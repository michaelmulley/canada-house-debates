</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned yesterday that the millennium fund was a waste of 
taxpayer money and that it was overspending by this government. I 
would like the hon. member to comment on the fact that he does 
not believe that helping 100,000 young Canadians gain access to 
post-secondary education, skills training, vocational schools is 
a valuable investment for this country in order to pursue their 
education and their careers into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, on page 10 of the Reform Party's alternative budget it 
advocates federal spending to drop to 10.5% of GDP.  In real 
terms that is another drop of $10 billion in spending cuts each 
year.  I suspect that it has to find those cuts.  It has yet to 
identify those cuts of $10 billion.  I would like the hon. member 
to make reference to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like the hon. member to stand in his place and 
reiterate what was said to the Calgary <I>Herald</I>, that this 
budget, a balanced budget, is very hard to criticize: “It does 
make it hard to criticize.  I am not going to argue a balanced 
budget is not good”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member for Medicine Hat can for once stand up 
and say a balanced budget is good, the government has made 
progress, and speak to Canadians in a very forthright way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to respond. Obviously the Reform Party believes a 
balanced budget is good. We have been arguing for that since we 
came to Ottawa in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to Ottawa in 1993 we were fighting a tremendous 
election battle in the months leading up to that point.  One of 
the quotes I remember best was a quote from the Prime Minister on 
the campaign trail.  He said “zero deficit, zero jobs, zero 
hope”.  What a difference the Reform Party has made.  We have 
convinced the Liberals across the way that a zero deficit is a 
good thing.  We moved the government and we channelled a lot of 
the opinion of the public toward moving toward a balanced budget. 
I am glad that my friend across the way and his colleagues have 
had a change of heart and have realized that a zero deficit no 
longer means zero jobs and zero hope.  It actually is a very good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that it was the taxpayers who really did 
balance the budget.  Sixty-six per cent of the improvement in the 
government's balance sheet came from increased revenues which 
came directly out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers.  The 
other big chunk of that, two-thirds of the remainder, came from 
cuts in transfers to the provinces for hospital beds and higher 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to my friend's point about the millennium fund. 
He suggested I said it was a waste of money.  That funding would 
have been better used by the provinces to restore transfers for 
things like higher education.  We pointed out that the millennium 
funds benefits 6% of students.  What about the other 94%?  Why 
not allow the provinces to lower tuitions so that all students 
can benefit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, my friend has pointed out that the Reform Party 
believes that we should reduce the overall size of government to 
10.5% of GDP.  I absolutely believe that.  We think the 
government is too fat.  I notice the government increased 
spending in this budget for the Department of Canadian Heritage; 
more money for TV production funds while it is closing hospital 
beds around the country.  That is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say trim spending in Canadian heritage.  Cut the waste in 
Indian affairs.  There is a tremendous amount of it.  Cut funding 
for regional development which is simply corporate welfare.  We 
know that the Chamber of Commerce comes before the finance 
committee every year and says please do not fund business 
anymore, it does not want subsidies for business anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also point out that we can make more savings in employment 
insurance.  There are tremendous savings to be made there.  We 
believe that we need to reform equalization.  We are not afraid 
to say that.  We think equalization formulas need to be changed. 
In a country as wealthy as Canada it is ridiculous that three 
provinces would support seven. That is where we would make some 
of those changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the Reform Party bash Indian and northern affairs now 
for a number of years.  I want to ask the member a question. 
Seventy per cent of all transfers from this government to native 
people go directly to native people and to their bands. We all 
know that is a fact, those of us who have first nations in our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says we should help the poorest of the poor, first 
nations people.  Can he tell me where the waste is that he seems 
to think he can trim?  If he goes to first nation communities he 
will see the worst housing in the country, he will see that in 
some cases there are no sewers or water, that they have the worst 
health and that there is more poverty there than anywhere else 
across the nation. If he is so convinced that there is a bunch of 
waste going on in Indian and northern affairs, we would like to 
know from this member and his party exactly where that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 51 first nations I represent, I do not see that waste. I 
do not see that there is some native chief or some band running 
around, going to Vegas or driving around in a Cadillac, as some 
of these people suggest. We all know that is not factually 
correct. I would like to know from this member just where that 
waste is because I do not see it in the 51 first nations I 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians are very 
concerned about the plight of natives in this country. That is 
why we want to reform the department of Indian affairs. Right now 
in Canada we spend over $6 billion a year to help natives.  But 
in fact a great chunk of that, as much as 50%, is chewed up in 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general routinely rips the department of Indian 
affairs because of the complete lack of accountability. A lot of 
that money does get to the band level only to not get to the 
grassroots natives simply because there is no accountability at 
the band level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend just alluded to this. I along with colleagues on both 
sides of the House probably recently saw an expose of what 
happens on some reserves where money gets to the band level but 
does not get to the people at the grassroots level. We saw an 
expose of one band in particular where in fact the chief was 
driving a Cadillac, going to Las Vegas, had a huge house, and 
that is not unusual. Unfortunately it was in Manitoba. 
Unfortunately my friends across the way are blind to this or they 
do not want to hear about it. They do not want to wade in and fix 
this problems. Reformers do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
maybe to straighten up these misguided Liberals over here on a 
couple of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals announced the other day that they were going to 
look after the debt, they were going to put a whole bunch of 
billions of dollars and shrink the amount of debt we have in this 
country.  It is only about $588 billion. I believe they were 
going to put around $3 billion if they had that left over from a 
contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Medicine Hat, as many 
Canadians would like to know, what is the impact, the reality of 
this philosophy that they have brilliantly come up with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Medicine Hat has 60 
seconds to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I can do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I point out that the government blew the 
contingency fund last year. In three successive budgets it said 
it would ensure the contingency fund is only used for 
emergencies, for no policy initiatives. In this year's budget it 
blew the entire $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the Liberals did devote the entire contingency fund in 
debt repayment, it would take them 200 years to pay down the 
debt. It is a ridiculous plan and they are being beat up by all 
the analysts who know their plan is not going to help pay down 
that debt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member 
opposite invited me, I will speak for British Columbia and for 
Canada. There is no dichotomy there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come to defining moments in our history as Canadians, and 
I think I can take note of two events of great interest. 
One is of course the role of the United Nations secretary general 
in the peaceful settlement of the gulf conflict.  We will note 
here that the primacy of the Canadian policy of settling 
international differences by negotiation, quiet diplomacy, has 
been reaffirmed. It should be noted the foreign minister was very 
active in New York at the United Nations in the week before 
leading up to that.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take notice and with pleasure, because it involves the 
co-operation of an hon. member opposite, that B.C. spoke out for 
Canada, got rid of some of the old shibboleths.  A British 
Columbia panel on national unity found that British Columbians 
have no hang-ups about understanding that Quebec does have civil 
law, that it does have a French language and culture and that a 
strong united Canada recognizes that fact.  It is an interesting 
and total across the board expression of opinion in British 
Columbia without any demand for quid pro quos or reasoning 
arguments in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the budget, it is a defining moment again in our history.  It 
is not simply that after so many years the budget is balanced, 
but that it has been achieved ahead of the schedule that we 
projected when we first took office in 1993.  From a $42 billion 
annual deficit, a disgrace, the budget we inherited, we are back 
to a balanced budget and that will be the reality of our times 
from now on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it has been achieved by using the theme which we 
campaigned on and I campaigned on in British Columbia in 1993, 
that the best way to balance a budget is to create new jobs, to 
create new meaningful employment.  That is where we get more tax 
revenue.  We tax the incomes.  That is the way to do it and this 
is the way we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to say that I am sharing time with the 
hon. member for Kitchener—Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say that the keynote in this budget is the emphasis on 
advanced education and research. That is a distinctive British 
Columbia contribution to this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fought the battle five years ago in support of TRIUMF, a pure 
research project. We had to face the inherited $42 billion annual 
deficit situation to make the case that pure science pays off. It 
is not simply some abstract ivory tower concept.  The scientific 
ideas of today properly tested and properly applied mean jobs in 
industry down the line. With the German and Japanese syndrome the 
key to their economic recovery was to invest in higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took the minister for science and industry, one of our most 
imaginative cabinet ministers, to B.C. and we said that is a very 
distinctive laboratory.  He said that it looked to him like a run 
down laboratory.  We said that that was where the Nobel prize 
winner worked when he first came to Canada.  He worked there and 
it is still in the same condition as it was 25 years ago. 
Something has to be done about scientific infrastructure.  We 
cannot engage in advanced research, we cannot engage in research 
that is oriented eventually to production technology and 
everything else, without building up the infrastructure. The 
point was well made and in a period when we were still staggering 
economically because of that inherited deficit, the money was 
allocated to TRIUMF, $167.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have basically been selling the idea that the next century is 
the knowledge century.  Our universities, our graduate 
institutions have been allowed to run down in a real way by 
benign neglect by provincial and other financing authorities. It 
is time to correct it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the response in terms of the grants for infrastructure, 
the Foundation for Innovation, to encourage medical research. By 
the way it should be known that British Columbia leads in areas 
of biomedicine and pharmacology.  We lead in North America in 
these areas.  We have already developed consortia style research 
arrangements with neighbouring American states. The networking of 
centres of excellence and the millennium scholarship foundation 
are other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had people speak to me about the millennium foundation when 
the idea was first in circulation.  They asked “Isn't that 
elitist?  Is it only for graduate institutions?”  We explained 
that first of all there is a constitutional issue.  We have no 
doubt that we can constitutionally put the money into advanced 
research. 
It is getting beyond that.  We need the co-operation of the 
provinces.  We are trying to get it, but they are not as active 
in education in all parts of the country as they should be.  Some 
provinces like to spend money which we think should go to 
education on highways or something else.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are basically stressing in this particular issue the need for 
federal leadership.  In the budget the finance minister used a 
very delightful phrase.  He did not simply speak of our great 
universities which now have international status and they really 
are leaders.  He also mentioned the community college in northern 
Alberta and the institute of technology somewhere in rural 
Ontario.  It is reaching down.  Frankly, our hope and our 
intention is, with the co-operation of the provinces, to get into 
the secondary education field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is our investment in making sure that the jobs created 
are meaningful jobs.  Look at the statistics.  People without 
advanced education, without college degrees, have very limited 
chances of finding employment.  The opportunity to grow is with 
the people who have diplomas.  That is why we are investing in 
this area. It is a dramatic, radical doctrine in that sense.  It 
reflects the inspiration of ministers like the science industry 
minister, his very bright secretary of state who is no longer 
with us because of electoral vagaries, the finance minister 
himself and the Prime Minister, who accepted the notion that it 
is the knowledge century and that is where this budget should 
make a breakthrough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned the lesson of the Germans and the Japanese.  If 
we want to recover, we have to invest in knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the assistance given to us by the 
university faculties, in my province the University of British 
Columbia, the science faculty and deans, and also the Association 
of Universities and Colleges of Canada, the association of 
university professors and the community colleges who are coming 
to us.  We want to reach out to the community colleges. They have 
helped to make this a very dramatic budget which will put us 
firmly into the position where we can lead in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took office, the reality was that we were lagging behind 
the countries with which we were competing in world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telling point concerning TRIUMF was that it was not simply 
pure research.  We have already seen a $200 million export 
contract spinoff from TRIUMF.  We are outbidding other countries 
in Indonesia and elsewhere.  We have brought $200 million of 
business to British Columbia.  That is where the link was made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the Liberal member's 
comments regarding higher education.  As many members of the 
House of Commons know, the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra has 
been involved in education for his entire career.  I am sure he 
understands as a former university professor the plight of 
post-secondary education students, in particular as it applies to 
their finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency there are many students who have $25,000 to 
$40,000 in student loans.  Some of them are unemployed after 
graduation and are unable to meet their obligations to repay 
those loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the hon. member could enlighten us and provide 
us with his views as to whether or not the millennium fund will 
be of any assistance to the people I have described in his 
constituency, in my constituency and right across the country. 
How will they be assisted in repaying their loans when they are 
unable to find work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an educator, how does he feel about whether the government 
should be assisting students who are in university now who are 
unable to obtain appropriate financing for their education?  I 
would like to know his views on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for a very thoughtful question.  I would take notice 
of the fact that he also has devoted a great deal of his life to 
higher education at the very low financial remuneration which we 
know that occupation offers in comparison to other professional 
fields. 
I congratulate him on what he has done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of student loans is a very vital one.  My first 
executive assistant had a $55,000 accumulated loan because he had 
taken three senior degrees.  This is a crippling debt and the 
obvious situation is that people with those sorts of debts will 
go down to the United States.  We will have a brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have addressed this in the previous budget and the pressures 
within the government will continue.  I do believe that this is a 
necessary and inevitable follow-up to what we have done in terms 
of grants for education in this budget. It is the signal that 
higher education, all education is a matter of national concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand the constitutional divisions of power.  We have 
made the necessary nexus in terms of higher education.  We can 
justify that constitutionally.  It becomes greyer as we get below 
but we want to work with the provinces. The key to federalism in 
the next decade, once we get rid of the constitutional battles of 
the last 30 years, is in partnership between the provinces and 
the federal government, and in education we are ready and 
willing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs, I 
just wonder whether he would care to comment in that in the 
budget document the government talks about spending for foreign 
affairs at $2.2 billion and for health at $.9 billion.  I wonder 
how it can justify those priorities to the Canadians standing in 
waiting lines at hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is always 
difficult as I have said before to the hon. member opposite to 
make invidious comparisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With what we spend on foreign affairs, we are already being 
criticized by the OECD and others for not spending enough. We try 
to get good value for our money in foreign affairs.  That is why 
we use quiet diplomacy.  We would not send off intercontinental 
ballistic missiles even if we had them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the health issue, it is certainly a high priority in my area. 
Within the government I am one who certainly is arguing for the 
increasing of expenditures in the medical field. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
hear from this government a commitment to education. Yet I 
remember in 1993 the Liberals attacked us for at least being 
willing to address these issues. They came in and cut $2 billion 
from post-secondary education in this country.  Does the member 
not feel it is just a band-aid to put a couple of hundred million 
dollars a year back in a scholarship fund from what the 
government has cut? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of the 
facts as the hon. member describes them.  I do not believe we 
have cut money from higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, if the member examines the policy on tax points, he 
will find that the position we made is that the provinces have 
exercised their option for the extra tax points and not to spend 
money on education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that is the wrong policy. I am sorry to say that 
British Columbia has not been one of the better provinces in 
showing a constructive attitude to education but we hope to 
change that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when I first came to this House in 1993, we were on the 
brink of losing Canada's economic sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the previous nine years, the Progressive Conservative 
government had grown the debt from $208 billion to $508 billion 
and left an all-time high annual deficit of $42 billion. More 
than 11% of Canadian workers were unemployed and the Tory Prime 
Minister of the day did not expect the rate to go below 10% in 
this millennium.  Unemployment insurance premiums stood at $3 per 
$100 of income and were scheduled to rise to $3.30.  Our nation 
was falling into self-doubt and we were the economic basket case 
of the western countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House of the bleak situation we inherited 
from the Conservative government so that never again will we go 
down the track of fiscal ruin as the Conservative Party did in 
the nine years it was in government after having campaigned with 
deficit reduction as a major plank in its platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote the Ottawa <I>Business Journal</I> editorial of February 
23, 1998:  “It is to the party's everlasting discredit that it 
held power during booming economic times yet boosted taxes to 
unprecedented levels and never ever made much of a dent in the 
deficit.  That is a dismal record”.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have recovered the fiscal integrity of our nation, we must 
thank all Canadians for their support in this effort.  We must 
also recognize and commend the leadership of the Minister of 
Finance and the Prime Minister.  Who would have believed that 
this day would come? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to complete this first stage of the recovery plan and 
balance the budget, we pursued a balanced program of reduction in 
spending, reducing transfer payments to the provinces and growing 
the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reducing spending the government was streamlined and the 
public service reduced by 20%.  Our program spending has declined 
every year since we took office both as a percentage of our GDP 
and relative to the average for G-7 countries.  We have taken it 
from 17.5% of the GDP in 1992-93 to 12.8% in 1996-97.  The G-7 
average is .09% in reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal transfers to the provinces were reduced but we cut 
federal spending even more.  In the case of my province of 
Ontario, the Canada health and social transfer was reduced by an 
amount equal to about 2.5% of Ontario's revenues or $1.2 billion 
less than they received the year we took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revenue problem in Ontario was caused by the decision of the 
Ontario government to give a tax cut with borrowed money which 
would reduced its revenues by $4.9 billion.  This amount was four 
times greater than the $1.2 billion we cut transfers by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slash and burn policies pursued by the Ontario government to 
deliver meaningful tax cuts for the rich have seriously impacted 
negatively on every community in Ontario.  This hurting of the 
most vulnerable in our society is contrasted by the balanced 
approach of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an unswerving supporter of Canada's health care system, I am 
delighted that the cuts of previous years are now being replaced. 
Under the budget my province gets $308 million more than last 
year.  There is an increase under the cash portion of transfers 
and tax points.  In all, the provincial governments will receive 
an additional $7 billion over six years because of the budget and 
the increases will continue in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We grew the economy.  In constant 1992 dollars our GDP based on 
expenditures grew from $716.1 billion in 1993 to $769.7 billion 
in 1996.  Last year's statistics are not in yet, but the rate of 
growth is expected to come in at 3.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is limited and I want to talk about the importance of 
education to growing our economy and creating jobs.  Statistics 
Canada produced figures on what most of us take as a given, that 
the more education one has the less likely one is to be 
unemployed.  There is unemployment also among university 
graduates but at a lower rate than among those with a secondary 
level of education or less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, for example, the general unemployment rate was 6.5% for 
people with post-secondary education, 8.5% for those with 
secondary, and 12.8% for those with less than secondary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Waterloo region is blessed with three excellent 
post-secondary institutions.  I am proud to have served those 
institutions:  the University of Waterloo as a two term student 
body president and member of the senate, and Wilfrid Laurier as a 
member of the board of governors.  I served as a chairperson for 
a community reference group on basic job readiness training at 
Conestoga College. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 250,000 Canadians have attended these institutions 
over the years.  If one multiplies that by the $50,000 a year of 
wealth generated by each of those individuals, we have a figure 
of $12.5 billion that the Waterloo region adds to Canada's 
economy each and every year by virtue of higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. James Downey, president of the University of Waterloo, 
describes the budget as a triumph for the minister and for the 
Government of Canada because it blends prudence with compassion 
and is a superb blueprint for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jeff Gardner, vice-president, education, at the University of 
Waterloo federation of students, also approves.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge step forward not only for Canadians going to school 
but for other Canadians coming back to school. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He understands that education is a lifelong process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. John Tibbits, president of Conestoga College, recognizes 
that in the budget the government has “provided vehicles to 
students and families to invest in education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of Wilfrid Laurier University, Dr. Rosehart, 
called yesterday to say that this new budget makes a positive 
impact with the extension of tax credits and child care expense 
deductions to part time students.  He is very pleased to see 
assistance offered to students with children, a group which has 
been overlooked in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals, and many like them, have had a role in 
preparing the budget.  During the prebudget consultations the 
finance minister met with groups representing students, faculty 
and staff of post-secondary institutions and with representatives 
of the scientific and medical research community, in addition to 
the other groups that usually take part.  I am very happy to have 
contributed to this process through the post-secondary education 
caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of the original members, along with the hon. member 
for Peterborough and Dr. John English, then member of parliament 
for Kitchener, who has now returned to teaching at the University 
of Waterloo.  Having worked with the post-secondary education 
community for a long time, I knew the post-secondary education 
caucus would help them in putting their message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the consultations before the last budget, the post-secondary 
education caucus helped to ensure that future post-secondary 
institutions and hundreds of thousands of students were given 
high priority.  As a result, the last budget was good news for 
post-secondary education and that is why this budget works.  The 
people had an influence in its preparation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from coast to coast are working hard to better 
themselves and improve their prospects.  In so doing, they are 
enhancing Canada's economic strength and furthering Canada's 
future prospects, enabling us as a nation to compete successfully 
in the new economy.  Research and development are crucial to our 
economic well-being as we compete in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more imperative now as we are undergoing an information 
technology revolution which has a greater impact on jobs than the 
industrial revolution.  Millions of jobs across the country were 
lost in the old economy and the millions of net new jobs created 
in the past four years are a tribute to our ability to embrace 
the new economy, much of it a new economy founded on research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new budget the industrial research assistance program 
will receive $34 million in increased funding to enable NRC to 
reach and provide technology support to small businesses, 
according to Dr. Art Carty, president of the NRC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Tom Brzustowski, president of the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council of Canada, hails the increased 
funding for the granting agencies as an extraordinarily important 
decision by the Government of Canada: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's young people will be very encouraged by the increased 
allocation for university research.  It will help many of them 
directly to pursue postgraduate studies in research and to 
develop their talents to the full. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add that this will also enable them to do these things in 
Canada and not elsewhere such as in the United States.  This will 
help stop the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the pioneers who founded our post-secondary 
institutions.  Let us be bold enough and forward looking enough 
to uphold their vision by continuing to invest in our future and 
our nation's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In wrapping up my speech, keeping our country competitive lies 
in affording an opportunity to our young people, and indeed all 
people in Canada, to participate in the new economy.  Spending 
money on education, research and development is a fundamental 
investment in the development of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this budget more than any other has struck this 
approach. I think in the future that Canadians will be the 
beneficiaries of it as we continue to be the best country in the 
world.

during his remarks the hon. member criticized the Ontario 
government for its brutal cuts.  How dare the member?  The 
hypocrisy is overwhelming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stood up in this place and voted to cut transfers to 
the province of Ontario from $7.6 billion in 1994 to $5.8 billion 
in 1996.  For his constituents there was a $1.8 billion cut in 
net cash transfers for health care and education in Ontario, a 
24% cut. And he has the gall to criticize Mike Harris for 
increasing health care spending by $100 million, for absorbing 
the $1.8 billion cut but still finding the resources to increase 
health care spending by $100 million, all the while increasing 
provincial revenues from income tax by $2 billion even after his 
tax cuts are taken into account. 
Mike Harris cut taxes, absorbed your transfer cuts and increased 
health care, Mr. Speaker.  How could the member possibly 
criticize Mike Harris for cutting when he voted to cut health 
care for his constituents?

address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we must be tolerant 
toward new members of the House.  I am sure he will learn many 
things over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mike Harris government in Ontario is a reform government. 
That is why the people in Ontario elected zilch Reform members to 
the federal House of Parliament.  I mentioned that in order to 
balance the budget we had to cut all areas of government 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Why did he increase health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  One of the things that member will 
learn is that when other people are speaking, he should allow 
them to speak.  That is democracy.  It is also something his 
party should be promoting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  We cut transfers to the province of Ontario by 
$1.2 billion.  The tax cut put in by Mike Harris cut his revenues 
by $4.9 billion.  It was on the backs of the most vulnerable 
people in Ontario.  This year, at the first opportunity, we in 
the federal government restored funding to the social transfers 
to the tune of over $300 million and it will grow over the years. 
Over the next six years it will grow to the tune of $7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see young Reformers stand in the House to say “do not spend 
money because it comes out of the pockets of taxpayers”.  I 
decided to look up some of the CVs of the members of the Reform 
Party.  The member for Calgary West attended the University of 
Calgary for all of four years to get his degree. During that time 
the money he contributed to his education through tuition was 
$11,600.  The actual cost of that education was $50,877.19. 
Almost $40,000 was contributed by the taxpayers of the country.

the development of our future generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will say right off that I will not be congratulating the Minister 
of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You do not congratulate someone on work others have done, or 
on efforts others have made.  It was the provinces that had to make 
the cuts in health care, education and income support.  It was the 
provinces and the unemployed that made all the efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government took office in 1993, 61% of the 
unemployed were entitled to unemployment insurance benefits.  Now, 
five years later, fewer than 40% of the unemployed enjoy benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development wonders why.  He 
says he will investigate.  He is perceptive that one.  Very 
perceptive indeed.  If he were at all self-critical, he would very 
quickly realize why the proportion has dropped so tragically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read the budget I thought it was the work of the 
Minister of Finance.  I was wrong, because it looks increasingly 
like the Prime Minister's budget.  He had his hand in it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Exactly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> —in an effort to make his mark in 
history.  He will, but not for the budget.  We will get to that a 
little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so definitely the Prime Minister's budget that, for the 
first time in years, he will be the one going to New York to talk 
to financiers about the budget rather than the Minister of Finance, 
who, however, reduced the deficit to zero this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in 28 years, we have a balanced budget, yet 
it is not the Minister of Finance who is being sent—this would 
perhaps take time away from his leadership race—but the Prime 
Minister.  He is the one going to New York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that it was the provinces and the unemployed who did 
the work.  Let us take a look at how the zero deficit was achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-two per cent of the cutbacks were carried out by the 
provinces, in health, I recall, in education and in income support 
for the most disadvantaged.  This means that for each dollar cut in 
Quebec, 75 cents was because of Ottawa, and the people of Quebec 
need to be reminded of this.  The cuts, the problems in the 
education, health and welfare systems are the fault of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals suffered 37% of the cuts, and only 12% were to 
federal spending.   The Minister of Canadian Heritage was able to 
continue draping herself in flags.  There were no cuts to the 
heritage minister's flag budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a surplus appeared.  We might have expected to see it go 
to the provinces, but no, 23% went to them, 26% went to individuals 
and 51% was spent by the federal government on new initiatives in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.  This is why we have this 
crushing $583 billion debt.  A good part of it is because of the 
genius of the Prime Minister when he was finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not all.  In addition to grabbing revenues, the 
Minister of Finance is not telling us everything.  He keeps quite 
a few things to himself, does the finance minister. 
We saw it in Bill C-28, which he sponsored. While it contains 
provisions on international shipping, he claims he did not know. 
That is worrisome in a finance minister.  If he did know, there may 
not be a conflict of interest, we shall see about that, but there 
is definitely, at the very least, an apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister hides things from us, not only his personal 
interests, but also his deficits.  Last year, the Bloc Quebecois 
said he had approximately $12 billion in leeway.  We did not have 
figures, but our prediction was about $12 billion.  We were told we 
did not know how to do the math, that it was ridiculous, that our 
figures did not hold up.  Last year, they realized there was a $15 
billion error and this year, $17 billion.  We were right on.  This 
minister maximized his deficits.  This year, he is minimizing his 
surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the only ones to say so.  I am thinking of 
financial expert Jean-Luc Landry of Bolton Tremblay, whose comment 
on the Minister of Finance's surpluses was “He hides them from us, 
that is very clear”.  Alain Dubuc, editorial writer at <I>La Presse</I>, 
which is not known for its sovereignist views—it is owned by Power 
Corporation—wrote that the minister was so prudent that he is 
becoming untruthful.  That is what Alain Dubuc said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But why all this whispering about?  It is clear.  If the 
minister showed us he had surpluses in hand, he would then be 
obliged, if he had that amount to spare, to meet the needs of the 
provinces, of the unemployed, of the taxpayers whose taxes have 
gone up because the tax tables have not been indexed since 1993, 
and even back in the days of the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the whole matter of this government's hypocrisy. 
It cuts assistance to the provinces and then comes along pretending 
to be their saviour, saying “Look here, we have injected $6 billion 
into the Canada social transfer”.  That is one way of looking at 
it. 
The reality is that instead of cutting $48 billion by the year 2003, 
they will cut $42 billion. And they call this investing $6 billion. The 
reality is $42 billion in cuts. For Quebec, this means $12 billion in 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politically, this has been explained. From time to time, ministers 
tell us what they are really up to. The President of the Treasury Board 
said that, when Bouchard would be forced to make cuts, they in Ottawa 
would be able to show that they can afford to preserve social programs 
for the future. That is clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister saw French people marching to protest cuts 
to social programs, he told Jacques Chirac in his colourful way of 
speaking: “You know, things are done differently in Canada. Decisions 
are made in Ottawa, and the province have to make cuts”. It was crystal 
clear. That is exactly what they are doing, and the premiers have 
noticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this week, Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, who is no 
sovereignist—he was there with the Prime Minister on the “night of the 
long knives” in 1982 at the Château Laurier, so he is not exactly a 
friend of Quebec— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Oh yes, the first blow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> —said: “The premiers unanimously agree—so 
many people dream of unanimous agreement in Canada, and they certainly 
have it in this case—that the federal government's top budget priority 
should be to increase funding for the Canada health and social 
transfer”. That is clear, but that is not what the Minister of Finance 
and the Prime Minister have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to their old ways—Liberals, like leopards, never change their 
spots—they implement new programs, especially in areas outside their 
jurisdiction, which do not meet the needs of Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, for instance, is increasing the deduction 
for child care from $5,000 to $7,000 just as Quebec is developing an 
early childhood policy to reduce child care costs. This means that the 
deduction will have little or no impact in Quebec. 
This shows how little they know Quebec. It is not surprising, 
considering the Prime Minister has not lived in Quebec for 35 years. He 
has lost contact with Quebec society and he thinks he can buy people by 
sending them cheques. Things no longer work like this in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund tells the real story. The Prime Minister 
clearly admitted it yesterday. When the Prime Minister loses control, he 
becomes very transparent, and yesterday he clearly told us what his true 
objective was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days ago, on February 17, the Prime Minister addressed the 
Canadian Club—a respectable institution to whose members he spoke 
respectably—and said, in reference to the fund, that “as incredible 
as it may seem, some will criticize it. Yet, we are only trying to 
prepare young Canadians to enter a new century and to take their place 
in the new economy”. This is political grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the Prime Minister's good intentions. A leopard cannot 
change its spots. The Prime Minister's contemptuous attitude quickly 
showed through again when he said very clearly yesterday that “students 
are entitled to know where the money they receive comes from. We think 
every Quebecker should know that the taxes they pay to the federal 
government give them something in return”. This is very clearly what we 
call contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister talks about sending cheques to students. It 
reminds me of the contempt he showed a few years ago toward the 
unemployed in the Gaspé Peninsula, when he said they were only 
interested in getting their unemployment insurance cheques. Talk about 
contempt. We are used to it. We know the Prime Minister. We know how 
contemptuous he can be when talking about Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His good intentions to help students have gone up in smoke. 
The Prime Minister forgot, or perhaps he did not know, that Quebec 
has, for over 30 years, had a program of loans and bursaries far 
more developed that any such program elsewhere in Canada.  The 
Liberal Party, the Parti Quebecois, university rectors, CEGEP 
principals, students and teachers all agree: they are not 
interested in the millennium scholarship fund, because there is a 
bursary program in Quebec.  A program that is to be found nowhere 
else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec students' debt load, while too high, is $11,000, while, 
for students outside Quebec, it is $25,000.  The situation is 
different.  We are truly distinct, and our program of loans and 
bursaries is especially so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An agreement was reached in 1964 with Jean Lesage, the 
federalist Quebec premier and the initiator, with René Lévesque, of 
the Quiet Revolution. 
He believed and Quebeckers believe that this program does not meet 
the needs of Quebec.  The spirit of the Lesage and Pearson 
agreement to enable Quebec to opt out with full compensation from 
the loans and bursaries program needs to be revived.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of this House fails to acknowledge this. What 
is more, they want to impose mobility.  In other words, students 
moving from one province to another will be given special treatment 
under one of the criteria.  I can understand the case of a student 
from Vancouver going to Toronto or to McGill in Quebec, where there 
is a network for anglophones in Quebec.  We look after our 
minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a francophone student wanting to study outside Quebec, 
well, there are no full-fledged French universities outside Quebec. 
There is a university in Ottawa, but it does not offer all the 
programs.  There are none anywhere else.  Mobility is theoretical, 
virtual.  The mobility criterion will do nothing for students in 
Quebec. 
It is a coast to coast to coast program for them, but not for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister made deliberate choices.  After taking away 
money from the provinces, he chose to take that money and get his 
name in the history books as the first Canadian head of government 
to have interfered in Quebec education.  What he wants is to get 
the flag onto the cheques.  That is what he wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not be surprising if he eventually introduced a bill 
to get his portrait on Canadian $20 bills in place of Queen 
Elizabeth II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B>  This is the Prime Minister who has twice 
led Quebec and Canada to a constitutional impasse.  He is in part 
responsible for the shocking deficits we face at this time, and the 
$583 million debt. 
He is now reverting to type, in order to get his name in the 
history books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec know him, and they know that by attacking 
Quebec—blinded as he is by his disdain for Quebec—he is leading 
Canada into a dead end.  That is his new version of federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial premiers clearly called for him to withdraw 
from areas that are not under federal jurisdiction, and to put 
transfer payment money back.  That is not what the federal 
government is doing.  It is launching into a series of new 
programs.  Everyone in Quebec says it makes no sense.  No problem, 
it is just that the Prime Minister wants people to know where the 
money is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as regards the student loans and scholarships program, out of 
$500 million invested annually in Quebec, only $74 million comes from 
the federal government, not 90% as the Prime Minister tried to tell the 
public yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what they call flexible federalism. I say it is the same 
old approach, the “Ottawa knows best” approach. This is the type of 
federalism that will prevail in the next millennium. As for us, we are 
more and more convinced that we need to have our own country by the year 
2000, to get out of the mess that the Prime Minister is creating once 
again, because setting up new programs will generate new deficits, 
unless the Prime Minister simply intends to once again force taxpayers 
to make huge efforts to promote his party's visibility and his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to some responsible proposals made by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which are included in the budget. Indeed, the government 
followed up on at least three of our suggestions. 
Last year, when the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe proposed the 
creation of an employment RRSP, we were told the idea was ridiculous. I 
can still hear the Prime Minister say “this is not what RRSPs are 
for”. 
This year, the government came up with an RRSP initiative to help people 
rejoin the labour force. It might as well be called an employment RRSP 
as it is the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at the employment insurance program: young people aged 
18 to 24 will get a break on premiums. This was also proposed by us last 
year. Congratulations to the government for following up on our 
suggestion. Then, there are the tax measures relating to the repayment 
of students' debts. We agree with these three measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, we asked that the money be given back to the provinces. We 
also asked that employment insurance benefits and eligibility be 
improved, because the unemployed have been hurt by the government's 
measures. 
Third, we said that there had to be targeted tax reductions such 
as, on the one hand, EI premiums, which are much too high, and on 
the other, indexed tax tables, because there has been a covert 
increase in taxes for too many years now, although they tell us 
taxes have not gone up.  I think a basic accounting course would 
show us that, without indexing, there is a real increase in taxes. 
Fourth, we told them to freeze programs and quit interfering in 
areas outside their jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there should be an anti-deficit law to bring the 
Liberals down to earth.  Those are our proposals, responsible 
proposals that reflect the needs of Quebec, of Quebeckers, of the 
provinces, of all Canadians, of taxpayers, of the middle class and 
of the most disadvantaged members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am telling Quebeckers it is time we left all this behind. 
It is time to get out of this nuthouse.  I am saying to Canadians 
that they should condemn this government for taking money needed by 
Canadians and using it to try and buy the young people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with a thought from Gilles Vigneault.  I remind 
the Prime Minister, with his millennium fund attempt to buy young 
people, with his lack of respect for Quebec, that Gilles Vigneault 
once said that people were wrong to think we did not notice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we too 
understand the idea that Ottawa knows best and its contempt for 
the provinces and the fact that the federal government 
continually overrides provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found his reference to the night of the long knives in 1982 
very interesting.  I too feel there were things left out of the 
Constitution which should have been in, or provisions which 
should have been made concerning provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if our friends in the Bloc could comment on what I 
think they have been leaders on, that is that they, to their good 
fortune and vision, opted out of the Canada pension plan and set 
up the Caisse de dépôt many years ago, realizing where the feds 
would go with this and how badly the federal Liberal regime would 
squander its resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if he might be able to comment on provincial 
jurisdiction there and whether other provinces should choose to 
opt out of the CPP. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I would say to 
my colleague that I do not wish to become involved in the 
reorganization of Canada.  I would say to him that they will have 
a much easier time of it after we are gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the sixties, we decided to take a number of steps, one of 
them involving the pension plan, on the assumption that one always 
runs one's own affairs best.  We did the same for loans and 
scholarships and the joint programs we pulled out of in 1964, 29 of 
them if I remember correctly.  Jean Lesage negotiated that 
withdrawal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout all this, Quebec developed a model very different 
from that of the rest of Canada.  I am not saying it is better, nor 
that it is not as good, but simply that it is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell my hon. colleague, who asked what the provinces should 
do, that in many areas the provinces could do much more, as Canada as a 
whole could, provided it is recognized that two realities exist north of 
the United States, namely the Quebec reality and the Canadian reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be two sovereign countries in a new partnership; this 
way, certain measures would not be imposed on the rest of Canada by this 
government because, for one thing, it would not be in office and we 
would be able to take care of our own business. I think that we would 
all have more respect for one another and the issues would be clearer, 
including with respect to the future of the Canada pension fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

comments made by the hon. member.  He went on and on about the 
hiding of deficits.  I am not quite sure what he said. However, I 
remind the hon. member that whether you are in Quebec, in British 
Columbia, in Ontario or down east, the other day the Minister of 
Finance stood to announce a balanced budget. That is great for 
this country.  It is great for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians participated in ensuring that we were able to 
achieve that objective.  I think the hon. member should 
congratulate Canadians and Quebeckers for their participation in 
ensuring that particular objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the millennium fund, the hon. member went on and 
on about jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that whether a student is in Quebec or British 
Columbia or any other part of Canada, students do not want to 
hear about jurisdiction.  They want to hear about assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday this budget provided assistance to students to allow 
them to continue their courses, to allow access to education and 
further training and skills so that we can continue to build this 
country, a very united country into the next millennium. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. colleague just walked in; he must have heard my remarks elsewhere. 
I started by congratulating Canadians and Quebeckers on the efforts they 
made and I did say that, if a zero deficit was achieved, it was thanks 
to the efforts made by the provinces, the unemployed, the taxpayers, and 
not by the people across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he recognizes this fact today, we agree on one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the millennium fund, he suggests that students are 
very pleased. I would submit to him that, if there is one thing students 
in Quebec do not want to hear about any more, it is that party and its 
leader, the current Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be interesting for the hon. member to read Quebec papers. 
Even the Montreal<I> Gazette</I>—this is probably the only Quebec paper he 
reads—said this morning that Minister Landry was right and the federal 
government had no business in education. That is what the Montreal<I> 
Gazette</I> said. This morning, Pierre Elliott Trudeau was reported as 
saying that, when the federal government stepping in the area of 
education through the grants and loans door, people should not obey the 
law. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the Prime Minister's hero, is inciting 
people to a tax revolt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to follow up on the remarks of my colleagues, the 
member for Vancouver Quadra and the member for 
Kitchener—Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, after many decades, we saw the elimination of 
the federal deficit.  At the same time that elimination was 
announced we also announced new investments in health care and 
higher education and a new look and a redesign of the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back on all the budgets since we were elected in 
1993, difficult budgets for Canadians, difficult budgets for 
members of Parliament like me, we will see in those times when we 
were downsizing and redesigning government, in each budget some 
seeds were planted to help in the areas of health care, higher 
education and research and help with respect to the basic support 
supplied by Canada for senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that the deficit is now behind us.  We can move 
on from that.  I am also delighted at the way in which the 
deficit has been eliminated.  We have been able to reinvest as we 
were redesigning and downsizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the time I have available I cannot speak about the health 
care side or the Canada pension side of the budget.  I would like 
to speak about the higher education part which has been the 
subject of discussion between members on this side and 
representatives of the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I was elected to the government caucus I worked with a 
group of MPs from all regions of the country in a government 
caucus on post-secondary education and research.  We have tried 
to listen to students from all over the country and their 
national representatives in Ottawa.  We also went out to the 
regions to speak to them.  We have met with presidents of 
universities and the AUCC, the association which represents the 
universities in the national capital.

from universities, from colleges, from institutes, from hospitals 
and researchers in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government caucus on post-secondary education, having 
listened over these years to the concerns of these groups, 
students, university and college groups, is truly delighted with 
the announcements in this budget and with the response of the 
government to these representations which have been made over the 
last three or four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on record the letter to the Minister of 
Finance from this caucus group on post-secondary and research, a 
letter that was the basis of our discussions with him some weeks 
ago when we took the concerns of all those people I have 
mentioned to the Minister of Finance.  We said to him that 
post-secondary education and research should be a priority for 
all Canadians in this budget.  This is the sense of the letter 
which we sent to the Minister of Finance prior to our formal 
discussion with him: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, the caucus on post-secondary education and research 
was formed during the last Parliament.  Our executive consists of 
MPs, from all regions, who have a keen interest in the role of 
the federal government in higher education and research. We 
greatly appreciate the support you have given us over the years. 
Without your enthusiastic involvement, the millennium 
scholarships, the RESP program, the foundation for innovation and 
the increase in student loans and the extension of the grace 
period for those loans, would not have come into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to meeting with you next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the meeting, we would like, with your permission, to 
develop two main themes. The first of these concerns is the 
importance of increased funding for basic research, particularly 
through the grants councils. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the SSHRC, the Medical Research Council, and NSERC, 
the science grants council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like us, you have undoubtedly received a great deal of input from 
the research community.  Their arguments, particularly with 
respect to levels of funding in other jurisdictions, are 
compelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that it is time to move on support of the operational 
side of research to complement our investment in the research 
infrastructure through the new Canadian foundation for 
innovation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one of the two main themes that our caucus on 
post-secondary education and research picked up from hundreds of 
representations that we have received from across the country, 
that basic research in the country, the actual performing of 
research in the hospitals, in the colleges, in the universities, 
now needed important support because the government in the 
previous budget had moved on the infrastructure side of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second theme concerns improving accessibility of students to 
college, CEGEP, university and other post-secondary training 
institutions.  We believe that this is something which goes 
beyond further reform and revitalization of student loans 
programs (important though they may be).  We would like to 
canvass topics such as student employment, further support for 
students' families and special provisions for disadvantaged 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hope that you will address these themes in your 
upcoming budget— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the letter which was the basis of a discussion some 
weeks ago with the Minister of Finance. I want to thank the 
minister on behalf of the students, the professors and the 
researchers of our colleges, CEGEPs, universities, hospitals and 
institutes across the country for his response to these well 
supported requests from the higher education community.

important as what you do.  This is true in everyday life for each 
of us as we go about our business and our social affairs, but it 
is particularly important for governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is very, very important that the deficit has been 
eliminated.  For me, the way it has been done is equally 
important. We have tried over the last three or four years to 
eliminate the deficit in as humane a way as was possible.  That 
is very important. From the beginning we had a plan which, while 
downsizing was going on, involved reinvestment in various areas 
such as higher education as I have been discussing, but also with 
early childhood education, prenatal and postnatal programs and things 
of that type. In that sense it has been done well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was done well in the sense that when we cut the federal 
system, we cut it strategically, targeting some areas for large 
cuts and some for small cuts. It was also done well in the sense 
that we timed the cuts, for example we gave the provinces notice 
and time to adjust to the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted with this budget and with the results that we 
have achieved.  I am equally delighted with the way in which we 
have arrived at this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question.  As a matter of fact, it was a bug 
put in my ear by a fellow colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think back to just after the election in 1993 and even 
during the election, we heard Liberals across this country say 
that the budget could not be balanced, that it could never be 
balanced in three years or in a short period of time because the 
economic growth rate would go through the floor.  They were like 
Chicken Little running around the country then I remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals were saying that if Canada tried to balance its budget, 
the growth rates would be non-existent.  We would shrink. We 
would go back to having children with tar on their noses, 
something like the industrial revolution. The economy would grind 
to a halt because Canada could not handle a balanced budget and 
the cuts in government spending that would necessitate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering how three years later the Liberals can sit here 
bleating, preening and patting themselves on the back for 
balancing the budget and not recognize that indeed they have gone 
against everything they were saying three years ago.  They have 
accomplished what they said three years ago was impossible.  Then 
only the Reform Party was saying that the budget could be 
balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the member 
opposite is listening so closely to what we have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to office in 1993, people seem to forget that we 
had a detailed elaborate plan for dealing with the fiscal 
problems faced by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we stressed fiscal responsibility with the 
federal government is that in terms of interest rates, in terms 
of the strength of the dollar, it is the performance of the 
federal government that counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, there are two provinces which are still 
struggling with their deficit problems,  yet our interest rates 
are lower than they have ever been, the growth in GDP is higher 
than it has been for many, many decades and so on. That is 
because it is seen by the international investment community that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my colleague a question. He says he does not want to 
deal with the problem of health. He wants to speak of education. 
He is interested in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is his reluctance to speak of the problem of health in Canada 
related to the fact that, before the budget, Canadians had clearly 
called for money to be put into that program?  In New Brunswick 
this week the nurses association said that nurses were suffering 
from burnout. There is no money available in the health system for 
the administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, New Brunswick Minister of Health, Dr. Russell King, 
attacked the Liberal budget. The Newfoundland minister attacked the 
Liberal budget. 
You have missed the boat.  In my opinion, you did not listen to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do you not want to talk about it?  Are you ashamed?  Is 
that the problem? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the largest single 
financial item in the budget was the $1.5 billion in restored 
funding in transfers to the provinces.  That funding of course is 
for health and social services, but it is our assumption that a 
great deal of that will be put into health by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other matters of health, I mentioned the support for the 
grants councils.  Funding for the Medical Research Council, which 
is going to be the major beneficiary of the Foundation for 
Innovation which will provide research infrastructure in 
hospitals and labs, was increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would mention the caregiver tax benefit that was included. It 
ties in with the money we have invested in home care and national 
prescription drug programs in the last budget.  I did mention in 
my remarks prenatal and postnatal care which we introduced in 
1993 and which is still running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Burlington.  I must advise the hon. member that 
we are going to have to interrupt her at 10 o'clock for routine 
proceedings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to be part of this debate on the 1998 federal budget and 
to share my perspective on how this budget will benefit Canadians 
today and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud to be part of this debate as the 
vice-chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. 
This year we completed the most extensive public consultation 
ever.  My colleagues did an excellent job and made the many hours 
of deliberation pass quickly.  Their support to me personally, 
especially on the road as we met Canadians in Regina, Winnipeg, 
Montreal, Fredericton and Charlottetown made chairing easy. To 
those Canadians who shared their ideas, their hopes and dreams 
and the benefit of their experience along the way and here in 
Ottawa, thank you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During Burlington's prebudget meeting, the variety of opinions 
and suggestions was truly impressive, every idea born of 
experience and every suggestion a good one in its own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balancing all of these special interests is not an easy task. In 
fact it is such a difficult task that some opposition members 
preferred not to consider special interests in their policy 
making.  Our success is built on our commitment to ensuring that 
our policy decisions reflect the core values Canadians hold from 
coast to coast coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget reflects the hopes and dreams of Canadians of 
all ages.  The Minister of Finance presented Canadians with a 
balanced budget, a focused plan which prepares and propels us 
into the 21st century.  It is a Liberal balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget signifies a turning point for all Canadians.  Over 
the past four years our budgets have been about how to reduce our 
deficit and get our country back on track without kicking the 
legs out from the economy.  They have been about making strategic 
small steps in areas we knew were desperate for help knowing that 
the dismal set of books left to us by previous governments 
limited our choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge then was about how to deliver very necessary 
services to Canadians under very restrictive circumstances.  This 
budget is about pursuing those goals as individuals and as a 
nation.  It builds on those baby steps and starts us walking 
freely and upright, proud of our accomplishments as a nation in 
working hard and getting our financial circumstances back in 
order.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is about helping Canadians open doors. The Canadian 
opportunities strategy is a carefully considered well crafted 
initiative. It gives Canadians in every region something to look 
forward to, to count on, to believe in and to invest in. It 
builds on our commitment to getting Canadians back to work, to 
being financial responsible and to preparing our children for 
healthy productive lives. While time will not permit me to expand 
on all seven steps in the strategy, I will highlight a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian millennium scholarship foundation says to bright 
young Canadians they do have a chance for post-secondary 
education in spite of their families' limited circumstances if 
they work hard and produce results in high school. It ensures our 
next generation has a fighting chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy includes grants of up to $3,000 to students with 
children allowing parents to take advantage of post-secondary 
education they only dreamed of in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy allows those who wish to increase their 
employability to do so by allowing them to withdraw tax free from 
their RRSP to enrol in full time education and training. This is 
particularly helpful to those on whom the economy has forced a 
second career at age 45 or 50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In partnership with families the Canadian education savings 
grant provides added reasons to put a few dollars away for a 
child, a niece or a grandson, for their future post-secondary 
education. It builds on our previous initiative to remove some of 
the risk of that investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are concrete examples of how much this government believes 
in its greatest resource, the Canadian public. Equal to this 
accomplishment and a critical commitment to Canadians was our 
increase of some $400 million over the next four years to the 
granting councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made a commitment to Canadian researchers, university 
professors and post-secondary students.  This measure reflects 
the government's commitment to ensuring Canada remains 
competitive in the next millennium. It says to our brightest and 
our best: Stay here in Canada. Make your discoveries here. Invent 
your inventions. As partners we recognize your work enhances our 
economy and international competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the important issue of taxation. While it 
should be every government's dream to reduce taxation to its 
citizens, governments must not do so irresponsibly. That is why 
Canadians did not ask for broad tax cuts. It is why they told us 
in city after city to reinvest in their society, provide some 
relief for the sacrifices they have made over the past few years 
and pay down the debt. Canadians are not foolhardy, even if some 
of their elected officials in opposition pretend that they would 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does cut taxes in a strategic way. It supports 
families by increasing the child care expense deduction to more 
accurately reflect the true cost of child care allowing young 
families more flexibility in their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget removes the 3% surtax for those who need the biggest 
breaks. It is responsible and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is consistent with our last budget and the one 
before that. It delivers on our strategy. It reflects the core 
values Canadians have. It reflects their priorities because it 
was created in consultation with them. It is a budget that makes 
strategic investments in Canadians. It delivers on the hopes of 
Canadians and their commitment to work hard to accomplish their 
dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We will interrupt the 
presentation of the member for Burlington, who has five minutes 
for questions and comments, and we will proceed now to the daily 
routine of business.

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggest 
that all questions be allowed to stand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; of 
the amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members will 
recall that when we interrupted the debate for Routine 
Proceedings the hon. member for Burlington was on her feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Burlington has two minutes remaining for 
debate and five minutes for questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the hon. member's remarks she said there was not public 
support for broad based tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at a poll conducted by the Angus Reid group in the 
past month.  In response to the question “What do you think 
should be the federal government's main priority in deciding what 
to do with any future surplus money?”, 45% responded that it 
should be used to reduce the accumulated debt, 29% said that it 
should be used to cut taxes, and merely 23% said that it should 
be spent on government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as the budget places much greater emphasis on new 
spending programs than on either debt reduction, with zero 
commitment to that in the budget, or tax relief with only a 
modest commitment, how does the member square that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she speaks of tax relief, how does she justify the 
continued tax increase of bracket creep which KPMG estimates will 
cost taxpayers over $1,000 in the upcoming fiscal year, on 
average, far outstripping any tax relief to be delivered to 
modest income Canadians in the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my speech I was 
reflecting what we heard in the presentations that were made to 
us as we travelled across the country and as we sat here in 
Ottawa.  In fact there was not broad support for across the board 
tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in terms of our commitments and the delivery we have 
made in the budget, the hon. member should present the facts as 
they are.  Sixty per cent of what we have done in the budget will 
reduce taxes and the debt.  That is more than our commitment to 
the public on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of bracket creep is one we have to address seriously. 
I hope we can do it in the next budget.  It is something that has 
concerned me for quite a while.  It is something I hope we will 
be able to do as we get the economy in better shape.  I hope the 
member for Calgary Southeast will support us in that initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member what she 
thinks of the fact that her government decided in the budget to put 
all its eggs in one basket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000, there will be a surplus of $25 billion in 
the employment insurance fund.  Is it reasonable for the government 
to use this fund as one of its primary sources of income to the 
detriment of the objectives of the employment insurance plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not risky? If we have an economic recession, fewer people 
will have a job, which means less money will go into the fund. Do you 
not think that the government and the Minister of Finance could put us 
in the same situation as the one we experienced before 1993, when the 
provinces and the unemployed were forced to make a major contribution to 
the fight against the deficit, which led us to the current situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why create a $25 billion surplus in a fund, when those who are 
supposed to benefit from the program do not enjoy acceptable benefits? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has 
highlighted a very responsible move on behalf of this government. 
We have moved to reduce EI premiums in each of the years that we 
have been office rather than what the previous government did. In 
a time of great difficulty and a time of downturn in the economy, 
it increased the premiums and further exasperated the 
difficulties for finding employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also opens up another opportunity.  We built a nest egg and 
that is important for what is a cyclical turn in the economy.  We 
have also reduced premiums for all workers and that is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in this budget we provide an EI holiday to all those who 
hire young Canadians between 18 and 24.  That perhaps is one of 
the most interesting and creative ways to deliver job 
opportunities to young people from coast to coast.  It is as 
important to the kids in Montreal and in the member's riding as 
it is to the kids in Burlington and the kids in Kamloops.  It 
gives them an opportunity.  It says to employers if they fulfill 
their side of the bargain in creating this opportunity and we 
will fulfill something for them, we will give them a bit of a 
break.  That is a very important initiative.  I am glad the 
member is supportive of those reduced premiums for our young 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really 
happy to have a chance to participate in the debate today.  If I 
can summarize my view and our view of the budget, from the New 
Democratic Party perspective, the government has decided for one 
reason or another to turn its back on large numbers of Canadians, 
to betray a number of promises that were made to large numbers of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has decided to ignore the plight of those Canadians who have 
successfully, not necessarily on their own volition, fought the 
deficit war.  I thought it was somewhat inappropriate for the 
Minister of Finance to suggest that he or the Liberal cabinet or 
the Liberal caucus or the Liberal Party has somehow been able to 
balance the books to achieve a surplus budget.  If he did that 
either directly or indirectly, he certainly assumed the 
responsibility for having achieved that.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have a balanced budget today is that a whole 
number of Canadians have been asked to sacrifice a great deal 
over the last number of months and years.  There are people who 
have not been able to get the surgery they require, who have had 
to sit in an emergency ward for hours and hours waiting for a 
doctor. There are hundreds of thousands of children who have been 
required and forced to live in a state of poverty in this 
country.  There are hundreds of thousands of young people who do 
not have a job at all, to say nothing of the hundreds of 
thousands who have two or three part time jobs so they can try to 
patch together a decent income to attempt to start a family or 
buy their first home or apartment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about 1.5 million people who do not even have a 
job, who are out there looking day after day for decent 
employment and cannot find employment. We are talking about 
another million people at least who are working at minimum wage, 
part time jobs, 20 hours a week in this shop and 5 hours a week 
over here in the evenings and so on, trying to piece together a 
decent income.  All these people were ignored in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance often talks about values, how really 
politics is about values and we are asked to make decisions about 
who we support in this country.  The government has to make tough 
decisions now.  Now it has a surplus budget so it has to decide 
who to assist with the surplus, who to help out, who to show 
support for, who to nurture and encourage along.  Is it the poor? 
No. Is it the unemployed?  No.  Is it poor children?  No.  Is it 
aboriginal families?  No.  Is it students?  No.  Is it education? 
No.  Is it health care?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from coast to coast to coast have told us as 
parliamentarians, have registered in polls, have written letters, 
have presented briefs. When the finance committee toured the 
country at every stop we heard the same thing. The health care 
system of this country is in crisis.  The doctors told us it is 
in crisis. The nurses told us it is in crisis.  The patients told 
us it is in crisis.  The administrators told us it is in crisis. 
From coast to coast Canadians are in agreement that if there is a 
problem that needs to be fixed in this country, it is our health 
care system and this budget completely ignored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be some oddity.  I could not believe my ears.  I 
know my friend from Calgary will feel the same way this morning. 
We woke up, turned on the radio and we heard the Prime Minister. 
What was he saying?  There is no need for more money for health 
care.  Our health care system is fine.  I do not know where he 
gets his health care.  He must fly down to some elitist hospital 
somewhere in the United States to get his treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all been there.  We have all talked to our constituents 
who have told us their experiences in hospitals. They went down 
to the emergency ward and had to wait hours and hours because 
there are too few doctors to serve the lines in the emergency 
wards.  Then people tell of their experience when they are in 
hospital.  There is no criticism against the physicians, no 
criticism against the nurses, no criticism against the 
caregivers.  There are just not enough of them to go around. The 
infrastructure is not there.  The technology is not there. The 
research facilities are not there.  The personnel are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this Prime Minister has the gall to say this morning that 
the health care system in this country is okay and it requires no 
more support, no more funding.  Yet the Minister of Health just 
hours ago said we will be bringing in a health care budget soon 
because there are problems.  As a matter of fact, the Minister of 
Finance said not too long ago the hardest thing he had to do was 
cut health care.  He at least was honest about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance at least said that there is a serious 
problem in health care.  He made choices. I think they were the 
wrong ones. He chose not to support health care.  At least he 
admitted that there was a problem, there was a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says there is no problem.  Yet the Minister 
of Health just yesterday said we will have to deal with this as 
soon as we can.  Talk about speaking out of both sides of your 
mouth, but every conceivable orifice in your body has a different 
sound coming out of it. There is something drastically wrong 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What value does this reflect?  Canadians are calling out for one 
of the centre pieces of our Canadian society that distinguishes 
us from most countries of the world, a first class health care 
system, and now it is eroding on all edges. Do government members 
acknowledge that fact?  No. Are they prepared to put their money 
where some of their mouths are?  No.  Are they prepared to assist 
the provinces in terms of providing decent health care?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is immoral for the members of the Liberal Party to sit in 
their seats today and say they do not care if there are line-ups 
in our hospitals, if people do not have decent health care, that 
they do not care about the line-ups in emergency wards, about the 
hospitals that are forced to close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says disgraceful.  It is a 
disgrace.  They should be walking out of their seats. They should 
not be sitting there.  How can they sit there with such hypocrisy 
and say they care about Canadians when the proof of the budget 
demonstrates they do not? 
That is just health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing the finance committee heard travelling 
across the country it was that we had a job problem that was of 
paramount significance in our country.  As a matter of fact, just 
days ago the Minister of Finance was in Europe meeting with the 
G-7 countries.  He said he was going to go home and deal with the 
unemployment problem, work to reduce the economic inequalities 
and put these in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened carefully to the minister and I do not think he 
mentioned the word job.  I do not think he mentioned the word 
unemployment.  He certainly did nothing that is going to change 
the unemployment problem in this country.  We told him that he 
should at least do one thing, something he did for the currency, 
for interest rates and even in the budget for inflation: set a 
target.  He told us that at least as a society we want to achieve 
that goal and that target.  Is there a target for employment?  Is 
there a target to reduce the number of unemployed within the 
mandate or within the year?  No.  The government does not set 
targets for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government basically tells us is that it is quite happy 
the way things are.  It it were not it would do something about 
it.  Other countries do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways to measure a country's value is to ask how that 
society, that country and that government treat its children. In 
this country when we all got up this morning, there were about 
1.5 million children living in poverty.  In one of the richest 
country in the world, 1.5 million kids woke up this morning in 
poverty because their parents are living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the government decides this is something it has to 
accept, poverty is just a reality.  We need to have a million 
children in one of the richest countries of the world living in 
poverty.  However, that is not the case.  There are many 
countries in this world where there are no poor children.  We 
cannot find a poor child in Norway, in Denmark or in many 
countries because their governments have instituted programs to 
ensure that poverty does not exist in their countries.  It is a 
reflection of our value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only conclude that the Liberals sitting across the way, 
epitomized by the Minister of Finance, do not care about the poor 
children in Canada, could not care less about the poor families 
in this country and could not care less about the unemployed 
because if they did they would do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will try to be fair and balanced.  The Minister of 
Finance said that if a child is poor in Canada, the government is 
not going to do anything in this budget and, as a matter of fact, 
it is not going to do anything in next year's budget. But if the 
child waits until July 1999, it has a program that will enable 
the child to receive about an extra 75 cents a day.  Image what a 
poor family thought of that news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government not care about children?  I do not 
suppose the Liberals are mean.  I do not suppose the Minister of 
Finance is an evil, mean person.  However, children do not have 
paid lobbyists in Ottawa.  They do not make contributions to 
political parties.  They do not work in campaigns.  They are not 
at the Liberal conventions hammering away for attention.  They 
are not schmoozing in the cocktail lounges of the government 
parties and so on to bring their case before the Liberal caucus 
and the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are voiceless and they are ignored by the government. 
It does reflect our value and tells us what importance the 
government places on certain Canadians.  Children have been 
abandoned, particularly poor children.  Their parents have been 
abandoned.  The people who do not have employment have been 
abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who else has been abandoned?  The Minister of Finance waxed 
quite eloquently about his concern about education.  Yes, we are 
going to enter a knowledge based economy and society in the 21st 
century, so he said he wanted to take some steps that would help 
students.  There were steps that will help some students. The 
centre piece is the millennium scholarship fund, a $3,000 
scholarship to 100,000 Canadians when it all gets into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, that is going to kick in in a few years from 
now. If someone is a student today they can forget that, but 
sometime in the future there will be this millennium scholarship 
fund for $3,000, recognizing that it costs about $10,000 to go to 
school at the post-secondary level, and 100,000 people will get 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 1.4 million people are in post-secondary education which 
means if everybody qualifies, about 7% of young people will 
qualify for the millennium fund.  Seven per cent.  Ninety-three 
per cent will not qualify by definition.  It is just not enough. 
Seven per cent could qualify.  Are they the young people who 
really need it?  Is this a fund that will support young people or 
others who really need financial support?  Not necessarily.  It 
is based on marks and so on.  It is not necessarily based on 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we have to be bold. If the Minister of Finance 
actually cares about the young people seeking post-secondary 
education, why does he not join with the other 16 OECD countries 
of which he is so fondly attached and do what they do. Have 
tuition free colleges, universities, technical schools and 
vocational schools across the country.  That is what they do. 
They are tuition free, no tuition fees.  And it is about time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  A few years ago we as a society decided that 
grade 12 was the minimum education necessary to become a 
productive citizen.  We said that anybody would now have access 
to that level of education, grade 12.  That was in the 1930s. 
Surely to goodness we can all agree that grade 12 is now 
inadequate.  We need grade 13, grade 14, grade 15, grade 16.  Let 
us be bold and say to young people and others that for the first 
16 years of their education, we will at least eliminate tuition 
fees to remove that barrier to becoming a contributing citizen in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems simple.  I noticed with some encouragement today that 
the premier of British Columbia said it is about time we started 
to move in this direction.  British Columbia is going to move to 
eliminate tuition fees in the first year of university and 
college. That is a progressive move.  Twenty-seven other 
countries around the world do this.  It is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a new idea.  It has been practised for decades and 
decades in many countries, countries that put a value on their 
young people. They are countries that put a value on their most 
important resource, their human resources.  They do not want 
barriers impeding their people from becoming productive citizens 
through education and training, but apparently we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about poor children.  We can no longer 
abandon the 1.5 million children living in poverty.  I remember 
the Minister of Finance standing up not long ago saying that when 
growth in our country hit 3% for a three year period, the 
Liberals would introduce a comprehensive child care program. 
Remember that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have accomplished that.  We are there now.  Was child care 
mentioned in the budget?  Not even a word.  Was home care 
mentioned?  That was the main plank in the Liberal platform. The 
Liberals were saying that they would introduce a comprehensive 
home care program to complement our health care program across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was home care mentioned?  I do not remember home care being 
mentioned at all.  Home care has been jettisoned. Not only that, 
there was no funding in terms of returning funds to the transfer 
payments for health care.  We could understand perhaps that that 
would take place if the government had announced a major home 
care program to complement the hospital work, but it was not even 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would understand that there might not be any transfer 
payments to health care if there was a pharmacare program 
introduced.  Was pharmacare introduced?  That was promised.  I do 
not think that was mentioned either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No pharmacare, no home care, no child care, no elder care, no 
care.  This government does not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the other highlight, what the government is trying to 
put a positive spin on, is that it will give everybody a tax 
break. Anyone who believes that would believe there are pink 
elephants floating around this Chamber.  People would rather have 
a job than a tax break.  And yes, they want decent access to 
education.  They want a decent health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just talk about the tax break aspect.  I give the 
previous Liberal speaker credit because I have a great deal of 
admiration for the work she does.  But I guess what she was 
really saying is that the government should have addressed the 
whole area of bracket creep.  I know bracket creep sounds like an 
odd term, but I think people who know taxes know what it means. 
It means the basic personal exemption has not been increasing 
because of the increase in inflation over the years. 
Consequently the government is collecting billions and billions 
of more money than it should be. Taxpayers should have that in 
their pockets to spend. But the government did not move on 
bracket creep.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us face it, we have changed the CPP system. The 
premiums are significantly increased. When we look at what people 
are paying out and the minor tax break, the reality is that 
Canadians are going to be paying a whole lot more than they did 
as a result of this budget. That is the reality, a whole lot more 
taxes of one kind or another. From CPP premiums alone it is $874 
million this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a budget of hypocrisy actually. This is a budget of 
smoke and mirrors. During armed forces exercises they lob over a 
smoke bomb and it blurs the reality. That is what this budget is, 
a smoke bomb just chucked out all over Canada. Even some of the 
journalists for whom I have a great deal of respect said that 
there were some good things in the budget. We have to look long 
and hard to find some good things in the budget that will have 
any significant impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 400,000 young people out of work today. Talk about 
immorality. This ought to be enough to call an emergency debate 
in the House of Commons to find ways and means to find jobs for 
these 400,000 young people. What does the government do? It says 
“We are going to act”.  Its concept of acting is pretty weird. 
The Liberals said “We are going to introduce a program that is 
going to create 5,000 jobs over the next two years”. For 400,000 
people.  That does not even register mathematically. That is it 
in the budget. The government is going to make some changes to EI 
which officials say might create an extra 6,000 jobs. Four 
hundred thousand young people in this country are desperately 
looking for decent employment and the government brings in a 
program that may create 11,000 jobs over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is pathetic. This is wrong. This is cruel.  Yet my Liberal 
friends sit there on their benches— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Friends? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B> They are friends. They are friendly 
people. Let us face it, the Liberal members have nothing to do 
with this budget.  It is the Minister of Finance. Liberal members 
should be getting up from their seats and running out in humility 
saying “We are ashamed of what we have seen in the last couple 
of days in this House. We are ashamed of being associated with a 
budget that is so cruel to so many people, that has abandoned so 
many Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by simply saying the following.  Some are 
walking out. That is appropriate.  I give them credit for doing 
the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we have a small surplus budget, this is the time 
when the values of political parties reveal themselves. When 
cutting is the modus operandi for everybody, cut, cut, cut, fair 
enough. But now it is different. Now we see the value systems 
begin to emerge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, when you abandon poor children, when you abandon 
the unemployed, when you abandon people who are sick, when you 
abandon so many Canadians when you do not have to, it reveals a 
great deal about what your priorities are and what your values 
are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora—Rainy River, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the reality which I think the member opposite should 
keep in mind is that his party has not gotten past the 1960s. It 
is so obvious that the New Democrats have no new policies as they 
relate to the new generation. They go back to the same old 
rhetoric I have heard for the last almost 10 years in this House, 
and we can tell why that party has now become irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of NDP leaders and governments in this 
country.  Let us look at just two of them.  We always like to 
remind the member and his federal party that those are the ones 
that have gotten past the NDP rhetoric of the 1960s.  They have 
gotten back to the real basics of how a new global economy will 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is Premier Romanow. He is one of the premiers who 
slashed and hacked and closed all those hospitals the member is 
so disgusted about.  His government felt very strongly that it 
needed to make some changes because hospitals had become a 
political tool. There was a hospital and a clinic in every small 
town in Saskatchewan which was not necessary to meet the needs of 
the population.  Obviously the government did some work to clean 
that up. 
Not too long ago Premier Romanow gave a little tax cut to the 
population of Saskatchewan. He felt it was a high tax area and it 
was affecting the economy of that province.  Those are the two 
issues these people seem to be opposed to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider Premier Clark who is closer to the member's 
home.  Not too long ago Premier Clark did a complete 360 on NDP 
policy.  He virtually said that his economy was falling apart 
because the assumptions the NDP had been making for years and 
years were not working.  Taxes were too high, they were driving 
investment out of the province and the unemployment rate was up 
over the roof.  The resource industry, which I am very familiar 
with being from Kenora—Rainy River, is right down in the tanks 
in British Columbia.  The reason is the lack of policy of the New 
Democrats in British Columbia and they are now starting to 
realize where they are at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member one other question because I know the 
NDP policies are so far from reality that we cannot expect too 
much from them.  In Kenora—Rainy River we call the NDP the no 
down payment party because New Democrats do not understand that 
if you do not pay your way, somewhere down the line someone is 
going to have to pay for it.  That is why they cannot seem to get 
anywhere in this country.  They think you do not have to pay it 
back.  You just throw it out there and somehow it just gets paid 
and everything is rosy at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that this budget did nothing for the unemployed. 
He has been here a long time and he knows there are certain 
assumptions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, he is taking all the 
time. He is not giving me the chance to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am getting to the 
question. If members will just quiet down, I will get to the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget we have put a significant amount of emphasis on 
young people and their future in education.  We all know in the 
new economy that for young people who have a university or 
college degree, unemployment drops to a low of 7%.  Those at high 
risk have high school education or less and they bump right up to 
15% or 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call this an education budget. All these improvements we have 
made in the education field are good news for Canadians in the 
long run and good news for Canadians in the short run.  We also 
gave people the ability to do things with education part time. 
Does the member not think we deserve credit for our vision of 
where we must go for young people so they can get jobs, because 
that is where they lie only if they have the education level and 
the abilities to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend 
getting up to ask that kind of question and providing me with an 
opportunity to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the last part of his question.  There are two 
sides to education.  One is the student side and the other is the 
educational infrastructure side.  We can help students access 
post-secondary education but there must be post-secondary 
education for them to access.  Therein is where this budget is 
sorely lacking.  There are no transfer payments to assist in the 
development of colleges and universities, technical schools or 
vocational schools.  That is one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend raised the example of Saskatchewan.  I will inform my 
friend of two or three elements he forgot to mention.  After nine 
years of Progressive Conservative government in the province of 
Saskatchewan, the province was financially devastated. The debt 
loads were high.  And which province was the first province in 
Canada to balance its budget?  Was it a Liberal province?  No. 
Was it a Tory province?  No.  Was it a Reform province?  That 
does not exist.  It was a New Democrat province. The New 
Democratic Party was the first political party in this country to 
balance its budget in recent decades.  That is the first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a health care problem.  The federal government cut 
hundreds of millions from health care year after year.  Did the 
spending on health care in Saskatchewan decline?  No.  Because 
the provincial government backfilled all of the cuts to make up 
for all of the cuts by the federal government.  The health care 
budget in Saskatchewan has been able to remain constant.  No 
other province was able to accomplish that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about taxes?  The provincial government decided that since 
it had a balanced budget it would be appropriate to reduce the 
provincial sales tax rate by 2%. 
It asked what it could do to help every Saskatchewan citizen 
whether they are in Lloydminster, Saskatoon, Regina, Prince 
Alberta or wherever.  It said “Let's reduce the provincial tax. 
That will put money in people's pockets the next morning”, which 
it did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was its first balanced budget.  It maintained health care, 
which no other province was able to accomplish, and gave tax cuts 
to the citizens of the great province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Kenora—Rainy River should be on his feet 
applauding that government for setting the way, for being the 
beacon, for being the light, for showing what governments should 
be doing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to 
the hon. member from the NDP, and I fully agree with him. I also share 
his concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is totally silent on the issues of employment and tax 
cuts. It does not propose anything to eliminate the debt and, more 
importantly, it includes no firm commitment on how surpluses will be 
used. We know full well that the Liberals are merely launching new 
programs, such as the millennium scholarship fund, in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the debt is the result of the federal government's 
absolute spending power. 
It is the result of initiatives implemented in the seventies and 
designed to promote federal identity, such as Air Canada, Petro Canada, 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that the Conservative government is to blame. 
However, the largest deficit was incurred when Marc Lalonde was Minister 
of Finance, in the seventies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that this government is currently headed 
in the same direction as the Liberal government of the seventies? Does 
he agree that we will have to put a stop to the federal government's 
absolute spending power in areas of provincial jurisdiction, if we are 
to eliminate the debt? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, again that was a very 
thoughtful question from my friend in terms of pointing out what 
the government did in the budget to inflict pain on a lot of 
people who have been experiencing and living in pain for many 
years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an opportunity for the government to extend some care, 
concern and compassion to those men, women and families who have 
suffered so much during the difficult years of restraint.  This 
was the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the money.  Before it said that it did not 
have the money and now it has it.  It had the money to improve 
health care.  It had the money to support education.  It had the 
money to help people who did not have jobs.  In other words, the 
government could have acted in a number of areas that would have 
reflected on the value of caring, but it chose not to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fair.  It is a free country.  However let the record 
show that when the Minister of Finance had the opportunity to 
help Canadians who needed help, he chose not to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, contrary to the comments of the previous speaker, I am 
quite proud to rise to speak on the budget.  I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first balanced budget in nearly 30 years is something to be 
really proud of, not only for the government but for all 
Canadians and for this Parliament.  The budget reconfirms the 
value of the prudent fiscal approach we have taken over the last 
four years.  We will continue that prudent fiscal approach so 
that Canadians can look forward to a government which is not run 
on credit cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on the speech which the hon. member for 
Kamloops just delivered.  His whole approach showed why the NDP 
has lost substantial credibility.  He spoke about several things. 
He said the budget did nothing for employment.  That comment 
shows clearly that the NDP does not understand what builds 
employment in a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the budget would do nothing for poor children and 
for those who most need help.  I will outline exactly how it 
helps those very people in society who most need our help. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about employment first.  Governments do not create 
employment.  We have all seen the folly over the years of 
government throwing money into make work programs that are 
temporary and that do nothing to deal with the underlying causes 
of unemployment or to better prepare people to take part in the 
economy and the jobs that are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However governments do create the economic conditions that allow 
the private sector to create employment.  That is exactly what 
our previous four budgets have done and what the budget continues 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues to ensure low interest rates.  It continues to 
ensure low inflation.  It continues to ensure that investors can 
have confidence in the economy of Canada because they can have 
confidence in the fiscal situation of the Government of Canada. 
Those economic conditions are very clearly supported and 
strengthened by what is in the budget as well as what has been in 
our previous four budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment is built by research.  Now, with the flexibility to 
make some choices, one of the major new investments we have made 
is to put money back into research granting councils: the Medical 
Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council and the National Science Research Council.  We are 
restoring funding for those bodies to where it was in the 1994-95 
budget.  We will be increasing it further over the next few 
years.  We know that the research we do now is the jobs of 10 
years, 15 years or 20 years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing, and perhaps the most important thing, we are 
doing is investing in the knowledge and education of our 
population and not just our young people and children.  There are 
measures in the budget to make it possible for more and more 
young bright people to have an education without assuming a 
mortgage of debt that can last, for some, the rest of their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax treatment of education expenses and the ability to 
deduct interest on student loans from income taxes as they are 
being paid back are a couple of ways in which we are helping 
students to afford an education without being burdened with 
ongoing debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are helping Canadians in the workforce to go back to school 
and upgrade their learning so that they can take advantage of new 
opportunities that are arising in a dramatically changing 
economy.  We are supporting their tuition fees with grants.  We 
are supporting their child care costs.  We are making it possible 
for the parents of many young poor children, about whom my 
colleague from Kamloops talked, to get the education that will 
help them to have better paying jobs and to better support their 
families.  As the member knows perfectly well, low income single 
parents, usually moms, cannot afford to go back and get that 
education.  The budget will help them do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that we are not investing in health care and that 
we are not investing in education.  I consider that to be a 
statement that is not honest and is not consistent with what is 
on paper in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows perfectly well that we are restoring $1.5 
billion of cash money to the provinces for education, health care 
and social services.  That is not counting the extra billions of 
dollars that come to the provinces through tax points that are 
being transferred from the federal government.  That is not 
counting the equalization payments which are also transferring 
billions of dollars to the provinces to be used for those and 
other purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the member expects us to start transferring more 
billions to the province of Ontario which has cut more out of 
health care to finance a tax cut than any money that has been 
reduced by the federal government to health care, it will not 
happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about poor children.  The member made a special 
point of saying we are not doing anything to help poor children. 
In 1996 the Liberal biennial convention adopted as its top 
priority a resolution dealing with the issue of poor children. 
That was dealt with in our last budget and it is dealt with again 
in this budget.  I am particularly proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that caucus members on this side had 
nothing to do with the budget.  I want to tell him that the 
budget was developed by our caucus members.  That resolution 
received the national support of Liberals plus the support of our 
finance minister.  It was the initiative from my riding 
association, supported by the Nepean Women's Liberal Association, 
that made it a national priority, not only for members in the 
House but for Liberals right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may not have read the budget.  I do not know how he 
could overlook an additional $850 million dealing with child 
poverty through the child tax credit.  That is a total of $1.7 
billion in two budgets.  Maybe it is not enough, probably not, 
but there are other measures. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are delivering a first broad based tax relief to Canadian 
taxpayers, starting with those most in need, that is, low and middle 
income Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the reductions in taxes are modest but they are targeted to 
those who need them most.  Four hundred thousand Canadian 
families with children will no longer pay income tax because the 
basic deduction has been reduced.  Families receiving under 
$30,000 will pay significantly less income tax this year.  Poor 
families are the families of poor children.  When we help 
families of modest income we help poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem standing here today saying I am proud of the 
budget.  I feel I have contributed to the budget.  I feel every 
one of my colleagues on this side of the House has contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We promised Canadians when we ran for election in 1997 that we 
would stay the course, that we would not fritter away the 
benefits that had been gained by their sacrifices across the 
country in order to put us in a sound fiscal situation where we 
are not seeing growing interest payments eating away at our 
ability to do anything for health care, for the economy or for 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now broken the back of the deficit.  We have a balanced 
budget.  We have choices to make as Canadians.  We have made 
prudent choices in the budget.  We are heading in the right 
direction.  I stand here proud of the budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask a question regarding the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may think that I did not read the budget, but I 
did. The problem is that her counterparts in New Brunswick may not have 
done so, or did not understand it or are no good with figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Russell King, the New Brunswick health minister, condemned the 
budget. The Newfoundland health minister condemned the budget. New 
Brunswick finance minister Edmond Blanchard condemned the budget. 
Education minister Bernard Thériault condemned the budget. That is what 
is happening across the country. Canadians are condemning the budget. 
They have missed the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently, she wants credit for that;  we thought the Minister of 
Finance was alone, but she is in the same boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague a question. They say RRSPs 
can be used to good advantage, but the poor in Canada cannot afford 
RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question for her. She mentioned that scholarships 
would be awarded on the basis of merit. I can tell you one thing: 
children who leave for school without having eaten properly—teachers 
tell us of children going to school on an empty stomach—will not get 
scholarships to study on the basis of merit. Those scholarships are not 
for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government of Canada has missed the boat.  The 
Liberal government of Canada said that 50% of the surplus would go 
towards social programs.  All the Liberal provincial ministers in 
the country are condemning the budget.  Either you do not know how 
to read, or they do not know how to read, but I have read the 
budget, and I have ears to hear what the provincial ministers are 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I have nothing to learn 
from my colleague opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live five minutes away from a community of 500 families 
living out poverty on a daily basis.  In my riding, there are 
thousands of poor families; I am very close to these families and 
these communities—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B> —and I am here to represent these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleague to read the budget and tell the truth in

There are tax cuts that target poor families, that will help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a premier, I would want much more money from the 
federal government, there is no doubt about it, and I would 
complain if I did not get it. 
But the premiers must also assume their responsibilities.  I have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today to participate in this very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>February 24, budget day, was a very good day, a good day for 
Canada and a good day for the people of Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand in my place today in this Canadian House of 
Commons where I have the privilege of representing the people of 
Thornhill and the opportunity to support this balanced budget, a 
very balanced achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous Conservative government had brought this country to 
the brink of financial crisis.  Our deficit was $42 billion, the 
largest in Canadian history.  Now for the first time in almost 30 
years the budget is balanced, the deficit is gone.  In just a few 
years this country has gone from what was described as an 
economic basket case to the country leading the G-7 nations of 
the world in economic and job growth, and this year we will be 
the first country in the G-7 to balance the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am proud.  I am proud that we are now able to make 
strategic investments in our priorities, our children, our youth, 
our health and our communities.  We are preparing for a secure 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is our vision.  It reflects our values and our plans 
for that secure future.  By investing in knowledge and creating 
educational opportunities we can complete the transition from an 
industrial economy to one that is information based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key component of our plan is the Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  The centre piece of our strategy is the Canadian 
millennium scholarship endowment fund.  Our plan will provide 
more young Canadians with access to post-secondary education than 
ever before. 
It will provide post-secondary scholarships for tens of thousands 
of deserving young Canadians in the next century.  It will help 
ensure that Canadians can fully benefit from the new jobs and the 
new economy of the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has also introduced the Canada study grant to 
assist students with children or dependants, which is so 
important.  We have also included new tax credits for interest 
paid on student loans and a Canada education savings grant which 
will provide a grant of 20% of the first $2,000 of annual 
contributions to RESPs for beneficiaries up to age 18.  That will 
ensure that people save for their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning next year, Canadians will be able to make tax free 
withdrawals from their RRSPs for lifelong learning. These 
approaches will help address the burden of student debt as well 
as enhance access to educational opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government understands the importance of education.  We 
also understand the importance of research.  That is why over the 
next three years we will increase the budget to the three 
research granting councils by $400 million.  This will create 
jobs, generate economic growth and establish Canada's position 
among world leaders in research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget the government has acted on our commitment to add 
an additional $850 million to the Canada child tax benefit, 
bringing our total commitment to $1.7 billion.  This is important 
progress in the battle to end child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Thornhill is a new riding, created in the federal 
riding redistribution before the last election.  Thornhill has 
two municipalities within its boundaries, Markham and Vaughan. 
The riding is bordered on the east by 404, on the west by 400, to 
the north by highway 7 and Rutherford Road, and the southern 
boundary is Steeles Avenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east side of Yonge Street is the town of Markham which 
was founded in 1794.  Markham is a remarkable community which 
combines the charm and atmosphere of a small community with the 
amenities and business advantages of a cosmopolitan centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west side of Yonge Street is the city of Vaughan, a 
growing and thriving young community.  The area of Vaughan which 
falls within the riding of Thornhill is commonly referred to as 
Thornhill-Concord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thornhill is like this wonderful country.  It is a mirror of the 
world.  For example, in the town of Markham over 40% of the 
residents were born outside Canada and there are some 65 
languages spoken.  In the last election the people of our 
community were given a clear choice.  Thornhill overwhelmingly 
chose the balanced policies and fiscal prudence that the Liberal 
plan offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thornhill also had a chance to judge the record of the first 
Liberal mandate.  I had the honour to be elected as the first 
member for Thornhill, another reason why I am proud to speak 
today in this House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us for a moment review the Liberal government's record. More 
than one million jobs have been created since 1993.  In 1993 
unemployment was 11.4%.  In January of this year unemployment 
was at 8.9%, still too high but the lowest level in seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has gone from having the second highest debt to GDP ratio 
to the lowest of the G-7.  In 1996-97 Canada's debt to GDP ratio 
recorded its first significant decline in 25 years.  This 
government is committed to moving in the right direction, keeping 
the trend on a downward track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to stand here today and proudly tell my constituents 
that by any international comparison the Canadian economy is 
strong and we have earned the United Nations ranking as number 
one in the world, as the best country to live in, to work in and 
to raise our families in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to maintain that quality of life.  There is still work to 
be done.  That is why I wanted to come here to Ottawa to do that 
work.  I can assure my constituents that this government will 
continue to work on behalf of all Canadians as we move forward 
toward the millennium and beyond.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance told this House and this country that we 
have won a major battle.  However, we all know we have not won 
the war.  Yes, the deficit is gone but the heavy legacy of 25 
years of deficits remains and Canada's debt burden is too high. 
Through the debt repayment plan and other fiscal measures we will 
bring down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fiscal plan is clear and balanced.  Over the course of our 
mandate half of any budgetary surplus will provide debt and tax 
relief and the other half will be invested in our social 
priorities.  Why?  This government is committed to taking the 
necessary steps to reduce unemployment and social inequities in 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth unemployment at 16.5% is too high and we are taking steps 
to ensure that all Canadians can get a first job and use their 
skills and talents to help build our economy and secure not only 
their future but our future.  Yes, we have cut taxes but the 
impact from those taxes is going to the people who need it the 
most.  Why?  It is simple fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reduced the unemployment insurance contribution by $1.4 
billion for 1998, our fourth consecutive reduction of employment 
insurance premiums.  Furthermore, we have created an important 
incentive, an employment insurance premium holiday for employers 
who hire young Canadians in 1999 and in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years $7 billion of cumulative tax relief 
will be provided.  Nearly 400,000 low income Canadians will be 
removed from the tax rolls and another 4.6 million taxpayers will 
pay less income tax.  Almost 13 million Canadians will no longer 
pay the 3% general surtax and another 1 million people will see 
that surtax reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to repeat the commitment of the leader of our party, 
the leader of our government, the Prime Minister of Canada, when 
he said we will never allow the finances of the nation to get out 
of control again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to tell the people of Thornhill that not only will 
this year's budget be balanced but so will next year's and that 
of the year after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I thank Thornhill for its confidence. I will always 
do my best to act in its best interest, the public interest. I am 
proud to support this 1998-1999 balanced budget on its behalf and 
on behalf of the public interest of Canada.  I am proud to stand 
in my place today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a question on the 
government's debt reduction policy.  She talked about the old 
50:25:25 program but what I see in the budget documents is a $3 
billion contingency fund.  If there is enough money left out of 
that, barring any other glitches to the economy or whatever, it 
will be applied to the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years the maximum we would see paid down on 
the debt is $9 billion according to my math.  In that same three 
years, interest on the debt will accumulate to almost $140 
billion.  I am wondering how she gets some sort of balance or 
fairness out of that for taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know the member finds 
it hard to accept good news, but the fact is the GDP to debt ratio is 
on a downward trend.  We have already seen some $14 billion 
repaid on the debt.  We have put in place contingency amounts of 
$3 billion this year, next year and the year after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These funds will be used for debt reduction.  This is part of 
the debt reduction strategy that I believe is in the interests of 
Canadians and that is part of a balanced policy.  It meets our 
commitment which says that 50% of any budgetary surpluses will go 
to social investment and protection of our quality of life and 
50% to debt and tax relief.  That, of course, is over the course 
of our mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the member brought this to the attention of 
the House because the debt repayment strategy and the reduction 
of the debt to GDP ratio is something that is very important as 
part of that strategy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
earlier this morning, a call came in at my constituency office, which I 
quickly returned of course, via my Ottawa office. It was a call from the 
AFEAS group in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are extremely disappointed with the latest Martin budget, 
especially as concerns the calculation of the amounts women will be 
eligible to. From now on, it will be based on family income instead of 
personal income. This is yet another low blow, especially to women who 
have been away from the labour market and will be hard hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, at Garthby, Beaulac and Disraëli in particular, a 
letter writing campaign is being staged to raise the finance minister's 
awareness of the injustice of the poverty issue in this country, because 
the hon. Minister of Finance, being a very rich man, is naturally above 
all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member opposite, who supports the budget 
brought down by her finance colleague of course, to tell me if she at 
least has compassion for the women who will be the most affected by this 
calculation based on family income. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, in response to the 
member opposite I say merci beaucoup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think women are big winners in the budget and I will tell the 
House why.  Of the 400,000 people who will no longer be paying 
income tax, many of them will be women.  One of the things we 
know, unfortunately, is that too often in Canada the face of 
poverty is women and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women will now be able to have an increase in their child care 
deduction from $5,000 to $7,000.  Women will also be able to 
participate in student loan programs which are now extended to 
part time students, many of whom are women.  When it comes to the 
Canada pension plan, young women in the future, or in fact all 
youth in Canada, can now be assured that the plan will be there 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the seniors benefits will be discussed in the 
legislation of the House, but I can assure the member that the 
guiding principle of the government when it comes to any changes 
is to ensure that the impact is understood and that we try to be 
as fair as we can be.  We understand the special needs that women 
often have in our society, particularly those who are raising 
children alone. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, today 
I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the comments earlier and the buoyant optimism of 
the member for Thornhill about the budget and I heard the 
comments from the member for Acadie—Bathurst about the pain and 
suffering in his riding and the inadequacies of the budget in 
addressing those pains and sufferings, it reminded me that three 
of the Atlantic provincial governments, two of which are Liberal, 
have come out against the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only Atlantic Canadian premier who has not stood up to the 
budget is the Prime Minister's lap dog in Nova Scotia, Russell 
MacLellan.  Why would Nova Scotians expect Russell MacLellan to 
stand up for them now, because in 17 years in Ottawa he failed to 
stand up for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are disappointed.  Canadians have sacrificed over a 
period of 15 years to reach this budget surplus.  When the member 
for Thornhill refers to the Liberal progress in reducing the 
deficit, she should remember that the deficit grew as a 
percentage of GDP from zero in 1970 under Liberal leadership to 
almost 9% under the Liberals in 1984.  It was reduced from 9% to 
5% of GDP under the Conservatives between 1984 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deficit reduction has taken some time and the Conservative 
government deserves credit for policies like free trade, which 
helped make it possible, policies members of this government 
fought vociferously when they were in opposition. 
In any case hypocrisy is only half a mortal sin and it does not 
seem to have hurt them to date.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason Canadians are disappointed in the budget is that 
after 15 years of sacrifice, after 15 years of visionary policies 
and difficult decisions to reach this point, they needed 
acknowledgement that they had actually paid the price of the 
deficit.  Ordinary Canadian taxpayers who have seen their taxes 
increased over the years, who have seen their personal disposable 
income drop 6% in recent years at a time when the U.S. personal 
disposable income has increased by 13%, needed a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about how great things are and the 
fundamentals of the economy.  We should look at how we are doing 
in comparison with the U.S.  Canadians pay roughly one-third more 
in income taxes than our American friends.  The U.S. savings rate 
has held steady at around 6%.  That is about three times what 
Canadians are able to save. Personal disposable income has been 
on the rise in the U.S. and has been on the decline in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important social indicator, unemployment, remains at 9% 
in Canada and 17% for our young people.  In the U.S. the 
unemployment rate is 4.7%  I do not think we should be taking a 
lot of time to commend the government for helping the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has been consistent over the past 18 months in 
encouraging the government to increase the basic personal 
exemption to $10,000.  We do not believe that a Canadian making 
less than $10,000 should be taxed.  The Liberals recognized that 
taxing poor Canadians was not a good idea, so they raised the 
basic personal exemption by $500.  If we calculate the total 
benefit in the budget for someone in Canada making $10,000 per 
year, it is $80 per year.  That is one cup of coffee per week at 
Tim Horton's.  If they are going to Starbucks, it is one per 
month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poorest of Canadians who have borne the brunt of the 
government's cuts to health care and the government's increases 
in taxes have suffered to reach this point.  That was a pittance, 
an insult, a slap in the face that the government gave ordinary 
Canadian taxpayer.  It is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some members opposite will say that things are better in 
Canada because of our health care system.  It may have been 
possible to say that a few years ago but it is not possible to 
say that any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada there is a phenomenon of Canadians waiting in 
hospitals for adequate health care.  In my riding there are 
constituents who are laying on gurneys in hallways of hospitals 
in places like Kentville, Nova Scotia, or the Hants Community 
Hospital in Winsor, Nova Scotia, waiting hours for adequate 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members opposite will say that has been going on for years 
in the U.S.  What is the difference between someone laying on a 
gurney in Kentville, Nova Scotia, and someone laying on a gurney 
in New Jersey?  The biggest difference is that if they make less 
than $10,000 per year in the U.S., they do not have to worry 
about having to pay income taxes to the federal government.  That 
is the biggest difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that in Canada people making less than 
$10,000 a year, first, are not given adequate health treatment 
and, second, have to be concerned about paying their federal 
income taxes which the government can spend on pet projects to 
facilitate a monument fund for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals call Canada a kinder, gentler nation.  Their cuts 
to health care have certainly contributed to the end of that 
reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest single looming social issue that threatens the 
future competitiveness of Canada is our brain drain, the loss of 
our brightest and best to the U.S.  Every year we lose 400 to 500 
doctors to the U.S. because our taxes are too high.  Eighty per 
cent of the graduates from the University of Waterloo in computer 
science are going to the U.S. every year.  The budget gave the 
government an opportunity to address this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sherry Cooper, chief economist from Nesbitt Burns, said the 
following about the budget: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pouring all this money into education and scholarships and 
then the better and brighter will go straight to the U.S. where 
taxes are massively lower.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively the government's policies and the budget are taking 
the brain drain and making it into the brain train.  The U.S. and 
its economy will benefit the most by the government's inaction in 
addressing the issue.  It should be very thankful for all the 
bright young Canadians we are sending to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sound economic policy takes holistic approaches.  If we look at 
the overall situation in Canada, unemployment, the high debt 
rates of students and their personal bankruptcy rates are 
symptoms.  They are not the problem.  The cancer in Canada is 
high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of treating the cancer, trying to effect change, 
reducing taxes and implementing policies that will work and put 
Canadians back work, the government is essentially treating 
lesions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still 1.4 million Canadians out of work.  High taxes 
kill jobs.  The government continues to wallow in ignorance and 
to perpetuate policies of high taxation.  Nesbitt Burns went 
further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the budget did contain a variety of tax cuts, they were 
targeted in nature and will have only a marginal macroeconomic 
impact.  They will not provide a meaningful boost to employment 
and will not do anything to bolster competitiveness....it fails 
to address Canada's primary tax problem—a top marginal tax rate 
in excess of 50%, compared with 40% south of the board. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable.  The president of the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business, Catherine Swift, responded that the 
budget would do nothing to reduce the unemployment rate in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say that we should wait for tax cuts.  Effectively 
they are saying that the unemployed can wait.  The unemployed 
cannot wait.  The loss of productivity, the loss of 
competitiveness, the loss of Canadian families and of Canadian 
young people cannot wait for the government to realize that it 
needs to do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing it has to do is provide Canadians with a plan 
for growth which will reduce taxation, will put more money in the 
pockets of Canadians and will provide Canadians with an 
opportunity to stimulate economic growth in their families, in 
their communities, and to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst and the most insidious taxes are payroll taxes in 
terms of their impact on employment.  Payroll taxes are a direct 
impediment to job growth in Canada.  The government has taken the 
CPP payroll tax increase last fall of $11 billion and has failed 
to reduce EI premiums to help offset those payroll tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is saying 10 cents over a period of three years when we 
advocated reducing the EI premiums to $2 immediately.  That would 
do more to stimulate job growth in Canada and still provide an 
opportunity to have an adequate surplus in the EI fund.  The 
government has not done it.  It is saying that there will be a $7 
billion of tax relief over three years when we know that it will 
eliminate it in one year with excessive EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies of high taxes are clearly unacceptable.  Canadians 
know it.  We need strong leadership to reduce taxes.  I can only 
hope they will occur under the government prior to four years 
from now when we have to make the tough decisions and put 
Canadians back where they should be, at the top in terms of 
international competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On questions and

Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a comment 
and a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised at the political rhetoric of the member for 
Kings—Hants.  We know there is an ongoing election in Nova 
Scotia.  He tried to almost belittle the current premier of Nova 
Scotia for supposedly not having spoken out on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the hon. member that I was very proud to sit in the 
last caucus with Russell MacLellan as a member from the province 
of Nova Scotia.  If anyone stood up for Atlantic Canada, Russell 
MacLellan did.  We as a government had to make hard decisions 
left to us because of the legacy of the former Mulroney Tory 
government. 
As the Minister of Finance said the other day, we took over a $42 
billion deficit and we have managed to bring it down to what it 
is today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say again that Russell MacLellan as a member fought hard 
in terms of trying to retain an employment insurance program 
which would be of benefit to the people of Cape Breton and 
throughout Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member has to look at the progress which we have 
made.  For heaven's sake, he must admit that we got rid of the 3% 
surtax which the former Tory government implemented to deal with 
the deficit but did not. Can he not see that this budget is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure there is a 
question in there.  The hon. member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there seems to be some 
confusion.  Perhaps I was wrong when I said that Russell 
MacLellan did not stand up in this House for Nova Scotia because 
he did.  He stood up to vote for cuts to health care and 
education in Nova Scotia.  He stood up to support Bill C-68. 
That certainly did not help people in rural Nova Scotia.  He 
stood up to support policies which were damaging to Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the 3% surtax.  It was a deficit 
reduction surtax and it seems to have worked, has it not?  The 
fact is that his government has not eliminated the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wanted to improve his knowledge of these affairs he might 
subscribe to <I>The Economist</I> for $172 Canadian.  <I>The 
Economist</I> says that the fundamental changes made by the 
Conservative government in the early 1990s, including free trade 
and the GST, are responsible for the Liberal government's ability 
to pay off the deficit.

<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member comes from the east coast.  He 
recognizes very well that currently there is a crisis in health 
care on the east coast.  It is an enormous crisis.  The people 
are not receiving essential services when they need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that it put an extra $1.5 billion into 
health care by raising the floor.  The government has not even 
hit the floor yet.  The reality is that not one red penny has 
gone into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my Conservative colleague whether he feels the 
government has put money directly into essential health care 
services or whether the Canadian public, which needs those 
essential services, are once again being shafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the government talks 
about establishing floors for health care I would like it to 
understand that health care in Nova Scotia is subterranean.  It 
has not reached the floor.  It is still in the basement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this government continues to cut cash transfers 
to seven of the ten provinces, including Nova Scotia which will 
receive $14 million less in cash transfers from this government 
over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care cuts have not stopped.  In fact there will be less 
cash transfers from this government for health care for Nova 
Scotia and for health care for Prince Edward Island and for 
health care for New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the hon. member opposite, who comes from Prince 
Edward Island, to join with us and stand up for his province to 
ensure that these cuts do not continue.  There is an immediate 
price to be paid for the health care system in Prince Edward 
Island.  If he is unwilling to do so, we will fight on this side 
of the House for his constituents in Prince Edward Island because 
we need a commitment for health care in Atlantic Canada and it 
will come from this caucus and from other members opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is no small feat to forge social policies for the people of

individuals facing personal crises and needing a helping hand. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are values Canadians are not prepared to sacrifice. Yet they 
know they come at a price. The challenge for any government is to 
balance these values against fiscal responsibility.

of its platform.  This government claims to be concerned about

measures for the young and the not-so-young people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this government claims to be fiscally responsible, 
but that responsibility is at the expense of the businesses and 
workers whose contributions to employment insurance continue to add 
to the Minister of Finance's coffers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to mention that the finance minister in the hopes of 
polishing his own image has downloaded many of his cuts to the 
provinces.  The provinces were expecting concrete measures to 
match the federal government's rhetoric about reinvesting in 
health care and education.  What they got was a serious reality 
check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have failed to restore the $6 billion they have 
taken out of transfers to the provinces for health care, 
education and social assistance since they came to power. Not 
only will most provinces lose out on cash transfers over the next 
five years, but the federal Liberals have had the arrogance to 
undertake what they call a major initiative in education without 
consulting with the provinces.  I will say more on that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the maritimes where I am from not many provincial politicians 
are applauding the federal government.  In fact I think the only 
one who thinks this budget is good for his province is Russell 
MacLellan, the premier of Nova Scotia.  Talk about being out of 
the loop.  His province will lose about $14 million in cash 
transfers over the next five years.  Reality.  But Nova Scotians 
need not worry too much.  Within a couple of weeks they will 
elect a new premier who will actually fight for their best 
interests and get them off their knees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick, which is not too far from P.E.I., the Liberal 
provincial Minister of Finance who is from my hometown had no 
praise to sing.  This is a guy who has sheepishly accepted the 
federal government's cuts over the past few years.  He finally 
woke up to find “one-third of what we spend in this province is 
devoted to health care and this particular budget adds no new 
money to that area”. There are no new dollars being directed to 
the provinces for health care as a result of this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget this government has shown once again that it is 
without vision and is satisfied with piecemeal solutions.  A 
perfect example is the proposed millennium fund, a public 
relations exercise at best.  It shows just how much the 
government just does not get what the problems are.

tuition fee hikes.  The student debt load ought to be of primary 
importance to all Canadians.  Student debt affects more than just 
students.  It is an obstacle to the sustained economic growth of 
our country.  Canada simply cannot allow so many of its young 
people to be crushed by their debts.

the Minister of Finance have forced provincial governments to 
reduce the financial resources of their colleges and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They in turn have been forced to raise tuition fees.  This has 
led to such a rapid increase in the student debt load that it has 
become a serious threat to the economic future of our young people. 
In 1997 students owed an average of $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are making a great song and dance about the 
Canadian millennium scholarship foundation.  A problem of this size 
will not be solved by putting a little more money in the pockets of 
a very small number of students.  Only a very limited number of 
students will be helped by these scholarships. 
In fact, 93% of them will not get a red cent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the millennium fund only kicks in in 
two years.  This government's philosophy is that young people are 
the future of our society.  It keeps forgetting that they are 
also very much a part of the present with needs that must be 
answered today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

reductions and the cost of education, which are the fundamental causes 
of the debt load.

them the same opportunities their parents had. We must absolutely put an

investors look elsewhere, thus depriving our country of jobs, and they

Payroll taxes kill jobs.

policy and Liberal policy.  I would remind him and all Canadians 
that it was the Conservative government's policy that left a $42

</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to see Mr. Eves on the news this morning whining 
about this budget.  I remind all Canadians, particularly those in 
Ontario who listened to Mr. Eves, that the provinces make 
choices.  While the federal government listened to the national 
forum on health and raised the transfer from $11 billion to $12.5 
billion for health and education in the Canadian health and 
social transfer, Ontario chose a personal income tax cut which 
will reduce provincial revenues by $4.8 billion when fully 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare that to the transfer payment reduction of $850 
million for 1998-99, it means in Ontario after Conservative 
policies Ontario's revenue reduction because of tax cuts is five 
times more than what it is blaming the federal government for. If 
Ontario were really interested in maintaining health care and 
education, it would look at its policies and understand how 
misguided, unbalanced and detrimental they are. When I listen to 
this member compare that, I think—

certainly reply to the comments regarding inheriting a debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member should go back a little further to when 
her idol, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was prime minister of this 
country.  When we took power in 1984 we inherited the debt.  We 
had to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about a balanced budget.  We are certainly applauding a 
balanced budget today, but I will tell the member how we got 
there.  The Liberals certainly did not got there in three years. 
We got there because of the measures put in place by the previous 
Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned transfer payments.  Is she from Atlantic 
Canada?  I am from New Brunswick. I have seen the devastation in 
the health care system, in education, in high unemployment. New

four years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the member a selective memory, but he is also 
subject to illusion when he talks about the Nova Scotia election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a simple question. The budget the member talks about in 
terms of reductions was in fact the 1995 budget.  We felt we had 
to make choices.  We did not cut as deep as some wanted us to. 
We had to make the choices to get to where we are today.  My 
question is quite simple for his selective memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member support his leader and the member for Saint John 
when they voted with Reform in the 1995 budget against the budget 
because it did not cut far enough?  That is where his party 
leader stood.  Does he support that position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is certainly something 
wrong with the memory of this member from P.E.I.  I would like to 
ask him a question about what his party's position was on free 
trade and what his party's position was on the GST.  They were 
supposed to throw it right back and did not.  That is the reason 
we have a surplus today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member from P.E.I. say we should cut back transfers 
even more in his province?  Is that what you are saying?  That is 
what I thought I heard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think a very historic budget has come out.  I have no question 
that the Minister of Finance has, along with the cabinet, along 
with the Prime Minister, done something that all Canadians have 
longed for over the last several decades.  When we talk about 
eliminating the deficit, it is extremely important and it is 
extremely historic for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the basket case of the G-7 countries a short time ago 
under the former government.  We have totally turned that corner 
and now we are moving in a very positive direction.  Eliminating 
the deficit is not the end, and every person in this House 
realizes it is still very important that we maintain a course 
that is set to improve the financial status, the financial 
balance sheet, the whole finances of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it is extremely important that we look at the 
socioeconomic side of what is happening to our people.  We look 
at what measures a government can take to create a better society 
with the assets we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think when we talk about complaints regarding how dollars are 
being spent, it is like a family.  There is no question that 
every person in the family is not going to agree with exactly how 
every dollar should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we can agree on some basic elements and principles that 
have been going on in the last three years.  We can agree on some 
basic directions in which we are intending to go in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does set a course.  The course is not to spend 
lavishly, not to move our finances into a precarious position by 
huge tax cuts, not to put at risk what we have achieved to this 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in the House who say that we should cut taxes, a 
big cutting of taxes so that people can go out and spend more 
money.  Are they responsible in looking at the view that we 
should not follow a course of being prudent, being cautious, 
being careful and realizing that the roller coaster of economics 
goes up and the roller coaster of economics goes down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada cannot control world markets.  We in Canada are 
subject to actions that occur in the United States, actions that 
occur in Asia, actions that occur in South America, actions that 
occur in Europe or anywhere else in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not really cautious about charting a course, putting a 
little money away for a rainy day, cushioning the effects that 
world economic questions can raise, then we are really at risk of 
falling back into a deficit.  If interest rates throughout the 
world start pushing higher, if our Canadian dollar comes under 
heavy assault, as it really did a few weeks ago, if the Asian 
markets do not stay steady and move along, we are vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore when we talk about tax cuts, heavy payments, social 
spending, if we do not stay the course we have set over the last 
three years, we leave ourselves very vulnerable not only today 
but in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say we have a scenario to deal with.  We have almost 
$600 billion in debt and the interest on that money is crushing. 
There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Huge interest payments are very expensive to Canada.  For every 
$3 we take in in taxes, one of those dollars is spent against the 
debt on interest alone. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore realizing that enormous problem we have, realizing 
what is happening within the spectrum of payments, we must make 
certain that we can pay that off without extending our debt, 
without extending other programs beyond our means whereby we 
would fall further into a deficit situation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the finance minister has achieved that. I believe he 
has a very conservative approach to maintaining our financial 
security. But at the same time he has examined very carefully 
what is going to make us more prosperous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision is let us get the population that is going into the 
workforce as well educated as possible. Let us put those people 
in a position where they understand high technology, where they 
have post-secondary options not available to many young people 
today. Let us make sure that every young Canadian has the 
opportunity to have the highest level of education they can 
achieve and the education that is going to bring them to a point 
of good, solid income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does that affect Canada? If we educate our young people to 
the abilities of handling high tech, we can then develop this 
high tech industry in this country and move forward. We can move 
forward with business opportunities never perceived before. We 
have a great opportunity here to move our young people into those 
high tech areas, move our young people into job situations which 
in fact will pay tremendous benefits to this country in the short 
term as well as the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will attract businesses into Canada that are working in the 
high tech industry and we can become a very focal point of high 
technology for Canadians, for North Americans, for the world. I 
have no question when we look at that issue it is extremely 
important that we be the leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does that affect other jobs? Even those who do not go to 
school will have opportunity to move into other areas because 
there is no question once you develop a high tech area, once you 
develop more jobs, there are other job opportunities, small 
business and so on, to support those people working in the 
industries, which we are going to train Canadians to do. This 
budget speaks of our prosperity in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch on the questions we talked about with 
regard to what is most important for us at this point in time in 
order to help low income Canadians. I agree it would be nice if 
we could give more tax breaks and tax cuts. But we did target low 
income Canadians with a personal exemption. We removed our 3% 
surtax, which meant that many of our low income and middle income 
Canadians will have a much better opportunity within the tax 
structure than they had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is up. I would like Canadians to sit back and 
think about what opposition members have been saying to this 
point. I have heard them criticize what has been said, but in 
fact those critics are always going to be there. I have not heard 
them present good, solid solutions which would cure our 
illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have moved to a very positive area. We are on the 
move, and staying the course is the only way I see this country 
gaining the most benefit it can. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is always great to hear government members comment on a budget or on a 
bill. They always think they hold the key to the truth. They have the 
knowledge and the truth, they are right. No one else in Canada or in 
Quebec can be right; they are the truth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the criticisms and comments on this budget. 
They did not come just from the wicked old sovereignists.  They did 
not come only from the people of Quebec.  Criticisms have been 
levelled across Canada.  They have come from the papers and the 
editorialists.  They have come from friends of the Liberal 
government, who say that this budget massacres the middle class and 
that the government is knowingly hiding revenues in order to play 
petty politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say the government lacks clear vision on how to use the 
accumulated surplus. 
They say the government is taking billions of dollars from the 
pockets of the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speeches I have heard here are something else.  In 
university, I had a professor who taught about taxes and who gave 
me a golden rule, which I follow in politics, and the hon. member 
should be aware of it.  He used to say “Students, there is one rule 
to remember in taxation: you stuff mattresses, not the springs”. 
The member opposite did not understand anything, because he is 
trying to stuff the springs.  He is trying to stuff taxpayers, who 
fill the government coffers with their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst thing, and I will conclude on this point, is the 
millennium scholarship fund of $2.5 billion they are investing 
directly in provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member: is it not more important, because he 
seems to consider education important, to ensure that young people 
going to school eat well, that students in primary and secondary 
school have the tools they need and that universities are properly 
equipped?  The federal government is in no position to do that, but 
the provinces are.  If the federal government has too much money, 
why does it not send it directly to the provinces as transfer 
payments? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would very quickly 
point out that again the member said nothing positive.  He has 
really not tried to present an alternate viewpoint.  All he has 
done is to hammer the government for what it did.  I would 
challenge some of the things he said.  I really do not think I 
have read press clippings that say it is a disaster for the 
middle class.  As a matter of fact, I have read some very 
positive clippings along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that a lot of members have suggested taxes 
have been increased and we have a huge amount more money coming 
in today than we did in 1993.  That is very correct, but I want 
to point out why that is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked very hard to get the fundamentals right in this 
country.  Low interest rates, trade missions, promotions for 
small business loans, all of the fundamentals that require a 
thriving society; that has been the goal of this government.  As 
a result, we not only have created a tremendous number of new 
businesses in this country, more successful businesses in this 
country, but we have also employed one million more people.  The 
extra revenues have not come from tax increases.  The extra 
revenues have come from putting more Canadians to work.  Those 
extra revenues are now coming back to help us with the costs of 
operating the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fundamentally important to understand that we as a 
government have done everything we can to make certain the 
fundamentals are correct.  By doing that, more Canadians are 
working and taxes do increase. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to begin by saying that this government has done 
something that no other has accomplished in over 30 years. 
Through the direction of this government, the Canadian people 
have achieved a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this achievement, the finance minister delivered 
a budget balance on Tuesday. 
This budget is visionary.  Its recommendations are sustainable. 
Its foundations are predicated on fiscal stability.  Its scope 
reaches all Canadians in a fair and responsible manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Finance, I had the opportunity last fall to hear from Canadians 
from Vancouver to St. John's.  I also hosted a consultation 
session in my riding of Kitchener Centre.  I submitted those 
recommendations to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget speaks to the requests made by Canadians, made by my 
constituents.  It speaks to our children, our youth, our 
unemployed, our working families, our businesses, our disabled 
people, our aboriginal population and our elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is in the best interests of all Canadians.  It 
invests in community, the community of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is multifaceted.  I could not hope to touch on all of 
its merits.  Instead I would like to highlight four themes: 
feasibility, fairness, focus, and the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that Canadians were pleased that the deficit had been 
brought under control.  We now find that we are even ahead of 
that target.  However there was also an expressed concern that 
the government would revert to the program spending ways of the 
past. This government in the budget sets out a course for a 
continuous mandate of sensible reinvestment for Canadians without 
jeopardizing all we have been able to accomplish together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the previously committed programs of previous 
budgets, as well as Bill C-28 which will receive debate in this 
House in the next few weeks, we are committing to a course which 
is sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wanted to see us bring down the deficit.  This budget 
fulfils that wish through designating our $3 billion contingency 
reserve to this purpose if it has not been required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current budget commits 60% to debt reduction, which is 
slightly more than we said we would do in the last election. This 
was among the recommendations made by my constituents in 
Kitchener during my prebudget consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the contingency reserve has not 
been required for the past four years. As a result, we have been 
able to reduce our marketable debt by $13 billion.  This plan 
remains within the context of Canada's budget, interest rates and 
the debt to GDP ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to securing an enduring reduction in public debt 
burden the government has also reduced its exposure to increases 
in interest rates by restructuring the composition of our public 
debt.  Sixty-five per cent of our debt is at a fixed rate.  This 
is in the face of 50% in the early 1990s.  This saves Canadians 
almost $1 billion in debt charges per year and will help us to 
manage our debt over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to the feasible delivery of what 
Canadians said they needed and what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On fairness, this government is committed to meaningful 
consultations.  I see the issues and the concerns expressed by 
the people across Canada addressed in this budget.  This budget 
spans generations, provinces, and all of Canada's many ethnic 
communities.  It truly is a budget for all Canadians. It offers 
visionary approaches to issues which Canadians hold dear to their 
hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a demonstration of the government's commitment to ensuring 
fairness in taxation, it has removed the 3% general surtax 
introduced by the Mulroney government. In addition, the 
government will increase the basic personal exemption by $500 for 
single taxpayers with an income under $20,000 and by $1,000 for a 
family with an income under $40,000. As a result 400,000 
Canadians will be removed from the tax rolls and there will be 
tax relief for 4.6 million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is focused.  While providing a fair approach which 
benefits all Canadians, this budget also addresses key areas for 
growth and improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a segment from my prebudget town hall 
report:  “Education is the key to our future.  Start early. Keep 
it accessible.  Encourage lifelong learning”. This is what I 
heard from the people of Kitchener Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key focal point of this budget is on lifelong learning, 
encouraging Canadians to maintain and develop skills and 
knowledge.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a 24% increase in technological, computer and 
professional development as well as apprenticeship in short term 
programs across Canada in 1997, an increase over 1996.  Due to a 
number of factors people are realizing the importance of ongoing 
lifelong learning.  We are making those programs available to 
them through interest relief and being able to use their RRSPs 
for educational programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part time university enrolment was down 10% to 18% in 1997 from 
1996, due in part to rising costs, work and family commitments, 
the realization that a university degree is helpful in obtaining 
employment but specific skills development is also beneficial. 
This budget addresses these issues through offering ongoing 
support to lifelong learning by making the RRSPs accessible and 
by allowing for RESP contributions.  The government will match 
20% of those contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligibility for increased assistance is also available for part 
time students and for students with families and other 
commitments.  We are also opening up the eligibility to include 
apprenticeship programs.  Generally, we are being more inclusive 
of the entire education spectrum. This is key to the skills 
development which is needed for our future workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies in the Kitchener area indicate a desperate need for high 
tech and knowledge skilled workers.  We have seen a shift from 
manufacturing industries to those in the high tech sector. This 
budget offers Canadians the tools they need to develop the skills 
that are necessary to carry them into the future and ensure 
increased employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the increased aid to students and those 
furthering their education, we have the Canadian millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also offered to help ease the debt burden on 
recent graduates by offering tax relief on the interest portion 
of the amount paid on loans approved under federal and provincial 
student loan programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also offers an EI holiday which gives employers an 
incentive to hire young Canadians.  This is an attempt to stop 
the no job, no experience, no experience, no job cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constituents at my town hall said that technology and innovation 
are the future. Our companies need research and development if 
they are to grow and prosper.  Effective in 1998-99 this 
government has committed to restoring research granting councils 
to their 1994-95 levels and will continue to grow over the next 
two years reaching their highest level ever by the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will increase funding for research and development 
by more than $400 million over the next three years.  This 
commitment to research and development will allow Canada's 
innovation sector to continue to be at the cutting edge. We 
cannot continue to lose Canada's best and brightest.  We are much 
better off to have them make their medical discoveries and 
develop new technology in Canada rather than try to repatriate 
them after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is also a key concern of Canadians.  It is one of 
the reasons why in both Bill C-28 and this budget we have 
committed to having a floor of $12.5 billion going to the 
provinces for their CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget looks to Canada's future by making strategic 
investments in areas I have mentioned.  Studies indicate that 
over the next two decades the most critical economic challenge 
will be the supply of skilled labour.  It is said that the 
attention paid in the past to address the deficit and inflation 
will be necessary to address this need for skilled labour in the 
future.  The result of not addressing this would lead to a lack 
of economic growth with thousands of Canadians who want to work 
but lack the job skills to find employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Larry Smith, an adjunct faculty member in economics at the 
University of Waterloo, called this budget a stunning economic 
accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on the theme of lifelong learning I would like to share 
an analogy made by one of my colleagues.  If a man is hungry and 
you give him bread, he will eat for a day.  But if you give him 
seeds and teach him how to farm, he will nourish himself into the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truly, this budget has that kind of investment and that kind of 
vision both for Canadians and for the future of Canada.  This 
budget is offering Canadians the seeds to gain the knowledge and 
the ability to reap the long term benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
interested in the previous speaker's comments about lifelong 
learning and shortages in skilled trades.   He spoke about a 
number of issues I have been very concerned about and on which I 
was looking optimistically to the budget for some satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his budget speech the Minister of Finance spoke at length 
about the need for lifelong learning.  I believe he used those 
terms.  He spoke about the need for a strong human resources 
strategy, for more workers in the field of science, industry, 
trades and various non-university post-secondary training.  He 
capped it off by saying that this was a matter for the provinces. 
The lead up and a number of the issues raised by the minister and 
the previous speaker gave us no satisfaction in the skilled 
trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a journeyman carpenter who has spent his life in the building 
trades, I have seen a real problem with training opportunities 
for people who choose blue collar trades as a career choice.  All 
the funding for students while they are in the classroom 
component of their apprenticeship program has been taken away. 
There is no longer any income maintenance for those students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What satisfaction is there for the people in the building 
trades, the plumbers, carpenters and electricians, who earn while 
they learn and who have to go to community colleges?  Could the 
member tell me where in the budget there is any satisfaction 
given to those individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Conestoga College in my 
riding works with the sectors the member is talking about to 
offer those kinds of programs.  Through access to the RRSP and 
the RESP they will now be able to access funds to help with that 
portion of their education.  I see this as very forward looking 
and very cognizant of the kinds of skills training they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I ask the hon. 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca to try to keep it to around 30 
seconds or so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member correctly mentioned that the government 
has increased the floor for spending on health care and the CHST 
from $11 billion to $12.5 billion.  However, she made the mistake 
of saying that it was an increase in the amount of money put into 
the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the government is spending more than $12.5 billion on 
the CHST.  How much money does the hon. member feel is going 
toward increased payments to the provinces for health, education 
and welfare?  There is absolutely none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite 
right.  The CHST is made up partially of cash transfer and 
partially of a taxing authority given to the provinces through 
tax points.  That is predicated on the growth of provincial 
economic conditions, so there is more money going to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is one of several budgets brought in by the 
government.  Bill C-28 is the legislation that entrenches the 
commitment the government has made.  The government made an 
increased commitment of $12.5 billion during the last election. 
All members opposite refused to support that legislation in the 
standing committee, so I wonder what they are talking about.

everyone knows that Canadians and Quebeckers are among the world's 
most highly taxed people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare ourselves to our American neighbours, as we are 
so fond of doing, we pay 25% more in taxes.  One reason, 
unfortunately, is that there is duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, when a dairy cow's production is used for 
industrial milk, the federal minister has jurisdiction.  When it is 
used for commercial milk, the milk people drink every day, the 
Minister of Agriculture of Quebec, or of Ontario if the cow is from 
that province, has jurisdiction over the animal. 
The Minister of Finance, and our wonderful Prime Minister, are now 
creating more duplication:  millennium scholarships.

we were to ask the students if they would rather have two levels 
of government looking after them, which means more money and 
better access to education, they would be in full agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate on the budget released this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget was a historic achievement.  I was born in 1968, two 
years before we began to run deficits for the rest of my life.  I 
have known virtually nothing but deficits for my entire conscious 
life.  Therefore, it was with great expectation that I ran in the 
recent election and took my seat in this place, anticipating this 
budget, knowing that it would be the first balanced budget in 
Canada in three decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that as a former Liberal I have great personal regard 
for the hon. Minister of Finance.  I expected him to seize the 
moment, to seize the great opportunity of the first surplus in 30 
years, to chart a new course for Canada, a course of greater 
opportunity, hope, growth and employment, particularly for 
younger Canadians, a future which would unshackle us from the 
terrible destructive burden of the $600 billion debt and the 47% 
tax burden carried by Canadian families.  That is what I 
anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also anticipated that this would be an enormous achievement 
and would strike out in all the right directions.  However, I 
found that the budget just struck out.  It struck out on every 
count. It struck out three times.  It struck out in terms of 
controlling spending because we see federal spending going up yet 
once more in the budget.  It struck out in terms of debt 
reduction because we see in the budget plan zero commitment to 
specific debt reduction.  Most of all, it struck out in terms of 
providing hope, growth, opportunity and employment through 
meaningful substantive tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the budget increases spending, increases taxes and keeps 
the debt at its current level of $583 billion.  With all due 
respect, I cannot imagine under the current economic and fiscal 
conditions how the government could have framed a less 
constructive future oriented budget than it did.  I am truly and 
sincerely amazed that the minister missed the mark to the extent 
he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the means by which the budget has been 
balanced it is not altogether surprising.  After all, 69% of the 
deficit reduction that we have seen since fiscal year 1993 has 
been achieved through increases in government revenues and only 
31% has been achieved through spending cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends opposite will say that revenue increases will go from 
$116.5 billion to $160 billion in the upcoming fiscal year and 
that those enormous revenue increases of nearly $50 billion were 
achieved through growth in the economy and more employment. 
In part, that is true, but they are not telling Canadians that 
the absolute tax burden, no matter how it is calculated, has gone 
up at the same time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the straight revenue growth of nearly $50 billion 
clearly it has gone up.  However, if we look at taxes as a 
percentage of gross domestic product it has gone up.  If we look 
at personal income taxes as a percentage of GDP it has gone up. 
If we look at taxes as a percentage of family household income it 
has gone up.  If we look at taxes as compared to other family 
household expenditures like food, shelter and clothing it has 
gone up.  If we look at inflation the tax haul has gone up faster 
than inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to make this argument with reference to the 
statistics.  The ultimate proof of whether or not we have a 
higher absolute tax burden today is in the paystubs people get 
when they open their paycheques from work and what they see on 
the bottom line today is a higher tax burden than what they were 
paying in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most shocking, in three years when they open up that paystub, 
having heard all of this marvellous rhetoric about tax relief, 
they will find that their after tax disposable income will have 
gone down yet again.  Yes, this is a tax increase budget.  It is 
a budget which increases net taxes on most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will ask me how that is possible since the government has 
listed specific measures on the 3% surtax and a $500 increase in 
the basic exemption for some Canadians.  They will ask how they 
could then see an increase.  It is for two reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government managed in January to impose, as we all 
know, the largest tax increase in Canadian history, the $10 
billion CPP payroll tax grab which will do nothing in the long 
run to salvage that Ponzi scheme for my generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will in the immediate three years take $10 billion a year out 
of the pockets of taxpayers in a destructive job killing payroll 
tax. That is only part of the story because when we factor in the 
insidious effect of tax deindexation and the bracket creep 
imposed in 1986, we find that more and more Canadians will be 
pushed up on to the tax rolls than ever before.  Because more 
Canadians will be earning more than the basic exemptions they 
will be pushed up into higher marginal rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent study by KPMG, which is not the Reform Party's 
research but private sector research, indicates that by the year 
2001 an average taxpayer will have paid $5,300 more than they do 
today in income taxes because of bracket creep, that they will 
pay $913 billion next year alone because of bracket creep.  It is 
an enormous, insidious tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not trust me on that, Mr. Speaker.  I want to quote the 
leader of the opposition, a very credible source, who said with 
respect to the budget “The Minister of Finance told us there 
were no tax increases in this budget.  That statement is false 
because taxes are going up in this country because of the 
deindexation of deductions which this government has done in its 
past budgets”.  He went on to say “These taxes are hidden. They 
are sneaky.  You don't notice them until you get the bill. They 
are practically invisible, but the sneakiest tax increase of all 
was the deindexation of personal income tax which will cost 
Canadians billions of dollars more annually.  The minister kept 
quiet about it.  Here again low and middle income Canadians will 
carry the heaviest burden”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the leader of the opposition in 1987.  That was the 
Right Hon. John Turner, leader of the Liberal Party of Canada who 
at the time talked about this secret insidious tax grab on low 
and modest income Canadians, which has forced the lowest income 
Canadians on to the tax rolls.  People who earn $7,000, $8,000 or 
$9,000 a year, alone among the industrialized countries of the 
world, have to pay taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister provided in his budget a distributional impact of 
the so-called tax relief that he has afforded, but when we add in 
the effect of the CPP payroll grab and bracket creep we find that 
a $20,000 earner single taxpayer, the Minister of Finance says, 
will get a $63 tax break. 
Whoopee, $1.10 a month.  We can buy a cup of coffee once a month 
while these Liberals probably spend about $3 on latte at 
Starbucks.  Add in the CPP and bracket creep and it is an $86 net 
tax hike for that same person.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at a $50,000 single income earner for a family of four. 
The finance minister says they will save $238.  When you add 
bracket creep and the CPP they will pay $68 more.  This does 
nothing in terms of tax relief.  We do not have to make this 
argument because people's paycheques will make it very evident 
when this budget is implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does it not raise taxes, it does nothing in terms of 
concrete commitment to debt reduction. This I find the most 
shocking thing of all.  In poll after poll, the vast plurality of 
Canadians say their top priority is to pay down the debt.  They 
know we are siphoning $45 billion a year off the productive 
sector of this economy to flush it down the destructive sinkhole 
of government debt financing.  They know the average family now 
spends $6,000 a year in interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the finance minister say in his budget document?  He 
says on page 52 that the net public debt this year is $583.2 
billion.  The net public debt next year will be $583.2 billion. 
The net public the year after that will be $583.2 billion.  The 
net public debt the year after that will be $583.2 billion, with 
$45 billion in interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may call this a debt reduction budget.  It does 
nothing in terms of the debt.  He said that if we are lucky, he 
might allocate the $3 billion contingency fund to debt reduction. 
Three billion dollars times three years is $9 billion.  A $9 
billion reduction on a $580 billion debt, my goodness, it's 
remarkable.  It will only take him 200 years to pay down the debt 
of my generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going to happen to the interest payments, $45 billion 
this year to $45 billion in the year 1999?  This has nothing to 
do with debt reduction.  If he does to the contingency fund in 
future years what he did in the current fiscal year, there will 
not be a contingency.  There will not be a surplus to dedicate 
toward the debt because he has spent it this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need more than rhetoric when it comes to fiscal 
discipline.  We need a statutory and, I would argue, 
constitutional mandate to force the government, regardless of who 
is in power and regardless of the political circumstances of the 
day, to pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta has done it.  It has cut its net debt in half in four 
years because of a law that requires that every single dollar in 
surplus be directed to debt reduction.  That is what we need 
here.  The minister says “Trust me.  I will direct the 
contingency fund.  If the minister of heritage doesn't get her 
hands on it, if my other tax and spend colleagues don't spend the 
surplus before it gets to the debt, I will use it to pay down the 
debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just realized I should wrap this up because I am splitting my 
time with my colleague.  Is it too late?  Can I yield to the hon. 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With unanimous

Speaker, I thank my hon. friend from Calgary Southeast for 
pulling up his reins, because I know he has a lot more positive 
interventions and I am sure he will make those during question 
period today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a cynic I might believe that this budget was the 
leadership budget, but I am not. Certainly the government 
deserves to be congratulated for balancing the budget. But this 
budget is a tale of lost opportunity. This budget is a tale of 
what could have been an opportunity that could have really 
managed to give the Canadian people the ability, the opportunity 
and the chance to build a better, stronger future for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have missed opportunities that flew threw the finance 
minister's and this government's fingers like water in sand. The 
finance minister and this government have once again pulled the 
wool over the eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about government fables. But first I would 
like to talk about one fact. If we look back in history to the 
behaviour of government finance ministers and Liberal governments 
in the past, we can see that their governments have spent, spent, 
spent.  If not for the Reform Party the government would never 
have balanced this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has proven that it was the Reform Party on the tails of 
this government which has managed to force this government to 
finally do the right thing and balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about government fables and fact, reality versus 
fiction. Government members like to talk about a million jobs 
created. That is the natural increase that we would normally have 
in the most unambitious of growth rates. The cold hard reality is 
that in this country we have a 17% unemployment rate among youth, 
we have a 9% unemployment rate in the rest of the country and we 
have an underemployment rate that is beyond what anybody in this 
House can possibly imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All one needs to do is go down the streets and see the vacant 
store front windows, see the people who are far overqualified for 
the jobs they have, listen and talk to the shopkeepers and 
business owners.  They say “my gosh, if I only had some extra 
money I could hire apprentices, I could hire more employees, I 
could invest in my business, I could become more competitive, I 
could be the engine that helps to drive our economy in this 
country, a country that is only scratching its potential”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to talk about tax rates. The government 
likes to say it has dropped the tax rates. Let us look at the 
reality. To a family earning $30,000 the government in its 
generosity in this budget has given back $148.  That family 
should not spend it all in the same place because $148 for a 
family of four with one earner will not go very far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cold hard reality is yes, the government has gone and given 
some tax relief. It has put a couple of pennies in the left 
pocket while taking both hands and scooping out pails of money 
from the other to the tune of $38 billion over the last four 
years since we were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP rates doubled, and that is going to crush our economy. It is 
going to have a major negative effect on the economy. I challenge 
the members on the other side to address that issue with us in an 
active debate and to open their eyes and not accept what their 
government colleagues tell them but, for heaven's sake, look at 
the facts.  Take a critical view of what they are told. Analyse 
what they are told. Take a look, with the experiences that they 
have, to see in their own riding with their own business people, 
their own people who cannot find a job and compare that with what 
they are told. That is all we ask. If they do that then the 
reality will be immediately evident to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we have the highest tax rate that exists today in 
the G-7 nations, and that has a major crushing effect on the 
economy. The finance minister could have lowered the tax rate, 
could have taken a leaf out of the books of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Ontario, taken a look internationally at Ireland 
and England, countries and provinces that have taken the bull by 
the horns, lowered taxes and removed egregious rules and 
regulations that seek to strangle off the ability of the private 
sector to function properly. 
Did the government do that?  No.  Why?  If I were a cynic I might 
think it was a leadership budget.  If I were a cynic I might 
think it was trying to seduce the Canadian public by giving it a 
few pennies so it will remember at election time.  But I would 
never say that in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shame. The government intelligently made an investment 
in education. We compliment the government for doing that.  But 
that is only one half of the equation.  An educated population 
can be provided, but what is the point of providing an educated 
population when the educated population has no jobs to go to in 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned numerous times in this House, those people 
flock to greener pastures, to vibrant and growing economies. They 
flock to the south.  They flock to the east.  They flock to the 
west.  But they do not stay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayers are spending their hard earned money to educate 
the public and to provide it opportunities in a country where the 
opportunities are far less than what they could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed on one half of the equation.  It 
should have listened to the plans of the Reform Party, which are 
based on fact, experience and workable pragmatic solutions to get 
people back to work.  We would do it by reducing taxes and by 
eliminating interprovincial trade barriers and the rules and 
regulations which strangle the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has partially addressed the issue of research and 
development, a major pillar in our ability as a country to be 
functionally active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister was very incorrect in his speech when he 
said that the Asian flu is over.  I can tell the House that the 
Asian flu is far from being over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major cleavages taking place in Japan and in 
Indonesia.  The solutions are there.  There is no domestic will 
to deal with them.  I can only implore the government to work 
with other countries and pressure those countries to produce 
solutions to deal with their problems.  If they do not, an 
economic tsunami will come across the Pacific and hit Canadians 
harder than anything before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the government on listening, in 
part, to the Reform Party in getting the budget balanced. 
However, the government is once again pulling wool over the eyes 
of the Canadian public.  It is saying it is giving something to 
Canadians when it is not.  It is using this budget as a 
leadership budget.  It is trying to seduce Canadians so it will 
vote for this government in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have done the right thing.  It should have 
listened to sound economic advice, which I know the finance 
minister is open to.  He should do the right thing and provide 
targeted spending for things like education and health care, for 
which there was no spending provided in this budget, contrary to 
what the government says.  One of the great fallacies of this 
budget is that the government says it is putting money into 
health care.  The cold hard fact is that there is not one red 
cent going into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has merely juggled the books and given the public 
an illusion.  There is a serious problem in health care. Patients 
are not receiving essential care in emergency departments and 
hospitals all across the country.  People are suffering and dying 
on waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the health minister to get together with the finance 
minister and the Prime Minister to make a concerted effort to 
invest some of the funds they are sitting on now in health care, 
reduce taxes and provide Canadians with the real opportunities 
they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
never in my life seen so much confusion from a party which is 
really in total disarray.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, two days ago the party's finance critic stood up to 
say that a Reform government would give across the board tax 
relief, regardless of the level of income. In other words, 
someone who makes $500,000 a year would get the same tax break as 
someone who makes $25,000 a year.  Across the board tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the party's health critic stood up to say that the 
government should spend more money on health care.  Then another 
member just before him stood up to say the government has to give 
more tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not yet declared victory.  We still have a debt which is 
close to $600 billion.  We have to take the balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member justify his party giving across the board tax 
relief to the rich as well as to the poor on an equal footing 
while reducing the debt and keeping the deficit under control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure 
to talk about Liberal confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding health care, the Prime Minister this morning said 
there is no problem with health care. Yet the health minister is 
afraid to take his own child into the emergency department. He is 
afraid the resources are not there to provide access to his child 
when his child is sick. It is confusion when the health minister 
and the Prime Minister cannot agree that we even have a problem 
in health care.  I can say as a physician we have a serious 
problem in health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's question, if— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  You will not get a 
chance to answer that question because the hon. member for Quebec 
is about to ask a question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague seems to be wondering what planet the opposition parties 
are living on.  As for me, I wonder what planet the Liberal 
government is living on to bring down a budget such as the one the 
finance minister brought down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a piecemeal approach.  They are not addressing 
the real problem of poverty, as the government wished.  They go on 
about wanting to reduce poverty in Canada, but I do not think this 
sort of budget will do it.  They are not addressing the real 
problems.  They are spending money all over the place without any 
real strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, they cut the Canada social transfer by $42 
billion. 
At present, they are boasting about wanting to attack an area of 
provincial jurisdiction, the Canada social transfer.  In health and 
education, the Canada social transfer will receive a mere $2.5 
billion, after $10 billion has been cut from education alone.  In 
order to really address the problem of education in Quebec, Quebec 
and the other provinces should get the Canada social transfer back, 
so that they may develop true education strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are calling for, therefore, is to return the funds in 
the Canada social transfer so that true strategies may be 
developed.  In Quebec, what are those true strategies?  To address 
the problem of school dropouts and to restore funding to 
educational institutions so that they may be in good financial 
health and able to provide students with a proper education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to have seen real employment insurance 
legislation, with lower contributions and more people eligible.  So 
the millennium scholarships, employment insurance, a real 
employment strategy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry, but the time 
for questions and comments is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short response.  I am sorry, but we will not get the NDP in in 
this round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Bloc member wanted to 
know what world we are on. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to tell him that our world is a federalist one, a world 
in favour of national unity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also hope the member would like to join us as a fellow 
Canadian in trying to decrease the EI premiums.  That is what the 
government should be doing and is something the Reform Party has 
been pushing for for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government decreased EI premiums, it could be one of the 
greatest gifts the government could give to the private sector. 
The finance minister recognized this as being the primary 
motivating force in the country in creating jobs and giving it 
the ability to create jobs and opportunities for Canadians to get 
gainful employment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak in support of the budget 
tabled by the Minister of Finance on Tuesday, February 24.  The 
Minister of Finance with the support of the Prime Minister and 
the sacrifice of all Canadians accomplished something that no 
minister of finance has been able to do for 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only would I like to congratulate the Minister of Finance 
for his historic accomplishment, but I would also like to thank 
him for giving me a birthday present I will remember for many 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember during the 1993 campaign we promised to reduce the 
deficit of $42 billion to 3% of our GDP by the end of our first 
mandate.  We did better than that.  We got rid of it completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many tough decisions had to be made to eliminate the enormous 
deficit we inherited from the Conservative government in 1993. 
This Liberal government did not take the slash and burn approach 
advocated by the Reform Party.  We acted responsibly, and with 
the help of all Canadians, we were able to succeed.  This is 
something all Canadians should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter this new balanced budget era, we will continue to 
act responsibly when it comes to this nation's finances.  We will 
be as cautious with any surplus as we were with the deficit. That 
means targeted spending in areas of concern to all Canadians, 
such as health care and education, debt reduction, and tax relief 
to those who most need it.  That also means we will not do 
everything that everyone wants us to do in this first budget of 
our second mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this budget succeeds in striking a balance between 
social spending, tax cuts and debt reduction, just as we promised 
during the 1997 election campaign.  That is why we are providing 
$7 billion in targeted tax relief over the next three years, 
including the elimination of the 3% general surtax on those 
earning up to $50,000 and an increase in the basic personal 
exemption for low and middle income Canadians.  These two 
measures will completely remove 400,000 Canadians from the tax 
rolls and reduce the taxes for 14 million Canadians by 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a budget for Canada's families.  This is the budget for 
all Canadians who made sacrifices during our four year battle 
against the deficit.  Working Canadians with children will 
benefit from an increased child care deduction of $7,000 for 
children up to seven years of age, up from the previous $5,000, 
and $4,000 for children between seven and sixteen years of age, 
up from $3,000.  These measures will benefit some 65,000 Canadian 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians faced with caring for elderly or disabled family 
members will benefit from a new caregiver credit that will reduce 
the federal tax by up to $400.  This new measure will affect some 
450,000 caregivers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower income families with children will receive extra 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that knowledge and skills are the key 
to jobs.  That is why education is a key element of this budget. 
Lower income individuals with children or other dependants who 
would like to upgrade their education will be eligible for the 
Canada study grant of up to $3,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of January 1, 1998 this government is providing a grant of 
20% on the first $2,000 of annual contributions made to a 
registered education savings plan for beneficiaries up to the age 
of 18.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new program, the Canada education savings grant, will help 
families save for their children's education.  A family 
contribution of $25 to the RESP every two weeks for 15 years 
would provide one child with $4,700 for each year of a four year 
post-secondary education.  That means a case of beer per week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in the year 2000, the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation will also give up to $3,000 per year to approximately 
100,000 students wishing to pursue post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures announced under this program will reduce the debt 
load that many students can expect to incur by approximately 
half.  Once out of school, Canadians with student loans will see 
tax relief for interest payments on those loans.  All students 
will be given a 17% tax credit for interest payments on their 
student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also encourages employers to hire young Canadians. 
We are offering an EI premium holiday.  Employers will pay no 
employment insurance premiums for new jobs created in 1999 and 
2000 for persons 18 to 24 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is also making a significant investment in 
health.  An additional $7 billion over six years will be given to 
the provinces under the Canada health and social transfer.  This 
means that the CHST will grow an average of 2.5% over the six 
year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government also increased its contribution to the 
establishment of a new blood agency by $60 million to renew 
Canada's blood system.  An investment of $211 million over five 
years was also committed to the renewal of the national HIV/AIDS 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to promote advanced medical research and graduate 
study, the Medical Research Council of Canada will receive a 
major increase in funding.  The MRC will receive an additional 
$134 million for university based medical research.  I believe 
some companies in my riding that are working closely with the 
universities will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has not forgotten about the enormous debt burden 
facing this nation.  So far this year, the government has paid 
down almost $13 billion in market debt.  The debt repayment plan 
based on three key elements has been put in place.  Those 
elements include: a two year fiscal plan based on prudent 
economic planning assumptions; a contingency reserve of $3 
billion each year; and the use of the contingency reserve to pay 
down the public debt each year when it is not needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this type of fiscal planning which helped to eliminate the 
deficit.  I am confident that the same strategy will be 
successful in eliminating the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the federal election campaign we committed to spending 
50% of any fiscal dividend on social and economic priorities and 
the other 50% on a combination of tax relief and debt reduction. 
The impact of this budget over the next three years is a 40% 
investment in social and economic priorities and 60% on tax 
relief and debt reduction.  Over the course of our mandate we 
will have to address this slight imbalance to ensure that we keep 
our commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget before this House is a good budget.  It is a good 
budget because it is the first balanced budget in 30 years.  It 
is a good budget because it paves the way for balanced budgets 
into the next century.  It is a good budget because it strikes a 
balance between tax relief, debt reduction and spending on 
valuable programs for children, families and those less 
fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget shows a commitment on the part of this Liberal 
government to invest in the future of all Canadians.  I 
congratulate the Minister of Finance for his efforts.

unfortunately, my honourable colleague from Cambridge is out of 
touch with reality.  Unfortunately for him, he does not have 
contact with the men and women in the street.  He does not have 
contact with the middle-class workers in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says this is the first budget without a deficit in 30 
years. I would like to remind him that all but nine of those years 
had Liberal ministers of finance, one of whom was the present Prime 
Minister. That is when the country experienced the highest interest 
and inflation rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cambridge was trying hard to tell us earlier 
about the treats the government will be giving out, but he forgot 
that employment insurance has a surplus of $12 billion right now. 
Why not lower the contributions of our poor workers?  Oh, no.  We 
certainly cannot touch that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I had a call from a representative of the AFEAS

once again.  But the hon. member did not mention that.

I say he is cut off from reality—and I shall end on this—we

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that he is completely wrong.  Not only did I 
rub shoulders with ordinary people, I worked in a factory 
plant on the floor with average Canadians and I contributed to EI 
funds.  There were times when I did collect for a short time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member that this government has 
reduced EI premiums three times already.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I come 
here to praise the finance minister, not to bury him.  For was it 
not the finance minister who failed to mention crime?  Indeed it 
was.  For was it not the finance minister who was able to ignore 
the unemployed? Indeed it was.  For was it not the finance 
minister who cut the transfers to the provinces for health and 
education?  Indeed it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was all despite protests. What courage this man has.  It 
was despite the protests for those who have suffered crimes and 
wanted to see restitution done and he was able to weather their 
storm and say, “No.  I will not heed your concerns”.  He was 
able to weather the plight of the unemployed and despite the fact 
that were promised jobs, jobs, jobs, he said, “That doesn't 
matter.  Unemployment will remain high”.  He said to those who 
took up the commitment that the federal government made on health 
care that we will pass on the buck to the provinces and not live 
up to our commitments.

him.

Instead of closing hospitals in the health system since we came

health system, $12.5 billion, the same amount as before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member from the Reform Party what their excuse is

<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it interesting to hear the Reform Party quoting 
Shakespeare.  I would have expected Homer Simpson instead.  In 
any event, we will get to that a little later in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that I and I think Canadians find most 
interesting is the cries of indignation only come in this place. 
Take any of the journals of the fifth estate, take any of the 
headlines, just pick the newspaper, and it is really quite 
remarkable how this budget has been received.  You ask yourself 
why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the most telling thing that our finance minister said in 
his speech was not only is this a balanced budget, but it is a 
budget with balance.  The opposition parties are wrestling with 
what to do and say about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues said to me before the budget that you will 
know that this is a successful budget if everything you hear is 
we didn't do enough.  Go through it.  We can take the 
Conservatives who would say in their program that they would grab 
a 10% income tax cut right across the line.  It does not matter, 
as one of my colleagues said earlier.  If you make $500,000 you 
will get a 10% cut, if you make $25,000 you will get a 10% cut. 
They would say that we did not do enough in the area of tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the document we see that the amount of income that low 
income Canadians can receive on a tax free basis will be 
increased by $500.  That does not sound like a lot of money, but 
if you are a low income Canadian, that can make the difference 
between feeding your kids the way you want to and struggling and 
having to go to a food bank.  In fact, it relieves 400,000 
Canadians from paying any income tax at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we do enough?  Is there a person in this House who would not 
rather stand here and say we would like to give them $1,000 
instead of $500 in tax free allowances and tax free earnings?  Of 
course we would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you look at the balance and the responsibility of the 
government governing for all Canadians, we believe that it is a 
good first step for low income Canadians who at least put some 
money back in their pocket which gives them a chance to get 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3% general surtax was a gift from Brian Mulroney to the 
Canadian people.  We eliminated it.  Clearly, 13 million 
taxpayers with incomes up to about $50,000 will no longer have to 
pay that.  Would we have liked to have done more?  Yes.  Would we 
have liked to increase that ceiling?  Obviously we would have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, when we look at the balance requirements, we can 
only do so much in this budget and still maintain that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear talk about managing student debt.  The NDP would say we 
did not do enough. Once again there is that premise.  It is a 
good budget we hear, but they did not do enough.  The New 
Democrats, of course, would like to eliminate any requirement for 
a student to pay anything for post-secondary education.  They are 
open and honest about that.  We do not believe that is good 
balance. 
We do not believe that the Canadian taxpayer can afford that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we done?  We have provided tax relief for interest on 
all students loans.  We would have liked to have done more, but 
we have to be reasonable.  We have provided interest relief and 
extended it to more graduates.  We have provided an extended 
repayment period for those who need it.  However they have to 
demonstrate that they need it.  There is nothing wrong with that. 
If they need the help, this government is prepared to provide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be an extended interest relief period for individuals 
who remain in financial difficulty.  There is no point in forcing 
our graduates to struggle with a huge debt.  We want to be able 
to help them.  We have committed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have even said that we will reduce the loan principal amount 
for individuals who face severe financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard people say that we have not done enough to help 
people upgrade their skills.  One of the things that I see in my 
riding, when I look at the demographics of Mississauga West, is 
that a lot of people have made career changes.  A lot of people 
in my riding are looking for a way to improve their skills and 
increase their training.  They are entering a whole new way of 
life.  It could be in the software or hardware industry of 
computers.  It could be in some form of communications 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very difficult.  These people may be 45 years old.  They 
have been working for 20 years, since they left school.  They 
have managed to build up some retirement savings, but their 
company has downsized.  We all realize what that means.  Not only 
do governments downsize; the corporate world has been feeling the 
pain for the last decade.  We understand that.  The translation 
is that when the corporate world adjusts, it usually hits the 
human resource element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be a 45 year old man who has RRSPs.  Up until now he 
has not been able to touch the RRSPs to spend the money on his 
improvement without paying taxes.  We are providing a system 
whereby tax-free withdrawals can be made from retirement savings 
plans for lifelong learning.  That will begin on January 1, 1999. 
Canadians will be able to make tax-free withdrawals from their 
RRSPs for lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again that is a balance.  It says to the Canadian people 
“We have to be creative.  We have to find new ways to use the 
resources which you have put aside”.  Let us face it, a 
retirement savings plan is a tax haven for future retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a repayment plan tied to that, and so there should be. 
Ten years or 20 years down the road when that 45 year old turns 
65 and is ready to retire, they will have had an additional 20 
years of earning.  However we do not want them to be without 
RRSPs.  They must pay them back or they will become taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it is fair.  It is a reasonable approach and Canadians 
understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about tax reductions.  In my constituency there are 
an awful lot of people who still have young children either in 
elementary school or in high school.  We are providing the Canada 
education savings grant.  The phrase which is used in this 
document is that it is a new reason to save.  It is a clear 
incentive.  It is built with balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a family contributes $25 to a retirement 
education savings plan every two weeks for their child's 
education, a total of $650 a year, they will receive a grant in 
addition to that from the government of $130.  That is 20%.  On 
20 cents out of every dollar they will get an additional grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the family has three kids, or the proverbial 2.2 kids, and it 
makes those contributions for each kid, it will amount to a 
substantial amount of money to help a young person go to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that family contributes $25 every two weeks, over 15 years, 
assuming a 5% return on the investment, which I think is a 
prudent assumption, that child will wind up with $4,700 for each 
of the four years they will spend in higher education.

government simply blindly defending it.  This budget is about 
young people.  It is about people like Nicky, Harris and Dell, 
nine and ten year olds in Mississauga who are starting out in 
life.  It is about young David Bond, with his wife and two babies 
at home, working as a chef in Mississauga and what the future 
means for him.  It is about health care and education.  In fact, 
80% of the budget goes to those two items directly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the rather partisan remarks by my colleague for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For at least 35 years now, I have been following budget 
presentations, and the Liberals have been in power a good 15 years 
of that time.  I have never before seen a Liberal member rise and 
say that his Minister of Finance was totally wrong, that a mistake 
had been made.  Definitely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the first year the current 
Prime Minister was Minister of Finance, he got us into debt, debt 
that accumulated over 28 years. 
I do not understand the hon. member's thought process. How can 35 years 
worth of good result in something bad, like the current $583 billion 
accumulated debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not really my main concern. The Minister of Finance 
brags about curbing his deficit. But on whose backs did he do that? 
There are 500,000 people living in poverty in Montreal. Just this 
morning, the headline in the paper read “Young mother of four has 
problem with leaky roof”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this young woman with four children expected to set up a 
registered school savings plan for her children? They will probably die 
of hunger before they reach high school. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I fully acknowledge that 
we have only begun down the road to solve some of the financial 
problems the member talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have identified $7 billion in tax relief for low and middle 
income Canadians.  Does that satisfy everyone's needs?  Of course 
it does not.  We have increased the child tax credit.  I had a 
call from a constituent who told me his wife stayed home with the 
kids 10 years ago and now the government is just giving the money 
away for people to do that.  I told him that this was for the 
benefit of all Canadians.  I told him that he may not directly 
benefit but that his kids would benefit and his kids' kids would 
benefit.  That is the principle we are attempting to put in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing in this budget, which our Prime 
Minister has said and our Minister of Finance has said, is that 
never again will this country go down the road to the kind of 
deficit finance spending I admit we have seen in this place for 
far too long.  The budget is balanced and it is a balanced budget 
that will indeed set us on the road to a strong financial future 
for all of Canada.

Speaker, the hon. member mentioned headlines and that we should 
be reading headlines.  The president of the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce said he thinks the focus of the budget is misdirected. 
The hon. member talks about the opposition hammering the 
government.  It is the government that is hammering the Canadian 
taxpayer.  That is what is happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is that young people can benefit from a $583 billion debt? 
He talks about young people's future and it his government and 
past governments that have created a major problem which is not 
even addressed in the budget and that is debt repayment and 
substantial tax reduction.  How is that he can claim that the 
government is going to take care of young people with massive 
increases in CPP contributions and a huge debt looming with no 
signs of relief in that area?

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, there was a headline in one of the 
newspapers, “Big business bashes budget”.  Okay, I will accept 
that criticism.  It is the people who work for those big 
businesses, though, who are going to benefit from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  There is a debt reduction plan.  We have 
already retired $13 billion in marketable debt.  That is done, 
off the books, gone.  We also have a debt repayment plan with a 
two year fiscal plan based on prudent economic planning 
assumptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking the $3 billion contingency fund which, over the 
last three years, was used to eliminate part of the $42 billion 
in deficit we inherited from the Conservatives.  It will go to 
debt reduction.  That is $9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally misleading to say that we are not attacking the 
debt.  We would like to do more, but we have to maintain a 
balance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. 
member for Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 24, the first budget of this Liberal government's 
second mandate was delivered to Canada and Quebec. Not surprisingly, the 
maple leaf theme was omnipresent. The Liberals' masquerade is over. The 
true face of the Liberal government, the Prime Minister and his finance 
minister has been revealed to the people of Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois had been dreading since the Speech from the 
Throne, that is, an unprecedented invasion of provincial jurisdictions, 
has now become a sad reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec and the other Canadian provinces, the finance minister's 
words had a bitter flavour. The provinces have realized that, once 
again, they will have to pay a high price for the Liberal government's 
visibility, while the federal government completely ignores their 
demands to restore the transfer payments the Liberals have been 
systematically cutting back since they were re-elected in the fall of 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about the government's position on the employment 
insurance issue? Where is its commitment to agriculture? The budget does 
not contain a single line on this industry which is vitally important to 
Quebec and my region in particular. Not to mention the war of flags that 
will be fought on the backs of Quebec students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These remarks accurately reflect the comments made by the 
stakeholders in my riding of Lotbinière. On Tuesday, these people met in 
my Laurier-Station office and, after seeing the finance minister's 
fiscal plan, they concluded this was “a Canadian Liberal budget devised 
by a centralizing government that is gradually squeezing the 
provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote some of the comments made by socio-economic 
stakeholders in my riding: “Why does the federal government want to 
create a fund that will directly compete with Quebec's student loans and 
grants program?” “Where are the job creation initiatives?” “What will 
the Minister of Finance do with the employment insurance 
surpluses?” 
“Not a word on agriculture; it sure tells you what the federal 
government thinks of this sector.” “Independent workers are not just 
concerned about their dental plans; it is not enough, it is a 
joke.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation. 
Once again, we can see, upon reading the budget, that the Minister of 
Finance is contradicting himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech he said “Education is a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction. It is the provinces that are responsible for the 
curriculum, for educational institutions, for quality”. But the 
minister's respect for provinces, for Quebec, stops there. How the 
Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation will operate will be defined 
without consulting the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was clear on this. He said “Once established, the 
Foundation will consult”. The foundation, which will be administered 
through a cumbersome, costly and complex structure, will make life 
difficult for Quebec students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, along with certain provinces, is doing the 
groundwork for the establishment of a true federal education department. 
This government, which cares so much about the Canadian Constitution, 
which is even prepared to go before the Supreme Court, cannot even 
respect its own Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, which is looking more and more unitary, is 
acting unilaterally.  In actual fact, this budget is the second 
phase of the Canadian flag operation, a Plan B attempt to charm 
young people, a strictly election-minded strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's budget ignores the provinces, who 
wanted the Liberal government to be fair, and to use its surpluses 
to give them back what it cut in transfer payments.  But the 
government takes no notice of what the provinces are up against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to share another reaction from one of my 
constituents:  “I would like to see the look on the faces of those 
waiting in hospital corridors when they hear that the federal 
government is not returning one red cent to the health sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to give back to the provinces the billions of 
dollars it has taken from them in recent years, the federal 
government is giving a signal that health is not a budget priority. 
Although the Minister of Finance used the phrase “equality of 
opportunity” in his budget, it is a budget full of financial 
inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at EI, specifically at surpluses in the EI 
fund which, at the rate things are going, will stand at $30 billion 
by the year 2000.  That is the finance minister's big cash cow for 
paying down his deficit. 
Employers and unions throughout Canada called for substantial 
reductions in EI premium rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, workers were shocked to hear the Minister of 
Finance boast that the unemployment rate had gone from 11.2% in 
1993 to under 9% in 1997.  These victims of the new system were 
excluded from EI because of restrictive eligibility rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the scenario for Quebeckers, for our young 
people, for our sick people, for our seniors, as written by the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, with the help of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, is a sting aimed at our 
entire society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform you that, unlike the multiple 
Oscar-winning 1970s Hollywood movie “The Sting”, the Canadian 
version of that movie currently running in the federal 
parliamentary theatre is not winning any awards, with the 
exception of an Oscar for best predator to the Prime Minister and 
best imposter to the Minister of Finance.

make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly within the budget, as has been stated over and over 
again, with respect to provincial jurisdiction, curriculum, 
buildings, schools, books are the jurisdiction of the provinces. 
The millennium fund certainly respects that. The federal role in 
helping people gain access with financial assistance has always 
been a shared jurisdiction. The millennium fund continues to 
respect that jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am not one bit surprised that the Bloc and the PQ are 
attacking the fund, because they know this is the single most 
important way to help students gain access to educational 
institutions.  The Bloc and the PQ are in fact afraid of the 
positive effect on people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the member attacking the millennium fund? Is it because 
he is afraid that the positive effect on people is not coming 
from the separatist government in Quebec? Is that why he is 
attacking the fund? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, all that the Bloc Quebecois 
MPs do is defend the interests of Quebec.  Our mandate is a serious 
one.  We defend the interests of Quebec. We defend the interests of 
Quebec as defined in an agreement signed in 1964 between Jean 
Lesage and Lester B. Pearson, a respectable Prime Minister who had 
the interests of Quebec at heart at that time and knew that giving 
the responsibility for education and the student loan and bursary 
program to the provinces would ensure that the system would work 
profitably and efficiently for Quebec students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your present Prime Minister would do well to reread the words 
of Lester B. Pearson from that time, in order to see what a 
Canadian Prime Minister used to be like.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
three years ago, the Minister of Finance cut the subsidy to 
Canadian dairy farmers by $5.12 per hectolitre to zero over five 
years.  Cuts have been made for two years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, his fifth report to the House of Commons as Finance 
Minister says nothing about agriculture. Since he will, we believe, 
generate between $8 and $12 billion in the 1998-99 budget, he could 
perhaps have eased off a bit on the dairy farmers because it is a 
known fact that cheese has gone up by 40 cents a kilo since he 
became Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my distinguished colleague from Lotbinière 
whether he does not think this would be a good thing for the 
numerous dairy farmers in his riding, since it would increase the 
consumption of industrial milk products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I note the question put by 
my colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic.  Not only did the Minister 
of Finance do nothing for agriculture, he did nothing for SMBs.  It 
is as if six rural ridings like our own were wiped off the Liberal 
government's list of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But things are coming to a conclusion.  When Quebec is 
sovereign and a country, it will look after the real interests of 
Quebeckers, and I am sure that agriculture and the future of SMBs 
will be among the priorities of its government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond today to the Minister of Finance's budget 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might be tempted to congratulate the minister on his 
balanced budget, but I have at least two good reasons for not doing 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the public has made heavy sacrifices over the past four 
years at least to enable the minister to balance his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have faced huge cuts to health, education and social 
assistance.  Workers and the unemployed had their employment 
insurance benefits cut or no longer received them because certain 
eligibility criteria were tightened.  All these sacrifices created 
a surplus of billions of dollars in the employment insurance fund, 
which was used in the fight against the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with a balanced budget in hand, the minister is hiding 
budget surpluses and preparing a new series of federal expenditures 
instead of going after pressing objectives such as job creation, 
the fight against poverty and a reorganization of the social 
programs they dismantled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now a word about the budget itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about his strategy for equal opportunity, 
but he seems to forget that, for the past half century, one of the 
aims of the government has been to redistribute wealth through 
social programs.  He seems to have abdicated this role and to 
consider unemployment and the rise in poverty to be spectator 
sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister neglected in his budget to point out the cuts of 
$30 billion still to come in the next few years.

praiseworthy— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Although in the 
House there are no words in themselves which are unparliamentary, 
unfortunately it is also equally true that our flag and the 
waving of our flag are similarly not unparliamentary.  It is the 
fashion in which words are used or a flag would be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of the Chair at this time the use of the flag is 
inappropriate, so I would ask that you be kind enough to put the 
flags back in your desks, and we will resume debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> His $450 million child tax credit in 
1999 and 2000 is praiseworthy, but insufficient to meet the needs 
of the 1.4 million poor children in the country and the 5 million 
Canadians living below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely disappointing to see that the government is 
presenting no job creation measures whatsoever and is continuing to 
pocket the employment insurance surplus, which will hit $30 billion 
by the year 2000.  Instead of using the contributions as a tax in 
disguise, the government could have stimulated job creation by 
reducing workers' and employers' contributions or by using the 
surplus for job creation projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main initiative of this budget is the creation of the 
famous millennium scholarships at a cost of $2.5 billion. 
Those 100,000 scholarships will be handed out only in the year 
2000.  It is curious to see the government's sudden interest in 
education, when we know that it will have cut over $10 billion in 
that sector between 1993 and 2003, $3 billion of that in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, which has thus contributed to weakening the 
education system, to tuition fee hikes, to the increased debt load 
of a generation of students, wants to come off as a benefactor and, 
as the Prime Minister has admitted, to gain visibility by handing 
out the flag-emblazoned cheques itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre: </B> That is all right.

individuals to be quiet so that I may finish speaking? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure all hon. 
members wish to extend courtesies one to another.  In the course 
of debate there are sometimes a few words thrown back and forth, 
but please let us just get on with the debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Furthermore, this is an unprecedented 
encroachment on a provincial jurisdiction, where Quebec has had the 
right to opt out, with compensation, since 1964. This encroachment by 
the federal government is especially unjustified since Quebec has its 
own student financial assistance program, and one which works just fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Quebec provides assistance to 170,000 students each year. 
In Quebec, tuition fees are approximately $1,700 a year and the average 
student debt is $11,000. Elsewhere in Canada, tuition fees are about 
$3,200 a year and the average student debt as high as $25,000. If the 
federal government is serious about supporting education, it should give 
this money back to the provinces to help them improve their current 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to research and development, the government announced 
that the funding for granting councils will be reduced to its 1994 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that, at that time, in 1994, we were 
already behind and Canada was spending half as much as the average OECD 
country. In building for the 21st century, this is an area where the 
federal government should invest more, if our student are to benefit 
from the expertise of faculty members engaged in research and modern 
research facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax cuts announced by the government are welcome while they 
remain minimal, amounting to something between $100 and $250 depending 
on income.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, while it is giving $7 billion back to taxpayers over three 
years, the government will take an additional $10 billion from 
taxpayers because the tax tables are not indexed.  Where exactly do 
taxpayers come out ahead? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is still refusing to totally reform taxes to 
lighten the burden on the middle classes and SMBs and to put an end 
to tax loopholes.  While taxpayers pay heavy taxes, companies enjoy 
many tax shelters and strategies permitting them to put off paying 
their taxes for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28, introduced by the Minister of Finance, will allow 
foreign-based shipping companies to evade Canadian taxes.  Family 
trusts continue to deprive the tax system of millions of dollars, 
thanks to the complicity of the Department of Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced nothing for francophone and Acadian 
communities.  This indicates a total lack of political will, 
obvious in any case in the latest census where Statistics Canada 
has created a Canadian/Canadien status devoid of any reference to 
ethno-linguistic origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This political decision keeps three million people of 
francophone origin out of the statistics and prevents researchers 
from studying the phenomena of assimilation and the socio-economic 
problems of the francophone communities in the country. 
In denying there is any problem, the government justifies its 
inaction in the areas of access to education, health care, 
government services and cultural growth in francophone communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the need for French language resources is desperate, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage is cutting $22 million from official 
languages instruction programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cultural terms, this budget offers nothing new.  It 
contains four initiatives that had already been announced: the 
continuation of the Canadian television and cable production fund, 
the restoration of the Canada Council's level of funding, a program 
to help the publishing industry and increased funding for amateur 
sport.  The government also announced, without any details, a 
program to provide help for the insurance costs of travelling 
exhibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support these spending initiatives, but they are totally 
inadequate, since they give back just a fraction of the money cut in the 
cultural sector during the Liberal government's last mandate. Yet, 
spending in this sector greatly promotes job creation. Indeed, studies 
have shown that creating a job in this sector costs only half as much as 
it does in the industrial sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced it will pursue its program to connect 
schools and communities to the Internet. However, it has not proposed 
any funding initiative for multimedia, nor any loan guarantee to create 
a content that would affirm the presence of Canada's francophone and 
anglophone cultures on this network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, this was a commitment made in the second red book, and the 
Information Highway Advisory Council recommended that $50 million be 
invested in such a fund. 
Canada's information highway must not be developed without including 
cultural and educational components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget makes no mention of funding for both networks of the CBC. 
We are led to the conclusion that the cuts scheduled for this year will 
indeed be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is done either for the National Film Board which, following 
cuts of $45 million, had to virtually abandon its assistance to 
independent film making, something which particularly jeopardizes the 
careers of the young film and video makers who represent the future of 
their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is also silent on another issue, namely the promise to 
earmark $10 million for works of art designed to celebrate the new 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the sports and cultural events that may lose their 
tobacco sponsorship, the Quebec government took the lead by pledging to 
hand over part of the increase in tobacco taxes. 
As for the federal government, it has not included any support measure, 
and the Minister of Finance said that tax money is not allocated to any 
specific item. Therefore, we should expect nothing on that score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Heritage will need to find ways of supporting the 
periodicals and scientific and cultural periodicals which are being 
seriously threatened by the reduced postal subsidy and the changes in 
the applicable rules. In this area, there is a particular threat to 
specialized French language periodicals, given their limited market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of these omissions in cultural funding, the Minister of 
Heritage managed to find $20 million for her propaganda agency, the 
Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on, but I will conclude by repeating what many experts 
have said in the last few days, namely that this budget totally lacks 
vision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question for the member for Rimouski—Mitis has to do with the 
allegation that has been made by the member and other members 
from the Bloc Quebecois about the federal incursion into the 
provincial sphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member would I am sure know, our constitution 
provides for a federal spending power in areas where the federal 
government feels that a national priority exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that when we are dealing with training and 
higher education in a global economy, if anything is a national 
priority, that is a national priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is why is it appropriate for the 
Government of Quebec to set up quasi embassies all over the world 
in flagrant disregard for our constitution which provides for a 
federal responsibility in the area of foreign affairs?  Why is 
the member prepared to criticize the federal government in an 
area that is clearly within the federal government's 
responsibility?  Why the double standard there? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a word in both 
our languages that begins with the letter <I>h</I>, followed by a <I>y</I>, which 
I am not allowed to say but which describes very well the behaviour 
of the Liberal government since it has been in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It got elected on a platform and has done absolutely nothing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that everyone knows she 
wanted to say hypocritical, which is unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Verchères, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the member for 
Bourassa has a very poor grasp of French, because my colleague was 
referring to a word containing the letters <I>h</I> and <I>y</I>.  And, to my 
knowledge, hypocrite has an <I>i</I> near the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You do not know how to spell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  You certainly have 
your long-suffering Chair in a bad position here.  The hon. 
member for Rimouski—Mitis, please sum up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government members 
must get one thing straight.  They were elected on a platform and 
they have done absolutely nothing to implement it. They found a 
great platform, the one belonging to the Conservatives, and they 
carried on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They made breathtaking cuts in social programs, including 
post-secondary education, which affects Quebec's CEGEPs and 
universities, and all Canadian universities.  In this sector alone, 
cuts totalled $10 billion, $3 billion of which were in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have seriously weakened the universities.  They have made 
cuts to the granting councils, thus also taking away our research 
dollars.  Now they are congratulating themselves.  What they are 
not saying is that there are $30 billion in cuts still coming. 
With great fanfare they are announcing a fund that will not take 
effect until 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this government's policy to announce things well in 
advance and count on people having poor memories. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood has 60 seconds and there will be a 60-second 
response.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, 60 seconds.  The member for Rimouski—Mitis always 
manages to make sure that she can generate positive controversy 
wherever she is in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. friend has to do with the Canadian Unity 
Information Office.  The member mentioned that she thought that 
the $25 million for the Canadian Unity Information Office was 
simply propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally feel that the budget for the Canadian Unity 
Information Office should be 10 times that because I believe that 
promoting Canada, especially during a time when there is great 
strain on the fabric of the nation, is a useful and important 
thing for the minister of heritage to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member is what other instruments do we have 
in this government to promote national unity?  What other 
instruments would she recommend to promote national unity other 
than the Canadian Unity Information Office? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question, but he is confusing the Unity Office with the 
Information Office.  The Unity Office comes under the 
responsibility of the Prime Minister or the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, while the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
is responsible for propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to answer his question more directly, what is needed in 
this House is for people to show us some respect and stop 
interrupting us all the time.  What is needed is for people to stop 
provoking us with the Canadian flag.  It should be used 
appropriately.  People should be more open-minded and respectful 
toward Quebeckers and toward members in the House, because we were 
elected democratically like everyone else. 
We have a job to do, and if they keep on like this, it will not 
bring about unity, but rather give us one more reason to leave.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will wait until the 
wind goes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to finally see that a balanced budget has 
arrived. Canadians have been adding to the nation's mortgage for 
27 years and now, because of our collective efforts, we are 
actually starting to pay it off and to pay off the debt.  I will 
admit that it will take quite a few years to do this, but at 
least it is a start and we are now out of the blocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I comment on the initiatives contained in this budget, I 
want to briefly point out that we have not forgotten about job 
creation.  In fact, the focus of this budget is on jobs, future 
jobs.  We already have a proven track record of job creation and 
now we want it to continue by increasing access to the knowledge 
and skills required in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last four years, the number of jobs have grown by over 
one million.  From 1997 alone, 372,000 new jobs were created, all 
of them full time and in the private sector.  The unemployment 
rate fell to below 9% in December, and while that is not near a 
satisfactory number, the improving trend is clear and it will 
continue well into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cannot ignore global pressures.  Canada 
is part of a fast changing, competitive, interdependent world 
economy, an economy that is increasingly knowledge based, but 
this is not only because of the new high skill jobs in the high 
tech industries.  There has already been a steady rise of skill 
requirements in all sectors of the economy and in most types of 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know not all Canadians are in a position to access the 
knowledge and skills they will need throughout their lifetime to 
find and to keep good jobs.  Barriers, most often financial 
barriers, reduce access to post-secondary education for many. 
That is why this government has created this education budget. 
This budget is about enhancing the equality of opportunity in 
gaining the knowledge and skills for today and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centrepiece of our increased support is the Canadian 
millennium scholarship foundation.  Through an initial endowment 
of $2.5 million, the arm's length foundation will provide 
scholarships to over 100,000 students each year over 10 years, 
starting in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the most important aspect—and I know this is important 
to all Canadians and indeed to all Prince Edward Islanders—is 
that Canadians of all ages, studying full time or part time in 
publicly funded universities, community colleges, vocational or 
technical institutions and CEGEPs, will be eligible for these 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the foundation will have the authority and the 
discretion to include privately funded institutions.  This has a 
much broader scope than any existing support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition that many students' needs are not fully met by 
scholarships and student loans, the government is also 
introducing Canada study grants.  Beginning in 1998-99, grants 
will go to over 25,000 needy full and and part time students who 
have children or other dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student debt has become a very heavy burden for many Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December federal and provincial first ministers agreed that 
something must be done to reduce the financial burden on 
students. They asked the federal government to take action in 
this budget and it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, all students will get tax relief, a 17% federal credit 
for interest paid on their student loans. Second, we are 
increasing the income threshold used to qualify for interest 
relief on Canada student loans by 9%, making more graduates 
eligible.  Third, we are introducing graduated interest relief 
which will extend assistance to more graduates further up the 
income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, for individuals who have used 30 months of interest 
relief we will ask the lending institutions to extend the loan 
repayment period to 15 years.  Fifth, if after extending the 
repayment period to 15 years a borrower remains in financial 
difficulty, there will be an extended interest relief period. 
Finally, for the minority of graduates who still remain in 
financial difficulties after taking advantage of these measures, 
we will reduce their student loan principal by as much as half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these new interest relief measures will help up to 
100,000 more borrowers and over 12,000 borrowers a year will 
benefit from debt reduction when this measure is fully phased in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians who are already in the workforce want to take 
time away from work to upgrade their skills through full time 
study. We have introduced measures to help them overcome 
financial barriers.  Beginning in January of next year Canadians 
will be able to make tax free withdrawals from their RRSPs for 
lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To preserve the role of the RRSPs in providing retirement 
income, the amounts withdrawn will have to be repaid over a 10 
year period.  In many respects this plan resembles a successful 
homebuyers plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians oftentimes study part time to upgrade their knowledge 
and skills. We are proposing two new measures to help them. 
Beginning this year the education credit will be extended to part 
time students.  This will benefit 250,000 Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for the first time parents studying part time will 
now be able to deduct their child care expenses.  Currently only 
full time students are eligible. This new measure will benefit 
some 50,000 part time students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left> Any long range plan to acquire knowledge and skills for the 
next century must look ahead to the students of tomorrow. The 
best way to help ensure children's future is to save for their 
education today. We want to establish a new partnership to help 
parents save for their children's future. That is why we are 
introducing the Canada education savings grant to make registered 
education savings plans even more attractive. Beginning in 
January we will provide a grant of 20% on the first $2,000 up to 
a maximum annual grant of $400 per child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that this does not take much to save for a 
child's education.  For example, if a family contributes $25 
every two weeks for a total of $650 a year for 15 years, their 
child will have $4,700 available each year for a four year period 
of education.  Of that amount almost $800 a year would be as a 
direct result of a Canada education savings grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunity strategy also addresses the urgent 
problem of youth unemployment. The actions we are taking will 
give young Canadians the job experience they need and provide 
support for those who have dropped out of school and face 
particularly tough challenges.  First, the budget provides—

disturbing to say the least. First, the actual per capita value of 
federal cash transfers for social programs dropped by more than 40% 
between 1993 and 1997. 
Second, access to health care services is becoming increasingly

treatment.

<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the budget figures show that the government had enough 
revenue in 1997-98 to eliminate the deficit, to meet its program 
spending target of $103 billion, and to put $3 billion into its 
contingency reserve, but the government in fact spent $106 
billion and the contingency reserve went to zero with no payment 
on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the finance minister.  Why did the minister 
spend the contingency reserve devoted to new spending after 
promising in three previous budgets that this would not occur? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us be very clear.  The government did not spend the 
contingency reserve.  The government did not spend the 
contingency reserve this year.  The government did not spend the 
contingency reserve last year.  The government did not spend the 
contingency reserve the year before that, nor the year before 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the government was able to bring in the first 
balanced budget in 30 years is that we did not spend the 
contingency reserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's statement does not square with the 
statements in his budget tabled earlier this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His budget shows that higher revenues and lower interest charges 
were enough to eliminate the deficit on its own without touching 
the contingency fund.  Yet the contingency fund disappeared, the 
fund that was to go to the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister answer plainly?  Where did his contingency 
reserve go?  If it did not go to the deficit and did not go to 
the debt, did it not go into new spending? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it went to reducing the deficit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the opposition, various analysts and much of the 
Canadian public disagree with the minister's explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either the minister's communications are wrong or his accounting 
is wrong.  If his accounting is wrong, that is a very serious 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To settle this, will the finance minister agree to ask the 
auditor general to audit the definition of contributions to and 
expenditures from the contingency reserve and report to the House 
when it reconvenes next week? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the Leader of the Opposition has not noticed but 
the auditor general actually does audit the government's books 
and he does report to parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister does not get it.  We want to bring in the 
auditor general now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three billion dollars have gone missing from what is supposed to 
be a debt retirement fund, and the finance minister's 
fingerprints are all over it.  The government's whole debt 
reduction strategy rests on using this fund to pay down our 
staggering national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall the finance minister said the fund “would be used to 
pay down the debt of the federal government”.  He broke his 
word.  Why should we believe he will not do it again? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party has said to bring in the auditor 
general now.  Let me point out to the member that the year is not 
over.  There is still the month of March to go and there are the 
year end adjustments to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Reform Party might allow the year end to finish so 
the auditor general could make his report.  He will make it to 
parliament and once again the Reform Party will have been found 
out not to know how to count.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
us just see how good the finance minister's math is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government budgeted $103 billion.  It had enough revenue to 
cover $103 billion.  The problem is that the government spent 
$106 billion. The entire so-called debt retirement fund has been

education, it is that the first five questions Reformers have

scholarships as income earned by students when awarding Quebec 
loans and scholarships.

will be more imaginative than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, in Quebec City, I mentioned that our government was 
available to sit down with each of the provinces, with the 
Government of Quebec, so that the particular needs of each of our 
societies within the country would be reflected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Quebec's situation with respect to the 
scholarships is special in several respects.  I am perfectly 
prepared to meet with Mrs Marois and I think we will be able to 
arrive at an arrangement ensuring that Quebec students are well 
served by our government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the arrangement is that it withdraw, with fair compensation for the 
Government of Quebec, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the fact of suggesting that the value of millennium 
scholarships be included when calculating Quebec loans and 
scholarships not finally confirm what the minister has always 
refused to admit until now, namely that his millennium scholarships 
create duplication with Quebec?

the hon. member should recall that the very first thing the

provinces and add $7 billion of additional revenue over the next 
four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member can scoff all she wants, but that money is

things we did, when we began to see that the climate was 
improving, was to put $1.5 billion back into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the leader of the Conservative Party to speak to the

“all Tory taxes are odious”.  For once I agree with the Liberal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

detestable and terrible.  I will tell you what is equally bad, a

that the Reform Party would take $10 billion further out of 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one place where that $10 billion will come out of. 
It will come out of equalization.  It will come out of health

those things the middle class in this country deal with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the question was about the GST and the finance minister just 
forgot to answer it.  I will remind him one more time that 
yesterday he said “all Tory taxes are odious”.  That is what he 
said.  I think Canadians probably would agree with him and so he 
probably would want to make some changes in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was about the GST.  I will ask him one more time, not to go

what the Prime Minister had to say about medicare today.  He said 
“I am not going to give any more money to the provinces because 
I don't like the way they spend the money.  They will probably 
spend it on something that isn't for medicare.  In fact, Ontario 
spent the money for tax cuts”.  But at the same time Ontario cut 
taxes, it also gave more money to medicare. Since Ontario can 
walk and chew gum at the same time, why cannot our Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister told Canadians to relax and 
rejoice. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians are waiting for 
health services, 1.4 million are trapped in the unemployment 
line, 17% of our youth are searching for a full time job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the prime minister in waiting also believe these people 
should rejoice and relax?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister was confirming that since this 
government took office unemployment is down by over two and a 
half per cent.  We created some one million jobs.  Inflation is 
gone.  Interest rates are down, providing thousands of dollars in 
the pockets of people buying cars and paying mortgages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister wanted to reassure Canadians, he brought 
out the facts, unlike the hon. member who has overlooked 
completely how this government has helped this economy move ahead 
and how the budget that came out earlier this week will add to 
that progress for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the finance minister says this budget is going to give tax relief 
to middle income Canadians, but private sector economists are 
saying that because of bracket creep, this insidious tax on 
inflation, that the middle class is going to end up paying a 
billion dollars more next year than this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the OECD is calling for the reindexation of the tax system, 
when the finance committee has called for it, when Canadians are 
going to be paying more, not less, because of bracket creep, why 
did this minister not act to take this insidious tax on inflation 
out of our tax system? 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us take a look at what we have done.  In fact, there 
are targeted tax decreases for students, for families, for poor 
families, for caregivers.  Then there are general tax decreases. 
We increased the threshold by $500 for an individual or $1,000 
for a family.  We eliminated the 3% surtax for 13 million 
Canadian taxpayers.

this may come as news to the hon. member, but the health care 
system in Canada was never in greater jeopardy than when her

it threatened to engulf all of our social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every maritime government has spoken out against this except for 
one.  That is the Prime Minister's gofer in Nova Scotia, Premier 
Russell MacLellan.  Will the finance minister commit today to

Nova Scotians have a weak premier they should have a weak health

the social fabric in this country as hard as Russell MacLellan 
has for Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health referred to the Conservative program to 
eliminate cash transfers and go to all the tax points and what 
affect that would have on the ability to preserve the health care

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry

the Minister of Finance for reaching a balanced budget.  This 
allows agencies like FEDNOR to continue their good work in 
northern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budgeting for FEDNOR will continue.  It will assist small

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the books are now balanced, it has not been done without 
considerable pain. What message does the finance minister have 
for the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians?  Can he indicate where 
his job creation plan is and can he advise the House what his 
unemployment target is for this year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the entire budget is in fact directed to creating jobs 
in this country.  Whether it be the youth at risk program of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development which will take care of 
those students who have left high school and who are looking for 
job experience, or whether it be the very real relationship 
between education and job creation, it is the responsibility of a 
government to equip its citizens to succeed.  That is what we 
have done in this budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B> Mr.

expect the unemployment rate to be at the end of this fiscal 
year, or the next fiscal year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

created 372,000 jobs and over a million in the last four years. 
There is no reason why we cannot maintain this momentum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked what our target is.  It is that every

self-employed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a good idea, but what will that mean for those who no

</I></B></P><P align=left>Premiums dropped by 6.6% between 1996 and 1997. Six unemployed 
workers out of ten no longer qualify for benefits. We need action now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Hon. members, I do not know that this is a 
question of privilege.  However it is a vexatious matter for all 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Eglinton—Lawrence is here in the House.  He 
has been mentioned.  Because his name has been mentioned, perhaps 
he could clarify the situation, which he will.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I regret anything I might have said that might have caused such 
vexation.  Obviously anything I did say would have been in jest. 
If it offended the member, I withdraw it and I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We will let the matter rest there.  I will 
go to next question of privilege.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege with regard to a 
published article reported today in the Toronto <I>Star</I> that 
Yves Landry has already been named as the head of the Canadian 
millennium scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Landry reportedly admits to being head of the foundation and 
is quoted as saying “I am only one member of the board and my 
job is to be a facilitator”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no legislation before the House setting up this 
foundation.  Nor has the budget announcement allocating $2.5 
billion in revenue to the foundation been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question of privilege will argue that the minister 
responsible, his department and Mr. Landry are in contempt of 
parliament since they have brought the authority and dignity of 
the House and the Speaker into question.  Members of Parliament 
are elected stewards of the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and its departments are making a habit of mocking 
the parliamentary system in this manner.  This was raised earlier 
this month in the House as a question of privilege by the member 
for Prince George—Peace River regarding the Canadian Wheat 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that question of privilege, the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford summed up the history of similar complaints 
on which I will comment briefly because it demonstrates the need 
for the House to finally take some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Langley—Abbotsford pointed out that the Speaker 
was asked to rule on a similar complaint on March 9, 1990 
regarding a pamphlet put out by the government concerning the 
GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on March 25, 1991 another complaint was launched on a 
similar issue.  The member pointed out that a progressively 
stronger case was made on October 28, 1997 before you, Mr. 
Speaker, by the member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that instance the Department of Finance went much further and 
actually started to take action before the bill authorizing the 
department to act was passed by the House.  The member argued 
that these actions undercut the authority of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to the Speaker's ruling which contained a strong 
statement and a strong warning.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker said on November 6, 1997:  “The Chair acknowledges 
that this matter is a matter of potential importance since it 
touches the role of members as legislators, a role which should 
not be trivialized.  It is from this perspective that”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I appeal to you.  If you want 
to have private conversations, I invite you to go to the lobby. 
I would like to hear this point of privilege and there are a 
number of points of order after that which I also want to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to 
quote what you said on November 6, 1997: “The dismissive view of 
the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery 
of our parliamentary conventions and practices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also pointed out that an earlier warning of the 
Speaker had been ignored, since in the ruling of November 6, 1997 
Mr. Speaker additionally stated: “I trust that today's decision 
at this early stage of the 36th Parliament will not be forgotten 
by the minister and his officials and that the department and 
agencies will be guided by it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 250 of the second edition of Joseph Maingot's 
<I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> states:  “There are 
actions that, while not directly in a physical way obstructing 
the House of Commons or the members, nevertheless obstruct the 
House in the performance of its functions by diminishing the 
respect due it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a situation which mocks Parliament once again and 
diminishes the respect due it.  How relevant can it be when 
arrangements to spend massive amounts of public money proceed 
without so much as a “by your leave” to the elected 
representatives of the people who are paying for it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue this time it goes much further than the previous 
questions of privilege.  This time there is not a single line of 
legislation before this House.  In the case of the CPP board 
there was at least legislation before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times must we put up with this sort of mockery of our 
parliamentary system and disrespect for the Speaker before we 
take action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speaker said on November 6, the dismissive view of the 
legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery of 
our parliamentary conventions and practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that it has been repeated often enough. It is also 
becoming more severe, since in this case we do not even have 
legislation before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 225 of Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I> contempt is described as “an offence against the 
authority or dignity of the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be an alarming trend toward regarding the 
parliamentary process as a mere formality that can be lightly 
cast aside, and the official opposition in this House notices a 
repeated disregard for the proper role of the House being 
established by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Mr. Speaker, we would ask that you bear in mind that 
Canada's parliamentary system of government, combined with its 
tight system of party discipline, confers enormous executive 
power on the Prime Minister.  With a compliant backbench it is a 
very simple thing for the Prime Minister and his ministers to 
disregard this House and subordinate it to his will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason the Speaker bears a special place and 
responsibility in this House to protect the parties with less 
than majority numbers.  In so doing, he ultimately protects the 
privileges of all, government and opposition members alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible, his department and Mr. Landry have 
brought the authority and dignity of this House and the Speaker 
into question.  This is not an isolated case and, in this 
respect, must not go unchallenged.  Accordingly, I ask that you 
rule this matter to be a prima facie question of privilege, at 
which time I will be prepared to move the appropriate motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect, let me first 
indicate to the House that we had initially agreed informally 
that we would try to decrease questions of privilege today to 
allow the third party subamendment to be debated for the full 
day.  Now we are eating up that time, contrary to what had been 
understood. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I want to bring to the attention of the House 
is the fact that the allegation made by the member is incorrect. 
I have in hand the press release from the Prime Minister which I 
am fully prepared to table regarding the invitation sent to Mr. 
Landry, the chairman and CEO of Chrysler, and I will read from 
it:  “The Prime Minister is pleased to announce that Mr. Yves 
Landry, chairman and CEO of Chrysler Corporation, has accepted 
his invitation to chair the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document goes on to describe the programs the millennium 
scholarship foundation will manage, not the programs that are in 
existence now.  Nor does it suggest that this program is already 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, I would like hear what the 
government House leader has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me continue briefly 
describing the document which I am prepared to table, a document 
issued by the Prime Minister. Nowhere does it suggest that any 
funds pursuant to the ways and means motion tabled at 4.30 on 
February 24 will be disbursed prior to any legislation being 
adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing that prevents the Prime Minister from inviting 
anyone to perform a function on behalf of the government. What is 
at stake here is whether there is intention to disburse funds 
contrary to or in the absence of specific legislative measures 
that were permitted. Nothing to that effect exists here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, need I mention to the House citations 980, 981 and 982 
of Beauchesne regarding ways and means motions. A ways and means 
motion was of course duly tabled in this House at 4.30 on 
Tuesday, the 24th day of February. This resolution is there to 
give immediate effect to the possible collection of any taxes 
that would be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document itself has titled in bold “embargo until 1630” 
the exact time the ways and means motion was tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in any case there is no intention to give effect to 
that until such time as the legislation is passed anyway, so all 
of this would be academic even if it were the intention of the 
government to disburse funds right away, which it is not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we heard a moment ago was really just an excuse and not a 
legitimate reason for this point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to challenge any rulings by the Chair in the past, 
but I am concerned that if we let this one go unchallenged we 
will be setting a precedent for future Speakers, which will make 
it more and more difficult for members of this House to insist on 
their privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been brought up twice now in this early Parliament and 
two other times during Mr. Speaker's tenure in the last 
Parliament. All these complaints were legitimate complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to whether these matters constitute a prima facie 
contempt of Parliament, I point out that the last complaint 
brought to your attention by the member for Fraser Valley was 
pretty close to the money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You even recognized this by your comments, Mr. Speaker.  You said 
that if this sort of thing continues it would make a mockery of 
Parliament.  I think this has gone on often enough and has gone 
way beyond mocking Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are with a case more severe than all the others put 
together and it takes place for the second time after your 
warning, Mr. Speaker, of November 6, 1997.  The authority to 
appoint Mr. Landry was based on a statement by a minister of the 
crown.  Based on that statement which, I might add, has not been 
adopted by this House, the head of the foundation has assumed the 
position and has set the style for governing such an institution 
as reflected in his comments to the Toronto <I>Star</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article boldly states: “The foundation will award 
scholarships to low and middle income students, depending on 
financial needs, merit and mobility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is even a quote from the new head of the foundation: “I 
am not looking at this with an agenda”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to break the news to Mr. Landry, but he does not need an 
agenda until he gets a foundation.  He will not get a foundation 
until this House grants one.  I do not blame him for forgetting 
about Parliament because this government and its bureaucrats keep 
forgetting about Parliament from time to time.  If this keeps up, 
we might as well all go down to Mexico and join Senator Thompson 
because our roles will become as irrelevant as the Senate's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge Mr. Speaker to review your own words on these matters. We 
cannot just stand up in this place and bluff any more.  We have 
the authority to act and we should not be afraid to use that 
authority.  All we ask, Mr. Speaker, is that you allow this House 
to decide this matter.  Surely you must find this as offensive as 
we do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to reiterate the important point made by my 
colleague, the government House leader.  This press release does 
not speak of something being in place now.  It talks of the 
future.  It talks about how the millennium scholarship foundation 
“will manage the initial $2.5 billion Government of Canada 
endowment”, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the role of Mr. Landry, on page 2 it states that 
Mr. Landry will chair the foundation's board of directors.  It is 
clear that we are talking about something that has yet to happen. 
It is clear we are talking about something in the future.  The 
whole context of this is that the announcement is subject to the 
will of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to put another point on the record.  Mr. 
Landry has been accused of a breach of the privileges of this 
House.  However, the Reform members who made the accusation have 
not brought forward any proof whatsoever that Mr. Landry 
knowingly breached the privileges of this House if such breaches 
took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Please, colleagues, this is the fourth 
intervention I have made in this short period of time.  We owe it 
to ourselves to listen to the points that we are making.  Surely 
privilege affects the House of Commons and affects all hon. 
members.  I would plead with you to please hear out the 
interveners in this point of privilege.  I would like to hear 
them and I am sure you would too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the <I>Debates</I> of this 
House will show that at least one Reform member of the two who 
spoke mentioned Mr. Landry personally and accused him of 
breaching the privileges of this House.  I this is an unwarranted 
and unproven slur on a very distinguished Canadian. Before this 
House adjourns, the Reform members should not only withdraw their 
point of privilege, they should apologize to Mr. Landry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, not only have Reform Party members made unwarranted 
and unjustified accusations without proof against a distinguished 
Canadian, but in making those accusations they are attempting to 
raise a point of privilege which is not supported by the facts, 
in particular the language of the press release.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about something that had already been mentioned 
in the Speech from the Throne and mentioned again in the budget 
speech, which at the end and the beginning was based on a ways 
and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, Mr. Speaker, that the Reform Party has not provided a 
prima facie case for a point of privilege.  I respectfully invite 
you to totally reject its unwarranted requests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out that what the government is 
doing is, having brought Mr. Landry into this mess, trying to 
hide behind him— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  On the same point of privilege I will go to 
the hon. member for Qu'Appelle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make two brief points.  I support the member who raised the 
point of privilege for the following reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press release that was quoted by the two ministers across 
the way said that the fund will be managed, in terms of the fund 
will be there, and that Mr. Landry will be the chair of that 
particular fund.  What they are doing is anticipating what 
Parliament may or may not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the basic point of the privilege.  They are expecting 
Parliament to rubber stamp a ways and means motion, rubber stamp 
a statement by a cabinet minister.  That is not what Parliament 
is about.  We are the representatives of the people and we make 
that decision.  They cannot anticipate that Parliament will agree 
with their particular bill.  Therefore I think it is a genuine 
point of privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this House either means something or it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why the Prime Minister's office put out a press 
release was to inform Canadians of a fact, that Mr. Landry was 
appointed or accepted the invitation to head the foundation.  As 
a result of that press release the Toronto <I>Star</I> ran an 
article in today's paper.  The headline of that article is 
“Chrysler chief to run scholarships”.  The sub-headline is “No 
bias for high-tech training, Landry says”.  This is the 
information that those who read the Toronto <I>Star</I> are 
receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That assumes that the announcement made by the Minister of 
Finance will in fact become law.  Not only has legislation not 
been presented in this House, we do not know the nature of the 
legislation.  This House might decide, for whatever reason, that 
instead of having a foundation to dispense the millennium fund, 
it might choose another mechanism.  By inviting Mr. Landry to be 
the head of the foundation, they are in effect assuming that this 
Parliament will ratify and endorse whatever the plan is for this 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament, I have not seen the legislation.  I 
do not know how many members will be on this board.  I do not 
know what the provisions are with respect to the head of the 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this action a contempt of this Parliament, it is 
also a contempt of the Senate.  While the Prime Minister and his 
majority might be able to make an assumption that they could in 
effect pass legislation through this House, they cannot assume 
that the Senate down the way will also give its endorsation to 
identical legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, the invitation was premature.  The government 
should recognize that the invitation was premature. If it has any 
confidence in the integrity of this House, that invitation should 
be withdrawn pending the passage of that legislation in this 
House and in the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I intend to take the 
information from both sides into consideration.  The hon. House 
leader has said that he would table this press release.  I would 
like that to be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member over here has an article from the Toronto 
<I>Star</I> and I would like to see that article, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this information into consideration and I will study 
it.  I will come back to the House at an early future date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of the 
news release that named Mr. Landry to this position and I would 
be happy to provide that to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would like that information and I order 
the page to bring it forth to the House. I want to let this point 
of privilege sit until I get back to the House with my decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now going to points of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point of order I will hear comes from the hon. 
member for Roberval. 
<p align=center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POINT OF ORDER 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have eleven 
years of legislative experience, first seven years in the Quebec 
National Assembly and now four here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all those years I, like many others here, have been a 
fighter.  The political arena is here.  This is the place where the 
people speak.  The political game dictates that we face each other 
in accordance with certain rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my political career, I have seen members break those 
rules.  I have seen speakers bring down rulings and they were 
always justified, as their purpose was to enhance the quality of 
debate in the home of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, therefore, with great sorrow that I rise on this point of 
order. Never, in all my years as a parliamentarian, have I seen 
members of this Parliament, the Quebec National Assembly or any 
self-respecting Parliament show such disrespect to the flag of 
their country, using it in a demonstration aimed at causing 
disorder, preventing someone from exercising the right to speak, 
and disregarding the Speaker's orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The lack of respect is on your side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, shut up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be a good idea for 
all of the members of this House to listen, because if this House 
functions smoothly, if it is viable for you there, for them over 
there, and for us—and if anyone has not understood it yet, the 
veterans here can explain it to them—it is because the House 
leaders speak to each other, co-operate with each other, trust each 
other. 
It is because the House leaders, above and beyond differences of 
political opinion, first and foremost respect democratic values, 
the forum for debate Parliament represents, and the rules that 
govern it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always given that co-operation, and am often the one 
who initiates compromises to make things run more smoothly in this 
House.  For instance, this evening we are finishing earlier to 
accommodate colleagues who are not of my political persuasion.  We 
are always pleased to oblige, since democratic debate must be 
carried out in the most correct, most comfortable, most respectful 
way possible.  But that could change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am asking members of this House to listen to my point 
of order, because we can never again let the flag be used to protest or 
to disrupt the proceedings in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Chair issued a ruling prohibiting members from 
using the flag as a tool of protest inside the House of Commons and 
allowed the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis to take the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is fully entitled to rise in this House, like any 
other member of this place. Liberal members will not change that, at 
least as long as I am parliamentary leader on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago, when we arrived here as sovereignists, everyone 
said we would show no respect for the House of Commons. Yet, if 
there is a political party that always listens to the Chair, that 
always co-operates with the Clerks-at-the-Table and with 
parliamentary leaders, it is the Bloc Quebecois. In spite of our 
diverging views, we have always done our work with dignity, by 
defending our ideas, and not by doing stupid and inappropriate 
things like those we have seen today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never will we tolerate again people using the national anthem in 
this House, during Oral Question Priod, to ridicule the proceedings of 
this place, or one of our colleagues, or the national anthem itself. It 
was quite something to see these great Canadians, who boast about the 
flag every day, use it as a mere tool of protest. 
It was quite something to see these great Canadians use the national 
anthem to disrupt the proceedings of the House of Commons. They must 
step aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will tell you this— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, in many of our debates we go not 
only to the heart of the matter but we go to the hearts of one 
another.  I remind all of us here of the following. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members of this House that we are members of Canada's 
Parliament. This means we were all elected by Canadians across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one thing about which there is no doubt. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of Parliament stand in this place, they stand among 
us as equals.  It does not matter what province they come from, 
it does not matter what region they come from.  You have elected 
me to see that you are respected and indeed that you respect 
yourselves and the rules of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a Canadian member of Parliament on his feet.  We are 
going to hear what he has to say.  We do not have to agree with 
it but he is elected like every one of us in this House. 
I am going to hear what my hon. colleague from Roberval has to 
say.  The hon. member for Roberval.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the kind 
of ruling that has earned you the respect of all members and got 
you re-elected as Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Parliament is the last place where people can talk to one 
another. The day Parliament goes silent, the country ceases to exist. 
And so does democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point was, and I will conclude on that: if our co-operation is 
expected in this House, never again will we tolerate that our national 
anthem or flag be used in the middle of question period or any debate to 
prevent a member of the Bloc Quebecois or any other member of this House 
from speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I hope that the media will report to all Quebeckers and 
Canadians the behaviour they witnessed here today, on both sides of the 
House, unfortunately. I hope Canadians will see what happened. I hope 
Quebeckers will as well, as they will think “How arrogant these people 
are. And, just yesterday, they came to Quebec to tell us how much they 
loved us”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, there is a point of order. I do 
not want to get into a debate on wrongs that took place. 
Colleagues, we heard from the hon. member for Roberval.  We are 
parliamentarians of Canada.  We can hear each other.  I will 
listen to all of you.

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am almost tempted to say that it is 
not a bad thing the House is adjourning a day early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the case, I think the Chair should consider whether 
a demonstration in support of a flag or the pretext of one 
contravenes the Standing Orders of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, I do not think this debate will be resolved 
through lengthy discussions on the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a spirit of calm, the House leaders of the parties will 
carry on their tradition, as the member for Roberval said himself, 
of finding some common ground on a number of thorny issues. 
Our behaviour this afternoon in this matter indicates just how 
thorny it is and perhaps for obvious reasons—without going into 
all the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone like myself who believes strongly in the unity of 
his country, flag waving is not provocation, but an act of pride. 
Someone of a different persuasion may see it differently, and I 
accept that.  I find it regrettable, but I accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lengthy debate in the House of Commons will not likely 
resolve the matter, and I propose that we let the matter rest 
awhile and allow our emotions to cool and then let the House 
leaders discuss it further. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that there has been a considerable level of 
co-operation in this Parliament, and I can agree with the hon. 
member for Roberval, on that point at least.  There has indeed 
been considerable co-operation by all of the parliamentary 
leaders, and consequently by all members of this House who have 
placed their confidence in their parliamentary leaders for 
settling contentious issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleagues and the Prime Minister for their trust, 
and I must also thank the hon. members across the floor. 
Generally, when one enters this House as a leader and introduces a 
motion, the members across the way do not even have to hear it to 
know what is being proposed.  They know that if we say in 
introducing it that the others have agreed, that is true, by 
definition. 
Such trust has built up that most of the hon. members no longer 
read it.  They know there was agreement or one of us would not rise 
in the House to claim there was. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have developed that kind of confidence in Mr. Speaker and 
this Parliament.  And I am proud of it, not just for myself 
although I would like to consider that I contributed to it but 
all the House leaders and all members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think if we give it a bit of a rest we can get 
together and find if there is any common ground on establishing 
when a demonstration might or might not be perceived or really as 
being acceptable or not.  We can discuss it at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In either case, I want to again use this occasion perhaps on 
this day with all the questions of privilege and points of order 
to say that there has been that level of confidence. It has 
assisted me.  It has assisted the government.  It has assisted 
the House.  I believe it has also assisted the Chair in 
fulfilling what I think so far is a very good Parliament 
notwithstanding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the constituents, the Canadians of 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, I was elected to serve this House. The 
last time I checked, every member in this House was elected by 
Canadians for Canadians to work in this House, the House of 
Commons of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the House of Commons of another country.  The flag 
is the central emblem of this House of Commons for our country. 
If there is one place where we can sing the national anthem of 
our country, to wave the flag of our country, it is in the heart 
and soul of this country, which is the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any member in this House who does not believe that 
they cannot be a part of Canada or for Canadians or they feel 
uncomfortable with our national anthem or holding our national 
flag in their hand, then they should not be in this House of 
Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last time I checked, the majority of people in Quebec had 
decided to remain within Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask on behalf of the constituents of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, 
on behalf of all Canadians, that we make a statement here today 
that the national anthem of Canada and the flag of Canada always 
be welcome in this House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I truly 
regret that I have to rise in this House today to speak on a matter 
such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not from Quebec.  I am a proud Canadian but I am ashamed 
of what happened today in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House are here for all Canadians.  From what I have 
seen today, however, if we wish to have national unity, if we wish 
Quebec to stay in Canada, it will be done not by provoking 
Quebeckers but by respecting them.  That is one thing that can be 
said.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of my flag.  I have it here in my office, and in my 
New Brunswick riding office.  But our Canadian flag must never be 
made a mockery of.  I feel really discouraged, and my colleague 
from Halifax West feels the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you continue to shout and behave in this way, it indicates 
that you agree— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, with respect to the point 
of order, I think we have a fairly good flavour of what members 
are thinking in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Roberval has raised a point of order.  We 
have had discussions on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What occurred today for all of us, as I mentioned, we are 
Canadian members of Parliament.  Look. The flag is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes in enthusiasm things are done in the House of Commons. 
For example, an hon. member has a particularly incisive question 
and his party or one side of the House will applaud.  A minister 
on the other side will have a particularly good answer and he or 
she will be applauded by other members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what has been brought up here is a point of order which 
contains this question:  Should we at all times not be permitted, 
for example, to sing our national anthem in our House of Commons? 
It would seem to me that could not be acceptable. On the other 
hand, sometimes we use very important icons to convey other 
messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be hard pressed, as a member of Parliament and as your 
Speaker to say that the Canadian flag cannot be displayed in this 
House.  I would be very hard pressed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot look into your hearts.  I do not know what the 
intention was of all hon. members.  It would seem to me that if 
it were a matter of pride that we were doing that, that is one 
thing.  If it were a matter of some hon. members using this 
device to insult or put down someone else, I would say if that 
was the intention, it is not the Canadian way.  It is not our way 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we could disengage for just a little while because 
we have touched on the heart of our country today; we have, as to 
who we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the point of order, I want to reserve my decision for the 
time being. I want to think about it and I hope you do too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a suggestion from the hon. government House leader 
that the House leaders of the different parties come together to 
discuss how these things should be handled— 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Then it is 
not properly represented, Mr. Speaker.  It is a matter for 
Parliament to decide, not some guys in backrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You should have respect for all members of the House, not just 
those represented by political parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member of Parliament for York—South 
Weston is correct in bringing that point out.  I suggested that 
we start with the House leaders as a point of reference and I 
myself will be the representative for the member York—South 
Weston.  He will have a voice through me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Why does he get special treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I mean no disrespect to the 
member for York—South Weston.  Know that, because I would speak 
for him as readily as I would speak for any of you. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few days to consider this point of 
order.  At this time, I would like us to stop talking about this 
point of order.  After consultations, after I have thought it over, 
I will get back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will be able to reach a solution to the events of 
today.  Moving on now from this point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will hear other points of order, starting with the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL COUNCIL MEETING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in light of the passion and emotion that was in the 
last point of order, I do not want to dwell on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been discussing, in the context of this last point of 
order, the House leaders and the integrity of the House leaders. 
On behalf of my party I take great exception to the reference 
that has been made to my personally misleading other House 
leaders at this meeting with respect to the national council 
meeting that will be taking place in Ottawa this weekend.  This 
is a national council meeting that will involve over 500 people 
coming from all parts of the country to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I would like to make is that this item was put on the 
agenda by the government House leader, not by the House leader of 
the Conservative Party.  I would appreciate the support of the 
government House leader in this matter.  I am surprised that he 
did not respond appropriately when he rose in response to the 
Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point to be made here is that this weekend we agreed 
unanimously at the House leaders' meeting that this Friday would 
not be deemed a sitting day of the House.  However, in light of 
the allegation that has been made, I am ready on behalf of my 
party to suggest that we move a motion and sit tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect when the House leaders for the other parties, 
including the House leader of the official opposition, want to 
have their national council meetings that once again they would 
be prepared to put up or shut up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings into question my integrity and the integrity of my 
party.  This was a malicious, politically motivated point of 
order, and it is a new low. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think when the Thursday question was 
asked the other question was piggy-backed on it.  When the 
question was asked and the hon. House leader for the government 
responded to it, I thought we could clear it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the House leaders of the various parties, when they 
get together for these discussions, have to take a lot on good 
faith, and I would hope that would continue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know the discussions that took place on the whole. I 
would hope that there would be no question of the integrity of 
the House leader of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the matter has been dealt with.  As far as I know we 
will not be sitting tomorrow.  I would hope, whatever 
negotiations take place among the House leaders, they will be 
very fruitful ones but, more than that, they have to be carried 
on in an era of trust with one another.  I hope that will 
continue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there was any doubt as to who set the agenda for not 
only the House leaders' meeting, to which the hon. House leader 
for the Conservative Party referred, or for that matter any other 
House leaders' meeting, clearly it was I who placed all the items 
on the agenda other than the ones that are spontaneously added at 
the end of each meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, all the items that are placed on the agenda are 
placed by me and there is no doubt about that. If there is any 
suggestion that it was not I who had placed it on, let that be 
cleared because in fact it was.  That is definitely clarified. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
simply like to respectfully draw your attention, in connection with 
your decision to delay a ruling on the suggestion by the government 
House leader regarding this afternoon's incident, to the fact that 
the Chair made a ruling on a similar incident early this afternoon 
when we called for an end to the interruption of our colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I understand, and I agree with you entirely that the 
question of pride displayed in this House must be given careful 
consideration. But such consideration must examine whether pride 
that may be expressed in this House may go so far as to apply to a 
flag of one of the ten provinces of this great country, as we had 
thought possible when we were elected in 1993. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is a bit off this point of order.  I am 
hoping to put it to rest in just a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for York South—Weston have something to 
add to this point? 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Yes, I do, 
Mr. Speaker.  Some might consider this to be a frivolous matter, 
but a few moments ago you indicated to the House that you would 
be my voice as the only independent member of Parliament with 
respect to the matter that was discussed at a House leaders' 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, Mr. Speaker, you are not present at House 
leaders' meetings.  I know it was not your intent to mislead the 
House or to mislead Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand the workings of the House leaders, the leaders 
of each of the respective political parties get together, not in 
public but behind closed doors, to make decisions that impact on 
all members of Parliament in the House, members in their own 
political party including the member for York South—Weston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, Mr. Speaker, you seek unanimous consent in order to 
implement the decisions of the House leaders, decisions that I 
have not participated in, decisions that you have not 
participated in, and I am expected to expedite the workings of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply wish you to clarify, Mr. Speaker, that you are not my 
voice at House leaders' meetings, that you do not participate at 
House leaders' meetings— 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I clarify it and I say it publicly.  I 
was not at the House leaders' meetings, but when it comes for the 
House to act like we did today during question period I 
recognized you as a participant in the House with a question and 
a subsequent question, as is my duty in certain circumstances to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That I was at the House leaders' meetings, no, but for the most 
part I do know what is happening in the House of Commons and for 
that part I will see to it that not only your rights and 
privileges are protected but that the rights and privileges of 
all parliamentarians are respected in this House.

impossible.

the impression that has been left with the House by the 
intervention of the House leader of the Reform Party is that we 
as a party are not willing or do not wish to sit tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that you put the motion to the House for unanimous 
consent for us to sit tomorrow.  We are ready, willing and able

saying that I am very pleased with the budget presented here on 
Tuesday.  I know that the people of Canada will be very pleased 
with it and that the government has done many things Canadians 
have been seeking for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my short time here, getting on to 10 years, this has been a 
budget that I was glad to follow and to wait for.  I knew it 
would be a budget that would satisfy many Canadians.  As a person 
from the east coast of Canada, I know that the education budget, 
as I call it, will be one where students have more access to 
education.  People who have been out of school for some time will 
have more access to education.  Part time and full time students 
will have more access and more money made available to them. 
I believe that Canadians are going to be very pleased with what 
this budget does over the next period of time.  We have given tax 
breaks.  As I have said, we have made education more accessible 
and we have done a lot of things that are going to make Canadians 
very proud.

their desks to withdraw them.

have for a number of years as we move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on the Canada education savings 
grant, which will provide a 20% top up for every dollar up to a 
maximum of $2,000 per year?  Could he provide some indication to 
this House of what impact that grant will have for his

for his questions.  I said earlier in the day in my speech with 
regard to this fund that this is a way for Canadians to put money 
into education for their children.  It is money that the 
government will contribute 20% toward.  This money will allow an 
awful lot of Canadians who would not normally have access to 
education to have that access.  It is a tremendous way—

Speaker of the House told everyone here that he was going to 
consider all points of order raised earlier in the House.  At this 
time we must, I think, await his ruling, because it seems to me 
that this is more of the same.

the House for the few minutes of debate remaining today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was going to rise on a 
point of order myself because I assumed this was put to bed 15 
minutes ago, that we were through with this point of order.  I 
hope there will not be any more points of order on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The education fund makes tremendous access to education possible 
for a lot of people who otherwise would not necessarily have the 
funds to attend a post-secondary institution.  This will provide 
funding for an awful lot of Canadian students who otherwise would 
not have had that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has in general given Canadians something they have 
been waiting for for many years.  We have not gone all the way. 
The Minister of Finance has said this many times.  We have just 
opened the door.  It will come.  Things will get better as time 
goes on. Canadians will rejoice in that we have given them tax 
breaks, we have made access to education possible, we have put 
money into health care, we have done all the things Canadians 
have asked us to do with the number one and number two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to all of my colleagues that this is a tremendous budget. 
I have been here for almost 10 years and this is one of the best 
budgets I have seen come down in that time and I will have no 
problem selling it in my constituency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate on this 
1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first of all like to congratulate the Minister of 
Finance, the hon. Paul Martin, for producing a balanced budget, 
the first we have had in 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balancing the budget has not been an easy task.  We know it 
required fiscal prudence, the sacrifice of all Canadians and the 
commitment of the government to listen and to act on the social 
and economic priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, our commitment to provide a secure future for 
all Canadians is reinforced and reaffirmed.  I am very pleased to 
see that the government has introduced new initiatives and has 
expanded upon existing programs to produce greater support to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives outlined in this budget will provide support for 
families with children, support for people looking after family 
members and access to knowledge and skills along with support for 
persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are measures and initiates essential for economic growth 
in my constituency of Etobicoke—Lakeshore and other communities 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is not an end in itself but a means to a better 
future for all Canadians.  We must, therefore, continue to 
dialogue with Canadians to assess and to address the needs and 
concerns of all communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November I held a prebudget consultation in my riding of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  In my discussions with my community groups 
and various individuals from the business community and others, I 
heard my constituents say that they want the federal government 
to do three things in this budget:  continue on the path of 
deficit reduction, use the fiscal dividends to address the social 
and economic needs of Canadians and, third, provide tax cuts and 
support for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the message that I delivered to the Standing Committee 
on Finance and I am pleased to say to all of my constituents 
today that the government heard and responded to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Etobicoke—Lakeshore, reaction to the budget has been 
positive.  I and those constituents who contacted me agree that 
the government has taken a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My staff contacted community organizations such as the Lakeshore 
Area Multi-service project that provides front line service to 
constituents and their families, and Storefront Humber, which is 
an organization that provides service to senior citizens and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those phone calls were made to gauge my constituents' sentiments 
on budget 1998.  They understand that deficit reduction is the 
key to putting our nation on the right track to social and 
economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents also understand that investing in our children's 
future has to remain one of the top priorities of the government. 
It is not surprising then that a balanced budget and increases to 
the child tax benefit are well supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to speak to the priorities of my constituents 
as they relate to the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on deficit reduction, Etobians and all Canadians have 
every reason to be encouraged by the government's fiscal policy 
on deficit reduction which has brought us to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget speech, the Minister of Finance reaffirmed the 
Liberal government's deficit reduction plan.  We made a 
commitment in the red book in 1993 to put our fiscal house in 
order.  We have followed through on this commitment with a 
balanced budget that will remain balanced in 1998-99 and 1999 to 
the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, Canada had a $42 billion deficit, the largest in our 
history.  With this deficit, we were in a period of high interest 
rates and slow economic growth.  Canadians were faced with the 
prospect of paying those higher interest rates on the debt with 
few job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the sound fiscal policy, this $42 billion will no 
longer be on the government's books.  We have a zero deficit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking about a zero deficit budget.  This means that 
the government is making tremendous fiscal progress.  It is 
creating a strong, vibrant economy where interest rates are low 
and economic growth is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong economy that is well managed is needed so that 
Canadians can compete in the global economy. Low inflation and 
low interest rates give Canadians confidence in their economy. 
Over the past three years the people of Etobicoke—Lakeshore have 
been able to reap some benefits because of reduced payments on 
mortgages and loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will lead the G-7 nations in economic and job growth in 
1998 and this is no common boast.  Our debt to GDP ratio is 
decreasing.  Our goal is to put the debt to GDP ratio on a 
downward track and to do so without borrowing and increasing the 
debt burden of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must stay the course, say my constituents.  We have a 
balanced budget because of tough fiscal discipline and we must 
not let up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, on the Canadian opportunities strategy my constituents 
agree that young people are the future of our nation. When we 
invest in their future we are building a stronger nation.  There 
is no better investment in the future than investment in 
education, in knowledge and in innovation.  We are living in a 
technologically literate, knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the mother of two young women.  I was an educator for over 
30 years working with young people.  I sat on a university board 
of governors.  I know the plight of young people.  I have 
listened to many young people in my riding who have talked to me 
about the difficulties they face in today's job market. They are 
in a vicious cycle of no job experience, no gainful employment. 
This budget will change this cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth at risk, students and graduates want the government to 
take an active role in ensuring that there is equal opportunity 
to post-secondary education and assistance for debt burdens.  The 
Liberal government is aware of this reality and this is why we 
are giving support to young Canadians through the Canada 
opportunities strategy, knowledge and skills needed for jobs now 
and in the future. Better jobs and higher standards of living for 
our young people in the 21st century is our goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarship fund will remove the barriers 
for young Canadians to get the post-secondary education or 
advanced technical training that they will need to get gainful 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the young people in my riding to know that the Canada 
millennium scholarships will commence in the year 2000.  They 
will be awarded to over 100,000 full and part time students every 
year over 10 years through an initial endowment of $2.5 billion 
from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues across the floor commented that the start of the 
fund is not soon enough and that students would be better off if 
they were given the money now.  We are putting the administrative 
structures in place so that the fund can be administered fairly 
and efficiently and this will take some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our role is to support young Canadians and we will take on the 
responsibility of creating the measures to facilitate this role. 
The Canada millennium scholarship fund is an initiative that will 
benefit Canadians of all ages at various institutions who are 
undertaking studies under different terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of fairness and equity are embodied in the 
millennium scholarship fund.  I believe that this fund will 
lessen the financial stress that many Etobians face at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that young Canadians leaving colleges and 
universities with heavy student loans which they are often unable 
to repay get the help that is needed right now.  This budget does 
give them a break.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we must continue to build on our resolve to bring 
about fiscal order to our country while we focus on the needs of 
our young people.  I call on my colleagues on all sides of this 
House to support this budget to ensure that all our young people 
have the future that is important for them.

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to my hon. colleague's presentation. She is very 
concerned with helping young people pursue their education; she is a 
teacher and I was one too. Everyone agrees with this. The situation of 
a 20- or 21-year old student who has not yet found a job and has 
accumulated between $25,000 and $30,000 in debts is truly difficult. It 
makes no sense and I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, everyone knows that, in Quebec, we have had a grants and 
loans system for 30 years. Why add to something that already exists in 
Quebec and is extremely well managed? This is a relatively simple 
situation. 
Had the government agreed to give money, say 25%, back to the Quebec 
Ministry of Education, our young people would still have received the 
money and their debt load would have been lighter. That is what we want. 
I hope my hon. colleague will address this aspect in her answer. I agree 
with the objective, but not with the way it is achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is touted as a wonderful thing. Last year, I sat on the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources. We did some work on rural 
areas. In my riding of Matapédia—Matane, we have fishers, foresters and 
farmers. These are the three main classes of workers in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, most of their jobs are seasonal jobs. Some of these 
people need another 10, 20 or 30 weeks of work to qualify for employment 
insurance. As you know, new claimants are required to accumulate 910 
hours of work. 
It is nearly impossible for fishers to accumulate 910 hours of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry workers in my region are as proud and hard-working as 
anyone else in Quebec. Sometimes, they are short a few hours. There are 
people in my riding who lost their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is supposed to be a wonderful, an extraordinary budget. Come 
and tell the people in my region that this is a wonderful, an 
extraordinary budget, that there is hope. No. The rural community had 
suggested that a department of rural development be established, but I, 
as the Bloc Quebecois spokesperson, said: “No, let us not complicate 
things and cause further duplication; let us just invest in 
agriculture”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question to the hon. member: Can she tell me if there is 
anything in this budget for fishers, farmers and foresters? That is my 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Madam Speaker, it seems I have about 
a minute or so to answer three questions.  I would again ask my 
colleague to pay attention and read the budget papers that were 
so generously sent to our various offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on one aspect, which is the whole issue of young 
people and their debt load.  I will agree with the hon. member 
that young Canadians are leaving colleges and universities with 
heavy debt. 
I would agree with him that the loan payments for young people at 
present are burdensome, but I would also direct his attention to 
the assistance which is given to young people in the budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is saying to me that people are saying this is a good 
budget, I want to say to him, yes, it is a good budget.  It is 
not a perfect budget because there is nothing in life which is 
absolutely perfect, but there are items in the budget which 
respond to the needs of Canadians.  The member must agree that we 
have covered the issue of women and children, we have covered 
students at various levels, not just at university but also at 
college, we have covered the issue of part time workers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry, but I 
must interrupt the hon. member as her time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would also like to split my 20 minutes with a 
colleague, but I understand that I will only have three or four 
minutes before I will be cut off for the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I wish I could be as proud of this budget as I am 
to be a Canadian and as I am of our national anthem and our flag. 
I mean that sincerely.  I would have liked to have had an 
opportunity to speak on this issue earlier, but I did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the positive in the budget.  There is one 
positive.  Canadians taxpayers, all across this country, can give 
themselves a pat on the back.  They balanced the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we have heard that the Minister of Finance or this 
government or the Liberals have done it, but there is no question 
about it, the taxpayers have suffered in order to balance the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will get into the negative side of it.  I will focus on 
three areas.  I only have a couple of minutes so I will rush 
through this quite quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep talking about this 50:50 plan.  There is absolutely no 
question that the evidence before this House is that this is 100% 
increased spending.  There is zero debt reduction.  There is 
absolutely zero tax relief.  There is no question about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members will have a few token things to say to 
suggest that there is tax relief, but there is not.  Make no 
mistake about it, there is no tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the constituents of Saanich—Gulf Islands.  I sent 
out a resumé.  I am here as their voice to speak on their behalf. 
I got over 2,000 responses.  Ninety-five per cent of those 
responses said the most important priorities are to pay down the 
debt and reduce taxes.  Five per cent said that the most 
important priority was to increase spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government done?  It has not only increased 
spending in this budget, the $3 billion—and they do not seem to 
know where it has gone—has gone into the Prime Minister's or the 
finance minister's personal slush fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to speak specifically to a couple of points because a 
lot of the points I was going to make have already been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a Liberal debt.  Make no mistake about it.  The Liberals 
have added $75 billion to the debt since they took office. There 
is $5.5 billion worth of interest each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I find to be quite amazing.  We listen in the House 
of Commons day after day after day to the Liberals talking about 
the debt.  What do they do all the time?  They blame the Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance points to the Tories and says “The 
Tories left us this big mess in 1993”.  But the Liberals started 
it long before the Tories were in power.  They are the ones who 
brought in this debt under former Prime Minister Trudeau.  They 
started it and look where we are today.  The Liberals stand up so 
proudly and pass the buck over to the Tories.  They should be 
ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to a point which I think is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals keep talking about families.  This government and 
this budget have absolutely no respect for the stay-at-home 
parent who looks after their family. 
They are discriminated against now in this budget.

for this motion to be put at this time. As I understand the order 
of the House, at 4.45 the Chair is required to ring the bells to 
call in the members to vote on the Bloc amendment to the

to 4.45 when I sought the floor of the House. I do admit I am 
guilty of taking a little longer, possibly, in making my 
submission for unanimous consent, but I did begin prior to 4.45.

“That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the word 
“That” with the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“the House of Commons reject the Budget statement by the 
Minister of Finance because it denies Canadians debt and tax relief 
by spending away the federal budget surplus, thus killing 
opportunities for job creation and economic growth; it leaves 
Canadians saddled with the highest personal income tax rates in the 
G-7 countries, resulting in systematic brain drain to jurisdictions 
with lower taxation levels; it allows interest charges on the 
national debt to consume one third of every tax dollar collected by 
the federal government and to exceed spending on health care, 
education, and old age security combined; it continues the steady 
decrease in real disposable income for the average Canadian through 
tax hikes; and it does not keep the government's promise of 
committing 50 percent of the surplus to new spending and the 
remaining 50 percent to 
some combination of debt reduction and tax relief”;
