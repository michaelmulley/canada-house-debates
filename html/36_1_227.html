International Awareness Day for Chronic Immunological and 
Neurological Diseases such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, gulf 
war and multiple chemical sensitivity syndromes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These devastating illnesses are striking a growing number of 
Canadians who suffer from cognitive problems, chronic muscle and 
joint pain, extremely reduced stamina and numerous other symptoms 
which leave sufferers ill and bedridden for years at a time. Most 
sufferers are unable to work because of their pain. However, 
their suffering is not only physical.  A lack of public knowledge 
about these disorders often causes sufferers their jobs and 
disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent, mother and very close friend of mine, Leni 
Spooner, suffers from fibromyalgia syndrome.  She will live with 
this condition for the rest of her life. Her 16 year old daughter 
was also recently diagnosed with the same disorder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of parliament to spread the word about these 
devastating conditions so that people like Leni and her daughter 
may suffer a little less.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Premier Klein invited the governors of several 
northwest U.S. states to Drumheller, Alberta for the annual 
western premiers conference to be held later this month. Premier 
Klein's mission is to persuade American politicians that there 
are provinces within Canada that support a growing and prosperous 
trade relationship with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again, this Liberal government has failed to take 
a proactive role in addressing contentious trade issues.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Day in the province of New Brunswick. 
Chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS, is a debilitating and complex 
disorder characterized by profound fatigue that is not improved 
by rest and may be worsened by physical or mental activity.  The 
cause or causes of CFS have not been identified and no specific 
diagnostic tests are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a real disease that deserves real research in order to 
find a cause and cure.  Its affects are made worse by the fact it 
is commonly not recognized within programs that are otherwise 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In past years in my riding of Fredericton I have participated in 
the annual elephant walk which raises money and awareness for 
CFS. 
This year's walk will take place in the town of Oromocto on May 
30.  I urge all adults and children in the riding of Fredericton 
to help this worthwhile cause, because together we can work to 
make life better for those suffering from chronic fatigue 
syndrome.

Amnesty International student group 731 from Thérèse Martin 
school in Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people collected more than 2,000 signatures from 
people opposed to trafficking in human organs, to which 
Guatemalan street children are prey.  Their petition calls on 
the government of this country to take action to ensure the 
safety of these children, and of the humanitarian aid workers 
trying to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate the man who spearheaded this project, 
Marcel Lacroix, and the students who took part:  Marie-Pier 
Bellemare, Marie-Élaine Sabourin, Jean-Luc Coutu, Jean-Pierre 
Coutu, Éric Lévesque and Francis Giraldeau, not to mention Dulus 
Racine, their spiritual adviser on this worthy endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exceptional interest the young students at Thérèse Martin 
school have taken in children from a less privileged country 
deserves our heartfelt admiration.  May their example pave the 
way for other humanitarian initiatives to put a stop to this 
unacceptable practice to which young Guatemalans fall victim.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

Added to these global data are seven success stories

trade policy, the reports of the impact of NAFTA are highly

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this year, 
the theme of the Semaine québécoise de la famille is “families: 
a social strength”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few decades there have been major changes in the 
family landscape, but the family still remains a keystone of the 
socio-economic structure of Quebec and of the psycho-affective 
development of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the federal government's never-ending efforts to weaken 
social programs with its see-sawing social transfers, and its 
preference for visibility for the maple leaf over the needs of 
the clientele concerned, Quebec is the province with the 
greatest investment in services to the family and to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of its integrated approach, Quebec's family policy 
constitutes an innovative solution and offers a real model for 
the rest of Canada.  We in Quebec are justifiably proud of the 
priority given to a family policy which respects the multiple 
realities and fundamental needs of families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is 
a serious staffing situation in the province of New Brunswick 
which can mean a serious downturn in patient care.  Because of 
the high demand for radiation therapists across the country, 
provinces are competing for qualified staff to fill vacancies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, radiation therapists in New Brunswick are the lowest paid 
in the country.  For that reason many are seeking better paying 
jobs in other provinces.  Already the province has lost four 
people and one more is planning to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of New Brunswick deserve access to qualified health 
care providers.  We need to stress the importance of retaining 
our qualified, experienced radiation therapists in New Brunswick 
to care for the hundreds of cancer patients who are in desperate 
need of treatment.  We have an obligation to those patients to 
ensure that this alarming situation does not create an exodus to 
the west or stateside and that our health care workers remain in 
the province.

not, Bernard Lord will.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, six weeks ago I met an auto plant worker in southern 
Ontario who had just received a paycheque for overtime work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was madder than a boiled owl because the amount the 
government had ripped out of his paycheque was equal to the 
amount that was left for him and his family.  He said he thought 
he was working for Chrysler but it turns out he is working half 
time for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister provide substantive broad based tax 
relief for the overtaxed workers of Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have reduced taxes.  A surtax of 3% which was put in 
place by the previous government has been taken away.  We have 
reduced taxes for a family of four with two earners and an income 
of $60,000.  They have seen a reduction in their taxes of 
virtually 10%.  The same family with an income of $100,000 has 
seen its taxes cut by 4.8%, and we have reduced the EI premium by 
20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have balanced the books and so on.  The people of Canada are 
much better off today than they were when we took over. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister gave that answer to that auto 
plant worker, the worker would laugh in disbelief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government is promising $16.5 billion in tax relief by 
the year 2002, like it promised to get rid of the GST, in fact 
what it has done is collect over $42 billion in tax increases 
since it took office.  That is why that worker is paying half of 
his overtime pay in tax deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister could give every worker in the country a pay 
increase this year simply by reducing the federal tax rip-off 
from paycheques.  Why does he not do so? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, 600,000 Canadians who paid taxes before we reduced them 
are not paying taxes any more.  We have moved in many other 
fields, as I explained earlier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course for the opposition there is only one problem.  It 
thinks it will solve everything with just that.  However, the 
balanced approach is to have some tax relief and at the same time 
to help productivity in the land and to resolve social problems. 
That is the way to have a better society.  There is not only one 
avenue to having a good situation in our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister runs a tax system which not only 
gouges workers but particularly gouges low income workers with 
almost $4 billion per year in incomes taxes from Canadians who 
make $20,000 a year or less and over $2 billion per year in 
payroll taxes from workers who make $20,000 or less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax policies of the government have become one of the chief 
contributors to poverty in Canada.  How can this tax rich 
government, which is sitting on a $7 billion to $15 billion 
surplus, justify ripping $6 billion a year out of the pockets of 
the working poor? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I said, a two earner family with two children making 
$60,000 is paying $620 less this year than it was paying two 
years ago.  Also it is paying $270 less in EI premiums.  That 
gives the family $900 more in its pocket which it did not have 
before.  It is the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have a proper society we must not look only at one side of 
the ledger.  We must look at all the problems of society, which 
is what my party is doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government talks about a balanced approach.  Here is some 
balance.  It ripped $21 billion out of health care and social 
services and then it put $11 billion back in.  It ripped out $42 
billion more in taxes and then it says it will give us $16.5 
billion back in tax relief.  It looks to me like this is the new 
Liberal math, and taxpayers just do not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not just get up off his big fat 
surplus and give taxpayers the money back that he owes them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what a compliment.  We are standing in the House after 
five and a half years when we started with a $42 billion deficit. 
The country was facing bankruptcy and we have solved it.  Now the 
opposition pretends that we are doing too well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will spend a lot more money in health care, $11.5 billion in 
the next five years.  We have invested in innovation.  We have 
invested in federal health care programs.  We have invested in 
child tax credits.  We have done a lot of things so the country 
is in much better shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks again to the member of the opposition for saying that we 
have done quite well in the last five and half years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister talks about a surplus as though it is some 
kind of Liberal largesse.  Taxpayers are the ones who looked 
after that.  They looked after balancing the budget.  It was not 
the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian is paying $2,000 more in taxes now than they were 
in 1993.  Those are the figures.  People have just finished doing 
their taxes so they know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has a million and one excuses for why he 
needs these high taxes but he keeps getting mixed up with the 
facts.  They just keep getting in his way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Prime Minister to stand in his place and tell 
Canadians why they have such a big surplus and he still wants to 
keep his mud hooks on it.  Why is that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the reason Canadians are paying somewhat more taxes is 
because they have a lot more revenue.  That is not a problem. 
That is what happened.  It is because interest rates are the 
lowest they have been in a long time and productivity is 
increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could quote somebody the Reformers know quite well who 
had this to say about the opposition's chances in the next 
federal election: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, be realistic.  There is no way that either the Reform or 
the UA will beat the Liberals in the 2001 election.  Voters do 
not turf out governments that have presided over economic growth, 
new jobs and a balanced budget. 
</UL>

to say that Quebeckers in general have great regard for that 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a minister accused by the information commissioner of

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the documents requested by the journalist were provided. 
Second, there was a delay, for which I am sorry.  This delay was 
due to the fact that my department has twice the number of 
access to information requests to process that it had one year 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing everything possible to meet demand and to ensure

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is

The minister held on to these documents during the quota debate 
to keep the House in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He responded 95 days after the legal deadline.  That is four and

have complied with the Access to Information Act to the letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to do so, unless there are twice as many

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently a Quebec minister tendered her 
resignation because she felt responsibility for an error 
committed as the result of bad advice from her department.  As 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development, he has gone 
against a law of parliament in order to prevent directives that 
would have disastrous repercussions for him from becoming known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the principle of ministerial accountability, what choice 
does the Minister of Human Resources Development have left? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques is resorting to 
humour today, or maybe it is just his usual bad temper showing 
through.  I do not understand where there can be any parallel 
between what he is referring to and the situation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The journalists have been provided with the documents they 
requested.  The only problem is that there was a regrettable 
delay because we have twice as many requests as last year. We 
need to take steps to remedy this.  We are going to do just 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the letter from the information commissioner 
is clear. The minister's office put his interests before those 
of the requesting parties and has defied the law all this time. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the unemployed people who have been harassed, on 
behalf of the MPs who have been refused information, and on 
behalf of the law that has been broken, I am asking the minister 
to take the only appropriate step under the circumstances: 
resignation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one would think we were back in 
a referendum campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. Minister of Human 
Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, honestly, I have trouble 
taking this seriously, but I shall try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told again that there are employment insurance 
quotas, when that is totally false.  What is more, my office has 
never deliberately delayed providing information.  There was a 
regrettable delay and we have taken corrective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Bloc Quebecois, the branch plant of the Parti Quebecois, 
might perhaps have a look at what is going on in the Government 
of Quebec. 
We saw to social insurance. There was a target of $100 million 
and the same sort of investigation came up with $112 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one excuse 
the government uses to justify the high taxes in our country is 
medicare.  The U.S. government spends more on its public medicaid 
and medicare system per person than does the Canadian government; 
in fact, $800 per person more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With taxes in Canada so high, why is medicare spending so low? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the reasons that the Americans spend so much money on 
health care is that their system is so inefficient compared to 
ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just announced that over the next five years we are 
putting an additional $11.5 billion into the hands of provinces 
and they have promised to use it for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in medicare, unlike the Reform Party that would 
repeal the Canada Health Act and take the American route.  If the 
hon. member does not like the American system, why is he arguing 
in favour of it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is 
another example of Liberal math.  While he was telling us that 
the government is putting $11 billion back into medicare, he 
quietly forgot to say that the government took $21 billion out 
five years before.  That is Liberal math, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just an academic exercise.  What has it done to 
Canadians?  MRI is very valuable to health care.  Here is what a 
radiologist said about our MRI, “The big shocker is that when 
Canada is compared to other countries in terms of MRIs per 
capita, we rank at the bottom”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With taxes in Canada so high, why is medicare spending so low? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the money we have given the provinces should help them address 
their responsibilities when it comes to MRIs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue of dollars for the Reform Party.  It is not 
an issue of technicalities.  It is an issue of policy and 
philosophy for that party.  It does not agree with Canada in our 
approach to medicare.  It does not agree with the Canada Health 
Act.  It does not agree with the equity of making health care 
available to everybody regardless of what they have in their 
wallets.  It takes a different approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never agree with the Reform Party and their American 
style approach to medicare.

just two months ago the government announced that it is 
increasing by $11.5 billion over the next five years the amount 
of money available to the provinces for health care.  Just two 
months ago we announced our plans to spend $1.4 billion ourselves 
on areas like health research, early intervention with children 
to prevent illness and improving health for aboriginal and first 
nations throughout this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know where the Reform Party stands.  Reform would rip up the 
Canada Health Act, turn its back on public health care and opt 
for an American style model.  We believe that health care is part

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a brother who would love to have the Minister of Health in 
his math class.  This is math from the Liberal perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers are real.  The government took $21.4 billion out of 
health care.  It is going to put back $11.5 billion and it is 
telling Canadians to be thankful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. government spends more per person on public health than 
the Canadian government.  That is a fact.  Canadian taxpayers pay 
over 30% more in taxes than their American counterparts.  What do 
Canadians have to show for it?  Waiting lists, delayed surgery, 
staffing shortages and the declining health of thousands of

the hon. member seems to like his sums today, so let us try a 
number on him which maybe he does not know.  The member 
apparently likes the American system of health care.  The member 
did not mention that over 100 million Americans do not have 
medical insurance because they cannot afford it.  The member did 
not mention that there are tens of millions of working American 
families who worry that one day they are going to have to choose 
between their health and their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member likes that system, then he is free to go and 
join them.  I will tell him one thing, we will never opt for the 
American style of health care.

Mr. Speaker, according to departmental principles and policies,

the rural route mail carriers of Canada who wish to inform the 
House that they earn less than minimum wage in working conditions 
reminiscent of another era.  Section 13.5 of the Canada Post 
Corporation Act prohibits the rural route mail carriers from 
having collective bargaining rights and are not under 
the Canada Labour Code. 
Therefore the petitioners pray upon parliament to repeal section 
13.5 of the Canada Post Corporation Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is legislation that was brought forward in 1988 and in the 
legislation it stipulated that it would come back to the House in 
five years for review.  It came back in the last parliament; 
however, the bill that was proposed did not gain support and died 
on the order paper.  In this parliament Bill C-32 is the result 
of the new bringing together of the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a large bill.  It is comprehensive.  It is technical and 
it contains over 230 pages.  What is significant is that there 
were over 400 amendments introduced at committee stage.  Now 
there are 236 amendments at report stage.  There are more 
amendments than the House has seen to any bill in a number of 
years according to the clerks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be discussing in the first group of amendments the 
management of toxic substances, the application of virtual 
elimination, inherent toxicity and prior informed consent.  This 
is a fairly technical bill and we will be dealing with some of 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the application of virtual 
elimination.  Virtual elimination means pretty well what it says, 
that a chemical would be virtually eliminated.  However, the 
difficulty with this bill concerns the ability to measure.  I 
will be showing my age, but if we go back 20 or 30 years most of 
us will remember that the ability to measure was in parts per 
million, then it went to parts per billion, then to parts per 
trillion, and perhaps now to parts per quadrillion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry requires goal posts.  For instance, when building a 
plant, if there is a nasty chemical such as dioxin, which occurs 
naturally in forest fires or wood smoke, if that is to be 
virtually eliminated, industry requires goal posts to be set.  If 
industry knows that it is one part per billion, it can deal with 
that.  Industry will know what it will be dealing with down the 
road.  However, the bill does not say that with respect to 
virtual elimination.  Therefore, we have proposed, along with a 
number of other people, changes to clarify the issue.  Unless 
changes are made to the application of virtual elimination in the 
bill, Canada will be out of step with internationally accepted 
approaches.  For example, Germany has numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A witness appeared before the committee who made a very pointed 
remark.  If there is a point of one part per billion and industry 
steps over it, it can be taken to court.  It is very clean cut. 
However, if there is a very fuzzy goal post of the ability to 
measure, that could be in litigation for over 10 years.  In fact, 
technology could supersede the ability to measure and it would 
just muddy the waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An enormous disincentive will result when companies are forced 
to plan for unrealistic results.  There are really no 
environmental or health benefits from this approach.  It simply 
ties the hands of investment in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has put forward 10 motions which deal with the 
application of virtual elimination.  It is interesting, as well, 
that the government and the Progressive Conservatives have put 
together 13 amendments to bring the application of virtual 
elimination into a scope that we can all deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of amendments put forward by the Reform Party 
and the government which ensure that specific reference to 
implementation of subsection 65(3) is maintained in the act when 
dealing with the application of virtual elimination.  Many of the 
motions accomplish virtually the same thing as our motions.  In 
fact, the reason they are grouped is because they are very 
similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the amendments put forward by the Reform Party is 
to eliminate ministerial discretion when determining whether 
circumstances have been taken into consideration and to emphasize 
the role of science in decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 10 minutes one cannot really deal with many of these subjects 
in depth because of their complexity, but I would also like to 
deal with prior informed consent, which is addressed by our 
Motions Nos. 130, 132 and 135.  Our amendments would ensure that 
Canada prohibits the export of substances placed on a list which, 
by international agreement, are banned or severely restricted 
substances, rather than allowing the government to prohibit the 
export of any substance regulated in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was really quite surprised that the government did not propose 
amendments with respect to sections 100, 101 and 102 of the act 
concerning the implementation of the prior informed consent 
convention that Canada has entered into.  When the government 
introduced these sections to the committee it was explained that 
the purpose of these sections was to allow Canada to fulfil its 
obligations under the prior informed consent convention, which is 
also known as the Rotterdam convention, which was finalized last 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sections which the government proposed, while they enable 
Canada to fulfil its obligations under that convention, are far 
broader than what is necessary for the purpose.  I believe that 
is the crux of the matter.  The main point is:  How broad do we 
need this act to be?  The act should fulfil the convention. 
However, it goes far beyond that and gives far broader powers 
than we feel are necessary.  The legislation should not go beyond 
what the government initially said was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Reform Motion No. 90 we suggest that the purpose should be, 
as was explained to the committee by government officials, for 
the implementation of international agreements.  We agree with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the international agreement that we are talking about is 
the prior informed consent convention, we need to look at the 
scope of that convention.  The negotiating process resulted in 
the PIC convention being applied to banned and severely restrict 
substances.  The term severely restricted is clearly defined in 
the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that powers should not be created for the government to 
ban the export of substances without their being sound reasons in 
the bill.  At present there are no sound reasons shown in the 
bill.  Powers such as these, which can be exercised arbitrarily 
without any guidance from parliament, will create significant 
investment uncertainty in Canada in the business world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This uncertainty is particularly important and worrisome for the 
increasing numbers of companies which have as their primary focus 
of business in Canada export opportunities.  We are well aware 
that the world is shrinking and that Canada is an exporting 
country.  Therefore, this portion of the bill is very worrisome 
for many industries in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason this issue is important is that if Canada is to 
take a leadership role on environmental issues internationally, 
which the Reform Party and I am sure most members of the House 
support, it is important that we are responsible domestically to 
implement what we negotiate and agree to.  To implement something 
that goes beyond what we agree to in an international convention 
I do not believe is wise and will be seen by our negotiating 
partners as irresponsible.  We would put at risk Canada's status 
as an international leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to create unnecessary powers for the government 
for no apparent reason which go beyond PIC powers and create 
investment uncertainty.  We hope that other parties will agree to 
this approach and vote favourably to the proposed amendments to 
sections 100, 101 and 102. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude at this point.  My colleague will continue to 
speak about inherent toxicity and toxic substances which are also 
in this group.  As I said earlier, it is very difficult to 
capsulate in 10 minutes what is a 232 page bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to 
Bill C-32 and to the many motions that have been put forward 
within Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member opposite has recognized, the motions that we are 
dealing with today deal with export controls, virtual elimination 
and focus on toxics.  The preamble of Bill C-32, as amended by 
the standing committee, talks about the phase-out of the 
generation and use of persistent and biocumulative toxic 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government Motion No. 2 proposes an amendment to make the 
statement in the preamble consistent with that which is in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also changes on biotechnology and the administrative 
duties of the bill.  As a result of the amendments put forward by 
the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development, the administrative duties now correctly reference 
products of biotechnology. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For clarity, government Motion No. 9 retains this reference but 
places it in a separate clause that recognizes the need to 
protect the environment by providing for the safe and effective 
use of biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all members will agree that the bill in its entirety is 
focused on making sure that we are producing a win for the 
environment, a win for the Canadian public and a win for the 
future health of Canadians.  The bill is on the leading edge of 
environmental protection worldwide.  It focuses on pollution 
prevention, the protection of our environment and the health of 
all Canadians.  It strengthens the environmental protection act, 
as the member opposite has mentioned, a piece of legislation that 
came in some five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key components of the bill is the section on virtual 
elimination.  Virtual elimination means reducing the releases to 
the environment of a very small number of the most dangerous 
toxic substances to a level where these releases cannot be 
measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are talking about 12 substances in Canada that have 
been found to meet the criteria for virtual elimination.  Nine of 
these substances, one example being DDT, are banned in Canada. 
Controls are in place or are being developed for the remaining 
three.  There are 23,000 substances in commerce in Canada.  It is 
estimated that over the next number of years 10 or 12 could also 
be slated for virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we doing this?  Even extremely small releases of certain 
substances to the environment can create problems that are 
extremely costly or impossible to correct.  This is particularly 
true of substances that are:  toxic as defined under the 
environmental protection act; primarily the result of human 
activity; persistent, take a long time to break down, if ever; 
and bioaccumulative, collect in living organisms and end up in 
the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A prime example of this is the insecticide DDT, which I 
mentioned earlier.  It was introduced into Canada in the 1940s. 
It was responsible for causing drastic reductions in many bird 
populations, especially those at higher levels in the food chain 
such as gulls, cormorants and bald eagles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the ban in Canada on all major uses of DDT in the 1970s, 
today DDT is being detected in the breast milk of Canada's Inuit 
people.  The bill will make sure that we remove these substances 
from our communities and from the environment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is based on the regulatory relief limit that is very 
precise, the limit that industries will be obliged to meet after 
this limit is set.  That will come after consideration of the 
health and environment risk to Canadians, of the social and 
economic situation, and of technical matters.  Does the 
technology exist?  Do we need to develop something else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes achieving the virtual elimination of these substances 
will not be immediately feasible.  The bill recognizes the need 
to consider all these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government amendments to these sections, represented in a 
whole series of motions, will make it clear that virtual 
elimination planning and regulatory requirements will be set 
after consideration of environmental or health risks, as well 
social, economic and technical matters.  This is a common sense 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the special regime for the virtual elimination of the most 
dangerous and toxic substances, Bill C-32 is on the leading edge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talked about inherent toxicity.  To be 
slated for virtual elimination, a substance must meet the 
criteria for toxicity in section 64 of the bill.  Government 
Motion No. 88 clarifies ambiguous language in subsection 77(3) to 
make sure that the only toxic substances are put on the track to 
virtual elimination.  This is consistent with other sections in 
the bill and the government's commitment to risk-based decision 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about export controls.  Government Motion No. 128 is 
a technical amendment to make it clear that it is both the 
Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health who add a 
substance to the export control list.  This is about stewardship. 
It is about people being responsible within our borders for what 
they are producing and what they are sending elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for a couple of seconds about some of the 
opposition motions that are before us.  The Bloc Quebecois have 
several motions that would need the agreement of the provinces 
before we could move ahead with virtual elimination of persistent 
and bioaccumulative toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  In 1998 the federal government and all the 
provinces and territories endorsed the national policy for the 
management of toxic substances.  That policy is reflected in the 
bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 is consistent with the policy which calls for the 
virtual elimination of persistent and bioaccumulative toxic 
substances.  With the new CEPA, the federal government will 
continue to work closely with its provincial and territorial 
partners in taking action to deal with toxics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party wants to alter the definition of toxic 
and to abandon the current practice of making decisions based on 
risk.  The government is committed to a risk-based approach when 
dealing with toxic substances.  Basing our decisions on an 
assessment of risk to the environment and human health is the 
internationally accepted way of doing things.  Abandoning it 
would produce no environmental benefit and would put Canada out 
of step with the other nations with whom we work so closely to 
protect the environment from the threat of toxics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party want to return the 
definition of virtual elimination to that which was originally 
proposed in the bill.  The standing committee heard that the 
definition of virtual elimination that originally existed was 
confusing and could have been interpreted in conflicting ways. 
The government amendments corrected this problem.  The definition 
in the bill is clear and credible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, reducing releases of the most dangerous of toxics to 
the point where they can no longer be measured is our goal for 
virtual elimination.  Striving for anything less would put the 
environment and the human health of Canadians at unnecessary 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the Progressive Conservative amendments. 
Substantive gains have been made in this piece of legislation. 
Since there are several pieces of federal legislation that govern 
new substances and the expertise is shared across several 
government departments, it is appropriate that the decision 
making is in the hands of the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key point of the bill, which some people choose to ignore, is 
that CEPA sets the standard.  Other acts must assess for toxicity 
to determine if the new substance has the potential to harm the 
environment or human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the Reform cross-referencing amendments to 
delete all mention of virtual elimination outside the definition 
in section 65.  That would make the goal of virtual elimination 
unattainable.  It would leave the definition of the bill without 
any corresponding operational clauses.  We are not prepared to do 
that.  It would be bowing to industry, to the mythology of some 
of the paranoia that has existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform amendments to the export control provisions would weaken 
Canada's ability to control exports of dangerous substances.  It 
would add “for the purposes of implementing international 
agreements” and the concept is “severely” restricted.  These 
limit the scope of the sections dealing with the export of 
toxics.  It would take away Canada's ability to control exports 
of potentially dangerous chemicals unless they were covered by an 
international agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Motion No. 92 would make it impossible for Canada to 
control exports of CFCs which are responsible for depleting the 
earth's ozone layer.  It would be kowtowing to industry, it would 
not be a good thing and it would take us to pre-Reform Party, 
pre-1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about stewardship.  It is about pollution 
prevention.  It is a good bill that is important for the health 
and environment of all Canadians.  I urge all members to support 
it with the amendments we are proposing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the report stage of Bill C-32, 
and to have an opportunity to show you just how many 
shortcomings there are in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was my first experience with a clause by clause study of a 
bill in committee.  I must say it was a most disconcerting 
experience for me, to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process was a lengthy one, and introducing and withdrawing 
hundreds of amendments was very confusing.  To top it all off, 
for a number of clauses, the English and French versions did not 
correspond. 
We adopted more than 160 amendments, and no doubt there would 
have been more if we had not got fed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still today, at the report stage, the hundreds of amendments 
before us prove without a doubt that this bill needs to be 
totally reworked, not just changed here and changed there, but 
totally reworked.  Otherwise, we will end up with a bill that 
lacks rigour, consensus and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this committee process, I noted this government's 
flagrant lack of good will.  Here we are, stuck with an 
unfinished bill for the next 10 years.  This is not a process 
that is undertaken every year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555
<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois wanted to do this. Here are a few 
examples to show our good will on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, public participation: what a lovely expression. 
Unfortunately the government is letting cumbersome 
administrative and legal procedures take precedence over the 
public's legitimate demand for a healthy environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, toxic substances: once again, the government is putting 
off updating the list of toxic substances. It will wait seven 
years. When will the new substances be analyzed? This is urgent. 
Why procrastinate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, enforcement: with this bill, the federal government wants 
to set new rules for the environment. How can it enforce them? 
Even with the current legislation, it has cut staff drastically. 
There are fewer inspectors, so there is less enforcement. The 
government cut the department's budget by several million 
dollars. It should seek to enforce what is already in force 
before thinking of extending its power to interfere in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some facts must be pointed out. We will recall that, on December 
15, 1995, the Liberal government proposed revising the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. The proposal by the Minister of 
the Environment at the time was the government's response to the 
fifth report of the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development entitled “It's About Our Health—Towards 
Pollution Prevention”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This response set out the broad lines of a proposal to renew 
the federal government's main legislative measure on 
environmental protection, CEPA. This was a promise made in the 
red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc opposed the report, and made that perfectly clear 
by tabling a minority report. Most of the recommendations in the 
majority report supported the centralizing tendency of the 
federal government in environmental protection matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois refutes the theory of the double safety net 
and contends that the environment would be better served if 
responsibility for its protection were given to one level of 
government only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois firmly believes that the provinces, 
especially Quebec, have greater knowledge of the specifics of 
their natural environment and are in a position to arouse the 
interest and encourage the participation of local residents, are 
more open to the claims of environmental groups, are able to 
conclude significant agreements with national and international 
partners and have indicated their desire to find solutions to 
environmental challenges and to contribute actively to 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced Bill C-74, but the bill died on the 
order paper when the election was called in 1997.  After the 
election, the government introduced a new bill, Bill C-32, born 
from the ashes of Bill C-74, at first reading on March 12, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act is required to undergo a review every five years, and that 
deadline is already past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the renewed Canadian Environmental Protection Act give 
powers to Quebec and the provinces? Definitely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In theory, Bill C-32 recognizes the environment as a shared 
responsibility between the federal government and the provinces. 
Unfortunately, all the rhetoric and pious wishes are not matched 
with action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not delegate any power to Quebec or any of the 
provinces, which is contrary to what true environmental 
harmonization between the various levels of government should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-32, now at report stage, the Liberal government is 
reinforcing the federal government's supremacy in the area of 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill opens the door to duplication of federal and 
provincial powers. To this end, the government even dares to 
hide behind the latest supreme court ruling on an environmental 
issue, in P.G. Canada v. Hydro Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address the four main changes made to the bill at 
committee stage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new definition of virtual elimination is provided at clause 
65.(1).  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this part, “virtual elimination” means, in respect of a toxic 
substance released into the environment as a result of human 
activity, the ultimate reduction of the quantity or 
concentration of the substance in the release below the level of 
quantification specified by the ministers in the list referred 
to in subsection (2). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we create new definitions devoid of meaning, we must make 
sure we can achieve the highest standards in the world.  By way 
of example, the harmonization of federal environmental standards 
with those of European countries, such as Germany, would be a 
big step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could see there was a problem of harmonization among the 
various positions in the bill referring to virtual elimination. 
The new definition of virtual elimination has not been uniformly 
applied to all the clauses concerning this issue.  Accordingly 
the Bloc Quebecois is proposing amendments to respond to these 
inconsistencies in Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee eliminated all references to cost-effective 
measures the government was to take under Bill C-32.  The 
committee based its decision on the fact that the government did 
not want to explicitly define the word cost effective in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this legal void, the committee decided it was 
simply preferable to eliminate the term, considering that in the 
context of sustainable development, it is understood that 
government measures are to be cost effective. 
On this issue, the Bloc Quebecois' position was the same as that 
of the committee. We should delete a term that has not been 
defined in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hormone disrupting substance means a substance having the 
ability to disrupt the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, 
action or elimination of natural hormones in an organism, or its 
progeny, that are responsible for the maintenance of 
homeostasis, reproduction, development or behaviour of the 
organism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill now specifies that the federal government shall conduct 
research or studies relating to hormone disrupting substances 
for preventive and abatement purposes, to deal with the negative 
effects of these substances on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we think the federal government should limit its 
activities to conducting research and studies in this area. All 
the other aspects mentioned in the bill should come under the 
provinces' responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest concern about Bill C-32 is undoubtedly the issue of 
harmonization with the provinces. Under the original version of 
Bill C-32, the federal government was going to act in accordance 
with the intent of intergovernmental agreements. The Liberal 
majority softened this requirement by adding the word 
endeavour before the verb to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois maintains that the federal government must 
always keep in mind the prospect of harmonization with the 
provinces, to avoid duplication and overlap in the legislation 
and regulations. By trivializing federal-provincial harmonization 
agreements, the Liberal government clearly shows that it lacks 
the will to respect the jurisdiction of the provinces with 
regard to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will table amendments, including one to have 
the term “endeavour” deleted from the current version of Bill 
C-32. I hope the government will give us its support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the agreements respecting the administration of the act, 
clause 9 of the bill provides that the minister “may negotiate 
with a government with respect to the administration of this 
act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering all the issues raised, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed 
to this bill at report stage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am honoured to speak to an act respecting pollution.  If we 
stopped at that we would be in great danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution in this country was given a free ride for generations 
and decades.  The protection of the environment and human health 
is the most important part of the act and contributes to 
sustainable development. 
That is the weight of this act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must respect the toxicity and the dangers pollution poses to 
our health, our organisms, our plants, our animals, our 
biodiversity, the air we breath, the water we drink, and the food 
we eat.  Pollution has made its way into our entire being. 
Therefore we must find strong legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We received a wake-up call in the 1960s when the terms ecology 
and ecologists came into being, along with the environmental bill 
of rights for all Canadian citizens, especially our children. 
That is what CEPA is deemed to be and where it will evolve in the 
future.  It may not have achieved it in this round and it 
certainly did not achieve it in the first round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first round pollution control was the key word.  We tried 
to control pollution in our air, our water and our soil.  Bill 
C-32 is designed to bring about pollution prevention, to 
eventually stop pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the challenge we faced when we looked at the original 
draft of Bill C-32 during clause by clause consideration.  It was 
referred to the committee on April 28, 1998.  It took us a whole 
year to review it.  Up to now over 800 amendments have been 
brought forward.  This is strong enough message that something 
was wrong with the basis of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from non-government environmental 
organizations and health associations across the country.  These 
organizations and countless other groups came before the 
committee to offer their view that the bill was a biased industry 
bill designed and drafted for industrial purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September committee members asked these organizations how 
much access they had to the minister.  All these health and 
environmental organizations said that they had limited access to 
the Minister of Environment.  We asked the same question of 
industry representatives who replied that they had unlimited 
access to the minister.  They were happy with the balance between 
the environment and the economy as set out in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the whole committee process everybody rolled up their 
sleeves in a happy forum under the auspices of a good chair.  In 
this democratic process we tackled the bill through thick and 
thin.  Many amendments were lost and won.  We felt the bill stood 
a chance of getting passed in the House.  We looked forward to 
possibly supporting the bill which would ensure good health for 
our children and our families and clean air, clean water and 
clean lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We endeavoured to look at pollution prevention.  We looked at a 
number of opportunities to enhance it.  One of the issues that 
came out was precautionary principle, one of the highlights of 
the bill, which included the term cost effective. 
Through the committee process we were successful in taking the 
cost out of effective measures.  Cost effective did not take into 
account that there were health matters.  If pollution continues 
to enter our environment and continues to inflict illnesses on 
our children there are various costs:  the health costs, the loss 
of work costs, the insurance costs, the cost of securing homes, 
the cost of buying cleaner water, and the cost of ensuring food 
is well prepared.  These costs are not taken into consideration. 
The cost for our citizens, the cost for Canadians for clean food, 
clean water and clean air were not the definition of cost 
effective. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cost effective was an industrial measure for controlling 
pollution.  It was uppermost in the government's mind.  Lo and 
behold we tossed out cost effective and included measures, that 
beyond scientific evidence precautionary measures should be 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again cost effective came back into this round of amendments 
before the House from the government side.  Obviously the 
industry has put its foot down.  We would tell all members and 
all Canadians who are listening that the cost effective measures 
do not improve environmental measures.  They look after the 
industry's needs and the industry's costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue comes into play, that is virtual elimination which 
is a new term in law.  In essence Bill C-32 is a piece of 
legislation which will be the law of the land.  Virtual seems to 
be a high tech word.  It is like virtual reality.  It is not 
quite there.  In my interpretation of virtual elimination we do 
not really want to prohibit or phase out toxic substances.  We 
will try to do it to a point but there will always be a trickle 
of toxic substances in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite startled when the minister said that in law we could 
not measure zero.  That was a real awakening call.  It will be a 
challenge to try to find a legal definition of zero.  The closest 
the government has come up with is virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We lived through this phase of virtual elimination.  We accepted 
where it was going.  We kind of understood the integrity of the 
government, that it would try to achieve virtual elimination in 
the evolution of the bill and carry forward.  However a big part 
of the virtual elimination is in clause 65(3) where the topic is 
defined as achieved virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Achieving virtual elimination is the task at hand.  Members have 
proposed amendments to remove the achieving of virtual 
elimination.  It is unacceptable.  It does not make any sense for 
it to be taken out of the bill because achieving virtual 
elimination was the task of Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue, which I will close on, is the phase-out of the 
generation and use of toxic substances.  There are amendments to 
take out this part of the preamble and replace it with virtual 
elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would understand and sleep better at night if they 
knew that the preamble of the bill was to phase out the 
generation and use of toxic substances.  In essence the 
government and some of its members want to have virtual 
elimination in the preamble.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-32, 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, at report stage. When 
the member for Davenport talked about this piece of legislation, 
he referred to it as “a very pioneering bill.  It is Canada's 
principal bill with respect to the controlled use of toxins in 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very pioneering bill that was first established by the 
Progressive Conservative Party in 1988 by the hon. Tom McMillan 
and spearheaded by the former environment minister, the hon. Jean 
J. Charest.  It is in that light that I take great pride in 
trying to augment this particular bill as we went through the 
clause by clause process at committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alarm bells should go off for Canadians when they hear that the 
bill had over 400 amendments at the clause by clause process and 
now we are facing over 200 amendments.  That is almost 700 
amendments.  I believe this shows that the bill is flawed in its 
own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After speaking to my colleague for Richmond—Arthabaska, I know 
he is not all that surprised by this.  This is a government, 
after all, which has not passed one piece of environmental 
legislation despite the fact that it has been in office for six 
years.  It did pass the MMT bill but that cost Canadian taxpayers 
$16.5 million because it was not banned under CEPA, which is what 
the government should have done in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are cleaning up the government's work should 
not come as a surprise to Canadians when it comes to the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to a couple of issues that fall in Group No. 1, 
particularly the issue of virtual elimination.  We were satisfied 
that the original definition contained in the bill before it went 
to committee was workable.  It provided for the reduction of 
releases to a quantity of concentration below a measurable amount 
that was at or approaching the lowest level of quantification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported regulations to control the release of substances to 
define virtually eliminated amount.  We also supported the bill's 
power under section 93 to totally, partially or conditionally 
prohibit the manufacture, use and processing of toxic substances. 
We believe that if the government intended on eliminating use of 
a substance, it should use the provision.  Otherwise, if it 
intends to virtually eliminate a substance then it should be able 
to set levels of release by regulation that are virtually 
negligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention something that is almost unprecedented 
in my short time here in the House and, as I understand it, for a 
lot of people who have been here for quite some time.  We are 
about to make an amendment to an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a definition in Bill C-32 of virtual 
elimination before it went into the clause by clause process. The 
parliamentary secretary tabled an amendment which passed.  He is 
now tabling another amendment admitting the government goofed not 
once, but twice.  I think the government had it right the first 
time, but at least it had the sense to recognize that.  It tabled 
an amendment just the other day after we had already put in the 
amendment that corrected it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have two levels of virtual elimination to establish and 
achieve.  It is unclear as currently written which one would be 
deemed the operable amount.  There is first a supreme goal of 
virtual elimination defined as the ultimate reduction of the 
quantity or concentration of the substance in the release below 
the level of quantification specified by the minister in the 
virtual elimination list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Level quantification is defined as the lowest possible measured 
amount.  The ultimate goal is to get below that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is this process to help us gradually get there and it 
is called “achieving virtual elimination”.  In this section, 
the minister prescribes a quantity or concentration of a 
substance that may be released into the environment.  This is 
very different from “below a level of quantification, which is 
the lowest concentration that can be accurately measured”. 
Instead it is a realistic level that industry is required to 
attain when aiming for elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government's intentions were to make the level set under 
achieving virtual elimination the objective industry is to 
pursue, then it should be made clear.  My amendments, the 
amendments of the Progressive Conservative Party, make this 
process clear.  They clean up the change the government and the 
Reform Party supported in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that this mistake was actually 
supported by not one party but two parties at the clause by 
clause level:  the government and the Reform.  However, both 
parties have recognized that the original wording was the right 
way to go.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's amended committee language creates uncertainty. 
This is because there is a gap between a level that is a step 
below the lowest measurable quantity and a level that achieves 
virtual elimination by targeting a release amount prescribed 
under subclause 65(3) which considers social, economic and 
technical matters.  This means there would be a gap between what 
the law prescribes we achieve and what we actually enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the voting pattern document I received this morning, my 
amendments on this clause will be put before similar ones 
introduced by Reform, the Bloc and the government.  As a result, 
given that we want to proceed in a very time effective way, I 
would be very shocked if the government were to vote against our 
amendment because it would be voting against its own amendment in 
a very different way.  I would also be shocked if Reform did the 
same and somewhat shocked if the Bloc did as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of virtual elimination, as originally tabled in 
Bill C-32 before it went to clause by clause, is a better way to 
go and that is what the Progressive Conservative Party will be 
doing with its amendment in terms of trying to clean up the 
government's error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that was sent to committee included a clause 2.2, which 
called for the avoidance of duplication and overlap in 
legislation regulation in areas that involve the protection of 
the environment and human health.  It proposed to resolve any 
potential disputes by having the Minister of the Environment, the 
Minister of Health and the minister responsible for the other act 
jointly decide whether measures that can be taken under the act 
are appropriate and sufficient to address the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was removed from the act during the committee review in 
favour of introducing separate clauses in appropriate sections of 
the bill where the potential for overlap and duplication existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new clauses shifted the power to decide which law would 
prevail to cabinet from the three ministers, except in the case 
of biotechnology where the Minister of Health and the Minister of 
the Environment make the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may actually agree that my amendment makes more sense. 
My amendment would actually have the Minister of the Environment, 
the Minister of Health and the applicable other minister make a 
collaborative decision.  Those are the ministers who would know 
their acts the most.  It would provide Canadians with political 
accountability about who is making decisions, as opposed to 
sending it to some murky area known as the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of respect for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of National Revenue.  These are 
individuals who know their portfolios quite well.  However, why 
would we ask them to make an intervention in a piece of 
legislation that, quite honestly, they do not study on a day to 
day basis.  That is why I believe it is more prudent for us to 
have it done by the Minister of Health, the Minister of the 
Environment and one other.  My amendment tries to do that in this 
very section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out a couple of other motions that 
the Progressive Conservative Party intends to support. The first 
one is the NDP Motion No. 26.  It attempts to further entrench 
the precautionary principle in the administrative duties section 
of the act.  We supported this inclusion of the principle at 
committee stage and we support this motion which defines what the 
precautionary principle means for the purposes of this section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP Motion No. 83 attempts to do the same, except this time it 
defines the reference to precautionary principle referred to in 
the section dealing with screening and assessment of toxic 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one motion, which I am a little bit troubled by and 
which I think Canadians should be very concerned about.  It is 
Motion No. 206 tabled by the Reform Party.  This motion, dealing 
with emergency planning, refers to one of the most severe toxins 
in existence being slated as a schedule 1 toxin.  Once a 
substance has been slated as being toxic, the government can then 
ask a particular industry or company to provide a pollution 
prevention plan.  This motion will not allow that.  Once a toxin 
has been slated for fast-tracking to a schedule 1 toxin, the 
Reform Party wants to wait to have it approved by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me is that the Reform Party believes that cabinet 
may actually say, “Well, we know this is a very harmful 
substance, but, gosh, maybe we should not do it anyway”.  I 
think the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health 
should be able to make that call.  If it is toxic, it is toxic 
and it requires a pollution prevention plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know industry is not that concerned about that particular 
amendment.  I would think that if we are protecting human health 
and the environment, then that would be the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that I do not have enough time to speak about the large 
number of amendments that we have, I am very pleased with the 
position we have taken in terms of virtual elimination, as it is 
a workable definition. 
Given that our motion will be up first, I trust that the Reform 
Party, the government and the Bloc, which have similar motions 
that accomplish the same objective, will vote for our motion as 
opposed to voting for another for purely partisan purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to be here to speak to Bill C-32 after toiling 
for a year in committee on the bill.  It is great to have it back 
in the House and to have the opportunity to debate it in a public 
forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by some members, it has been quite a 
process.  The bill was first tabled in the House on March 12, 
1998.  We are now 14 months to the day from the time it was first 
read in the House.  We have had witnesses from all aspects of 
Canadian society.  We have had industry, people from the 
environmental groups and people speaking to us about children. We 
should listen to everybody in Canada because pollution prevention 
is everybody's job and everybody's problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We dealt with 400 or 500 amendments at committee and now we have 
230-some more.  This just goes on and on.  We debated at length 
many aspects of pollution prevention in committee.  Certain 
members of the committee wanted to take the bill in one direction 
and some wanted to take it in another.  Quite frankly, we felt 
fairly comfortable with the bill that was presented in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to try to take a piece of legislation to the nth 
degree to command and control absolutely everything, but if we do 
that, I believe we would lose some of the people involved in the 
process.  The bill will limit the use of toxins in our society 
and in the way we do business.  If we are going to alienate the 
people in the country who are involved in the use of those and 
take the bill to a point where it is not manageable or not 
workable, then I believe we are doing more harm to the 
environment than if we come up with something reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balance is a word we have heard a lot of and will continue to 
hear as we debate the bill.  We must have the proper balance. We 
cannot go too far one way and we certainly cannot go too far the 
other way.  We have to stand back and look at what we are doing 
on occasion to see if there is a little bit of common sense in 
what is going on.  Canada has to stay in tune with the rest of 
the world.  We have to fulfil some of the international 
obligations that we have been part of.  We also have to be a 
leader and, in many aspects, we can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the months that this was at committee, the hardest working 
person on the Hill was the whip of the Liberal Party.  We had 
people sit and vote in committee who, quite frankly, I had never 
seen before.  They certainly did not know the issues but they did 
vote.  It was an interesting scenario to live through. We saw 
people at the committee who were talking on telephones, reading 
newspapers and whatnot.  It was unfortunate that had to happen. 
Our party attended as many meetings as we could.  If we look back 
at the record, we attended most.  We were there and took part in 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party originally put forward very few amendments 
because we felt it was a bill that had balance, that could work, 
and that it was a piece of legislation that would help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a little from the preamble to bring back into focus 
what the bill is intended to do.  The bill is an act respecting 
pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and 
human health in order to contribute to sustainable development. 
We can all agree with that because it does not split up sections 
of the environment or sections of human life.  It says “the 
environment” in total and “human health” in total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Macleod, being a medical doctor, knows that 
human health applies to human life no matter what age or form. 
Some people may try to indicate that some aspects of our 
population are more at risk than others, but the bill addresses 
human health in total. 
Its declaration and preamble states in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hereby declared that the protection of the environment is 
essential to the well-being of Canadians and that the primary 
purpose of this act is to contribute to sustainable development 
through pollution prevention. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development is an important part of any 
environmental bill. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Government of Canada seeks to achieve sustainable 
development that is based on an ecologically efficient use of 
natural, social and economic resources and acknowledges the need 
to integrate environmental, economic and social factors in the 
making of all decisions by government and private entities; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something we firmly believe in.  We have to take into 
effect the social and economic aspects of any piece of 
legislation as it goes forward.  If we make it too restrictive, 
then we are going to lose some of the players in the game. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to implementing the 
precautionary principle that, where there are threats of serious 
or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall 
not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to 
prevent environmental degradation; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember these issues as we talk about the bill, what 
is and is not in it and the amendments that are brought forward. 
It is going to take us a while to get through them all.  It gets 
a little complex as we try to bring in a bill that has some 
reason and some scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect we are dealing with in this group of motions is the 
use of toxic substances.  The government has consistently focused 
on managing releases of toxic substances and not their uses.  Our 
proposals ensure that the bill is consistent with the relevant 
toxic management strategies incorporated in the UNCED's Agenda 
21, keeping us in step with the rest of the world. This agenda is 
generally pursued by the international community in its risk 
reduction activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments brought forward by some of the committee members 
alter this approach by expanding the scope of CEPA from its 
current focus on emissions to the use of toxic substances.  There 
are 23,000 substances in use; 12 have been classed as toxic. 
These substances are going to be used.  They need to be used. It 
is the control and keeping them under control and stopping the 
release that this bill has to focus on.  It is not the use that 
is a cause for concern; it is the improper management and the 
release of these substances that cause the adverse effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 1 and 13 deal with the use of toxic substances and 
address these concerns.  Motion No. 1 proposes that lines 19 to 
21 of the preamble be returned to the original text. That would 
take the bill back to where it started which was something we 
were quite comfortable with.  The government and the Bloc have 
proposed motions similar to Motion No. 1 which effectively 
accomplish the same thing.  We have general support to move in 
the same direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government Motion No. 14 only partially addresses concerns 
regarding the management of toxic substances.  Our Motion No. 13 
is preferable to Motion No. 14 which is not adequate and is only 
a marginal improvement.  It is critical that we do not consider 
use of toxic substances separately from the release of toxic 
substances as this derogates from the risk based principles that 
are intended to be the foundation of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to be quite interesting as we go through all of 
this. Motions from three different parties which are worded 
somewhat differently could eventually work out to be the same 
thing.  It is important how the groupings take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is inherent toxicity.  Amendments put forward by 
the Reform Party and the government also address this issue. 
Inherent toxicity has been left undefined in this bill as a 
result of the committee amendments.  If inherent toxicity is left 
undefined, it could lead to substances being proposed for virtual 
elimination without their going through the traditional risk 
assessment.  Our proposals address this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Motion No. 87 ensures that substances that have been 
determined to be toxic by risk assessment, not by the minister, 
can go to virtual elimination.  Motion No. 87 ensures that the 
decision making is scientific rather than political. 
Government Motion No. 88 addresses the same concern.  However its 
amendment does not go far enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end here because we will have other opportunities to 
speak as we go through this process.  We have eight groupings so 
we can speak eight times to the issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
quite evident from the interventions by the Reform Party that it 
wants a weaker bill.  It wants a bill that loses its original 
intent and mandate in a manner which makes it extremely weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words used by the member for Lethbridge is also interesting. 
He talked about the players in the game and that we must be a 
leader.  The question is in what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the member for Lethbridge nor his other Reform Party 
colleague referred to public health once. Their main concern is 
the quite evident preoccupation with the industrial side of this 
bill and not with its health side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might as well call a spade a spade and make it clear that 
Reform has been on the wrong tack with this bill from the word 
go.  It has also supported in committee every attempt to weaken 
this bill as it is doing here in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary to the minister was quite right when 
she referred in her intervention to this bill being a reasonably 
strong bill.  She went as far as to describe it in very positive 
terms. That description would only be valid if the amendments by 
the government at report stage are not carried.  If they are, 
then this bill will be weak and it will not perform the intent 
that was expressed so well and so clearly by the government in 
1995 when it replied to the report of the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development entitled “It's about our 
Health”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the limited time available I will try to address Motions Nos. 
2, 14, 67 and 88. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 would eliminate the words “to phase out the 
generation and use of the most persistent”.  “The generation 
and use” are important words.  We put them in at committee. 
Actually it was “to phase out the generation”.  We thought in 
the long term that a bill whose aims are the prevention of 
pollution and the protection of public health should have an 
indication of that nature in the preamble. Therefore this 
amendment should be resisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 14 is an amendment whereby in the administrative 
duties of the government the products of biotechnology would be 
deleted. It is very unfortunate that the government would see fit 
to present such a motion. It implies that the products of 
biotechnology should be the domain of just one department, namely 
the Department of Industry, as if biotechnology is a matter of 
economic concern alone.  That is wrong.  Biotechnology touches on 
a number of values that go far beyond the economic values and 
concerns of society. Therefore the deletion of the products of 
biotechnology from clause 2(1)(j) ought to be resisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to an item that has already been raised by others 
and quite understandably so, namely virtual elimination.  We must 
be very clear in trying to convey to the public what it is all 
about.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill came out of committee, as it now stands before us 
before any amendment, the matter of eliminating, so to say in 
vague terms, toxic substances would be the prerogative of the 
ministers.  The ministers, as the bill reads right now, shall 
make regulations respecting allowable releases. It is left to the 
two responsible ministers, environment and health, to make that 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment being proposed by the government says that there 
would have to be a precondition before this could take place.  In 
other words an obstacle is set in the way of the two ministers. 
Namely the specification by the ministers of the level of 
quantification for each substance on this famous list called 
virtual elimination would be a precondition to the making of the 
regulation.  This is a considerable weakening of the clause as it 
is presently in the bill and when it came from committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that we have yielded to pressures, to 
lobbyists.  We have somehow decided to put forward an amendment, 
and it is most unfortunate that the government would have done 
that, that is watering down and weakening the handling of the 
very central issue in the bill of virtual elimination of toxic 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtual elimination is a central key issue which requires 
considerable debate and not just the few minutes that are 
available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that was conceived in committee of the ultimate 
reduction of toxic substances has disappeared.  There is no clear 
requirement to continue as it is intended to ratchet down the 
limits of release.  The proposed amendment will legitimize the 
continued use of toxic substances which is a very unfortunate 
development. Therefore, I would urge colleagues not to vote for 
this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 88 deals with the question of inherent toxicity. This 
amendment is extremely difficult to explain in the course of this 
debate.  Again it weakens the bill because it removes the 
possibility of having access to a faster track for the 
elimination of harmful substances.  It is an amendment that ought 
to be rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment seriously weakens the work of the committee whose 
permanent members attempted very conscientiously to find ways of 
reinforcing the thrust of the bill with the main purpose of the 
bill in mind, namely that of preventing pollution and of 
protecting human health.  We are dealing here with some very 
dangerous substances.  We are dealing here with a process that 
requires some clear measures that aim at the long term 
elimination of substances that are harmful to human health and to 
the environment.

to reject the major amendments in Group No. 1, and particularly 
the ones that I referred to in my brief presentation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32, 
which is now at report stage, proposes to renew the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses the following aspects: pollution prevention, 
toxic substances, air and water purity, pollution control and 
waste, environmental emergencies, biotechnology, federal 
government operations on federal and aboriginal land, 
administration and application of penalties, information 
gathering, guidelines and codes of practice, and finally, public 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act may be full of good intentions, but it is equally full 
of imprecision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that the study of Bill C-32 started back 
in the fall of 1998, and ran until April 1999.  After 60 
sittings, a total of 580 amendments had been submitted during 
the clause by clause examination of the bill.  The committee 
adopted 160 of them.  As a result, the bill is inconsistent in 
many regards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most critical point in this bill is, in my opinion, the lack 
of harmonization with the provinces.  While the original version 
called for the federal government to act within the spirit of 
intergovernmental agreements, the government majority softened 
that requirement by adding the words “endeavour to” before the 
word “act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois maintains that the federal government must 
always work within a framework of harmonization with the 
provinces, with a view to avoiding duplication and overlap of 
legislation and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Quebec has its own specific nature, we insist on being 
allowed to speak for ourselves when our interests are at stake. 
Despite the fact that, in theory, Bill C-32 acknowledges that the 
environment is a shared responsibility between the federal and 
provincial governments, in practice it delegates no powers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-32 is to enhance still further the federal 
government's preponderance as far as environmental protection is 
concerned.  That is the major point on which amendments are 
required.  Otherwise the situation will get worse instead of 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of products of biotechnology, the bill 
establishes a federal safety net and the authority to make 
regulations for the safe and effective use of biotechnology for 
environmental purposes.  Clauses 104 to 115 apply here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean?  Where are we in the vital matter of 
biotechnologies?  Who is prepared to educate the public?  In 
what area does the bill require products of biotechnology that 
meet international standards and are subject to recognized 
scientific rules?  When will we deal with labelling?  Who, in 
the government, will finally take the lead in this matter and 
not look at biotechnology only in terms of toxicity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weakness of clauses 104 to 115 and their approach to the 
subject of biotechnology is a bit confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect of the harmonization of this bill with 
the provincial governments I consider very important. 
It is a field of jurisdiction in which the Province of Quebec is 
at the forefront and needs no help the federal government.  I am 
referring to the control of water, land and air pollution in 
agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec pork producers complete the agri-environmental picture of 
their farms.  Each farm is studied to determine its physical 
characteristics, level of pollution, production capacity and 
quantity of input so that the impact of the pork producers on 
their community is known quasi scientifically.  It is easy 
therefore to correct discrepancies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This picture will be extended to other farming activities.  It 
is a procedure that is unique in North America and a real 
agri-environmental realization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in Quebec are also required to produce an 
agri-environmental plan, which is a management tool or an 
integrated fertilization plan for farms.  These plans are done by 
professionals or farmers who have taken courses and proper 
training.  This is an example of making this community 
responsible, which has already proven effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we have faith in our provincial 
government, which is a leader in environmental matters and must 
be given full latitude in areas under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the amendments adopted in committee, the Bloc 
Quebecois opposes this bill at report stage and third reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in any 
legislation, words are powerful. Through them public opinion and 
the courts can judge legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as powerful as words may be, any piece of legislation 
is much more than its wording and words. Indeed, any act of 
parliament is also an expression and a symbol of the primary 
objective and intent of the government proposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, any act of parliament includes certain words and 
provisions, which, because of the pertinence of their meaning 
and intent, carry a critical significance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 10 minutes which are allowed to me I can dwell only on a 
few key elements of the very strong reservations I have regarding 
certain amendments now before us to Bill C-32, concerning the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first strong reservation I have relates to the issue 
referred to as inherent toxicity.  The bill, as it now stands, 
provides under clause 77 that if the Ministers of the Environment 
and Health are satisfied that a substance may cause lasting harm 
because it is persistent and biocumulative and that it is 
inherently toxic to human beings and other living species, the 
ministers can recommend that the substance be added to the 
official list of toxic substances and, in some cases, earmarked 
for virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the recommendation of big industry, the chemical industry, 
the mining industry and other sectors of big business, we are now 
faced with amendments which will make it immensely more difficult 
for the ministers to act.  Indeed, before they can exercise any 
judgment or discretion as to the danger of a substance, the 
substance must have already been determined to be toxic or 
capable of becoming toxic, according to the provisions of the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a huge departure from the current test.  It effectively 
nullifies the powers of the two ministers to take prompt action 
on being satisfied that a substance is inherently toxic and thus 
dangerous for human health and the environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, under the amendment proposed by big industry, which 
is now before us, a protracted risk assessment would be required. 
To quote one of the committee's main expert advisors during the 
clause by clause study of the bill, this amendment is “very 
significant”.  He said “The proposed change would gut the bill 
of the significant direction taken in this clause toward inherent 
toxicity”.  This advisor sat with us throughout the total 
revision of the original CEPA bill of 1988.  He is one of the 
foremost experts, an environmental lawyer who has sat through all 
the various revisions, the amendments and the complete work of 
the committee so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the inherent toxicity concept was 
endorsed by the government in its 1995 official response to the 
committee's report of the same year, entitled “It's about our 
Health”, and was reflected as well in the predecessor to Bill 
C-32, namely Bill C-74, which died on the order paper prior to 
the 1997 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second main reservation concerns the concept of virtual 
elimination of toxic substances.  The original wording of the 
virtual elimination provision contained in the bill when it was 
sent to the standing committee for study was judged by the 
government to be too convoluted and confusing, with which we 
agreed fully.  Therefore, under the direction of the Deputy 
Minister of Environment Canada a new clause was submitted to the 
committee as an amendment to the original one.  It was moved by 
the parliamentary secretary in committee and passed with the 
backing of a large majority.  I am sure the Reform Party was 
against it because it was against every provision which related 
to the protection of the environment and human health when it 
affected industry.  The Reform Party is traditionally onside with 
big industry, so when I say the backing of a large majority, I am 
certain that Reform would systematically be against it, as it is 
against any provision that speaks of human health and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government wants to amend its own clause.  Big business 
has asked for the amendment and we have accepted significant 
recommendations of big business and amended the clause 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote excerpts from a letter from a group of 
industrial concerns which was written to the government and to 
all MPs of all stripes.  This group consists of the Alliance of 
Manufacturers and Exporters of Canada, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce, the Canadian Chemical Producers Association, the 
Canadian Electricity Association, the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, the 
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the Canadian Steel 
Producers, Dow Chemical, Imperial Oil, and the Mining Association 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what they said, among other things: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless changes are made, results such as requirements to shut 
down wood-burning stoves, or municipal waste incinerators in 
Newfoundland's fishing villages would be the outcome. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No less than the president and CEO of Alcan Aluminum wrote to 
the government to say, among other things: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the act could force the closure of all aluminum smelters in 
Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that kind of language is not total fearmongering, I do not 
know what is.  This is total fearmongering.  As if all aluminum 
smelters in Canada would close because Bill C-32 would be in 
force.  If it was not so sad it would be a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time does not permit me to go into a detailed review of the big 
business amendments proposed, except to say that the current 
version of virtual elimination in the bill is far better for the 
environment and human health and should be kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, time does not allow me to cover other aspects of 
other amendments with which I fundamentally disagree in Group No. 
1, such as the dilution of the powers of the Ministers of the 
Environment and Health in favour of decisions made by the 
cabinet, which was an alternative strongly endorsed by big 
business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ministry of the Environment forms a part of the economic 
union committee of cabinet.  It is interesting to note that the 
co-sponsor of the bill, the Minister of Health, sits on the 
social union committee, a different committee.  It carries very 
little weight compared with much larger and more powerful 
ministries such as industry and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved with the original Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act since this work started five years ago.  It has 
occupied a significant part of my time since my election in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it reached the standing committee I considered Bill C-32 to 
be a weak reflection of our commitments in the 1993 and 1997 red 
books.  After a large amount of diligent work by all members of 
the committee, I felt that Bill C-32, as amended in committee, 
although nowhere as strong as I would have wanted it to be, was a 
step forward and I fully intended to support it.  I still do. 
However amendments brought by the government have in my view so 
diluted certain key provisions of the bill that I find myself 
unable to support the bill if such amendments are passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a deeply committed environmentalist this saddens me greatly, 
but I dare to hope and continue to hope that between now and 
then, before all these steps are taken, before Bill C-32 is 
finally passed, that the bill may be restored to the state in 
which it is today.  I hope that it will not leave that state and 
that these amendments will be defeated, at least the amendments 
which make it a weaker bill for the environment and human health. 
This is my fondest hope, because I certainly wish to vote for the 
bill if it is in the condition in which it is today.  I hope it 
stays that way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will exempt three members of the Liberal Party from my recent 
statement.  They are the members for Davenport, Lac-Saint-Louis 
and York North.  I happen to know these three members of the 
Liberal Party are deeply concerned about the environment.  I know 
this because I have spoken to them and I have seen them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for York North, through a lot of hard work and 
diligence on her part, just organized an eco-summit in the House 
of Commons.  My comments to her are very sincere.  We have heard 
prestigious people in Canada tell us their concerns regarding our 
environment, especially when it comes to air quality.  I hope she 
can promise us that she will not allow the government to gut Bill 
C-32 as it is in its current state.  If it is not in that state, 
I hope she votes against her government on this most important 
principle for the future of future generations and other species 
we share the country with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A classic example of how business and friends of the government 
are putting pressure on the government in order to change the 
regulations is the aquaculture industry in Nova Scotia.  It 
issues a paper called “Aquanotes”.  I could not believe when I 
read it the other day.  It said that Bill C-32 was coming down 
the pike.  The environment committee was concerned about the 
chemicals, the additives and the pharmaceuticals going into fish 
products being produced in open net systems.  Its comments were: 
“Watch out everybody, the battle has just begun”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would assume that a burgeoning industry like aquaculture 
would want a full environmental assessment and review of its day 
to day activities in order to protect and to advise the citizens 
of this country and of nations to which we export seafood that it 
is a healthy and very good product for them to consume.  Why 
would the industry want to fight against any kind of 
environmental protection?  It is in its best interest to work 
with environmental organizations and the provincial and federal 
environment departments to come up with the best solutions for 
the industry to convince and protect our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that we as a nation have destroyed our inland 
fish stocks and on all three coasts.  Now we are to grow fish in 
pens.  We have absolutely no scientific or biological evidence on 
how to do it properly and the aquaculture industry fights tooth 
and nail on every environmental aspect.  It is unbelievable that 
it would want to do that.  One would think it would want to work 
with us in order to come up with long term solutions which will 
benefit it and our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a conversation I had when I participated in an 
environment committee hearing.  Bloc, Conservative, Reform, 
Liberal and NDP members who participated in the marathon of 
lengthy Bill C-32 CEPA debates deserve the Order of Canada.  On 
and on and on they went.  They were very lengthy.  There were 
some heated exchanges and there were some very long exchanges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP put forward 100 amendments.  That is our record.  The member 
for Churchill River, a Metis aboriginal person, is so concerned 
about the environment that he always tells us in caucus that we 
have to use the seven generation principle.  Whatever we do on 
this planet today, we must think about the seven generations down 
the road.  What effect will it have on our great, great, great 
grandchildren?  That is very worthy advice.  We should all heed 
that very simple warning from our first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question in early April 1998 of the then deputy 
minister of the environment, Mr. Ian Glen.  I asked him whether 
he had adequate human and financial resources to do his job 
properly.  Mr. Glen replied “The fair answer, and I think it is 
becoming abundantly clear to people, is no”.  He went to say 
that was one of the challenges they had within their 
organization.  I bet if I asked that question today I would get 
an even more resounding no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government come in with Bill C-32.  It was a mess when it 
came to committee.  The committee in its wisdom put forth 800 
amendments.  As the member for Lac-Saint-Louis just said, it is 
not as strong as we would like but in its current form it is a 
pretty good compromise.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a statement the other day at the eco-summit because a few 
years ago when the current heritage minister was the environment 
minister she was quoted in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> as saying 
that she could not wait to get out of the lowly environment 
department and get a higher profile.  That is what the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> said a few years back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the other day I asked some very prominent people why in 
federal and provincial legislatures the environment department is 
placed at the bottom of the list of cabinet ministers while the 
finance, industry, treasury board and trade ministers are at the 
top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the environment these people would have nothing.  It 
should be reversed.  Everything around us and everything we do is 
contained within our environment.  I make a passionate plea to 
all hon. members to turn their thinking around.  Without fresh 
air, clean air, clean soil and water, without the biodiversity of 
the other species we share the planet with, we are nothing.  We 
are just skin, bones and minerals.  That is all we are.  If we 
cannot think in those terms we are doomed in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Louis talked about big industries 
saying that all the plants would shut down.  What a load of bunk. 
It is an absolute load of crap.  I am sorry to say that but the 
member is absolutely right.  It is just a threat that we should 
ignore.  We have to understand that we must make environmental 
protection as strong as we possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remaining time I wish to thank the following people for 
their efforts.  First I thank Mr. Don Maclean for trying to 
prevent an expressway through the largest urban park in North 
America, the Red Hill Creek.  He tried to stop that expressway so 
that people could go from one place to another faster. It would 
have destroyed the air quality of the Hamilton area and we do not 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank Mr. Paul Muldoon, Ms. Elizabeth May of the Sierra 
Club and Mr. Mark Butler of the Ecology Action Centre.  There are 
many others I could mention.  These men and women are dedicated 
to preserving our environment, to working with federal and 
provincial governments of all political stripes in order that we 
can live in harmony with our planet and we can share our 
resources for seven generations down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not, as many other people have mentioned before me, we 
will be doomed.  That will be the end of it because without a 
proper environment we can kiss our ass goodbye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  A lot of people have a lot of things to say about the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address one of the issues that an hon. member has 
already raised and that is the amendment to make changes to 
section 77(3), which deals with the removal of inherent toxicity. 
The government response in 1996 agreed with the standing 
committee that virtual elimination can be proposed for substances 
that are inherently toxic.  Bill C-74 in 1996 also agreed with 
that.  When the current bill, Bill C-32, came before the 
committee it also agreed with this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a lot of arguments on the issue of including inherent 
toxicity within the CEPA toxic definition.  I was told that that 
was unacceptable and it could be handled in other ways, for 
example, in section 77(3).  Therefore, I am very concerned that 
inherent toxicity has been taken out of this section.  In the 
words that have already been uttered in this place by someone who 
has worked as a consultant and an environmental lawyer on this 
very legislation, this proposed amendment is very significant and 
would gut the bill of the significant direction taken in this 
clause toward inherent toxicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two other issues that I would like to address deal with Motions 
Nos. 1 and 2, the phase-out of generation and use, and the 
motions dealing with virtual elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original definition of virtual elimination, as worded in 
Bill C-32, was seen to be too convoluted, conflicting and 
confusing to be effectively implemented.  Under the advice of the 
Deputy Minister of Environment Canada, the government moved to 
amend the wording of virtual elimination in Bill C-32.  This 
change adopts word for word the definition used in the 1995 toxic 
substance management policy, a policy adopted by the government 
in a multi-stakeholder process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to underscore for the House that it has been 
acceptable to industry for the past four years, yet in recent 
weeks and months industry lobbyists have mounted an assault on 
this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new amendment to Bill C-32 , if accepted, would diverge from 
the toxic substance management policy.  Virtual elimination, as 
defined in the bill, will not shut down plants as asserted by 
industry.  If this policy has been in effect for the past four 
years, why is investment not flooding out of this country?  It is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind colleagues that while we are making 
decisions on a national piece of legislation, the effect of our 
decisions on virtual elimination will affect an international 
process that we are currently undergoing around the issue of 
persistent organic pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of this bill is the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, an act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of 
the environment and human health in order to contribute to 
sustainable development.  This is not a sustainable development 
bill as asserted by the Reform Party.  Get it straight, guys. 
This is a bill about the protection of the environment and human 
health.  It only contributes to sustainable development.  It is 
not a sustainable development bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that deletes “generation and use” from the preamble 
will make it difficult to prevent pollution.  By focusing only on 
the reduction of the release of pollution, it will make it 
difficult to work toward preventing pollution.  Disasters such as 
Bhopal and other minor but more frequent incidents such as 
accidental discharges and spills result from the misguided notion 
of relying on containment only.

for example, by the UN, the OECD and the North American 
Commission for Environmental Co-operation, recognize that this is 
folly.  They are moving toward use reduction and not just 
focusing on release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution prevention is a stated policy of the government.  The 
bill, as it is before the House, with the inclusion of the 
reduction of generation and use, would better ensure pollution 
prevention.  Its approaches, as I have mentioned, are closer to 
what is happening in the U.S. and Europe.  If we allow this 
amendment to go through simply focusing on release will not be 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask hon. colleagues to consider how they want to define 
themselves and what it is that they want to stand for.  If we 
want a bill that actually works toward the protection of the 
health of Canadians and the environment of Canadians we have to 
defeat the amendments that weaken this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague, the member 
for Jonquière, on the excellent work she has done in recent 
weeks on this issue.  As the former environment critic, I passed 
on to her all the material I had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having frequently discussed the bill with her, I think the 
member for Jonquière has done a good job of incorporating the 
concept of sustainable development favoured by the United 
Nations commission on the environment and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fundamental concept, developed and put forward by Norway's 
Prime Minister Brundtland, clearly states that any economic 
development must now take environmental concerns into 
consideration.  It is important that this be noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever it has taken a position on environmental issues, the 
Bloc Quebecois has always borne in mind this fundamental concept 
that economic development must respect the environment.  The 
member for Jonquière covered it well during her statements in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I am proud to take part in this debate.  Basically, Bill 
C-32 introduces provisions to implement pollution prevention, new 
procedures for the investigation and assessment of substances, 
and new requirements with respect to substances that the 
Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health have 
determined to be toxic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of such substances is extensive and a few examples are 
in order.  Investigators will be given new powers and there will 
be new regulatory measures to deal with offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago, some sensational statements were made.  A 
number of senior officials of the Department of the Environment 
wondered very openly—and this was mentioned by the member who 
spoke before me—whether their department could still monitor 
offending businesses, so draconian had the cuts been.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having sat on the standing committee on the environment with 
some of my colleagues from across the floor, I remember the 
eloquent representations that were to be reflected in the report 
tabled by the committee.  This is a report that was rather 
staunchly defended by committee members a few months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report pointed out the lack of resources available to 
investigators.  Today, it is said, we want to improve the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, commonly known as CEPA. 
However, it is regrettable that the Minister of Finance is not 
here today, as we undertake the debate to renew that act. 
It should be pointed out that investigators are not given the 
means to do their job properly.  This is deplorable, if we 
basically want to ensure better environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we must answer on this side of the House as 
representatives of Quebec is what powers will the renewed CEPA 
delegate to Quebec and the other provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although in theory Bill C-32 recognizes that responsibility for 
the environment is shared between the federal government and the 
provinces, in practice it delegates no powers to them.  And this 
runs counter to real environmental harmonization between the 
various levels of government. Bill C-32 unfortunately aims at 
strengthening the federal government's preponderance in the 
field of environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This centralization runs counter to the clearly expressed wish 
of the Quebec National Assembly to participate fully in the 
environmental assessment of any project on its territory. The 
bill is also in flagrant contradiction with the spirit of the 
harmonization process launched between the federal government 
and the provinces. This is why the Government of Quebec has 
pulled out of negotiations, and is looking further into this 
promising process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill thus opens the door to duplication of federal and 
provincial powers. The federal government is justifying its 
interference in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction by invoking the 
recent supreme court decision with respect to Hydro-Québec. This 
case has always been contested by Quebec. All the courts that 
ruled on it, including Quebec's highest court, the Court of 
Appeal, declared the federal government's order invalid. 
Only the supreme court, with its unitary vision of Canada, 
overturned the Quebec court rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 also contains a number of new features. For instance, 
the government wants to replace the existing federal-provincial 
CEPA committee with a new national advisory committee. This 
committee would consist of one representative each from 
Environment Canada and Health Canada, one representative from 
each province and territory, and up to six aboriginal 
representatives. This committee will advise the two federal 
ministers on the drafting of regulations, the management of 
toxic substances, and other matters of mutual interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot understand why the bill clashes with the 
harmonization the government claims to have as a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that Quebec refused to sign the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of the Environment agreement on January 29, 
1998. When the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment 
met at that time, Quebec Environment Minister Paul Bégin refused 
to subscribe to that agreement, as long as the conditions called 
for by Quebec are not met by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions include recognizing that Quebec has primary 
jurisdiction in certain areas, under the Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK287">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should defend section 43 of the Criminal Code in the 
courts and should invoke the notwithstanding clause of the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms if necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to speak to Motion 
No. 528, a motion that would protect parents and their children 
from state intrusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that in the opinion of this House, the 
government should defend section 43 of the Criminal Code in the 
courts. If the government does that, then all is fine and well 
and we may carry the day with that. It should also be prepared to 
invoke the notwithstanding clause of the charter of rights and 
freedoms if necessary.  We believe that vigorous defence of 
section 43 of the Criminal Code in the courts would not even 
require that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under current law parents are allowed to use physical correction 
to discipline their children, as long as it is not abusive and is 
reasonable under the circumstances.  The relevant statute is 
section 43 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a 
parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a 
pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the 
force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the enactment of this section of the code there was no 
legislation placing limits on the use of physical correction, nor 
were there any government agencies to protect children from 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was precisely to protect children from abuse that section 43 
of the Criminal Code was passed into law.  Now thanks to section 
43, parents cannot physically abuse their children in the name of 
discipline.  As long as the police and the courts do their jobs, 
child abusers will be prosecuted under the law.  In my view they 
ought to be, to the very full extent of the law and right up to 
the supreme court if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very ironic therefore that some people who want to remove 
section 43 from the Criminal Code argue that it only protects 
parents' rights when in fact parliament's original intent in 
framing section 43 was to protect children.  These so-called 
child advocates have totally missed the point.  They have missed 
the wise intention of parliament in giving us this part of the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason section 43 strikes that necessary balance 
between the rights of parents and the rights of children. On the 
one hand, parents must have the freedom to fulfil their 
responsibility to their children and to society to raise their 
children to be moral and decent people who respect others.  On 
the other hand, children have the right to be free from physical 
abuse and bodily harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 strikes that appropriate balance.  It is a good law 
that was well conceived, which has served its purpose well and 
continues to serve us well today. 
That is why I find it very disconcerting that some children's 
rights advocates want to see section 43 declared by the courts to 
be in violation of the charter of rights and freedoms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This past fall a group which was thrown together very quickly 
called Justice for Children and Youth submitted an application to 
the Ontario court, general division asking the court to declare 
section 43 to be in violation of the charter and therefore 
unconstitutional.  This case will be heard sometime in the coming 
months.  If this group succeeds in having section 43 struck down, 
the results would be absurd and totally unacceptable in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all many good and loving parents would be made into 
criminals overnight and could be charged under the Criminal Code. 
That would be a disgrace to our judicial system.  The public 
gets frustrated enough when they hear about bizarre court rulings 
as we have had in Saskatchewan or B.C. or elsewhere, rulings that 
pose a threat to their freedoms and the well-being of their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If section 43 of the Criminal Code were to be struck down, the 
massive intrusion of the state into the private sphere that would 
result boggles the mind.  Trudeau said that the state has no 
business being in the bedrooms of the nation, but anyone who 
removes section 43 will be moving the state right into the 
nation's family rooms.  That would be tragic.  The state makes a 
lousy parent and the state should not presume to tell parents how 
best to shape the moral character of their children as long as 
abuse is not involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have introduced this motion calling on the 
government to defend section 43 of the Criminal Code in the 
courts and to invoke the notwithstanding clause of the charter of 
rights and freedoms if necessary.  We believe that would only be 
a last resort.  If it does this vigorous defence of section 43 in 
the courts we will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this motion is to enable caring non-abusive parents 
to do the best job possible of raising their children to be 
responsible well-adjusted individuals and members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 actually protects the rights of parents to raise 
their children in accordance with their moral and religious 
beliefs about effective child rearing.  It protects the rights of 
parents to raise their children in accordance with their personal 
knowledge of the unique characteristics of their children.  It 
also protects the rights of parents to raise their children in 
accordance with their understanding of how best to discipline 
children and to gain from their parents, to gain from other 
training and to gain from their own experiences during childhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today accomplishes this goal in two ways. 
First, it requires that the government defend section 43 of the 
Criminal Code in the courts, to defend it vigorously and to use 
the best law resources in that defence.  Second, in the event 
that one or more court rulings strikes down section 43, then the 
motion would commit the government to invoke the notwithstanding 
clause of the charter of rights and freedoms. Notwithstanding a 
court's decision to strike down the law, section 43 would then 
remain the law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Shaw decision in British Columbia on the right to have 
child pornography, I think that parliamentarians more than ever 
understand and realize that parliament has an obligation to 
protect Canadians from nonsensical judicial rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While parenting has always been a challenge, raising children to 
be responsible and law-abiding members of society is more of a 
challenge today than ever before.  The surge in violence during 
past decades testifies to this.  The recent shootings in high 
schools in the U.S. and Canada have horrified all of us.  Now is 
not the time to handcuff parents in their role as moral guides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons, I have brought forward this 
initiative. I will read it into the record again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should defend 
section 43 of the Criminal Code in the courts and should invoke 
the notwithstanding clause of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
if necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the unanimous consent of the House to have the motion 
before us deemed adopted and passed at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
motion be deemed adopted and passed at this time?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  I would like to take the rest of my 
time to address some of the arguments that are used by those who 
oppose any form of physical correction.  We might hear some of 
those arguments today from different members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, how will this group, Justice for Children and 
Youth, argue in court against section 43?  Maybe some of the very 
statements we will find in a somewhat empty way coming from the 
other side of the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Justice for Children and Youth will argue that section 43 
violates the charter of rights and freedoms because it 
discriminates on the basis of age.  It will point out that 
because adults are protected by the law from assault, children 
should be protected from physical discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with that argument is that a swat on the bottom that 
gets a toddler's attention but which does not bruise or do 
physical harm is hardly analogous to an assault by one adult 
against another. In the case of adults, the intent is to do harm 
and the victim often winds up in the hospital.  In the case of 
discipline by loving parents, the intention is simply to offer a 
negative consequence or, we might say, feedback for persistent 
misbehaviour and the child is in no way physically harmed by the 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when it gets to court this advocacy group is going to 
argue that physical discipline instead of changing a child's 
behaviour for the better causes aggressive tendencies in 
children.  The assumption is that the child will imitate mom and 
dad.  If mom and dad use physical discipline, the child who 
receives that discipline will start hitting others.  When this 
argument gets made, we are going to see the absurd in the court 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Academics who do research in the field of pediatrics are 
currently engaged in a debate over the effects of physical 
discipline on children.  Does it improve compliance among 
children or does it increase aggressiveness?  That is the 
question being asked by academic people.  The debate can be 
highly technical.  It is clear there is no scholarly consensus 
that has emerged in all the issues.  In fact, many scholars agree 
that there is a woeful lack of research being done in this area, 
prompting some of them to call for greater attention and 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that this debate in academic halls is still very 
much in its infancy.  Yet in the near future that debate is going 
to shift from the academic journals into the courts.  A judge 
with no study and no academic background in this area is going to 
be hearing conflicting interpretations of research results and 
will have to make a decision.  This shows just how absurd the 
situation with our courts has become under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any interest group citing supposed research studies can walk 
into a courtroom and try to convince a judge that research shows 
that this or that is the case and that the charter is being 
violated.  It is really an abuse of the court system, something 
the court system was never intended for, with judges being asked 
to settle academic research questions.  That is the role of 
parliament. That is the role of this place.  That is the role of 
committees in calling expert witnesses before committees when 
there is time for that kind of thing.  Judges are not to make 
laws; they are simply to rule on the laws that are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the research say about the effects of physical 
discipline on children?  Does physical correction have positive 
outcomes or negative outcomes?  Has it led to improved behaviour 
in children or has the misbehaviour continued accompanied by new 
aggressive tendencies?  In one sense the researchers have come to 
contradictory conclusions, as I have indicated. Some studies have 
found negative outcomes, others positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to describe why the conclusions have varied so much 
by referring to the work of Dr. Robert Larzelere, of the 
University of Nebraska medical school.  He published in the 
<I>Journal of Pediatrics</I>, one of the most important resources 
on this very topic.  He undertook a literature review of studies 
published in scholarly journals in the last 30 years.  He studied 
35 relevant articles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something rather important for us to note is that many of those 
studies, in fact the sum total of 24 of them, did not leave 
abusive dysfunctional family situations out of the research.  In 
fact it came down to only being 11 of the studies that excluded 
abusive family situations.  Of these 11 that left abusive family 
situations out of the research altogether, six of those studies 
showed beneficial outcomes, four of them showed neutral outcomes 
and only one showed negatived outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That suggests that when used properly by parents who truly love 
their children, physical correction has positive results and no 
negative results.  Based on these studies, Dr. Larzelere was able 
to be specific about the kind of physical punishment that brings 
beneficial results.  On average he found that in a loving, 
responsible, functional home situation there were beneficial 
results when corporal correction was used less than weekly.

when it was used by parents who were not physically violent 
against family members, for example a father beating a wife or 
vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were beneficial results when it was used without a 
potentially damaging instrument.  With corporal correction there 
were beneficial results when used from ages two to six.  There 
were beneficial results when it was used privately, not in 
public.  There were beneficial results when it was used with 
reasoning and explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were beneficial results when it was used with a moderate 
level of child distress.  As well, there were beneficial results 
when corporal correction was used primarily as a back up for 
other methods of discipline.  This back up threat made reasoning 
and time out more effective, so the need for physical punishment 
decreased over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beneficial results occurred when corporal correction was used by 
loving parents who were positively involved with their child and 
had child oriented motivations.  It was not about the parent.  It 
was about the rearing and the constructive raising of that child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporal correction did not increase the child's fear of 
parental discipline.  It was beneficial when parents co-operated 
with each other in discipline responsibilities and did not use 
verbal putdowns.  Corporal correction is also beneficial when 
parents change their main discipline method to grounding when 
their children got older. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on those 11 studies that excluded abusive family 
situations, physical correction was seen to have positive results 
in six of the studies, neutral results in four, and negative 
results in one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would contend in view of this information that many of the 
studies had some flawed methodology weaknesses.  Of the 35 
studies, in fact 24 did.  Of the other 11 studies it was found 
that on the basis of positive, responsible parenting in other 
ways there was positive benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my summary at the end of the hour I will refer to some 
follow-up research done by Marjorie Gunnoe, some very extensive 
confirmation of these findings.  Again I ask for unanimous 
consent for this motion to be deemed adopted in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
motion be deemed adopted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government has no difficulty with a great deal of the hon. 
member for Wanuskewin's address.  We do have difficulty with the 
introduction and the tail of his motion of a subsidiary proposal 
of constitutional change.  That is something I will address a 
little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to section 43 of the Criminal Code, it is very clear 
that Canadian criminal law does not condone or authorize the 
abuse of children.  Section 43 in its context is merely a limited 
defence to a charge of assault.  There are several key points 
which we should emphasize.  It only applies to a parent, teacher 
or person acting in the place of a parent and only in respect to 
a pupil or child under that person's care.  The person is only 
permitted to use this defence if force was used for the purpose 
of correction.  A person who uses force in a fit of rage or in 
order to hurt a child cannot claim section 43 as a defence. 
Finally, on the issue of proportionality, the force used must be 
reasonable in the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A court asked to consider applying section 43 in any given case 
would look at the nature of the child's behaviour or action 
calling for correction, as well as the age of the child, the 
severity of the punishment, including any injuries suffered by 
the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When determining whether the force used is reasonable the 
standard is the community standard of reasonableness.  There is a 
warning that if one goes beyond these limits one may find oneself 
before a criminal court, and in appropriate cases criminal 
prosecution will be pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on the more general issue that we felt we should add some 
comments to what the hon. member for Wanuskewin said.  Lawmaking 
in Canada follows Jeremy Benthan's euphemism that law is not made 
by judge alone; it is made by judge and company.  There is a 
continuum in the law making process.  Judges, university law 
schools, law reviews and the legal profession have put in their 
criticisms.  To a very considerable extent our courts have 
developed a highly nuanced relationship with the rest of the 
legal company.  Courts very rarely say tout court, that is out, 
that is illegal. 
They offer suggestions for changes and modifications and the 
sensible response of a ministry of justice is to consider these, 
to take them into account and to come back afresh.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is ordinary legislation.  It is not constitutional law.  It 
can be changed, as can any court decision on it, by subsequent 
legislation if parliament thinks so fit.  This is in fact a 
fairly normal operation with criminal law today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal company involved in monitoring the Criminal Code is 
very large and very well informed.  It has contributed 
significantly to the progressive evolution of our criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the notwithstanding clause I should express the reservations 
which I advanced in an earlier debate concerning the B.C. 
decision, the intermediate court decision in the child 
pornography case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there seems to be a certain misunderstanding of the 
history and the nature of the notwithstanding clause.  Perhaps 
this is understandable if we consider that the premiers who 
insisted on putting it into the charter of rights may again be 
said not to have been fully aware of the constitutional 
implications of what they were dealing with.  There were not very 
many constitutional scholars among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, the notwithstanding clause is a prior issue.  It 
is addressed to a government introducing new legislation.  One 
can put it in there if one wishes, but Mr. Trudeau said that it 
would be a tragedy if any federal parliament decided to use the 
notwithstanding clause in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, the only significant use of it has been in a 
fit of haste, the reaction of the premier of Quebec toward what 
he felt was the way the gang of eight premiers behaved in 
relation to the adoption of Constitution Act, 1982, and the 
charter of rights.  We would regard it as a regrettable step 
backward if the federal government were to use the 
notwithstanding clause.  There are other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the United States Supreme Court where there is an 
unbridgable gap or barrier between the courts and Congress, and 
where one has to get a constitutional amendment, essentially, to 
overturn a judicial decision.  Hon. members will be aware that 
when the United States court outlawed income taxation on 
constitutional grounds it took a constitutional amendment to 
override that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our situation is different and, in relation to the criminal law, 
if parliament should think that the court has misconstrued the 
careful balance, the pragmatic balance that it has made in 
relation to section 43, it is open to parliament to make 
amendment.  It is open for the legal community as a whole to 
offer the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context we would reaffirm that the notwithstanding 
clause is, and I think this was the view of Mr. Trudeau, a 
constitutional aberration.  I would reaffirm that it is wrong to 
use it, as has been suggested with very little care or thought, 
as a method of appeal from a judgment of an intermediate court as 
was proposed in relation to the British Columbia judgment.  The 
appeal process must go its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislature, this parliament, which is a vestigial court in 
its own right by the way, is bound by doctrines of comity and 
mutual respect to co-ordinate institutions of government.  It 
would be quite inappropriate for this court to attempt to meddle 
with a decision that is being appealed.  It would be 
discourteous.  It would be, in a very large sense, 
unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the hon. member, who is very thoughtful and 
informed in this area, that we should concentrate on the 
substance of the bill.  We believe section 43 will withstand 
challenge.  The government is committed to defending it in the 
courts.  If there are judicial decisions cutting down its scope, 
we will study them with care and the proper respect due to the 
co-ordinate authority and we will bring our suggestions to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member again for his intervention.  On the 
substance of his remarks on criminal law, the government finds it 
co-ordinates very much with what we have been suggesting in 
relation to this bill.  On the larger question I would hope that 
on reflection he would agree.  We understand the sentiments he is 
expressing, but the notwithstanding clause is not the way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak to Motion No. 528.  I am 
always honoured to follow the lead of the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra who I think has added, in his very articulate 
and vastly insightful way, to the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the motion which 
defends section 43 of the Criminal Code and invokes the 
notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms when necessary.  I suppose that when necessary clause 
defines the issue to some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a need?  Is there a pressing concern that would require 
this to happen?  That in and of itself is something that could be 
debated for some time.  I am not questioning the merits of what 
the hon. member has done by bringing the issue forward.  It is my 
feeling and the feeling of my party that this debate is useful to 
clarify and perhaps reinforce section 43, in particular for the 
sake of many parents and teachers who deal with the challenges of 
raising and educating today's youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has in its wisdom enacted such a section of the 
Criminal Code.  I would go further and say that it has been 
consistently upheld by our courts at the provincial supreme court 
and Supreme Court of Canada levels.  Consistently case law 
suggests that it has been upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are instances of which hon. members have been made aware 
or perhaps personally encountered where the degree of force has 
been brought into question as to how much or how far a parent or 
person acting in the stead of a parent can go in correcting a 
misbehaving child or youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I do not mean to trivialize the issue in any way by saying 
that this is not a wildfire epidemic which is sweeping the 
country.  I am not aware at least of any issue of spanking taking 
place throughout the country that has resulted in a major court 
challenge or in repeated community disruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording in the section defines the issue, and that is 
reasonableness and community standard.  These words are 
encompassed in the Criminal Code.  They define how far a parent 
or a person in a parent's place can go in disciplining a child in 
response to a misbehaviour or perhaps an action taken by a child. 
I do not feel that section 43 is in any jeopardy at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also brought forward certain studies and 
psychological and methodological evidence which is also helpful 
in the debate to define just how far a parent can go and the 
reaction or the response of that child to physical correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well it helps to define the fact that this is not a situation 
where we are talking about child abuse.  I do not believe the 
line is that grey at the present time.  There are instances where 
quite clearly the corrective methods undertaken are 
disproportionate and very injurious to a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referenced the fact that there were instances 
that one can envision when harsh words and a berating attitude or 
a barrage of language can be perhaps even more painful and have 
more deleterious and lasting effects on a child than, for lack of 
a better word, a simple physical corrective measure where a child 
is stopped physically, for example, from picking on a younger 
sibling or partaking in what is deemed to be a dangerous 
activity; a teacher takes a child firmly by the arm and marches 
him or her down to the principal's office; or one simply removes 
something from the child's possession if it poses a danger to 
himself or herself or another child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of physical corrective measures are envisioned by 
section 43 of the Criminal Code and certainly the type of 
measures to which my hon. colleague refers in his remarks. All of 
that to say that I do not see the line as being that blurred when 
one applies the reasonableness and the community standard test in 
place currently in the Criminal Code.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When physical injury results, when marks are left on a child 
because of the overreaction of a parent or a person in authority, 
that would cross the line.  When that occurs and matters, through 
the natural course, wind up before the courts, and there is an 
opportunity for a judge to review the evidence and the 
circumstances, this section is put to the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable that there is concern about this.  However, 
I would suggest once more that this is not a matter which is in 
need, at least at this point, of taking what I would suggest in 
the context of the greater debate would be a disproportionate 
response, that being the use of the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By invoking the notwithstanding clause, as was referred to by 
the hon. member opposite from Vancouver Quadra, the pith and the 
substance of doing that would be tantamount to a parent 
overreacting and responding in a very disproportionate way and 
using a far too extreme form of response or violence to what a 
child has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to diminish what the hon. member is trying to 
accomplish, but even the reference of the notwithstanding clause 
in relation to this section, I suggest with all respect, 
diminishes the importance of what this section is really intended 
to do in the context of our Constitution and in the context of 
the application of it to our criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen cases that have come forward quite recently, such 
as the case of the Queen and Sharpe and the Queen and Feeney, in 
which there is perhaps a need for discussion in the context of 
what those cases dealt with.  When it comes to the protection of 
children from exploitation through pornography, when it comes to 
the rules and the laws of search and seizure that empower police 
officers in pursuit of criminals that have engaged in very 
violent activity, those are recent examples for which one might 
envision the invoking of the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those not intimately familiar with this, what it would do is 
essentially strike down a judge's decision and delay or put into 
abeyance the significance of the ruling for a period of five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the greater context, I reiterate with all respect that using 
this type of constitutional power in the context of this section 
would be extremely ill-founded and ill-timed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to the substantive debate, what is being discussed 
is the use of corrective proportionate response in the 
disciplining of a child.  It is fair to say that in these very 
trying and troubling times, for youth who are in need of an early 
start and proper direction in their lives, there are occasions. 
Mr. Speaker, you may have been subjected to a spanking at some 
point in your life, as well as other members present.  I am sure 
that it made an impression, but not the type of impression that 
would leave a mark on one's physical person.  We are talking 
about the type of impression that leaves a person with the 
feeling that perhaps they have done something wrong and that they 
should not engage in that type of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about this type of physical corrective measure we 
have to be very prudent in encouraging people to do it on the one 
hand, but at the same time we do not want to exaggerate the 
impact this would have on a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about this section of the Criminal Code, we want to 
be careful not to dismiss the issue of child abuse because that 
is something that is not sanctioned by section 43 of the Criminal 
Code.  It is there to ensure that children are protected, but 
that parents and those acting in the place of a parent are 
permitted in certain very specific instances and factual 
circumstances to exercise discretion and the implicit 
responsibility that they have to physically correct a child, and 
often to do so for the protection of that child.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very supportive of the efforts the hon. member has made in 
bringing this matter to the floor of the House of Commons.  I am 
very pleased to take part in the debate, but I would again 
suggest that this is not a Criminal Code section that is in 
jeopardy currently.  It is not a Criminal Code section that is in 
danger at this time of being struck down by any current 
litigation of which I am aware.  The issue itself bears 
discussion and it will continue to be respected by our judiciary 
and by those in the country who hope to and who will uphold the 
laws of the land. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak to Motion No. 
528, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should defend 
section 43 of the Criminal Code in the courts and should invoke 
the notwithstanding clause of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
if necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly does Section 43 of the Criminal Code state?  It 
deals with the correction of a child by force.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in place of a 
parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a 
pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the 
force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein lies the rub, “what is reasonable under the 
circumstances”.  We know that what may appear reasonable to one 
person may certainly be unreasonable to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose this motion.  We feel that, if anything, section 43 
should be repealed, whereas this motion talks about maintaining 
section 43.  We feel that it should be repealed because it is a 
19th century law that was first codified in 1892 which legally 
sanctions physical violence against children.  It should be 
repealed, not preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 has been used as a successful criminal defence by 
parents who have hit their children with straps, belts, sticks 
and extension cords, causing bruises, welts and abrasions. 
People have used this defence in court to justify that behaviour 
toward children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are the only class of Canadian citizens who can legally 
be assaulted for their correction.  We do not hit adults to 
correct them.  We gave up years ago using the whip to correct 
adults, but for some reason we feel that we can assault children 
to correct them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have argued that this does not have any adverse effect 
upon children.  We agree that it is obvious children have to be 
taught and socialized, but the legal right to hit them as a 
method of training is wrong because it is contrary to basic human 
rights.  It promotes violence as a legitimate response to 
conflict and it leads to physical and emotional harm to thousands 
of children each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can talk about all the studies they want.  People can pick 
the studies they want to support their point of view.  I am going 
to give a very real example of how such physical activity, 
allegedly to correct a child and probably done by the people 
involved thinking it was reasonable under the circumstances, 
affected one individual in Canada, and I am sure he is only one 
among many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent wrote to me.  I checked with him before coming 
here tonight to ask if I could talk a bit about his case.  He 
said “By all means.  Use my name if necessary”, but I will not 
use his name.  This young fellow was adopted in 1956 and lived in 
a small village in Nova Scotia.  He talks about his early 
childhood when he had a very severe bed wetting problem.  What 
was his parents' response to this bed wetting problem?  They 
would spank him to try to cure him of it.  That was their 
strategy.  Instead of curing it, it got worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the age of five he began school.  He talks about the 
principal as being a huge, six-foot, four-inch tall monster, with 
a stern face and a very cold personality.  He tells us that this 
person would discipline him.  He had only been in school a couple 
of weeks when he received his first strapping.  He said:  “Boy 
did it hurt.  It made my father's spanking feel like child's 
play.  I stood there with my hand out and I was given 15 straps 
on each hand.  I was bawling my eyes out and screaming at the top 
of my lungs.  The louder I screamed, the harder this person 
strapped”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally it got so bad he said “I pissed my pants.  After the 
strapping I was sent back to class in my wet pants until it was 
time to go home”.  When he got home his mother said “Well, you 
must have done something to deserve it”.  He was then given a 
spanking for wetting his pants.  This was all sanctioned under 
the code.  He was spanked. The mother was enraged and said “He 
is not only bed wetting now but he is also wetting his pants”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This continued until the end of grade one.  Then he moved into 
grade two.  In grade two his principal was a bulky man, about 230 
pounds and five feet eight inches tall and made his previous 
principal look like a boy scout by comparison.  The same thing 
happened.  He was strapped almost daily.  He said “I was 
strapped approximately 60 to 70 times in that year and my spirit 
was definitely broken”.  To make matters worse, the bullies in 
his class would chase him home and beat him up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “At eight years old I was a tortured, scared little 
boy, very quickly filling with hatred and anxiety and wishing I 
was dead”.  He talks further about how this kind of abuse 
continued in the school system, condoned by the law the Reform 
Party would like to maintain and buttress up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “Life had become unbearable and I remember praying to 
God on many occasions to let me die and end this insanity. It had 
come to the point where every day after school I would run out of 
school as soon as the bell rang and head straight for the woods 
behind the school and work my way through the woods in order not 
to be seen by people and to be beat up by these bullies.  Every 
morning as the class sang O Canada I would be strapped for 
running home through the woods rather than walking home in an 
orderly fashion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of interpretation when people talk about what is 
reasonable and unreasonable.  I am sure the school authorities of 
the day would argue that they were using reasonable means to 
train these children and to bring them up in a proper way so that 
they would behave properly.  We see this activity as far from 
reasonable, but people want to maintain this kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the period of four years he was strapped 300 to 400 times. 
When he turned 13 years old, in order to gain acceptance from his 
fellow classmates, he turned to alcohol and smoking pot. It 
became an addiction. This was the effect of this kind of 
discipline and activity in his life.  I am sure there are many 
people out there who find themselves in similar circumstances and 
who over the years have experienced what has been correction by 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are contemporary parenting courses and publications on 
child rearing and discipline that give effective and practical 
advice on non-violent alternatives to spanking and hitting.  Sure 
it takes a little bit more work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend from the Conservative Party said that it was 
necessary sometimes to have to discipline a child in this way. 
We have to find other ways to discipline our children so we are 
not hitting them.  When we hit a child it in turn teaches them to 
hit others and we see it accelerating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at some of the activities taking place today in the school 
system and some of the actions of children right across the 
country where they have no respect for other people.  Part of it 
is probably because they have not been respected as a person. We 
do not respect a person when we are so much larger than they are 
and we grab them when they have no defence and physically shake 
or spank them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is we must always ask ourselves how would we 
like to be treated?  Would we appreciate someone grabbing us and 
spanking us?  Perhaps some people would.  In all honesty no one 
wants to be overpowered by someone bigger than themselves.  They 
do not want to feel helpless and defenceless while they are 
physically struck.  This is what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at other means of disciplining our children. 
Give them guidance, give them love, give them direction.  Set an 
example that they would want to follow rather than show them that 
it is okay for someone bigger than they are to hit them in order 
to correct them. We must ask ourselves are we treating people in 
the way we want to be treated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party pays great lip service to family values and the 
importance of children, but it does not appear to care about 
protecting children from the physical and emotional pain of 
violent abuse which is currently safeguarded by section 43. In 
advocating the preservation of this section that justifies and 
rationalizes corporal punishment, the Reform Party is ignoring 
the fact that current conditions are intolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 4,229 substantiated cases of physical abuse 
investigated in Ontario alone in 1993.  Attempts to discipline by 
corporal punishment were suspected in 85% of the substantiated 
cases. 
People oftentimes start out lightly disciplining but as the child 
gets a little more stubborn, all of a sudden the parent gets a 
little more forceful and what started out perhaps as a gentle 
spanking ends up being much worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to look realistically at this. 
They should not try to justify it because of what may have 
happened to them in the past, and say “Well, I was spanked and I 
am okay”.  They should look realistically at what it is doing to 
children and be honest with themselves and decide to oppose the 
motion and all forms of physical violence to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member for Wanuskewin 
speaks now he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my wrap-up 
comments I will refer to some remarks made by colleagues on 
different sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first remind members that section 43 has not been in 
place many years.  My colleague to my immediate right, or to the 
left on the political spectrum, does not appear to be aware of 
when section 43 came into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physical abuse by an individual some 30 years ago is the very 
reason that section 43 was brought in, because there was no 
protection for children.  There were no agencies in place and 
this was the kind of thing that was put in place by well 
intentioned lawmakers so there would be protection for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also seem that some of the members around the House are 
not aware of the agenda of the United Nations, and specifically 
the convention on the rights of the child.  It would appear from 
the comments of the last speaker that he certainly is supportive 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada sends delegates to the convention on the rights of the 
child posturing that they represent the Canadian position but 
without having any debate in the House.  After having tried to 
smooth, sneak or stealth their views by individuals overseas, 
they come back to try to browbeat us by saying that the position 
of Canada ought to be a small select group of NGOs trying to get 
this through at United Nations meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the Progressive Conservative Party member said, 
that there was no threat at present, I remind him of a case 
coming up in the general division of the Ontario courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the court challenges program, has given 
money to this group to challenge section 43.  This is not 
something in some distant era but something of concern before us 
right now, which is being funded by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cited a number of different cases being investigated 
in Ontario.  However, at the end of the day it was found that 
only a couple of allegations could be substantiated.  It was 
decided that what had been alleged by individuals in Ontario had 
not occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies that found negative outcomes did not take into account 
the original frequency or severity of the child's behaviour that 
required some discipline in the first place.  In other words, if 
a child had a severe behavioural problem, and discipline or 
punishment was not having any positive results, it did little 
good to later blame bad behaviour on the physical punishment when 
in many cases the bad behaviour was there to begin with.  That 
would be like blaming cancer on radiation treatment.  It is true 
that radiation may not have cured the cancer but that does not 
mean it causes it.  The cancer was already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the recent confirmation of the very extensive 
studies by Dr. Larzelere, or at least his review of the studies. 
I also referred to the study done by Marjorie Gunnoe that 
provides important confirmation of those findings. On the basis 
of her work she has stated that positive or negative outcomes do 
not result from physical correction per se but rather from the 
meaning a child ascribes to the discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She suggests two plausible ways that children interpret 
spanking.  First, it is a legitimate expression of parental 
authority.  Second, it can be an act of interpersonal aggression.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If children perceive discipline as an expression of parental 
authority, there will not be, I state again there will not be, 
negative outcomes.  However, if they perceive discipline as an 
act of aggression, then there may be negative results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marjorie Gunnoe's scholarly and very thorough work underscores 
the fact that there are no dangers in loving homes in which the 
child knows that mom and dad are disciplining in a careful, 
responsible, loving manner and purely out of a desire to shape 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a privilege to speak to this motion.  At this point 
I again seek the unanimous consent of the House to have the 
motion before us deemed adopted and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since no more members wish to speak and the 
motion was not selected as a votable item, the hour provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the item is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.21 p.m.)
