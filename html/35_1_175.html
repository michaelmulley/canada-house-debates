<B>(0950) </B>
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, it is because the official opposition 
takes its role seriously that, right on Monday, proposals were 
made to the government, proposals that would have served a 
dual purpose: to bring about a speedy resumption of work and 
also a meaningful settlement, a negotiated settlement to this 
serious situation that impacts on the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I should point out that, instead of accepting our offer, the 
government decided-I call it as I see it-to capitalize on the 
circumstances, the difficulties created by this strike, as any 
strike. Strikes are never fun, neither for the strikers-who feel 
this is something they are forced to do-nor for those who suffer 
the consequences.
<P>
	The government took advantage of this situation to sort out its 
problem, and that is to have working conditions imposed on rail 
workers.
<P>
	It is important to remind the House that a two-stage 
mediation-arbitration process was recommended to the 
government in the Hope report, and this recommendation was 
made for the very simple reason that the companies have already 
tried to obtain concessions in the past.
<P>
	What is unusual is this statement: their demands are so 
controversial and provocative because of the partisan role taken 
by the government-the word is mine-who supports the 
position of the railway companies and because of the tenacity 
with which the companies have stuck to these demands.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I would ask hon. 
members who want to have private conversations to please step 
out.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	This is a momentous event in the history of the Parliament of 
Canada. Without taking too much of my speaking time, I would 
just like to say that we realize this is emergency legislative 
action and it is being taken for the second time in a short time.
<P>
	All week long, we have been guided both by the proposals 
tabled this morning and the need to bring about a meaningful 
settlement. The government sabotaged the Hope report's 
recommendations. Commissioner Hope recommended steps be 
taken to bring both sides together to allow them to negotiated 
settlements, these being the only way out of this difficult 
situation in which the companies claim to be.
<P>
	Let me read you a paragraph of the Hope report which gives 
hope-no pun intended-and we want to give this hope a 
chance.
<P>
<B>(0955) </B>
<P>
	We can read this on page 72: ``During the commission's 
proceedings, it was rather obvious that it would be possible to 
negotiate settlements if freight carriers were prepared to accept 
the fact that they will probably not win on all fronts, and that 
they will have to pay for the changes which they want, 
regardless of the settlement process. Similarly, if the unions 
recognized the fact that both companies are confronted with a 
financial reality which requires that some arrangements be 
made in the interest of all the parties, they might be more willing 
to negotiate an acceptable compromise''.
<P>
	We can see the possibility for a settlement. This is what 
Commissioner Hope looked for. He provided the government 
with tools to reach a negotiated settlement. But instead, the 
government chose to impose one, without giving the parties 
time to meet face to face and express their respective views on 
the problems and the future of the railway industry.
<P>
	We wanted to give the parties a real chance, and this is why the 
series of amendments brought forward this morning propose 
mediation commissions which would report to the minister who, 
in turn, would have ten days to table a report to Parliament 
which would become a public document. If agreements were 
reached within that ten-day period, the report would not go 
public. Otherwise, at the end of this process, the parties would 
either mutually agree to go to arbitration or, if they have not 
reached a settlement-but we think they would-the Labour 
Code provisions dealing with their rights would apply once 
again.
<P>
	Another way of doing things must be found when you do not 
rely on a power struggle. In Quebec, we spent a lot of time 
looking at these issues and workers now have the right to strike, 
even in the health sector, provided essential services are 
maintained.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10985"> 10985 </A></B>
<P>
	In Canada, the Labour Code provides the right to strike, but 
that right is completely taken away by the government, when it 
should come into play.
<P>
	As I said repeatedly:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the Canadian economy and politics cannot afford the 
Canada Labour Code, there is a big problem because it means 
that the problems will never be settled.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And when problems are not really solved, they resurface and 
then they are much worse. This is what Commissioner Hope 
explains in his report.
<P>
	We want to make it clear to those who are listening, and who 
may have suffered some inconvenience, that these workers are 
exercising a right which is provided in the Labour Code. They 
want a negotiated settlement, not an imposed one; they stated 
that they are prepared to accept a compromise.
<P>
	Commissioner Hope clearly showed that the companies' 
hard-nosed attitude was due to the fact that they have the 
government's support. Today, this House has an opportunity to 
concretely show that the country is headed for new labour 
relations, and not only where unions exist. The government 
must be a role model. It must define the kind of labour relations 
which will prevail in this country. However, the government is 
not fulfilling its role when it is not paving the way to a future 
which includes not only companies, but also every individual.
<P>
<B>(1000) </B>
<P>
	It is because we highly respect our role as the official 
opposition that we want to stress here in this House how 
essential it is for Canadians and Quebecers to realize, through 
this conflict, that a new direction is necessary, so that new 
economic conditions can indeed be taken into consideration but, 
more importantly, that we do not sacrifice, as is now so often the 
case, the right of every individual to be treated with respect.
<P>
	I invite the government to support the spirit of our 
amendments. Rather than taking us back to the days when labour 
conditions were dictated only by the prevailing economic 
forces, these proposals seek to lead us to a climate of respect 
between the employers and the workers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the purpose of the amendments presented this 
morning by members of the Bloc Quebecois and, more 
specifically, by the hon. member for Mercier, is to remove the 
entire concept of arbitration from the bill and to limit the bill to 
a mediation process.
<P>
	The approach taken by the Bloc Quebecois may be a sign that 
they did not follow the progress of negotiations after the 
collective agreement expired. As you know, the parties tend to 
start negotiating before a collective agreement expires. The 
agreement expired on December  31, 1993, so that the parties 
started negotiating several months before that date. 
Subsequently, we appointed a conciliator to help the two parties 
negotiate.
<P>
	When this did not produce tangible results, we appointed a 
conciliation commissioner who again for several months, tried 
to get the parties to negotiate and conclude an agreement. It has 
always been and always will be the position of this government 
to help the parties negotiate and reach an agreement. Actually, 
most collective agreements in federally regulated sectors are 
concluded without intervention by the government as such and 
without the need for legislation.
<P>
	The proposal made by the Bloc Quebecois this morning would 
mean that negotiations would be continued for 60 days. First 50 
days, then a report to the House, and if the mediation process 
fails, employees and companies will again be in a position to 
strike or impose a lockout. That means that exactly 60 days from 
now, we could be facing the same situation. Today is March 25, 
and we might be back in this House on May 25, with a 
nation-wide work stoppage in the railway sector.
<P>
	I do not think the proposal is realistic. There would have to be 
evidence that there is a good chance of succeeding through 
mediation alone, and that is not the case. Both parties have 
reached an impasse at this point. Neither party has asked for 
mediation.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	The parties want to go back to work, that is quite clear. They 
want the system to work, but both parties have reached an 
impasse.
<P>
	I heard a representative for the unions who appeared before 
the Senate this week, and it was interesting to hear his response 
when the senators asked if the people who act as mediators do 
arbitration as well, and whether we should not separate 
mediation and arbitration. Do you know what he told the 
senators? He said: ``You know, when we have a mediator, and we 
know that if we do not agree, it will be up to the same person to 
make the decision for us, well, when the mediator looks us in the 
eye and begs us to reach an agreement, we know perfectly well 
what that means, and it makes us negotiate a little harder so he 
will not have to make the decision himself''. This was said in the 
Senate by a representative from one of the biggest unions in the 
railway sector.
<P>
	It is quite clear that each situation must be assessed on its 
merits. I appointed a mediator in the Port of Montreal, but the 
situation was entirely different. First of all, the Port of Montreal 
has a long tradition of successful collective bargaining. It has 
been more than 20 years since we had a general strike in the Port 
of Montreal. Second, the parties were amenable and really 
wanted to reach an agreement. These are prerequisites for 
mediation. Third, it should be clear that the economic 
repercussions of the strike in the Port of Montreal, compared 
with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10986"> 10986 </A></B>
<P>
economic repercussions of the strike throughout Canada's 
railway system from coast to coast are not the same.
<P>
	Not long ago, the House passed back-to-work legislation 
which imposed a mediation-arbitration process on the ports on 
the west coast of Canada. Oddly enough, Bloc members did not 
react the way they are doing now. Does this mean that the 
members of the Bloc are not the official opposition and are not 
concerned about what happens on the west coast of this country? 
Why is it that today, they are criticizing the principle of 
mediation-arbitration, while last time, although 
mediation-arbitration was involved as well, there was no 
discussion of the principles at stake as there is today. What is 
going on? Do we really have an official opposition that is 
concerned about Canada's economy from coast to coast? I 
wonder. I am really amazed at this change in the position of the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Since last Sunday we have tried to obtain the consent of the 
Bloc Quebecois for the passage of the bill before the House. If 
these amendments are the only thing they can come up with after 
five days, A am sorry to say that we cannot accept them, because 
we need results, and above all, we do not want to be faced with 
exactly the same situation in two months' time.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we just heard the Minister of Labour questioning 
whether the Bloc was the official opposition. It is the official 
opposition and the Reform Party is the national opposition.
<P>
	The Bloc mentioned the noble conception of its role. I 
disagree with that. I do not find anything about what it is doing 
with regard to the legislation noble. I find the actions of the Bloc 
Quebecois selfish and the most unconscionable I have seen in 
Parliament. It has held up this legislation. It refused to waive the 
48 hour notice necessary to get this in and debated quickly. It has 
used every procedural tactic at its disposal to further delay the 
passage of this bill.
<P>
	We have to question what it is trying to accomplish. We know 
the legislation is going to pass. The Bloc knows the legislation is 
going to pass. It knows the CP, CN and VIA workers are going to 
be legislated back to work. The Bloc is costing them extra pay, 
costing the company extra revenue and costing companies all 
across Canada a great deal of income.
<P>
	Why is it doing this? Why is it selfish? The reason is the port 
of Montreal. That is the sole reason we are all here today on the 
weekend debating these delaying tactics offered up by the Bloc.
<P>
	When the port of Montreal went down it happened that the 
Standing Committee on Transport was in Halifax. Halifax was 
booming. Everyone was walking around with a great smile on 
their face because they had a tremendous amount of business 
coming their way. It was pointed out to the member of the Bloc 
who sat on that committee: ``You had better go back and tell 
those people in the port they are really making a big mistake 
because some of the traffic diverting to Halifax is not going to 
go back when the strike is over. That is the way things operate''.
<P>
	The Bloc took that to heart because we did not see too much of 
it for a while after that. There were lots of telephone calls back 
and forth. Then this great saving situation happened, the rail 
strike. All of a sudden Halifax cannot get a lot of the goods to 
load on the ships being diverted there. This played right into its 
hands.
<P>
	I wonder why there is so much emphasis on the port of 
Montreal. This is not an action on behalf of Quebec, which the 
Bloc is really supposed to represent because it is certainly not 
representing the rest of Canada. This is costing manufacturers, 
importers, people all across the country huge sums of money. 
The total loss is expected to run in the range of $3 billion to $5 
billion and that does not end when the strike is over.
<P>
	This is not costing B.C. companies or Saskatchewan 
companies. It is companies all across Canada, including 
companies in Quebec. Bloc members are hurting the economy of 
their own province. They are hurting it at a time when they know 
full well the legislation is going to be passed in any case. This is 
nothing more than a simple tactic.
<P>
	As was mentioned by the Minister of Labour during her 
speech this morning, there was not a peep out of Bloc members 
when the same legislation was brought in on dock workers in 
Vancouver. Why? Because they did not care. It was the very 
same principle but it did not matter to them then. It was not the 
port of Montreal.
<P>
	The Bloc is trying to take every tactic to ensure that the rail 
stays out until after the port of Montreal goes back to work. That 
is all they are interested in.
<P>
	The Liberals are not totally innocent in this either. We brought 
this up long before the strike ever came in. We brought it up last 
year when legislation was brought in for the dock workers in 
Vancouver. Our economy is far too fragile and far too 
interwoven to allow something this massive to go on. We have to 
find alternatives and no action has been taken by the government 
to do so.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	During the first week of the strike I attempted to contact the 
Minister of Labour numerous times. I was promised a return 
call. My intention was to find ways to work with the government 
to bring the matter back so that we could get it settled. We were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10987"> 10987 </A></B>
<P>
quite prepared to co-operate. I know the minister was extremely 
busy at that time, as well being relatively new in the portfolio. I 
understood that.
<P>
	Appointments were made for the return of my phone call and 
they were never kept. The Liberals had the opportunity to use 
broader legislation at the time they legislated back the 
Vancouver dock workers. It only took them two days to do that. 
Why has it taken them so long in the case of the rail strike? The 
reason probably is that they had to wait to make sure that CN was 
fully involved in the strike so that they could bring CN into the 
scope of the legislation as well.
<P>
	The government's real target is CN. It wants to bring in 
legislation that includes binding arbitration for CN. That is the 
only part of all the tactics of the Bloc I have some agreement 
with.
<P>
	One problem in the legislation is the arbitration clause. It says 
with regard to CN that there will be one member from the union; 
one member from the company, which is the government; and 
one member appointed by the government. We have a vague idea 
about how the arbitration will come out.
<P>
	The only alternative in this case is the Liberal solution used in 
the case of the dock workers' strike last year. Why did they use it 
last year and not now? I am talking of final offer selection 
arbitration which gives the company and the union the chance to 
get much closer together. It puts a lot more pressure on them to 
be as close as possible and to take the most reasonable position 
possible. It will allow them to settle outstanding issues and try 
to reach a total agreement. In the end it will be one side or the 
other. Whoever is the more unreasonable of the two will be the 
loser.
<P>
	That is a fairer operation than the type of arbitration that has 
been brought forward. We have to go with the legislation 
because we have to get the country back to work. That is the 
bottom line. That is the most important part of the whole 
legislation.
<P>
	I ask the Bloc to start acting like a national opposition party, 
be responsible, put the country back to work and put the 
economy back on its feet.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the debate today is against a background 
of Canada's burgeoning export records, the extraordinary 
successes that Canada has achieved in its export trade which are 
being jeopardized by the present strike of the railway.
<P>
	The amendments before the House this morning would 
attempt to resolve that strike through mediation. Mediation, 
however, would require yet another 60 days of deliberation and 
would not bring any early conclusion to the severe disruptions in 
our export trade resulting from the prolonged strike.
<P>
	If we have arbitration we can have an early resolution of the 
problem that faces us. It is for that reason that we on this side of 
the House oppose the amendments and intend to support the 
rapid implementation of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	The rail strike today is causing all sorts of disruptions in our 
export trade which, as I said a moment ago, has reached record 
levels in 1994 and again in the first month of 1995.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada recorded an annual trade surplus with the world of 
over $17 billion in 1994, up almost $8 billion over the previous 
year. Our trade surplus with the United States was $28.4 billion 
or $8.7 billion higher than in 1993. In addition to those 
formidable achievements, Canada has recorded a record 
merchandise trade surplus with Japan of over $1.3 billion.
<P>
	In the case of Japan and Europe, as well as in the case of the 
United States, the success of our trade achievement depends on 
the ability of our railways to deliver our products directly or to 
ports for shipment.
<P>
	As a result of the strike we found that severe disruptions were 
already occurring. In the automotive sector, the Ford Motor 
Company has had to curtail its production, reduce its assembly 
line operations. In the pulp and paper industry in the province of 
Quebec, the large company Repap Enterprises will shortly have 
to close its operations altogether since it cannot have access to 
its natural resources nor have the opportunity to ship its 
products to markets where there is demand for Canadian 
exports.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the January 
Canada recorded a trade surplus of some $2.4 billion in that one 
month, up by $285 million from December 1994. In January 
1995 Canadian exports stood at a record level of $22.5 billion, 
up by $1.3 billion over December 1994.
<P>
	In those circumstances we have a situation where Canadian 
exports to the United States and American exports to Canada 
total $1 billion a day, every day, day in and day out all year 
round. It is imperative that rail services be available to ensure 
that our goods reach the markets that have expressed such 
demand for Canadian products.
<P>
	We have already seen a situation arise where as a result of the 
rail strike rail cars have been retained in Canada when they 
should be moving goods and services across the border to the 
United States. As I noted a moment ago, the products for 
overseas are being detained because of an inability to reach our 
ports. All this is against a background of increasing liberalized 
trade, of freer market access that provides Canadians with the 
opportunity to ship their products across the globe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10988"> 10988 </A></B>
<P>
	Through the evolution of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and our commitment to free trade in the western 
hemisphere we have seen new opportunities for Canadian 
products in our own hemisphere.
<P>
	The growth of the markets in Asia is know to all of us. We 
have seen the so-called Asian tigers come forward as promising 
new markets for Canadian goods and services. We have a highly 
profitable market available to us in Japan, markets that will only 
be enhanced by the commitment that all member countries of the 
Asia Pacific Economic Co-Operation have made to trade 
liberalization, indeed free trade, within 25 years throughout 
Asia and the Pacific.
<P>
	In the case of Europe the growth of the European Union, its 
deepening and its expansion to additional countries have led to 
greater opportunities for Canadian exports.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	In a world of increasingly liberalized trade, especially with 
the new World Trade Organization that came into being on 
January 1, there are ample opportunities, promising new 
opportunities, for Canadians. We have achieved such 
remarkable success in ensuring the sale of Canadian goods and 
services abroad that we cannot allow the situation in our basic 
rail system to continue.
<P>
	There must be a resolution to this obstacle to our further 
growth in international trade, to the achievement of yet greater 
levels in 1995, and to the achievement of a permanent and more 
satisfactory method of resolving disputes and differences within 
our rail system.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Team Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLaren:</B> It is evident to everyone, as one of my 
colleagues reminds me, that Team Canada must have as an 
underpinning the assurance of an efficient and reliable transport 
system. Team Canada is the combined efforts of the provinces 
and of the federal government to ensure that there is a concerted 
effort, that all the energies of Canadians provincial and federal 
are directed toward the achievement of our export goals. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in our combined efforts to 
ensure that small and medium size businesses are fully involved 
in the export successes that have marked the Canadian economy 
over past years.
<P>
	Our efforts to promote small and medium size enterprises in 
the export world, including our vigorous efforts to ensure that 
small businesses in Quebec also enjoy those opportunities, can 
only be hindered by the absence of a reliable and efficient rail 
system. It is for that reason we oppose the amendments that have 
been brought forward this morning and look for an early 
resolution of the rail strike that is causing such disruption to our 
export trade.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I think it is highly significant that the second 
speaker for the government, the Minister for International 
Trade, spoke for ten minutes without mentioning labour 
relations for one single second. He said nothing at all about the 
situation of the workers affected by this bill. I think this is a 
clear indication of the government's true objectives.
<P>
	The bill before us and the series of amendments are the 
clearest indication of the government's real objectives. The aim 
of the bill is not a return to work. If it were, the dispute would 
have been resolved four days ago. We offered the possibility 
Monday, we offered it Wednesday. Everyone agrees on a return 
to work. The disagreement lies in the fact that special legislation 
imposes a new type of relations on the parties concerned in the 
rail sector.
<P>
	Let us have a look at the amendments. First, commissions 
were set up with the power to arbitrate and a biased mandate. 
The proof is in clause 12. I think it is important for all Canadians 
and Quebecers to understand this. The government's bill 
provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12. Each Commission shall be guided by the need for terms and conditions of 
employment that are consistent with-economic viability and 
competitiveness-taking into account the importance of good 
labour-management relations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the first time I have seen a government put 
improvement of the economy ahead of agreement between the 
parties, in a bill. With this clause, the government decided to do 
a job on the entire rail sector. As the negotiators failed to reach 
an agreement, the government wants to ensure the 
transformation of the rail sector with clause 12 and force the 
commissions to do the job.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	When the members of the commission see an interesting 
proposal from the union, their hands will be bound by this 
clause, which says to them: what the union is proposing will not 
lead to the economic viability and competitiveness of the rail 
system, which is the first requirement of the legislation, 
therefore you will not be able to accept the proposal. We are 
proposing a much more reasonable clause in keeping with the 
longstanding spirit of labour relations in Quebec and Canada. 
The aim of this proposal is not only to protect the workers, but 
also to make the future interesting in this sector and prevent 
people from getting into labour relations problems in the 
coming years.
<P>
	I think this proposal comes from our added experience in 
Quebec of working together, of taking an approach to labour 
relations that permits each side to come out a winner. This is the 
essence of labour relations. It is nothing like arbitration, which 
creates a winner and a loser, because in the years following 
arbitration, the loser prepares to win the next time, with griev-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10989"> 10989 </A></B>
<P>
ances and all sorts of unacceptable situations arising as the 
result. It seems to me that the government should understand 
this.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> We are proposing in this regard that the 
commission be guided first by the need to establish good 
union-management relations and, to this end, that it promote 
working conditions reflecting both the rights of the workers and 
the economic viability and competitiveness of the 
coast-to-coast rail system. And the way it is written means that 
we think that human resources is what is most important. It is 
what we hear in speeches around the world right now about 
globalization. What will make us competitive is the way we treat 
our human resources, not putting workers in no-win situations. 
Both workers and management must come out winners. Was 
management in favour of getting everybody back to work at the 
beginning of the week? Do you think they would agree with 
that? Go ask the management of the companies.
<P>
	I think that this vision of government is dangerous and that it 
is important for all of the citizens of Quebec and Canada to go 
beyond this way of looking at things and to see the government's 
relationship with society evolve. The government is going to 
systematically decide who is right in society. The government is 
going to decide who is right and wrong, and the next in line for 
the snow job that railway workers are getting now will be the 
unemployed. The next victims after that will be another social 
category, and it will always be done under the pretext that we 
absolutely need to do such and such a thing for affordability, to 
emulate the American way, and that is why the official 
opposition is against this way of thinking. I think that we have 
nothing to learn from a party that has five members present in 
the House when we are dealing with special legislation.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member not to remark on the presence or absence of other hon. 
members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. At any rate, 
Canadians can see what happens during votes and see who is 
there to vote and who is not.
<P>
	Therefore, I think that this series of amendments contains an 
interesting proposal, and it is important for Canadians to 
understand that we are not opposing this bill to prevent people 
from returning to work, we are doing it to ensure that, in the 
future, two, three, five, ten years down the road, that there are 
good labour relations in this sector, that people have choices, 
that part of the network will be sold. That will have to be 
negotiated anyway with the unions, and because we have put 
them in a situation where they cannot trust their employers, they 
will continue to distrust them and we will have problems. When 
Parliament has to bring in three special labour relations acts in 
one year, that is a sure sign that there is a volatile situation in 
Canada, and that it is one  that would be better dealt with by 
some means other than a government gag order.
<P>
	I think it is important for Canadians to hear how the 
government is going against the recommendations of the Hope 
report.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	According to the Hope report, there are a number of major 
points on which the parties could agree and we could then 
proceed to the more technical points and, if need be, resort to 
arbitration for some of these technical points. The government 
held its nose and decided to ignore that part.
<P>
	What saddens me a little is that I feel they are taking 
advantage of the fact that a new minister has been appointed. 
She must be briefed on the issues while fulfilling an economic 
mandate, although the labour relations mandate is not 
necessarily to settle economic problems but to ensure a good 
labour relations climate. This is a basic element on which we 
should agree.
<P>
	I sincerely believe that the amendment proposing that the 
commission be guided by the need to establish good labour 
relations as a top priority is the first step in a successful 
approach that would allow the whole railway industry to see its 
future in a different light.
<P>
	Let us assume that, in two years, CN wants to sell, for 
example, part of its line to people in eastern Quebec, the Eastern 
Townships or the Maritimes. With a binding decision like that 
one, the unions will never feel formally bound by the outcome of 
the negotiations, which will show at every phase of the talks 
with the new employers. The employer faced with these new 
situations will keep in mind that he could win through a decision 
such as this special act of Parliament.
<P>
	The employers in these situations may not want union 
accreditations to be adjusted to the new employers. Are there 
ways for these employers to ensure preferential treatment from 
the government? Ensuring economic viability by taking away 
workers' rights? This is the wrong way to see the debate, as I see 
it.
<P>
	In conclusion, you can be sure that, in labour relations, if we 
do not see to it that there are two winners, the unions and the 
employers, one of the parties will always have its moment of 
truth in catching up later.
<P>
	Shortsighted decisions such as this bill can only be corrected 
by achieving a balance between the parties. Parliament's 
responsibility is not to impose a different way to look at railway 
development through special labour legislation. If we want to 
change the railway industry, we should do so openly through 
bills to that effect, but not on the backs of Canadian workers 
because, at the end of the day, it is not only railway workers who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10990"> 10990 </A></B>
<P>
will pay, but all those whose livelihoods depend on this industry 
and all train users across Canada.
<P>
	I hope that the government will finally decide to listen to our 
arguments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I welcome this opportunity to mention that 
our new Minister of Labour has done an outstanding job 
regarding this strike.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not often that a new minister finds herself or himself with 
such a heavy agenda so soon after being made a member of the 
government. The fact that our Minister of Labour has acted so 
quickly and effectively in dealing with this strike is a great 
tribute to her.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have a problem with the Bloquistes opposing this bill. I find 
it quite strange that, last week, when we legislated the 
resumption of work on the west coast, they did not seem to be 
very interested.
<P>
	I also noticed that the hon. member for Longueuil dissociated 
himself from his party. He said his phone had been ringing off 
the hook with nothing but calls of support and that he even 
received calls from staunch sovereignists and mayors who 
wanted to congratulate him. Clearly, this is clearly how the 
people of Quebec feel because the economic impact the strike is 
having on Canada and Quebec is extremely serious.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	I wonder why the members of this political party, who claim 
that definitely the only thing they were prepared to agree to as a 
party was sovereignty for Quebec, all of them but one agree with 
this strike action. Clearly, they are now sending to the people of 
Quebec the signal that a sovereign Quebec would be run by the 
unions. They do not care what the ordinary people of Quebec 
think.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The effects in Quebec and the effects across Canada of this 
strike have to be dealt with. There is an old African saying that 
when the elephants fight the grass gets hurt.
<P>
	It is just fine for these people to come in and talk about the 
sanctity of labour relations. We think that is important too. In 
fact nothing would have been more desirable for the government 
than to see the parties to this dispute find their own resolution of 
it. That is why we waited; it was in order to see that the best 
possible efforts could be made.
<P>
	In the face of a national rail strike, the Bloquistes know that 
governments in the past have always been obliged to act. The 
effect on the economy is such that we simply must act in the 
interests of all Canadians whose jobs and livelihoods depend 
directly and indirectly on the rails. Listen to the impact.
<P>
	One of the main industries being affected is the aluminium 
industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The aluminum industry is the most important industry for the 
economy of Quebec, particularly for its rural areas, and it 
depends on rail transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Thirty thousand people are employed in that sector. It 
produces $8 billion annually in shipments. Two-thirds of all 
outbound shipments of aluminium are shipped by rail. Over 
three-quarters of the industry's inbound shipments, such as the 
chemicals that are used in the industry, are transported by rail, 
90 per cent of the shipment by rail and $4.5 billion annually 
comprising exports to the United States. Alcan and Reynolds are 
now operating at only 70 per cent of capacity. Their plants are in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
	In the automotive sector, earlier this week Ford had to lay off 
3,500 workers at Oakville; 2,500 at St. Thomas; and 400 at 
Windsor due to the strike. Most of them are back now but 
operating at half capacity. All the auto manufacturers are 
experiencing difficulty moving finished vehicles. Trucks are 
used to bring in most inbound shipments, 85 per cent, although 
rail is used for some essential bulk inputs such as body metal and 
plastics. This industry itself accounts for over $50 billion 
annually in output and employs about 150,000 people.
<P>
	The chemicals industry, especially commodity chemicals, is a 
major user of the rail system. Seventy per cent of outbound 
shipments, about $15 billion annually, is sent by rail from 
Alberta to Ontario and British Columbia, from plants in Ontario 
and Quebec to the United States, to maritime ports for shipment 
overseas. Chemical shipments amount to about $20 billion 
annually. The industry employs 80,000 Canadians.
<P>
	The fertilizer industry, potash and chemical fertilizers, is a 
major rail user. Two-thirds of the fertilizer shipments, about 
$1.25 billion annually, travel by rail. The industry is located 
mainly in Alberta and Saskatchewan with 6,000 people 
employed and shipments worth $2 billion annually.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The pulp and paper industry, another very important industry 
for Quebec, also depends on rail transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Along with aluminium it is probably the most vulnerable to 
disruption of rail service. It employs 100,000 Canadians in all 
parts of the country. Shipments are worth over $20 billion a year.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The effect of a prolonged rail strike on this industry is crucial. 
There is one very simple thing we have to understand. I have 
other statistics. I could keep reading them but it is important to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10991"> 10991 </A></B>
<P>
conclude on this thought. We have built a very prosperous 
country. Our prosperity has come to a very great extent from the 
ability we have to extract natural resources, whether from the 
forests, whether agricultural, whether from the mines or in the 
past from the sea, and selling them to the world as price makers.
<P>
	That is no longer so easy for us. Competition on resource 
prices is extreme. The difficulty we have in getting our goods to 
market contributes directly to our competitiveness not just in 
the manufacturing sector but in the natural resource sector.
<P>
	In the past it was easy for us to collect the rents from our 
natural resources. The world was willing to pay the prices we 
wanted and pay for the transportation costs built in. We built a 
railway in times when transportation costs were not a big factor 
in the price we could charge for the goods we sold. That world 
has changed. We are in a world of extreme competitiveness.
<P>
	The Bloc should understand how important it is to our overall 
economy that we be competitive not just in the manufacturing 
sector but also in the transportation sector, and in a real way.
<P>
	That is the issue we are going to have to deal with over the 
weeks and months to come in the resolution of this labour 
disruption. The competitiveness of our transportation system is 
a crucial element in the competitiveness of both our natural 
resource and our manufacturing sectors in the world at large.
<P>
	In container traffic to eastern Canada bound from the Pacific 
we are only attracting 40 per cent of that traffic on the Canadian 
rail system. Sixty per cent is using the U.S. rail system. That is a 
competitiveness factor. We have to understand that other 
countries get their natural resources to ocean bound vessels with 
less distance involved than we face. The competitiveness of our 
transportation sector is crucial.
<P>
	Time has come for Canadians to deal with the issue of 
competitiveness in our transportation industry. It has been dealt 
with in our manufacturing sector. People in Quebec, in Ontario 
and elsewhere have faced the necessity of difficult downsizing, 
of coming to terms with needing to rationalize manufacturing 
facilities, plants, acquiring new equipment, all for the purpose 
of being able to ensure the continuing prosperity of their firms, 
their regions, their provinces and this country. Now is the time 
for the transportation sector as well to deal in a real and 
continuing and lasting way with this serious issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege to speak to the bill today.
<P>
	I have heard a few comments about the ability of members to 
count. I know they can go to five. I am wondering if they have 
ever read the story in the Old Testament about David and Goliath 
and what happened to the giant. I am very proud today to stand 
here and see the confidence our leader has that the five members 
here will handle the giants on both sides or all around us.
<P>
	I have heard a lot of insults thrown around this morning. It is a 
little discouraging to hear some of them. This problem has been 
around for 25 years. It was not created in the last situation 
between labour and management.
<P>
	Fifteen times governments have legislated people back to 
work and said they have solved the problem. We have never 
solved any problems and the simple reason is governments have 
been buying people to get elected.
<P>
	I am pro labour. I am pro management. If I can get small 
business or large business, I will get a vote. I will go to the 
House and run the country. This is why were are here again today 
trying to resolve an issue.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I will tell the House a story about labour management 
relations and I hope members will listen. During the break I was 
asked to visit a plant in my riding which is a branch of a 
multinational corporation. I knew most of its products were 
shipped into the U.S. I felt that this was probably another 
situation where I would get the news that it was either going to 
downsize or close.
<P>
	The news was it was going to expand by over $17 million. I 
said what is going on here, everybody is shutting down and this 
one is expanding. The plant manager said: ``I started in this plant 
as a floor sweeper. I left home at 16 and had to fend for myself. I 
came back to get into the community. Now I am plant manager''. 
I asked: ``What did it to you? How did you show that kind of 
confidence to your superiors to get this job?''
<P>
	He said: ``When I took over this plant were were operating in 
the red and it looked as if it were going to be shut down. I went 
over the books and said I am unionized, I am going to lose my 
job here if things do not turn around. I called in the people and 
told them we were going to have a different type of management. 
I am going to be supervisor and you are going to run this plant. I 
am setting up four committees, one is going to do the hiring and 
firing; one is going to look after efficiency; one is going to work 
on problems, labour relations''.
<P>
	He said: ``After a year you would not believe the increase in 
productivity in this plant. I have not hired a man. I have not fired 
a man. It is all done by the union. But I make sure when there is 
profit that my people get a fair wage increase. I know we are 
competing with the Americans and the head offices have given 
me the go ahead to increase production because this plant can 
survive''.
<P>
	That is labour management. That is how the country should be 
run, instead of the way it is right now. We had an opportunity a 
week ago to do something that would have set us in that 
direction. The House defeated Bill C-262, the motion of my 
hon. colleague. I do not think I will ever have an experience 
again such as I had this week when I sat with the forum of young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10992"> 10992 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians at its dinner. Since we were busy working on this 
legislation and I was on House duty, I could not be there for first  
part of the dinner. I came back to the House for about 45 minutes 
and had to leave again. Our whip had not been able to stay there 
either.
<P>
	We discussed this situation with the students. One asked me 
whether I get a little discouraged when I see all the problems and 
work from maybe 8.00 a.m. until 10.00 or 11.00 p.m. and 
accomplish very little.
<P>
	I said not really. At times I feel like going home but I think the 
35th Parliament will go down in history as the turning point in 
our country, that finally it will make some decisions that will 
benefit the country, not destroy it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> The red book. The right start but we need the 
green book to cover the red book.
<P>
	I pointed out to these young people what our problems were 
when we discussed job description and what was taking place on 
the Hill. I said I was actually proud to be part of the 35th 
Parliament. One young student said her generation will also set a 
precedent and be recorded in history. She said for the first time 
in history her generation is going to be asked to take a reduced 
standard of living, a lower standard of living.
<P>
	She is probably right with all the cuts coming, with all the 
social program cuts. I asked her how she felt about it. She said it 
hurts but they know it is reality and are willing to make that 
sacrifice if it will do something for their country.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	I felt like saying send all the MPs home and let the kids run the 
country. They will make the decisions that have to be made. 
They are not interested in a multimillion dollar pension plan. 
They are interested in saving the country, bringing it back to 
what it was years ago.
<P>
	We sit here throwing insults back and forth and we think we 
are doing our job. We are playing politics and politics is what 
has brought the country to where it is. I hope we realize that 
today, whether it is the Bloc, the Liberals or the Reform. The 
next generation is not going to be putting up with the politics we 
have seen in the 35th Parliament. The bright spot in our future is 
that we have kids willing to make sacrifices.
<P>
	When I think of the first and second world wars, I see how 
many young people laid down their lives to protect this country 
and make it great. They left everything. They had no chance. 
What have we done in the last 25 years? We have put the country 
into debt by $550 billion. We have an unemployment rate of 
around 10 per cent.
<P>
	What has politics done for the country? We have left our kids 
a legacy they will have to deal with. I hope and pray they have 
the guts to do it because my grandchildren and future 
great-grandchildren will not have the opportunities I have had.
<P>
	I hope it is serious enough in the House today that instead of 
throwing insults at each other, we buckle down, go to work and 
finally form some type of legislation that will put the country 
back on the road to recovery and make it the great country it can 
be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to be able to say that I am proud to take part in this 
debate, but, unfortunately, such is not the case.
<P>
	It is always preferable in this sort of dispute for the employer 
and the union to attempt to resolve their differences on their 
own. But, as we speak, after months and months of talks, the 
dispute drags on. Despite this government's efforts to resolve 
the conflict as quickly as possible, there is still one political 
party that prefers grandstanding to finding a solution to the 
crisis facing Canadians across this country.
<P>
	Millions of workers are affected daily by this dispute. In the 
Montreal and Toronto areas alone, 70,000 workers who must get 
to their place of work every day are affected by this strike.
<P>
	It affects not just large companies, but also small and medium 
size businesses, who depend on the railways for their survival.
<P>
	As we speak, Canadian Pacific is paralyzed and Canadian 
National and VIA are for all practical purposes completely shut 
down. There are also automobile manufacturing plants in the 
Windsor area that have had to lay off 3,000 employees 
temporarily. The manufacturing sector is losing close to $500 
million daily. In other words, if the strike drags on, the loss to 
our economy, according to their estimates, will be somewhere 
between $3 and $5 billion dollars.
<P>
	The Reform Party suggested that the Bloc Quebecois was not 
worried about the dispute at the Port of Vancouver because it did 
not concern them. I would like to point out to them the economic 
effect of this dispute on Trois-Rivières, in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	In Trois-Rivières, the Kruger paper company is losing a 
million dollars a day. Five hundred employees are affected. Also 
affected are Stone Consolidated in Port-Alfred, Pétromont in 
the Verchères region, the Shell refineries in the east end of 
Montreal, the entire Port of Vancouver, Alcan, ADI, Reynolds, 
and I could go on.
<P>
	I ask myself if there are other brave souls like the member for 
Longueuil, who told his own party that what they are accusing us 
of doing is not true. The Bloc Quebecois is accusing us of 
flexing our muscles. On the contrary, if anyone is being heavy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10993"> 10993 </A></B>
<P>
handed, it is the  Leader of the Opposition, who always takes this 
approach when someone, including the member for Longueuil, 
does not agree with him. He told his own member that he would 
have to live with the political consequences of his action.
<P>
	I would like to quote the member for Longueuil, who said: ``I 
do not see why my constituents would take it out on me. In fact, 
the opposite seems to be happening. We have a major problem 
when the transportation system breaks down. People must return 
to work''. This is why this dispute must be resolved as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	We have to ask why the Bloc Quebecois has taken this 
position. It claims to be the defender of workers in Quebec. This 
is not quite the case, because I myself have had calls from CN 
and CP railway workers in Coteau and Kirkland who are not 
happy that this dispute has still not been settled.
<P>
	The economy, workers, everyone is affected, but still the Bloc 
Quebecois persists. It persists, in my opinion, for purely 
partisan reasons. They have said that we could have resolved 
this dispute as early as Monday. Again, this is not the case, 
because another 60 days would have gone by before the dispute 
was settled. Why does the Bloc see itself as the defender of 
workers? The main reason is because under Quebec law unions 
represent workers. It is no accident that the CNTU, the FTQ, in 
fact all the unions, support the separatist position. This is the 
sole reason for the Bloc's partisan politics today.
<P>
	Thus far, at least the Reform Party is supporting us and even 
the NDP has seen the light. We have the support of the member 
for Longueuil and also of other members not brave enough to 
rise and vote against their party. Even the Quebec Minister of 
Transport has told us that this dispute must be resolved as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	But not the Bloc Quebecois. The Bloc wants to stall the 
process; it is not in its best interests to see things improve, 
because it does not want to show that federalism works. It really 
does not care about those affected by this conflict, including the 
small businesses that cannot get their raw materials or imports.
<P>
	So, here we are today. We could have settled this conflict a 
long time ago. But no, we have to sit on a Saturday. I am told this 
is the fourth time, and it has not happened in years.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is what we are paid for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> The hon. member said that is what we are paid 
for. Sure, but every hour spent in this House today costs the 
taxpayers an extra $25,000. All this because, during an 
opposition day, the Bloc members insisted on talking about the 
CBC and the Department of National Defence, rather than try to 
solve this conflict.
<P>
	I will conclude by referring to a comment made earlier this 
week by the Leader of the Opposition, who said that the 
referendum should be held as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola: </B>The sooner the referendum is held, the sooner 
the Bloc Quebecois will have to decide. Does it really want to 
play its role of official opposition and look after the interests of 
all Canadians, or rather pick and choose the issues, as it has 
already shown it is doing?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to get this conflict settled as soon as possible, 
and not at the expense of the workers as the Bloc Quebecois 
would have us believe.
<P>
	The government has always preferred to let conflicts be 
settled between the two parties involved. We have tried. The 
minister in her new role has tried in vain. We are at the point now 
where the economy is paralysed and companies are closing 
down. The government, contrary to what the Bloc Quebecois 
says, has decided to act.
<P>
	Let us get the economy back on track. Let us get the trains 
running. Let us have the referendum as soon as possible. Then 
the Bloc will have to decide whether it wants to remain the 
opposition or resign and let the Reform take over.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
following the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, the then 
Quebec Premier stated that, regardless of what was said or done, 
Quebec was and always would be a distinct society.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Those are the only fine words spoken by 
former Premier Robert Bourassa. Today, we have yet another 
clear demonstration of that, and I want to tell the member for 
Vaudreuil and the federal Minister of Industry that, as far as 
democracy is concerned, Quebec has nothing to learn from these 
individuals. Let me explain.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Madam Speaker, could you ask the hon. 
member for Nickel Belt, the young pup from Nickel Belt, to go 
yap outside the House?
<P>
	Section 53 of the Quebec Labour Code provides for parties to 
begin and pursue their negotiations diligently and in good faith. 
Again this goes to show that the Quebec Labour Code is more 
progressive than the Canada Labour Code, which does not 
include any such provision. I want to point out to the House and 
to the people who are watching us that, contrary to what Liberal 
members may have said, the Bloc is not made up of unionists 
only. For 17 years, I was involved in labour relations on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10994"> 10994 </A></B>
<P>
management side in Quebec, but there is one thing I have always 
respected and that is the workers' right to strike.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I support management, I am proud of it, but I have always 
recognized the workers' right to strike and the employers' right 
to lock them out. Having made this clear, let us turn now to the 
Hope report. On the issue of good faith, I want to quote from 
page 58 of the Hope report, paragraph 1, where it says: ``In brief, 
the unions are faced with proposals put forward by the railway 
companies which they cannot accept, so they must choose 
confrontation as their only alternative to these unacceptable 
demands''. Unacceptable demands made by management.
<P>
	Also on page 58 in the Hope report, paragraph a), it says: 
``The dispute resolves around the companies' demands which 
can be described as controversial and provocative.''
<P>
	Further down on page 58, the report reads: ``Their 
demands-that is the companies' demands-are so 
controversial and provocative because of the partisan role taken 
by the government''-this is Commissioner Hope 
speaking-``the partisan role taken by the 
government''-which is, until further notice, the Liberal 
government-``which supports the position of the railway 
companies, and because of the tenacity with which the 
companies have stuck to these demands''. This quote can be 
found on page 58 of the Hope report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> This is only a huge charade on the part of the 
government, to score political points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> I would ask the Canadians and Quebecers who 
are watching us today from their living room or their kitchen to 
remember-Quebec has a fine motto: ``I remember''-that the 
Bloc Quebecois exposed the fact that the president of CN, Paul 
Tellier, who has a yearly salary of $345,000 plus a $52,000 a 
year expense account, received a $300,000 interest-free loan to 
buy a house in Westmount.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves if it is normal, if it is realistic, in 1995, 
that a senior civil servant paid with our taxes, the taxes of 
Canadians and Quebecers, benefit from such perks. I do not care 
if these advantages are offered to the president of CP or the 
president of General Motors of Canada. If these companies want 
to share their profits, they have the right to do so. However, 
when the president of CN benefits from such perks and we are 
paying for that through our taxes, it is a different matter. Do the 
viewers who are watching us today pay their mortgage each 
month?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> We pay our mortgage, and the president of 
CN, who is a government official, should pay his mortgage like 
everybody else.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He has negotiated good working 
conditions for himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> I welcome Paul Tellier to the next referendum 
debate and I look forward to hearing him say to Quebecers that 
they have to tighten their belts, just as he is saying to railway 
employees. There are full-page ads in the daily newspapers 
saying that CN has many employees who are paid for doing 
nothing. But what about his interest-free loan? We have to 
remind Canadians of that.
<P>
	I also want to remind members of this House and all our 
viewers of what our Minister of Transport said at the beginning 
of October when he was guest speaker at a dinner held in 
Winnipeg by WESTAC, the Western Transportation Advisory 
Committee. He said: ``Railway workers with grade eight or nine 
education cannot be blamed for negotiating excessive labour 
contracts''.
<P>
	That shows the contempt that the Minister of Transport feels 
for the 62,000 railway employees in Canada. These comments 
come from someone on the management side. I come from the 
management side, and I say that some things are totally 
unacceptable. The employees' level of education has nothing to 
do with all this. Railway workers are important for rail transport 
in Canada, and the proof of that is that, since they have decided 
to exercise their democratic right to stop working, rail transport 
is shut down.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Often, we hear: ``You, the opposition, are good at denouncing. 
You are good at blocking things''. Yes, but we also make 
proposals. True, we oppose the government and I would like to 
tell the Liberal majority members that when we are not here any 
more, once the sovereignty of Quebec has come about, you will 
have the Reform Party as the official opposition and everything 
will be very fine. You will have an extreme right party as the 
official opposition and you will just see that everything will be 
fine in Canada. As for us, we will be sovereign.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. 
member for Nickel Belt for reminding me of the role of the NDP, 
the party which had been, since the time of Tommy Douglas, 
traditionally committed to fight for the interests of workers. I 
want to say to all the workers of Canada and Quebec that the 
only party that is fighting for the rights of workers, including the 
right to strike, is the Bloc Quebecois. The NDP has abandoned 
workers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> They joined the Reform.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is true. They abandoned them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> The NDP Reformers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> What is the Bloc Quebecois proposing? We 
are told that we are good at criticizing, but we also put proposals 
forward. As recently as last Tuesday, our leader, the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean, really made  an offer to the Prime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10995"> 10995 </A></B>
<P>
Minister and the government, saying: ``We agree to pass back to 
work legislation and to ensure mediation for 60 days, to put an 
end to the exercise of the right to strike and the right to order a 
lockout, so that the parties can negotiate on an equal basis, 
freely and democratically. Then after that, we will see''.
<P>
	We proposed exactly the same solution as the one used in the 
dispute at the Port of Montreal. There are 7,000 containers now 
leaving the port of Montreal. People there are busy working and 
negotiating and my sources tell me that there is good hope an 
agreement will be reached. There has been no special legislation 
to deal with the dispute at the Port of Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> I just described the suggestion put forward by 
the Bloc. In conclusion, I would like to remind the House of 
what the Liberals are suggesting. They want to cut down on 
working conditions of railway workers, more particularly those 
at CN. The last budget announced a garage sale, a spring 
clearance sale in the transportation sector. To make the assets 
more saleable, collective agreements will be made less 
expensive, especially those of the workers at CN. The Liberals 
want to take away from workers their basic right to strike, the 
only democratic means they have to express their dissatisfaction 
with their employer. Nobody likes to go on strike, but when you 
have to, you have no choice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very proud to take the floor today to speak to Bill C-77, an 
Act to provide for the maintenance of railway operations and 
subsidiary services.
<P>
	I am proud because the action the government and the 
Minister of Labour have taken is basically a responsible move. 
When I look at the opposition members, I have to admit, much to 
my regret, that they are consistent. Members of the official 
opposition party are consistent because they always had as their 
philosophy that politics never work. Consequently, they apply 
that philosophy to everthing they do.
<P>
	People are told that is their philosophy, and people will make 
up their own mind. But now, I would like to examine the two 
opposite positions we have before us today. On one side, we 
have the stance of the official opposition that wants to amend the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Where does that amendment leave us? The opposition 
proposes a 60-day mediation process, that is 50 days for 
mediation and 10 days to let the Minister read the report and 
table it in the House. But, after these 60 days, if there is no 
agreement, we are in a dead end, and it is back to square one with 
the lockout, strike and never-ending disputes. That is not the 
way things should work with responsible people and a 
responsible government.
<P>
	On the other side, there is the position of the government, 
which is reasonable and responsible, which I support and which 
gives a mediation-arbitration commission composed of three 
persons a 70-day mandate to let the parties try to reach an 
agreement by mediation. During this 70-day period, the 
committee will hear both parties, and then, if the parties still do 
not reach an agreement, there is no denying that the members of 
the commission will have in hand all the necessary elements to 
make a proper decision. They will be able to weigh both sides 
and, after the 70 days, if no agreement is reached-because we, 
as the government, want to go ahead, and all parties, no doubt, 
want to go ahead-this commission will make a decision in full 
knowledge of the facts.
<P>
	There is no need to go any further and explain in greater detail 
the positions of both parties. There is no need to further 
elaborate to see that the government's solution is realistic and 
reasonable. However, I will repeat what I said at the beginning. 
It is sad to see that members from the Official Opposition are 
unable to rise above their own political interest and 
partisanship. How can they confuse their own interest with that 
of the population, the public interest? How can they confuse 
partisanship with such serious problems requiring a quick 
conclusion and solution.
<P>
	On the other side of the House, they disregard the interest of 
employers and employees and they also disregard the numerous 
economic problems this dispute is creating in Quebec. The 
previous speakers talked about that, therefore I will not give you 
the long list of businesses having a hard time these days, and the 
long list of employees being laid off. It is sad to see these people 
claim they represent the workers when, in fact, they are acting in 
their own best interest. Once again, they are just trying to fool 
the people. The Parti Quebecois simply does not want the 
system to work.
<P>
	Since the Parti Quebecois was elected in Quebec City, they 
have showed us repeatedly, and they are demonstrating once 
again that they do not want federalism to work. Unfortunately, 
they apply this ideology to real problems affecting the public. 
They have left the Canada-wide negotiation table on 
environment, where Quebec was one of the main and most 
important participants. But since they do not want the system to 
work, they left the table. What annoys them right now is that you 
have here, on this side of the House, a responsible government, a 
government that is holding the course, that is also responding to 
the expectations of the provinces. We only have to look at the 
finance minister's budget.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10996"> 10996 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon: </B>I say that we only have to look at the finance 
minister's budget. To see how much this annoys them, we only 
have to listen to the opposition members yelling today. When 
they are annoyed, they yell and they yell loudly. That is what 
they are doing right now. The budget responds to the requests of 
the provinces. For instance, the Canada social transfer gives 
much more autonomy to the provinces and will allow them to 
refine their own social programs. That annoys the Bloc. They 
are now trying other political avenues, still for partisan 
purposes. What is sad this time is that they are playing party 
politics on the backs of workers across Canada. And that is 
mean-spirited.
<P>
	The finance minister also responded to the expectations of the 
provinces in terms of national standards. The new Canada 
Transfer and the national standards will be worked out with the 
provinces. The provinces will be asked to discuss these 
standards with the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
so that they will reflect the reality of all the provinces, the 
Canadian reality.
<P>
	In conclusion, there are on this side of the House, thank 
heavens, people who are capable of rising above political 
interests and capable of acting responsibly to ensure that we 
make decisions so that, in this case, the economy and labour 
relations can progress and, ultimately, all workers across 
Canada, the Canadian economy and Canada as a whole can 
benefit. The message that I am sending to the opposition parties 
is this one: stop acting for purely partisan motives. People told 
you that during the regional commissions; they want 
governments that deal with the real problems, and that is what 
we are doing in the case of the rail dispute. I congratulate the 
labour minister for her initiative, and I also commend the 
government for its responsible vision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Réf.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise and speak to Bill C-77. Part of 
the blame has already been put today on the Bloc Quebecois. 
You could also argue that they did not act as a national party nor 
in the interests of Canada, and that they only have the interests 
of Quebec at heart. Personally, I would blame the government 
far more than the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> I say that for several reasons. First, over the last 
18 months, the government reacted to things instead of acting, 
as it should have.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we look at the longshoremen's strike as well as the rail 
strike, we can see that the government could foresee what was 
going to happen. The government knew there was a strike 
coming on. What did it do? Nothing. C'est le mot précis, rien.
<P>
	We have a government that is reactive. We have any number 
of examples, one being the budget. Look at the government's 
action on the budget. It knew it had to do something but how 
much did it do? Just the bare  minimum to keep things a little bit 
in balance. That is the government's approach throughout this.
<P>
	Look at national defence and the situation with the Canadian 
forces. We have had this whole Somalia thing whirling around 
our ears for several years now. The government had the 
opportunity to take action on this but it did not.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I blame the government for a lack of leadership and a lack of 
initiative. Let me remind the House of the airborne situation. 
The government saw what was coming. It was pressed as long 
ago as September 1994 to have an inquiry, get things out in the 
open, and find out what had gone wrong. The government said 
no, it would wait. It dragged its feet. When it stopped dragging 
its feet, it finally moved a baby step, not a big one, never enough 
to cope with what is needed.
<P>
	We find exactly the same thing with Bill C-77. Bill C-77 is 
not a permanent solution. It gets us off the hook for another year 
or maybe two years. We will be voting for Bill C-77 because we 
have a Canadian problem on our hands. This just temporarily 
gets us off the hook. It is another baby step on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	Permanent solutions are available. My hon. colleague from 
Lethbridge proposed a private member's bill, Bill C-262 a week 
or two ago. In Bill C-262 lie the seeds of a permanent solution 
the problem, not only in the rail area, but in the area of 
stevedoring as well. Why do we not come up with a permanent 
solution to these things? We have had 50 years of strikes. What 
does that mean? It means that the collective bargaining process 
in the area we are talking about and in the longshoring area is not 
working.
<P>
	We had the recent strike in Vancouver. Incidentally no one 
else here was very concerned about it. ``It is just Vancouver so 
we will legislate that quickly. No big problem''.
<P>
	I want to read a couple of quotes from two things. One is part 
of a letter from the Canadian Wheat Board to the government: 
``In a letter to your government dated April 1994, we the Wheat 
Board proposed that in those cases where a negotiated 
settlement could not be reached, a binding arbitration process, 
including final offer selection be instituted. This type of action 
would mean that a strike could be averted and the parties could 
continue to pursue collective bargaining. In short, the interests 
of all parties could be satisfied''. This is the wheat board talking 
to the Government of Canada.
<P>
	This went out a year ago in April 1994. It has been reiterated 
in March 1995. These are cries in the wilderness saying: 
``Government, please listen''. Government has a responsibility 
to take a leadership role and it is not doing it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10997"> 10997 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to read a line or two from a commission that 
looked into the Vancouver ports area several years ago. The 
commission stated: ``There are two key impediments to the 
future growth of container traffic in the port of Vancouver. One 
is a lack of co-ordinated effort by various links in the 
intermodal chain. The other is a poor labour relations climate in 
the port of Vancouver which acts as a disincentive for potential 
investment in the port and its related intermodal linkage.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	To overcome both these impediments requires a new approach 
to managing human resources and organizational behaviour in 
the port than has been taking place in the past. The experience in 
Puget Sound ports, particularly in Tacoma, reveals that these 
elements can be adjusted, attitudes can be changed and 
reputations can be altered. The key to success seems to be the 
provision of leadership and effective organization in order to 
harness and channel available resources toward an identifiable 
goal''. It is possible.
<P>
	Let me cite one other example where the government could 
have done something in anticipation of a problem. It 
commissioned the Fraser report. A year ago the Minister of 
Human Resources Development appointed Paul Fraser to 
conduct an independent review of current labour issues on the 
railway. This report was supposed to be tabled in June 1994. It is 
still not on the scene. Where is the Fraser report? What is the 
government doing with it?
<P>
	Was the minister so flustered by the lack of progress with his 
social programs that he scrapped this one as well? We have a 
new Minister of Labour in the House. Perhaps that minister will 
pick it up and do something with it.
<P>
	The Fraser report, along with all the other reports that have 
been done ad nauseam, may have provided a long term solution 
to this continuing problem. However, the Fraser report is 
non-existent. Even if it did exist, it would be ignored. The point 
I am making is that the west coast terminal strike could have 
been avoided in the same way that this railway strike could have 
been avoided. We need a commission to come up with a 
permanent solution.
<P>
	I stand here as a Reformer, saying this is what the government 
should do. However I know that not many across the way are 
listening. Sometimes I ask myself, are you being effective in 
Parliament, member for Nanaimo-Cowichan? A year ago I 
would have given you the answer: I really do not know. What am 
I doing here? What effect am I having? This year I have the 
answer. The answer is: If we stick to our principles, which we 
are doing, the markers are moving.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, for all the world, sounded like a 
Reformer a month or two ago. He sounded totally like a 
Reformer. He was getting the message. He was trying to get that 
message across through the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is my duty and privilege to rise and speak to Bill C-77, an act to 
provide for the maintenance of railway operations and 
subsidiary services.
<P>
	I wish to address my concerns to the railway employees who 
may be watching this important debate. For the reasons 
enunciated so clearly by the Minister of Labour, the Minister for 
International Trade and the Minister of Industry, the service 
you, the railway workers and management, provide is the 
lifeline and key component of the country's extensive 
transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	You supply a vital service for the industrial trade and 
agricultural sectors of our growing economy. We in the House 
can appreciate concerns for your personal finances, but would 
you disagree with this member for Hamilton West when I say 
that the best job security you can have is to work for a company 
that makes a profit.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	The economic impact of the current rail strike has been made 
painfully clear to each and every one of us. We hear of it in our 
ridings. We see the impact on the operations of a broad range of 
large and small industries and employers.
<P>
	In its opposition to the legislation, the Bloc Quebecois is 
parochially principled. The official opposition is pretending 
that it is acting in the interest of collective bargaining rights by 
criticizing the mediation and arbitration provisions of Bill 
C-77, the merits of which have not been questioned by the 
stakeholders.
<P>
	By perpetuating this kind of navel gazing, the official 
opposition is not only missing the entire point of the legislation, 
it is also thumbing its nose at the real concerns of both labour 
and management.
<P>
	While the opposition's thinly veiled political agenda 
continues to cripple the Canadian economy, 2,500 Canadian 
auto workers at Ford's St. Thomas, Ontario plant have been sent 
home because of shortages. Three thousand, nine hundred 
Canadian auto workers at Oakville and Windsor were forced to 
work half time this week. Seventy thousand commuters in 
Montreal and Toronto are lined up on the highways and at the 
bus stations facing long delays getting to and from work. Not to 
mention it is estimated the national rail strike could end up 
costing this great country, a country in a period of growth, $3 to 
$5 billion by the time it is finally resolved.
<P>
	In the same way that railway employees and management 
would like to stabilize their labour related economic 
circumstances, we in government must do everything we can to 
stabilize the nation's economy. In short, from an economic 
standpoint we have to be productive to survive. It is that simple.
<P>
	The transportation critic for the Bloc Quebecois went beet red 
in the face a few moments ago decrying the economic 
advantages of management. I agree with the  opposition critic. 
They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10998"> 10998 </A></B>
<P>
are outrageous but there are two sides to that story. There are 
two sides to every story.
<P>
	He conveniently forgets about the 600 employees on full 
salary who are not working under the current arrangement. If CN 
needs 250 employees in Calgary, not one of the 600 fully 
salaried, non-working employees in the east can be moved to 
Calgary to fill those jobs.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Industrial relations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> There are two sides to every story, I say to the 
hon. member.
<P>
	It has been established that such labour provisions could end 
up costing CN $77 million over the next five years. I repeat, the 
best job security an employee can have is to work for a company 
that makes a profit.
<P>
	The example given by the Bloc transport critic and the 
example given by me just now have brought negotiations to an 
impasse. I appeal to the members opposite to end the petty 
politicking.
<P>
	Almost two years of negotiations have produced no progress 
on any of those major issues. The Bloc wants another 60 days of 
mediation, which neither side in this dispute wants, only to 
eventually and most probably bring us full circle back to where 
we are at this moment in the House.
<P>
	I ask the Bloc Quebecois, I ask the official opposition, to think 
of their constituents who must bear the economic burden of the 
Bloc's opposition to Bill C-77. Think of the many workers 
across the country who are waiting, who are praying to get back 
to work. There is nothing to be gained by waiting but there is 
much that is being lost.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all I 
may recall that whatever hon. members opposite may have said, 
the reason we are here today and the trains are still not running is 
not because of the Bloc Quebecois but because the government 
refuses to accept a universal labour principle: mediation.
<P>
	They want to impose arbitration, they want to impose terms 
and conditions of employment and give the public the 
impression that the Bloc Quebecois is to blame, although from 
day one, on Monday and the day after, the Bloc Quebecois, 
through its leader, offered to settle the dispute immediately if 
the government accepted mediation. We in the Bloc are just as 
aware as you that this is a serious matter. We realize, as you do, 
that the workers must get back to work as soon as possible. But 
that is not the point of this debate.
<P>
	Today's debate is about the fact that the government 
absolutely wants to prescribe arbitration and impose terms and 
conditions of employment, not about mediation, a mechanism 
that works very well. Just this past week in the Port of Montreal, 
negotiations led to a settlement, acceptable to both parties, that 
will provide for good labour relations.
<P>
	I speak here as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development which examined this bill clause 
by clause on Wednesday, under a gag order. This is the first time 
in the history of this Parliament that a government imposed time 
allocation on the consideration of a bill in committee. And we 
only had four hours to consider it. We nevertheless proceeded to 
clause by clause consideration.
<P>
	Also and above all, I speak as the member for a riding that has 
a high concentration of railway activity. I want to talk about the 
railway centre in Charny, created mainly because of that 
activity. I regularly meet people who work in this town. I visit 
them regularly, almost daily, although perhaps a little less, of 
late, because I have to be in Ottawa several days a week. I speak 
on the behalf not only of the rail workers but of the people whose 
livelihood depends on the railways. In my riding, there is no 
problem. Business people realize that the railways are 
important. The government obviously does not, since it let this 
dispute deteriorate.
<P>
	Without wishing to make this a personal crusade, I want to say 
that I listen to what my constituents have to say and represent 
their concerns. CN workers in my riding are so concerned about 
the future of a business to which they are very much attached 
that they made the president of CN a purchase offer. Is this 
evidence of bad faith, when people believe so strongly in the 
business they work for that they want to buy it? They want to 
keep their company alive, unlike Mr. Tellier who ever since he 
was appointed has been doing a job on CN.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans 
said earlier that Mr. Tellier is now the highest paid public 
servant, with an annual salary of $345,000 plus a personal 
expense allowance of $51,000. He also asked his company for an 
interest-free loan so he could acquire a house in Westmount. He 
even said in the paper that if CN had not agreed, he would have 
turned down the job. Poor Mr. Tellier.
<P>
	Last year, he came to Charny to explain to workers the reasons 
for cutbacks and job cuts. The workers told him they did not see 
why he was cutting positions because conductors were working 
overtime, were always on standby with a pagette and sometimes 
worked 14 days running.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Why cut jobs under these circumstances? It would be much 
better to have more people working in order for everyone to have 
better working conditions and a better quality of life. But no, he 
did not listen. Mr. Tellier is not the only one causing problems at 
the CN level. Some senior officers, though not many, have left, 
and each time it ended with an agreement of several hundred 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10999"> 10999 </A></B>
<P>
thousands of dollars. In some cases, the amounts even came 
close to $600,000 in addition to pension benefits. Is that the sort 
of example to give when workers are being asked to tighten their 
belts? My constituents say no, and  do not accept such poor 
service. I believe that if people knew what is going on at the CN, 
they would not accept it either.
<P>
	What is lacking is information. But if you want information 
from the CN-I sat on the transport committee last year. Six 
months later, the president of the CN still has not given any 
answers to the legitimate requests made by the opposition in 
committee. He has not answered his employees either.
<P>
	The amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois today relate 
mainly to mediation and seek to eliminate the word 
``arbitration'', the process that the government wants to impose. 
The main problem is clause 12, which we want to amend in such 
a way that the commission it refers to will be guided by the need 
for good relations between the employer and unions and, to this 
end, promote terms and conditions of employment that take into 
account both the workers' acquired rights, the economic 
situation and the competitiveness of the whole Canadian rail 
system. But the government refuses to support such a balanced 
approach, which would take into account both the needs of the 
workers and the economic situation. No CN employee wants to 
hurt the economy, quite the opposite. But we can see that the 
government, that wants to privatize the CN, is eager to sell it off, 
bit by bit, to companies whose interests sometimes do not match 
those of the rail industry. We have seen people in that situation 
in the case of Murray Bay for example. Those people are 
truckers. What interests are they promoting?
<P>
	There is no enthusiasm whatsoever. I have been saying it over 
and over again and I have been in contact with people in the rail 
industry in my region for many years. The poor labour climate 
imposed by management drags on and on. Unfortunately, the 
same executive team which was in place under the Tories is still 
there to finish the dirty job. This government said that it wanted 
to put an end to this situation, but in actual fact, through its 
decisions, it continues to implement the policies of the 
Conservative Party. People in Quebec have trouble 
understanding why it is so. There is something else Quebecers 
have trouble understanding. In Quebec, like anywhere else, 
there have been strikes, yet people have come to accept the 
principle of the right to strike. People understand the 
importance of mediation, and of negotiating working 
conditions. This creates a better climate and this is a more 
productive way of doing things. Recently, at MIL Davie, 
workers accepted the working conditions which had been 
negotiated that way, because they understood how important 
those conditions were for their company, its survival, and also 
its improved operations.
<P>
	People balk at the working conditions the government wants 
to impose. The government is refusing to enforce appropriate 
legislation. There is a labour dispute at Ogilvie, which has been 
dragging on forever. Scabs have  been allowed in, even though 
this is happening in Quebec. Why? Because of the federal 
legislation.
<P>
	To conclude, I will say that Quebec is a distinct society. In 
Quebec, we refuse to work in a climate of confrontation. From 
now on, we want working conditions in Quebec to be 
democratically negotiated.

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech by the 
member opposite and I am wondering if he has read, like I did, 
what one of his own colleagues, the member for Longueuil, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I receive lots of congratulation phone calls. I only got calls of praise. Even 
good sovereignists and some mayors called me to pledge their support.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He was speaking of the fact that he sided against his party, the 
Bloc Quebecois. A bit further on, when some people threatened 
to penalize him for the stance he had taken, the member for 
Longueuil said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not see how voters could penalize me. It seems to me that exactly the 
opposite is happening. We have a major problem because transportation is 
almost at a standstill. These people must go back to work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what the Bloc member said of his colleagues-at least, 
he was a member of the Bloc Quebecois when this interview was 
made. The member for Rosemont must know that.
<P>
	This strike is damaging all parts of Canada, all across the 
country. We must put a stop to it. I received calls from 
constituents and also from striking railway workers. In a 
specific case, a friend of mine told me-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Perhaps this concept is beyond the hon. 
members across the way, but sometimes voters are friends with 
their MP. I realize this does not happen often with the Bloc 
Quebecois members.
<P>
	You know, at the risk of boasting, when I received 80 per cent 
of the votes in my riding, some of them at least were by friends.
<P>
	So, this voter called me to say it was impossible to live on $3 a 
day strike pay. The hon. members opposite do not live on $3 a 
day. No, they get their full salary. And so they should, but they 
should remember that some people are not as fortunate as they 
are.

	Let us look at some of the effects of this. General Motors and 
Ford employ around 21,000 people in the greater Toronto area 
and their plants have shut down. They cannot ship all the cars 
they are selling and get all the parts to keep those plants running 
by truck traffic alone. It is impossible. They need the rail sector. 
That is why it is there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers Association said that the strike 
cost the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a 
week. I have just heard the Bloc Quebecois finance critic. 
Perhaps he was hoping that no one would hear him. He said that 
this was more than Canada's GDP. I hope Canadians in the 
manufacturing sector heard the words of the Bloc Quebecois 
finance critic.
<P>
	We cannot go on like this. I beseech the hon. members across 
the floor to do their duty and vote with the government to end 
this strike. Otherwise, if they want to vote against it, I will 
respect their decision to do so. But I would ask them to please 
stop blocking-even though they are Bloc members-the entire 
country as they are today. They can vote against the bill, but they 
must allow it to be passed.
<P>
	Even in Quebec, Kruger in Trois-Rivières, Stone 
Consolidated Inc. in Port-Alfred, Pétromont, Shell in Montreal, 
the port of Bécancour, Alcan, ADI, Reynolds and 
Lauralco-they all need rail service. These people need us to 
end the strike today.

<P>
	A few minutes ago, I telephoned the St-Isidore de Prescott 
farmers' co-operative, in my riding of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. The hon. members opposite 
who take the 417 highway to get home will undoubtedly 
remember passing by the lovely community of St-Isidore in my 
riding. Workers at the St-Isidore farmers' co-operative told me 
today that soya beans cost 20 per cent more this week.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Oh, no? Well, I am telling the members 
opposite to dial the following number: area code (613) 
524-2828. Ask the people at the St-Isidore co-operative. They 
will tell you: farm products now cost 20 per cent more in my 
riding because of the Bloc's actions today, because of the Bloc 
members' failure to fulfil their public duty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	And if that was not enough, we are sitting in the House of 
Commons today. Of course all of us work full time in this 
business. If we were not here doing this, presumably we would 
be home meeting with our constituents. So either way we would 
be working.
<P>
	In order to keep the House of Commons sitting today it costs 
the taxpayers of Canada $17,125 an hour more than what it 
normally costs. I repeat, $17,125 an hour more. Tomorrow if we 
sit, it will be more like $25,000 an hour. I say to the MPs across, 
if by some misfortune, some unlikely proposition they were to 
refuse unanimous consent later on today to do third reading of 
this bill-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I cannot imagine that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I cannot imagine it either, but if they do, they 
are going to cost the taxpayers of Canada another $100,000. 
When people are brought in it is for a minimum of four hours. 
Therefore it will cost another $100,000 to prolong their ego trip 
for one more day. It is going to cost another $100,000 to the good 
people of Canada who are paying the salaries of the members 
across the way along with the rest of us in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Why are you afraid of our 
amendments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I would like to say to the hon. members 
opposite, who have not stopped making a ruckus, that I 
understand their agitation at this moment; they may be a little 
embarrassed. The hon. members opposite are finally beginning 
to see the light, and that makes them restless. They look like 
they are on the defensive.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What was the number again?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> 524-2828. I repeat for the information of hon. 
members opposite that is the telephone number for the 
St-Isidore farmers' co-operative. And that is but one of the 
farmers' co-operatives in my riding. There are others, farmers 
in my riding which the Bloc purports to defend from time to 
time, Canadian farmers. I say to them: Wake up. Help the 
Canadian farming industry. Help Canadian industry in general, 
from coast to coast. Help everybody who takes commuter trains 
to get to work, be it in Montreal, Toronto or elsewhere. They too 
want to have transportation to get home and see their families.
<P>
	I say to the hon. members opposite and to the leader of the 
Bloc that hundreds and hundreds, even thousands of people in 
Toronto and Montreal would like to be like everybody else and 
go home, but are unable to do so at present. Why? Because of the 
strike which could have been ended a week ago, had the hon. 
members opposite given their consent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> We could have ended it a 
week ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Why did they not consent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is because of the ego trip they are on. That is the only 
reason. Instead of doing what is right, they did what a handful of 
people asked them, told them or ordered them to do, instead of 
doing what their constituents want. That is the sad reality. That 
is what the Bloc Quebecois has been doing for the last week, 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
initially supported by  the NDP just in case some Canadians had 
forgotten. But even the NDP came around. That tells us that even 
the people in the NDP finally got some common sense. Well, I 
hope the Bloc Quebecois gets some now.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, at the

	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I called from the lobby. I was 
told that soya beans cost 20 per cent more today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> We just called.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member did not 
retract what he said, although a mistake was clearly made.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I just made the call myself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> They cost 20 per cent more.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. Order, please. I 
would remind all of the members who rose on the point of order 
that it was a point of debate. I now recognize the hon. member 
for Lethbridge.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, looking at the 
situation before us we can say that the delay is unfortunate for 
all Canadians to a great extent. The responsibility today 
certainly lies with the Bloc Quebecois as its members come here 
and go through a lot of political gymnastics in an attempt to 
prove something to Canada. That is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	The amendment before us asks for what is called a mediation 
commission. If there was sincerity behind that amendment I 
would buy it. However, when I listen to the Bloc present its case 
to this House, the case is one of political expediency. It is not to 
change the law of the country nor to bring about a common sense 
solution to the problem. Therefore I do not buy it, nor do my 
Reform Party colleagues.
<P>
	It is unforgiving for a political party to play with our 
economy. Ministers of this government have outlined situations 
that are costing Canadians billions of dollars. My colleagues 
have given examples where industries are hurt, where factories 
and a variety of businesses which are very dependent upon 
shipping in this country are hurt to a significant degree. And 
politics are being played in this House to delay the inevitable, 
that the workers must go back to work and that we must get the 
transportation system back on track.
<P>
	That is where we are today. As a common sense political 
party, we believe it is time to act. The Minister of Labour has 
brought legislation before the House. We are prepared to support 
it and move it as quickly as possible through the final stages.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I know we have been critical of the Minister of Labour. 
However, we have also generalized it to government saying that 
the government should have acted sooner and not only brought 
in back to work legislation but also put in place a long term 
solution to the problem.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour, as I listen to her in her new 
assignment, is committed. We are going to hold her accountable 
for this on behalf of the Reform Party. We will also hold her 
accountable as the representative of the Liberal Government of 
Canada. From what I understand, the commission which is going 
to be established will bring about a long term solution to the 
problem. We want that to happen.
<P>
	I have heard other comments in the House today that would 
only support that general direction of government, the 
somewhat commitment of government. I hope it is a real 
commitment. I hope it is not just political statements for 
expedient reasons at this point and then six months to a year 
from now we have no action by government toward a long term 
solution.
<P>
	As I listened to the Minister for International Trade today he 
said: ``Rail services should be available so that our goods can 
reach our ports and move across the U.S.-Canadian border''. We 
agree with that. That is the way it should be. The minister also 
went on to say that we need a more satisfactory way to resolve 
disputes in our rail system, which is absolutely true. We support 
that. That is a statement of commitment by the minister as I read 
it. I hope that minister will follow through and with the Minister 
of Labour will bring about a long term solution.
<P>
	The minister for trade also went on to say in his remarks to 
this assembly: ``Early resolution of the rail strike which is 
causing such problems to our rail system is certainly 
necessary''. We agree with that as well. That is why we are here 
today.
<P>
	That is the position of the Reform Party. We want action. We 
want action immediately to deal with this matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11002"> 11002 </A></B>
<P>
	It is my hope that the Bloc Quebecois will reconsider delaying 
this debate until tomorrow so we can forgo further expense. The 
government whip has indicated there are enormous costs in 
continuing the operation of this assembly, not only for Saturday 
but on Sunday as well. These unnecessary costs are being placed 
upon Canadians because of one political party that wants to play 
a political game, which is completely unsatisfactory.
<P>
	Where are we then as the Reform Party? What is our position? 
What do we think should be done at this point?
<P>
	First, we are prepared to support the current legislation, Bill 
C-77, that will put the workers back to work and our 
transportation in operation as of this coming Monday.
<P>
	Second, we are concerned that the government did not put the 
legislation in place at an earlier date. There were many signals. 
My colleague, the critic for labour, indicated in his remarks that 
the signals were there and that the government should have put 
in place legislation upon which we could have acted more 
quickly.
<P>
	Third, we think there is a long term solution to this problem. 
Bill C-262 was voted on in this House earlier this week. A 
principle in that bill is supported by a number of groups across 
Canada. We said clearly in Bill C-262 that there should be 
binding arbitration in place to bring about a conclusion to a 
dispute. The two parties in that process would each place their 
final offer on the table, the arbitrator would choose, and our rail 
system would continue to work.
<P>
	Some people say that is the wrong way to handle the problem, 
that we violate some basic principles of the collective 
bargaining process. I do not believe that is true. In this 
circumstance there is a difference.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In collective bargaining circumstances we have management 
and employees. They bargain back and forth through the process 
and reach a point where there can either be a lockout or a strike. 
Under most circumstances that is acceptable.
<P>
	However, when we are looking at the transportation system of 
the country there is a third party that loses its rights, that does 
not have any say in the process but pays the bill. The most 
obvious example is the agricultural community, the agricultural 
producer or the processor of agricultural products. We are 
required as farmers or agricultural producers to ship our goods 
via the railway. When there are no other options we must place 
the goods on the railway, get them to port, into the hold of the 
boat and into the international market.
<P>
	If we cannot have a reliable transportation system there will 
be a huge economic impact on the agricultural sectors. We have 
seen that some 15 times in the last 25 years. Billions of dollars 
have been lost in that industry. The third party, the producer, was 
the victim. He had no say but paid the bills. That is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	With Bill C-77 we will have binding arbitration in place that 
will be the solution to the problem. It has been the solution to the 
problem some 14 or 15 times in the last 25 years. It has been the 
only way to settle the problem. It has been satisfactory to 
management and employees. Government has had no other 
alternative but to knee-jerk and bring in special legislation to 
put people back to work.
<P>
	Our recommendation as the Reform Party is that we should 
have that mechanism in place on a permanent basis so that when 
the two parties get to a point where they have to settle a dispute 
arbitration kicks in and the solution is there for the problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
must admit that I am saddened today to see that we are unable to 
reach an agreement on a serious problem which is hurting the 
country and its citizens so much. I would have thought that when 
faced with such a big challenge, we could have given each other 
a hand and have found a solution that would make everybody 
happy. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
<P>
	That is sad, because the strike costs $500 million a day. By the 
end of the strike, say the workers come back on Monday, we will 
have lost $5 billion. Just break that figure down into how much 
each citizen of the country lost. It is a huge sum.
<P>
	Obviously businesses and stores almost everywhere in 
Canada are affected. Obviously Canadians are all affected. It is 
having very, very dire and, in some cases, brutal repercussions 
for people. We often forget that workers are also affected. Not 
only those on strike, not only those who are locked out, but also 
those prevented from working because of what is going on. I 
find that so sad.
<P>
	You have all heard that the Bloc is touting itself as the 
defender of workers' rights. But we have to ask ourselves one 
basic question. Which workers are they defending?
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Is it the workers of the industries listed here: the Himont 
petrochemical plant in Varennes, where production has dropped 
by 25 per cent; ICI, a petrochemical plant in Dalhousie, with a 
33 per cent drop in production; Donohue, a pulp and paper plant 
in Saint-Félicien, Quebec, now closed, with 100 people out of a 
job; Donohue, a pulp and paper plant in Clermont, slated to close 
down, laying off 75 employees; Franceau, in Chambord, where 
190 employees stand to be laid off; Univers, in Val d'Or, which 
will throw 16 employees out of work; Forpan Inc., in Val d'Or, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11003"> 11003 </A></B>
<P>
where 146 employees could be out of work; Panval Inc., in 
Soyabec, slated to close down, laying off 238 employees; or 
PanFiber, in Mont-Laurier, where 101 employees could be laid 
off? Are those the people the Bloc Quebecois seeks to protect?
<P>
	You know as well as I do that what they are trying to do, of 
course, is to disguise their true intentions. Why is it that the Bloc 
said absolutely nothing when the government forced the 
longshoremen to resume work in Vancouver? They did not say a 
word. Why is that? It is obvious. They have a big problem. They 
went too far. They did not understand. They have not been 
sensitive enough to the rest of the country. Now, they are 
looking for a way to put that behind them. They made a bad 
move; it was poor judgment on their part.
<P>
	Let us look at the damage done by this strike. I will quote from 
an article published yesterday, March 24, in <I>The Ottawa Sun</I>. I 
want to make sure I quote it correctly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is the height of irresponsibility for Bouchard to stall back to work 
legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The strike is costing industry $500 million a day in lost production and sales. 
By the time the legislation is eventually passed by Parliament on Sunday, the 
strike will have cost the economy $5 billion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The dispute has delayed shipments of potash, grain, coal, ore, forestry 
products, heavy industrial components, processed food, chemicals, 
manufactured products and other goods.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For Canada's farmers, the strike could not have come at a worst time. It is the 
busiest time of year, with nearly 25,000 rail cars on sidings waiting to deliver 
the rest of last summer's harvest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we were to ask my colleague from Brandon-Souris how 
the people in his riding are affected, he would corroborate that it 
is disastrous for the farmer and certainly the western Canadian 
farmer.
<P>
	The articles continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tens of thousands of workers across the country have been laid off because of 
the disruption, while many more are being forced to work half shifts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At least 70,000 commuters in Toronto and Montreal face the inconvenience 
of finding other ways to get to work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The stalling tactics are certainly linked to supporting the 
referendum. Referring to the province of Quebec the article 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The strike has hurt the province's manufacturers, aluminium industry and its 
pulp and paper companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For example, forest giant Repap Enterprises faces imminent shutdowns and 
layoffs affecting 5,000 workers that could paralyse entire communities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the reasons why Bouchard is being obstructionist is to keep good

independence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Clearly, Bouchard feels he can't afford to anger the unions which are one of 
the few organized groups in Quebec willing to jump over the cliff to reach the 
separatist dream.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The article is a little harsh and goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bouchard has demonstrated to Quebecers that he's clueless about bread and 
butter issues. If he doesn't know the impact that the strike is having in Quebec 
then imagine what would happen if the province ever separated from Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How can Quebecers put trust in his lofty claims that there won't be any 
economic fallout if Quebec separates?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Obviously they can't if he isn't able to see the consequences of a rail strike 
which is essential to the entire Canadian economy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the article states. It is a condemnation of the 
actions of Bloc Quebecois members. They show quite clearly 
that what they are trying to do is take advantage of the situation 
for their own political gain.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are two basic principles to consider. We all agree that, 
as far as possible, work agreements should be negotiated, that 
labour disputes should be settled through negotiation. Ideally, 
we all wish it could be so. But do you not think there is another 
principle that is equally important and sometimes more 
important here, namely the protection of the public, the 
protection of this country's economy to which we owe the 
quality of life we enjoy in Canada at this time? That is what we 
are doing today. It is not that we do not want workers to reach an 
agreement with their employers. We gave them time and no 
agreement was reached. Now, in the face of the damage done by 
this strike, we have to take action. We have no choice.
<P>
	Many Bloc members mentioned that the bill will be used in 
other sectors in the future, because of what we are doing today. I 
agree and I challenge them by asking: Why not begin to 
co-operate in an attempt to settle this situation? Let us put 
Canadians back to work and let us co-operate in looking for 
solutions that will ensure that the situation never occurs again, 
either in the railway industry or elsewhere. How can we 
simultaneously protect our workers and our people? That is the 
challenge.
<P>
	I conclude my speech by commending the Minister of Labour 
for her excellent work. Well done, Madam Minister! The job has 
not been easy. We are not enjoying this. We believe that 
agreements and labour disputes should be negotiated. But the 
time has come to give priority to the country and its people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we had no choice but to agree immediately to 
the request courteously expressed a few minutes ago by our 
colleague from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who said that we 
could verify what he said by calling the co-op he referred to. We 
hastened to do so and I can now reassure this House, which was 
needlessly alarmed by my esteemed colleague's remarks. First 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11004"> 11004 </A></B>
<P>
of all, this co-op is not out of stock. Second, soy prices did not 
rise this week but dropped by 10 cents a bushel as of last night.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> There are reassuring news which completely 
contradict the comments made by the hon. member across the 
way, which suggest he was badly misinformed, if I may use this 
euphemism. I have every reason to believe that other alarmist 
information we have been given on the consequences of the 
strike is in the same category.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> The current rail crisis would never have hurt 
the country's economy and poisoned, as it is doing, labour 
relations in the railway sector for long, if the Canada Labour 
Code had contained some of the provisions in Quebec's Labour 
Code, which are aimed at settling this type of dispute while 
keeping damage to a minimum. It is easy to imagine what would 
have happened, at least in Quebec, if our province had 
jurisdiction over the railways, or better yet, if Quebec was 
sovereign. Let us imagine, for the sake of comparison, how the 
current rail crisis would have been handled in a sovereign 
Quebec if the current provincial legislation had still been in 
effect.
<P>
	Let us suppose, first of all, that, in both Canada and the State 
of Quebec, railway unions decide to go on strike after 
negotiations reach an impasse. In Canada, after giving notice, 
the unions go on strike, leading to immediate confrontation. 
Other unions are locked out. In the State of Quebec, however, 
things would not degenerate so quickly, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	In the State of Quebec, after assessing a strike's potential 
risks to the public, the government issues an order-in-council.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	With this order, the onus is on both parties to negociate, 
before going on strike, what we call essential services, that is the 
basic services to be provided during the strike in order for the 
users to be somewhat disturbed by the dispute. After all, it is a 
matter of a balance of power and not a complete stalemate.
<P>
	Then you have different possible scenarios and various steps, 
and I will not go into the details, but at the end of the day, the 
government has the final word. In light of a report prepared by 
the board of essential services which was established to that 
effect, if the government considers the agreed services are not 
sufficient, it can suspend the right to strike until both parties 
agree to their satisfaction or the unions submit unilaterally a list 
of services that the government finds satisfactory. Then the 
strike is authorized and may start. That is the end of the first step 
which is aimed at humanizing the strike to come, a step that does 
not exist in Canada.
<P>
	So, now there is a strike in the State of Quebec. But it is a 
civilized strike, if I may say so, within a well defined 
framework. Of course users are not pleased but their activities 
are not totally disrupted. What if the unions do not respect their 
commitments? What if the agreed services are not provided? 
The government will then suspend the right to strike and, in case 
of violation, submit the matter to the Attorney General to obtain 
an injunction, possibly.
<P>
	The use of civilized dispute settlement mechanisms 
prescribed by the Quebec law does not exclude firmness, if 
required. Negotiations would continue throughout this civilized 
strike. The government might be forced to legislate in the end, 
but the right to strike would not be undermined and the economy 
would not suffer as much.
<P>
	This is how things would be done in a sovereign Quebec or, if 
you prefer, not to prejudge the matter, if the Canada Labour 
Code contained some of the clauses in the Quebec Code. The 
outcome would be different if, instead of the confrontation made 
inevitable by the Canada Labour Code which is brutal and basic, 
we had more civilized exchanges which would allow for the 
inclusion of some of our own legal clauses, which are based on 
the need in a real democracy to reconcile the citizens' right to 
strike and the employers' and users' right to essential services.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian law practically led inevitably to the 
current confrontation and only by agreeing to the principle of 
mediation, which was proposed Monday by our party, could this 
House end the conflict without hitting very hard the workers 
who will not forget. How can we avoid a tragic situation in a 
country where, in case of a labour dispute within a public utility, 
the government-after 24 hours of strike by workers-has, 
under the terms of its legislation, no choice but to allow the 
strike to go on and nearly bring to a standstill the economy and 
operations in some sectors or deny the workers' right to strike by 
unilaterally putting an end to the strike after 24 hours?
<P>
	The die is cast, as far as the current dispute is concerned. If 
this can be of any consolation to you, this assembly will soon 
have the opportunity to avoid similar disputes in future by 
amending the Canadian Labour Code in such a way that labour 
disputes could from now on be settled in the same civilized and 
efficient way as is done in Quebec.
<P>
	Indeed, my colleague from Manicouagan just presented a 
bill-Bill C-317-to introduce in the Canada Labour Code 
provisions similar to those we have in ours. This bill provides 
for the maintenance of all essential services in case of a strike 
and for the creation of a board to this end. In turn, it prohibits as 
in Quebec an employer from using the services of a person not 
usually in his employ during a strike or a lockout.
<P>
	The current crisis in this country will not have hurt workers, 
employers and users in vain, if it makes us aware of a terrible 
deficiency of the Canadian Labour  Code and if it leads us, in 
order to remedy it, to enact Bill C-317, introduced by my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11005"> 11005 </A></B>
<P>
colleague for Manicouagan. If we indeed enact that bill, 
Canada-when Quebec has become a sovereign country-will 
have nothing to envy it as far as labour legislation is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I feel I must contribute to the very important debate 
taking place here in the House today, because the official 
opposition has shown that it is unable to take a just and fair 
decision on issues of importance to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have faced a serious strike situation for over a week now, a 
strike that is costing Canadians millions of dollars and causing 
thousands of Canadians to lose work, time and money. The only 
reason this loss is continuing is the obstruction of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	I want to make it perfectly clear in all my remarks that the 
blame for the obstruction rests squarely with the official 
opposition. It has prevented the House from dealing with this 
bill in a manner that is normal in situations of this kind; that is, 
in an expeditious and fair way.
<P>
	I know the Reform Party has assisted the government to the 
extent that it has supported the legislation and has agreed to time 
allocation in respect of various stages of the bill in order to 
expedite passage. I appreciate that support very much and 
acknowledge it.
<P>
	On the other hand, the hon. member for Lethbridge in his 
speech this morning sought to criticize the government. When 
the government has acted so well it is difficult to find a way to 
criticize. He was really stretching things by arguing that 
somehow the government should have acted last week.
<P>
	Let us go back to the situation of last week. I remind the hon. 
member that while there was a strike by a few workers with CP, 
CP service was virtually continuous. It was working. Deliveries 
were still be made. CP was still running.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that. Surely he is not expecting the 
government to step in and legislate an end to a modest strike of 
that kind. The hon. member in his speech this morning was 
doing his best to make it appear that somehow the government 
was at fault for this strike when he knows that is not the case.
<P>
	The government has acted extremely well. It has done exactly 
what it should have done. When it became apparent that there 
was a national strike the first thing it did was give notice of 
intention to introduce this bill by issuing a special notice paper 
last week, or asking that one be issued. He knows that one was 
issued on Sunday morning. If it were not for that we would not 
be able to complete the bill as quickly as we are moving. I regret 
it is as slow as it is.
<P>
	The hon. member knows that I on behalf of the government 
and the ministers of the crown who have been in the House have 
tried all week to get the official opposition to abandon its rather 
ridiculous policy of obstructing this legislation and allowing the 
bill to proceed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last Monday, the members of the Bloc Quebecois decided to 
obstruct this bill and they have continued to obstruct it all week. 
If they had had more than thirteen members in the House 
Thursday morning, we would not have had this debate today or 
Sunday. This bill will perhaps be passed Tuesday or Wednesday 
of next week. Another three terrible days for Canada. What is 
the point of all this?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. members opposite should really be ashamed of the 
position they have taken in obstructing this. I recognize their 
right to oppose this legislation and speak against it and vote 
against it if they want to do so, but instead they have used the 
rules of procedure in the House to full advantage to obstruct the 
passage of this bill and put Canadians out of work. That is a 
disgrace.
<P>
	Always in the past when this kind of legislation has been 
introduced in the House-I remember we had some when we 
were in opposition and I have sat where the hon. members 
opposite are sitting today-we would make our objections very 
clear and very plain, and so did the NDP. In the end we allowed 
the legislation to go through in an expeditious manner because 
we recognized the public interest demands that when there is a 
national strike of this kind paralysing industries across Canada 
Parliament must act to bring the strike to an end. We allowed 
Parliament to act and make its decision in a rapid, responsible 
way.
<P>
	Hon. members from the New Democratic Party obstructed the 
bill on Monday with some glee, as one would expect from that 
group. As one of the editorials I was reading this morning said, 
they are bought and paid for by the labour movement so we 
would expect they might object to this. We support labour as 
well. Many people who are members of unions work and support 
the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois say that they have a 
monopoly on this sort of support, but that is not the case. Many 
workers belonging to unions in Quebec vote for the Liberal 
Party and the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who 
finds this so amusing, knows very well that it is the truth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11006"> 11006 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not like to cross the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot at all times. He tries his best. He 
knows these people are voting Liberal for a very good reason. 
We are providing good leadership and good government.
<P>
	Most of these people want to work. Most of the people who 
are out on strike do not want to be earning $3 a day in strike pay. 
They want to be working and making money. Before the strike I 
had occasion to speak with various employees of VIA Rail in my 
travels.
<P>
	They said if there is a strike, for heaven's sake legislate them 
back quickly, they do not want to be out for long. The Bloc 
Quebecois is obstructing and holding these people from their 
work and their jobs.
<P>
	What does that do for those Canadians? What does it do for 
their annual salary? It reduces what they can make in a year. The 
members of the Bloc Quebecois should be ashamed of 
themselves for this obstruction.
<P>
	I want to deal with the New Democratic Party briefly. The 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and the 
Minister for International Trade want to hear about the New 
Democratic Party.
<P>
	I do not see the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona but I 
know he is here in spirit. He was quite concerned on Monday 
that we not proceed with the bill. He refused consent. By 
Tuesday those members were silent. By Wednesday they were 
saying get it done. They have been saying it ever since. They at 
least saw the light.
<P>
	I invite hon. members of the Bloc Quebecois to have a little 
look around them. Look for the light. Then the members will say 
yes to this bill right away. There is no point in holding this up 
any further. They have obstructed the bill all week. We tried on 
Monday to introduce the bill and get it passed. We tried on 
Tuesday. We had the bill introduced and asked for unanimous 
consent to deal with it in all stages. That was refused at least 
twice during the day.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They do not care about Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Or the workers. On Wednesday we had the bill 
for second reading. We asked for consent to put it through all 
stages. That was refused. Therefore we used time allocation and 
got the bill through second reading. We used time allocation 
again to get it through the committee. It was not obstructed 
Wednesday night in committee.
<P>
	We had it reported on Thursday and what did we do on 
Thursday? We asked for unanimous consent to pass the bill on 
Thursday. It was refused. We asked for consent to pass it on 
Friday. It was refused. We asked again on Friday.
<P>
	Fortunately because the members of the Bloc were not here in 
sufficient numbers we fortunately got the right to sit on Saturday 
and Sunday to deal with it more quickly than we otherwise 
would but that was a stroke of luck on our part.
<P>
	I am sure it was not deliberate on their part that there were 
only 13 here when there should have been 25. I am glad that 
there were not 25 here.
<P>
	Here we are on Saturday debating report stage. When we have 
completed the votes on report stage and dealt with all the 
amendments, the 42 amendments the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois have moved, we will have the opportunity to proceed 
with third reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I urge members opposite to consider the situation of all those 
who would rather be working today. It is important for them that 
we vote at third reading as soon as possible and I hope that 
members opposite will give their consent today, so that we can 
vote at third reading this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has the best 
interests of the workers of Quebec and Canada at heart. If he 
does and if he considers their plight, he knows in his heart of 
hearts the best thing he could do today is vote to put them back to 
work; not just the people who are on strike but those who have 
been laid off as a result of the strike because that is the most 
unfair part of all.
<P>
	Through no fault of their own other Canadians, thousands of 
them, are losing money because of the rail strike. It should be 
ended. It should have been ended several days ago.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois through its obstruction and delay has 
denied these Canadians the right to earn a living. It is unfair. I 
invite it to join us today to end this strike.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
giving the speech I had prepared, I would like to comment on 
some of the allegations made by the hon. members opposite.
<P>
	Someone said a moment ago that the new Minister of Labour 
is to be commended for taking dynamic and aggressive action 
immediately upon assuming her duties. Indeed, we could not 
help but notice ourselves that the big companies and the rich and 
the powerful did not take long to recognize that she was on their 
side. In no time they were putting in their order: ``Please, 
Madam Minister, bring in special legislation because we are 
unable to reach a compromise through the civilized and 
democratic negotiation process that normally characterizes 
labour relation''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11007"> 11007 </A></B>
<P>
	So, the new Minister of Labour is perfectly comfortable with 
her new Liberal persona. She has adopted the Liberal philosophy 
that says that when one cannot get something according to 
democratic means, one imposes it. That is exactly what the 
Liberals did with the patriation of the constitution. It is nothing 
new.
<P>
	Hence the comment by a member opposite that the support the 
Bloc gives workers proves that a sovereign Quebec would be 
governed by unions. A sovereign Quebec would be governed by 
ordinary citizens. And if there are only ordinary people in the 
unions, well it is just too bad for the opposition because it is 
ordinary people who, democratically, will govern Quebec.
<P>
	We are being accused of defending unions because, they say, 
unions are separatist. But who are the Liberals defending? Why 
do they support so many large companies in this dispute? Why 
have they asked these companies not to go too far in the 
negotiations? They told them not to worry, that if they did not 
succeed, the government would pass a bill.
<P>
	That is what you get from being a friend of the Liberals. 
Maybe some of these large companies make hefty contributions 
to the Liberal Party election fund.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour has named many companies. She gave 
a list of companies that are threatening to close down because of 
this labour dispute. But did we hear her mention one worker, any 
one of the 30,000 workers who are affected too by this strike?
<P>
	Mr. Boudria said earlier-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I must remind the hon. 
member that he should refer to a member using the name of the 
constituency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> I am sorry, Madam Speaker. The hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said earlier that one of his 
constituents called him. It is another one, not the one mentioned 
earlier, he was not the right one. So, another of his constituents 
who is on strike complained that he could hardly live with a $3 a 
day strike pay. Let him find comfort in the fact that the 
legislation the government is trying to pass and that he will have 
to live with for at least two years is not worth a nickel.
<P>
	The government's contentions are hogwash. We have to put an 
end to that strike, they say. We are willing to put an end to the 
strike, and we agree that we could have done it before. But we 
feel that we should not do it at all costs.
<P>
	With its special legislation, the Liberal government wants to 
put the train back on the track as fast as possible, with no thought 
to the consequences. If the train, meanwhile, runs over the 
employees, that is too bad; so be it. The train must keep moving, 
no matter who suffers. In the long run, a return to work under 
such conditions will doom the railroad companies to several 
years of completely deteriorated labour relations.
<P>
	We keep saying to the government that it can still reach an 
amicable settlement and that if it wants to resolve this conflict 
this afternoon, we will not object, provided that it agrees with 
the very humane amendments which we have proposed to solve 
the issue.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 12:51 p.m.,
