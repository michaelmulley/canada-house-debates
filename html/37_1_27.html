<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK12">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the 
government establish a national sex offender registry by 
January 1, 2002. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I advise the Chair that we in the 
Canadian Alliance will be splitting our speaking times today. 
This could be a good day for the House of Commons or it could be 
a very sad day.  We will be voting tonight to determine whether 
members of parliament, not just the government, want to see a 
national sex offender registry installed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I think it is important that we on all sides do away with 
the partisan politics that exists so often in the House of 
Commons and think about what is best for the children and women 
in our country.  The motion today reflects the need for Canada, 
not the government nor the opposition, to have a national sex 
offender registry.  We are asking the majority government to 
implement it by January 2002.  That is a long time for the House 
of Commons to put in a bill that is absolutely necessary.  I have 
seen bills go through the House in a matter of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I in the Canadian Alliance have pro forma 
legislation already developed and ready to go should the 
government need it and want to work with it.  We are prepared to 
go right through committee with this to start it moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to first talk about what is a sex offender registry.  I 
will give some of the common criteria used in the United Kingdom, 
the United States and Ontario.  We would expect to see a national 
sex offender registry established and maintained by the 
Department of the Solicitor General, which basically means that 
it would be the solicitor general's responsibility, and the 
involvement of the parole and prison system, as well as the RCMP. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would contain the names, addresses, dates of birth, list of 
sex offences and any other prescribed information about a person 
convicted of a sex offence anywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for a national sex offender registry is important.  We 
have heard from many victims.  One in particular, who we heard 
from this morning, is Jim Stephenson, the father of a child who 
was murdered by a sex offender.  Victims are saying that it is no 
good just to have a sex offender registry in just one province 
because people move from that province to another province where 
there is no criteria at all, no registry in existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information that would be included in a registry would be 
collected from the offenders themselves and from any other source 
available to the minister, that is, their CPIC system, 
correctional services, parole board, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to have offenders themselves report is important 
because it then puts the onus on the individual to show up and 
admit the sex offence and to produce the criteria.  Once the 
offender has registered there is then a hesitancy inborn that the 
offender had better not reoffend.  If an offender does register, 
then police have good reason to worry about it and then make a 
check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry would be available only to the minister and police 
forces for the purposes of crime prevention and law enforcement. 
This takes away any argument that it would be public information 
and that the privacy act would be offended, and so on and so 
forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry could apply to every person convicted of or found 
not criminally responsible for a sex offence due to a mental 
disorder or who is serving a sentence for a sex offence on the 
day the act comes into force.  That is important.  After the bill 
receives royal assent everybody convicted goes on the registry 
and all those currently in prison go on the registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are about 6,000 inmates and people on parole in the 
country who have been convicted of sex offences. That is a lot of 
people considering that there are 15,000 people who are 
incarcerated.  There is over a 30% recidivism rate for sex 
offenders.  A registry would help police curtail that recidivism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another criteria could be that every offender who resides in 
Canada is required to register in person at his or her local 
police station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another criteria could be that persons convicted of a sex 
offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years or less would 
have to report to police for 10 years.  Persons convicted of a 
sex offence that a carries longer sentence would have to report 
for the rest of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A police officer may obtain a warrant to arrest a person who 
fails to register and report as required.  A person convicted of 
a first time offence could face a fine of up to $25,000 or up to 
a year in prison.  A person convicted for a second offence could 
face a fine of up to 25,000 and up to two years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do I get these criteria from?  That is pretty well the 
criteria that Ontario uses for its sex offender registry.  David 
Tsubouchi, the Ontario solicitor general, has basically said this 
about Ontario's sex offender registry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it is now clear that the federal government will not accept 
its responsibility in this matter, Ontario will do what is right 
and act to protect its citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not stand here today, and I hope none of us do, and 
slight the government for not implementing a sex offender 
registry.  That is not what this is about today.  This is about 
talking to our colleagues on the other side who have a majority 
in the House and who will determine tonight whether or not this 
bill comes into effect and the work begins on it.  This is about 
us trying to convince all colleagues from all parties that a 
national sex offender registry is necessary for the protection of 
women and children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we do not get into fault finding or rhetorical statements 
from the other side. or from any side.  Many people are watching 
the debate today and I think they will judge us on our decorum on 
the issue and the logic that we use for putting such a system in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some members of the British Columbia legislature 
and the current premier of B.C., Ujjal Dosanjh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one quote by B.C. Attorney General Graeme Bowbrick: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national registry would help ensure consistency across 
provinces and give police a co-ordinated enforcement tool. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. Premier Ujjal Dosanjh states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm calling on the federal government to open their eyes and ears 
and hearts to the concerns of Canadians across the country and 
set up a national sex and violent offender registry right across 
the country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is calling for the same thing.  There has to be a 
co-ordinated effort across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, the Ontario 
Provincial Police, the Saskatchewan Association of Chiefs of 
Police, and on it goes, all support an integrated police 
information system, a sex offender registry.  Virtually every law 
enforcement agency in the country wants this registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we received a letter from the Canadian Police 
Association which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the 30,000 front-line members of the Canadian Police 
Association, we are pleased to convey our support for the 
creation of a National Sex Offender Registry.  The Canadian 
Police Association is firmly on record in seeking a registry to 
assist in the investigation and apprehension of repeat sexual 
offenders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a call from Kevin Nierenhausen of the Sexual Abuse 
Victims of Canada.  He was asking for the same thing, the 
implementation of a national sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one minute left in this opening speech to appeal to all 
my colleagues in the House, and to all those watching to 
encourage all members of parliament, all the Liberals on the 
other side and all opposition members of parliament, to please do 
away with partisan politics in the House of Commons and implement 
a national sex offender registry.  It is so vital and important 
for law enforcement and critical to the protection of our women 
and children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member for Langley—Abbotsford for this 
initiative today.  As he has already mentioned, hopefully we can 
have a good debate today without any of the flights of rhetorical 
work for which the House is famous.  This is a bi-partisan issue 
and an issue that concerns everyone in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think there would be enough time to actually 
draft the necessary legislation and get the co-operation of the 
provinces on an issue like this?  It would give us a year but 
there is a lot of detailed work to be done.  Would that be enough 
time?   Would we be able to pull it together in such a way that 
the provinces, the victims groups and the federal departments 
could get all the <I>i</I>'s dotted and the <I>t</I>'s crossed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the date of 2002 is ample 
time.  The government and ourselves in opposition would have many 
areas upon which to draw.  The United Kingdom has a sex offender 
registry.  Every state in the United States has a national or a 
state sex offender registry.  Ontario has an outstanding example 
of it.  Other provinces already have drafts available.  This is 
not something that we have to reinvent.  In fact, the Canadian 
Alliance has been working on draft legislation for a year and it 
is ready to go. 
It is not meant to embarrass anybody.  It is meant to help.  We 
are prepared to give this document to the government and to work 
with it.  It can use the document if it wishes or it can draw on 
Ontario, as we have, or on any other organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I remind members of a letter that I received from 
Jim and Anna Stephenson, whose child was murdered by a sex 
offender.  They wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 our eleven-year old son Christopher was abducted, raped 
repeatedly and murdered by a known pedophile.  Among many 
recommendations contained in the verdict in the 1992 Inquest into 
his death was a proposal for a national sex offender registry. 
Since then, my wife and I have been advocates for various changes 
in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claiming there are programs and legislation currently in place 
and that a National Registry would only duplicate what currently 
exists, the Federal Government has yet to move in this direction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not meant as fault finding.  It is meant to say where we 
have to go.  The letter continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the continued absence of any Federal initiative, Ontario 
recently announced that it would introduce its own Sex Offender 
Registry.  The legislation is named “Christopher's Law” in the 
memory of our son.  While the other provinces have not announced 
plans to introduce legislation of their own at this time, each 
has indicated that Ontario's initiative is being followed 
closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the Ontario Government for the leadership it has 
shown with the introduction of the Sexual Registry.  At the same 
time, however, Canadians everywhere, and not only those who are 
citizens of Ontario, also deserve protection from those who 
present danger to repeat a sexual assault.  Clearly such 
protection is only possible under a National Registry. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for bringing the motion 
forward.  It is crucial in its timing and its content.  It is one 
that we in the Progressive Conservative Party will certainly be 
supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is quite simple.  The registry 
that he speaks of has terrific preventive aspects to it.  We know 
there is an existing firearms registry that was ill-conceived and 
has been entirely expensive.  It is not based on safety and is 
probably doomed to failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The computers currently in place to register guns have no effect 
on safety.  Does the hon. member feel that there could be any 
application of the firearms infrastructure that is in place? Is 
there any way that some of that infrastructure may be applied to 
a sex offender registry, which would have a much greater effect 
in terms of safety? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague 
on his work in terms of promoting a national sex offender 
registry.  It is well acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources that are tied up in the gun registry may well be 
used.  I know an upgrade to the CPIC system is coming which may 
well be used.  When we hear from the solicitor general on the 
issue hopefully he can shed some light on it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I begin by congratulating and 
thanking the member for Langley—Abbotsford for the excellent 
motion.  I commend him for all the work he does on important 
areas like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most parents keep a close eye on their children, but we as 
parents have all experienced those moments of terror when a child 
slips out of sight at a shopping centre, a playground or an 
amusement park.  It can take a few seconds for a child to go 
missing and it is easy to fear the worst.  One of the worst fears 
is that a sexual predator has taken the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some, like the parents of Christopher Stephenson, the 
moments of terror can actually last a lifetime.  When 11 year old 
Christopher disappeared in 1988, there was no reprieve.  There 
was no happy reunion.  A repeat sex offender, Joseph Fredericks, 
abducted Christopher from the mall where he was shopping with his 
mother. Fredericks took Christopher to a field where he 
repeatedly raped him.  At some point he took him back to his 
apartment.  At some point he murdered him.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An inquest into Christopher's murder led to recommendations that 
the government should create the national sex offender registry 
which the member for Langley—Abbotsford is proposing. Had such a 
registry existed and police officers were able to go right away 
to check the residences of all known offenders in the vicinity of 
Christopher's disappearance, they may have been able to save his 
life.  The recommendations were made back in 1992 and the federal 
government has not acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we urge all parties to vote in favour of our motion that 
the government create a national sex offender registry.  Such a 
registry would not only help to allay the fears of every Canadian 
parent, but it could save the lives of children like Christopher 
and help protect children from sexual predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario government has not waited for the federal 
government.  As already mentioned by the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford, the former solicitor general of Ontario, 
David Tsubouchi, went ahead with legislation that became known as 
Christopher's Law in honour of Christopher.  Around the time Mr. 
Tsubouchi introduced the bill he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it is now clear that the federal government will not do 
what is right and will not accept its responsibility in this 
matter, Ontario will do what is right and act to protect its 
citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario legislature unanimously passed Christopher's Law 
last April.  We are calling for the same all party support today 
for the creation of a national sex offender registry modelled 
after Christopher's Law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is not the only province calling for the creation of 
such a registry.  British Columbia plans to create its own 
registry.  Its premier, as we have heard today, has called on the 
federal government “to open their eyes and ears and hearts to 
the concerns of Canadians across the country and set up a 
national sex and violent offender registry right across the 
country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many Liberal members of parliament also support the 
creation of such a registry.  Peter Warkentin, the Liberal 
candidate in Surrey Central, advocated for a registry during the 
last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To day we are asking the Prime Minister and his Liberal caucus 
to give more than a blessing to an idea, to put partisan concerns 
aside and to vote in favour of creating a national sex offender 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a new idea on the other side of the House.  When 
federal and provincial justice ministers met in Regina in October 
1998, we understand the Minister of Justice told Alberta justice 
minister Jon Havelock that the federal government promised to 
amend the present system to allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard some of the arguments some Liberals have 
raised against creating such a registry, arguments like the 
Canadian Police Information Centre already does the job and that 
the registry would duplicate what CPIC already does.  We can ask 
any police officer who uses CPIC if the system does what a 
national sexual offender registry would do. CPIC does not tell 
police where all sex offenders in any given area are living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have legislation to mandate the collection of data 
necessary for police officers to do their job in this special 
area of crime prevention.  We need to have legal requirements for 
sex offenders to provide that information and sanctions when they 
fail to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are an estimated 4,500 sex offenders either in prison or 
under some form of community supervision.  Most researchers say 
that pedophilia is incurable and the risk of reoffending can 
remain for the rest of that person's life.  Rapists also show a 
high degree of recidivism for violent crime.  It is time for the 
Canadian government to show its concern for the victims of sexual 
predators.  It is time for the House to do something concrete to 
prevent sexual offenders from drifting from place to place under 
a cloak of anonymity, putting vulnerable children and citizens at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Christopher Stephenson's father, Jim Stephenson, wrote to the 
member for Langley—Abbotsford last Friday in support of the 
motion before the House today.  He said he was encouraged that 
the Canadian Alliance was raising the need for a national sex 
offender registry for debate and a vote.  He wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians everywhere, and not only those who are citizens of 
Ontario, also deserve protection from those who present danger to 
repeat a sexual assault.  Clearly such protection is only 
possible under a national registry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that members of all parties will remember Christopher 
Stephenson today.  We hope they will consider the lives of other 
children that may have been saved as Christopher's might have 
been.  We hope they will consider the abuse and violation of 
innocent victims that may be prevented by the creation of a 
national registry.  It is time that we set aside partisan 
politics and work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day we sit in the House as elected people and look across 
the aisles into the eyes of one another.  We plot, plan and 
strategize, which is something politics and parliamentary 
behaviour is all about. 
Tonight when we vote, and as we look across the aisles, can we 
picture the eyes of Christopher or the eyes of our own children? 
I will be picturing the eyes of my grandchildren.

think of their literal future.  It should absolutely be the 
utmost and foremost in the minds of not only of opposition party 
members but also of government members.  I want to presume that 
will be the case.  I do not want to make a political statement to 
the contrary but we will see tonight.  I presume that the 
children of this country are in their hearts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was in the RCMP for 30 years.  What 
the hon. member said about the Canadian Police Information Centre 
is accurate.  It does not provide the full scope necessary for a 
police officer to keep track of the sexual predators who are 
loose in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to indicate that at the present time police 
forces are releasing information into the community about the 
whereabouts of an individual sex offender.  However they are 
sometimes under civil threat of a lawsuit when they do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this registry help in the area of protecting our police 
forces when they do take action to monitor and follow these 
predators to make sure their whereabouts are known? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake raises a valid point.  I appreciate his 
experience in terms of policing as a good portion of his life was 
given to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this would be set up in a way that has been looked at by 
the legal experts to make sure that police officers have the 
guidelines to follow so that they do not run afoul of any 
possible rights or charter issues.  That would be carefully done 
and implicated in this particular motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the Leader of the Official Opposition for 
his remarks and his participation in this debate.  My question is 
along the same lines as the comments with respect to CPIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system there is a process for red flagging 
individuals who have received pardons.  There is obviously a 
system in place to try to ensure the accuracy of the information. 
I know the hon. member would agree that the accuracy of that 
information is crucial to this preventative nature that is behind 
a system such as this, an early warning system for police and for 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is twofold.  With respect to the cost, and this is 
not to suggest that no cost is too great when it comes to 
protecting our children, I wonder if the member has any figures 
on the cost of this system.  Second, with respect to the ability 
of the provinces to participate in this, does he have any 
thoughts along those lines? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the concern 
raised.  Relating to the CPIC, and I am not saying this in a 
pejorative way, it is important to look at some of the 
deficiencies.  We know that CPIC does not tell police where all 
sex offenders live.  We need to have legislation to mandate the 
collection of the data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the cost itself, it would not be prohibitive.  I 
appreciate the fact that the member acknowledged that there 
really is no cost too great in terms of protecting our children. 
These costs would not be prohibitive and could be handled within 
the fiscal capacity of the department.  I am sure the minister 
himself could illuminate us on that even further. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. 
member from Waterloo—Wellington.  I am pleased to rise today to 
speak on the opposition motion in favour of a national sex 
offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this proposal is motivated by a sincere concern for 
the safety of our children and for all Canadians.  This is a 
concern shared by all of us and certainly by this government. 
Since forming government we have taken a series of actions to 
better protect Canadians from sexual abusers and will continue to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as 1994 we conducted extensive consultations with 
individuals and organizations with special responsibility for the 
care and protection of children.  These included children's aid 
societies, school boards, big brothers and big sisters 
organizations, Volunteer Canada, police, victims and many other 
groups across the country.  What they told us was that sex 
offender registries, like those in the United States, would 
contribute little to the safety of children.  What they asked 
for, and what we delivered, was a made in Canada solution that 
targets abusers who seek positions of trust with children and 
other vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national screening system was launched in the summer of 1994 
by the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Health and the 
Solicitor General of Canada.  It is the result of effective 
collaboration between police, child care agencies and the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Information Centre, or CPIC, provides 
criminal records to local police forces who have helped these 
agencies conduct criminal record checks.  At last count, more 
than 700,000 searches had been done on behalf of volunteer 
organizations across the country.  This is an important tool that 
protects the most vulnerable from the most dangerous and is only 
one example of the measures that we have taken for the safety of 
Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created a new form of long term supervision for sex 
offenders after they complete their normal sentence.  A national 
flagging system has been developed with our provincial partners 
so that prosecutors can identify offenders who should be 
considered for dangerous offender status.  Peace bonds allow us 
to put special conditions on high risk offenders even when they 
are not under sentence.  With these measures we have imposed 
tougher controls on sex offenders and we have made Canadians 
safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex offender registries as they exist in other countries have 
not prevented crime.  Despite their heavy cost, they are easily 
defeated when offenders simply fail to register or provide false 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the American system only about 50% of those required actually 
register.  In a lot of states it is less than that.  In Canada we 
have chosen a different path.  We already have a credible and 
comprehensive national registry.  It is called CPIC.  It is a 
national registry of all convicted offenders, including sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPIC is already the basis for the national screening system.  It 
is a solid database of police information that can be accessed by 
all police agencies across the country.  CPIC is already in place 
and does not have to be duplicated by another agency.  It is 
highly reliable because it is based on fingerprints, not on 
whether or not an offender chooses to comply or not.  In other 
words, CPIC is Canada's national sex offender registry.  It does 
not need to be created because it already exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government is open to improvements.  We have 
already engaged in discussions with our partners across the 
country to enhance CPIC's role as Canada's sex offender registry. 
That collaboration is well under way and a truly national system 
can only exist if there is a national consensus.  That is why we 
are working closely with provincial and territorial ministers of 
justice and solicitors general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 ministers approved a report from senior officials who 
studied sex offender registries.  Ten very useful recommendations 
were made.  However, a new national sex offender registry was not 
one of them.  A few provinces have expressed interest in 
establishing their own registry but most have made no decision 
and some are clearly opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we all agreed to do, when we met in Iqaluit last September, 
was to work together to most effectively combine our efforts to 
protect children.  That is exactly what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those jurisdictions that are prepared to do so, we have 
offered to accept current addresses for known sex offenders to be 
placed on the CPIC database and to be updated as needed.  One 
province has expressed an interest in such an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We clearly already have a sex offender registry on a national 
scale.  It is an important public safety tool that will remain 
effective in the future.  I was also very pleased that the 
government saw fit to put $115 million into the CPIC system to 
make sure it was updated and one of the best systems available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always working to ensure we have the best possible tools 
to protect Canadians in their communities.  We will continue to 
review our progress on a regular basis to make sure that we are 
moving forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a proven and reliable sex offender registry.  We have 
already complied with the opposition's motion.  We are committed 
to going even further.  For that reason, I have absolutely no 
problem in supporting the opposition motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if that don't beat all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the government for, I think, listening. 
However I do want to correct a couple of statements the solicitor 
general made.  I want to give some quotes that are very important 
to listen to from the solicitor general's point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Police Association, the government has 
established CPIC but “it does not provide police agencies with 
adequate information and notification concerning the release or 
arrival of sex offenders into their community”.  The Canadian 
Police Association, which has 30,000 members, has told everyone 
in the House that CPIC does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Ontario officials were developing the Ontario sex 
offender registry they said “CPIC neither focuses solely on 
sex offenders nor has the updated address information needed to 
track them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to correct the solicitor general's comments.  I want to 
thank the government for supporting this motion.  I hope we are 
now moving forward on a non-partisan basis to develop the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sex offender registry, which is in every state in the United 
States and in every location in the United Kingdom, is, contrary 
to what the solicitor general said, supported by millions of 
people.  Even though bureaucrats from Canada go there and say it 
is not working, it actually is working.  I have a lot of 
information here that I would like to give the solicitor general 
to show that it is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know why and how he gets the information to say 
that these things are not working.  Furthermore, why is it that 
Ontario has implemented a sex offender registry?  It was sick of 
waiting for us in the House of Commons to do it.  There must be 
something to it.  In addition to that, B.C., Saskatchewan and 
Alberta are now moving toward one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, on his 
correction move, I do not understand what correction he is trying 
to put forward.  In fact, CPIC is not specifically a sex offender 
registry.  It is a registry of all people who commit criminal 
offences.  What is important to know is that everybody who 
commits a criminal offence is on CPIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an organization goes to the police and wishes to have a 
person evaluated as to whether the person has committed a sex 
offence, it can do that with CPIC.  The system is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the American system, as I said to my hon. colleague, in a 
number of states 50% or less of the people who should be on the 
system are on it.  What is the good of that?  What we have in 
Canada is a national system updated to be one of the most 
effective systems in the world, the envy of most police forces 
around the world.  To the criminal justice system it is a very 
important arm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we must have is a national system with everybody involved. 
CPIC is exactly that.  It is a national system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian

made reference to the dangerous offender status.  I would like to 
draw his attention to an instance in my own constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A teacher by the name of Robert Noyes in the community of 
Ashcroft offended and damaged many young students in his school 
for whom he was responsible.  In the course of his conviction and 
sentencing, he was designated a dangerous offender.  He has been 
in prison for a long time now.  More and more he has been moved 
out of prison and into the community. 
I have resisted that subject since being elected.  I have talked 
to the people responsible for him and they have said that he has 
had all the treatment and education they could give him and that 
he has done everything satisfactorily so they had to let him go. 
I asked if he would be offending again and the response was, 
probably.

reoffend, and yet even though he is a dangerous offender— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member but his time has expired.  With the indulgence of 
the House, I will give a minute to the Solicitor General of 
Canada to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
colleague's comments.  In fact, dangerous offender status is very 
important.  Those convicted as dangerous offenders could be under 
supervision for the rest of their lives.  That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to talk about individual cases, but we must have 
and do have a proper system in place to make sure nobody gets 
away.  What my hon. colleague referred to as dangerous offender 
status was put in place by this government.  It is more 
protection for the public in general. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great honour to stand in the House to discuss the 
national registry for convicted sex offenders.  It makes a 
valuable contribution to protecting the most vulnerable members 
of our society from the most dangerous offenders who would 
sexually abuse and exploit them.  No one in the House or 
Canadians across our great country condone that kind of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members of the House would agree that we want the 
best system possible to protect our communities from high risk 
offenders and to enhance public protection, especially for our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary goal of our national registry of convicted sex 
offenders is to prevent individuals from having the opportunity 
to perpetrate these horrendous crimes while remaining 
unidentified and undetected.  To contribute to this most vital 
effort of prevention and protection, the government is committed 
to giving police better tools to help fight crime.  We are 
fulfilling our commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, the federal government can assure all Canadians 
that the Canadian Police Information Centre, or CPIC as the 
national registry for all convicted sex offenders, is the 
appropriate tool to achieve the goal of enhancing public safety 
through the timely and well directed sharing of relevant 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all hon. members in the House are aware, we in Canada are 
currently protected by a criminal justice system that actively 
encourages and participates in extensive information sharing. 
Furthermore, through co-operation and consultation with all 
partners and stakeholders, we are looking at ways to build on the 
framework now in place.  Our ultimate goal is to find ways to 
maximize the contribution that our criminal justice system makes 
to public safety and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the primary goal of achieving excellence in protecting the 
Canadian public, the government has attempted to implement more 
effective practices and to correct any inadequacies.  This means 
the focus now is on maintaining and improving the lines of 
communication between and among the police, the courts and the 
correctional and conditional release authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members are aware, the Department of the Solicitor 
General has been leading a federally integrated justice 
information initiative.  The goal of that initiative is to create 
a trans-Canada highway of criminal justice information to improve 
the sharing of offender and crime related information among all 
partners in Canada's criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is called the Canadian public safety information 
network, and it is a top priority of the government.  A crucial 
improvement will be in the ability to share information more 
widely and in a more timely manner among police, prosecutors, 
courts, corrections and parole officials.  The backbone of the 
initiative is a funding contribution of $115 million to the RCMP 
to renew CPIC to which the solicitor general just referred.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because these tools are so critical for law enforcement 
agencies, it is necessary to embark upon important endeavours, 
such as the Canadian public safety information network, with 
foresight and planning.  That is something that we as a 
government are doing.  They need to be developed in close 
co-operation with partners in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the well-directed efforts and initiatives 
previously mentioned, the federal government, in consultation 
with the voluntary and child care sectors and with police and 
provincial representatives, has chosen a range of other effective 
measures targeted to protect children from sex abusers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have put in place a national screening system based on 
CPIC that allows child caring organizations and individuals to 
access the criminal records of persons assuming positions of 
trust with children and other vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have passed legislation to give police access to 
pardon records for screening purposes through Bill C-7, which was 
passed in the House last spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we continue to work in partnership with Volunteer Canada 
to conduct training and public education about screening 
practices and to promote screening with voluntary and public 
sector agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, we have adopted strict measures for the 
most serious offenders, such as the dangerous and long term 
offender designations.  In addition, we provide support for 
post-sentence programs, such as circles of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also work closely with local police to support public 
notification schemes about sex offenders.  We have put in place 
special protections to restrict the movement and conduct of sex 
offenders after their release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have created new offences to protect children and 
other vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this underscores the commitment of the solicitor general 
and the Government of Canada to ensuring the protection, safety 
and security of our children, especially as related to these 
horrific cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are tangible examples of how seriously the government 
takes public safety.  However, our work is not done.  We need to 
continue to make good on additional work.  We have made a good 
start with CPIC as a national registry of convicted sex 
offenders.  We have already complied with the hon. member's 
motion, which is why I, for example, have no hesitation in 
offering my support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, as the solicitor general outlined in his speech, 
we will continue to ensure we have the absolute best possible 
tools necessary and available to protect all Canadians, 
especially our young people.  The values of Canada and of the 
government are to ensure safety and security for our children and 
to ensure we have in place the kind of system necessary to ensure 
that ours is a good and decent society.  That is precisely what 
we on the government side want, that is what the solicitor 
general wants and, more to the point, that is what all Canadians 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that I have no hesitation in supporting this motion. It 
is something that we are already doing and will continue to do in 
the best interests of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many Canadians no doubt are watching 
today.  Many Canadians across the country have made it very clear 
that they believe we have given more protection to the criminals 
than we have to the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that an all party support of the 
motion now before the House would not only show confidence in the 
House but would also gain the support we really need on a 
national level for the justice system across Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess we will see tonight 
whether or not all party support is in place.  What I do know is 
that we on the government side continue to ensure that there are 
laws in place to ensure effective public policy in areas of the 
criminal justice system.  We also ensure that the values of 
Canada are taken into consideration when we provide public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do not like seeing, and what I believe Canadians do not 
like seeing, is the opposition, especially the reform alliance 
people, who seem to always want to fearmonger.  They always want 
to scratch the surface of the scab to try to get to the bleeding 
of society. 
I do not understand that kind of negativity.  I do not understand 
the politics of fear, the politics of blame, the politics of 
trying always to undermine the very values of this decent and 
just country.  Unfortunately, that is who they are.  That is the 
kind of people we have to put up with in the House.

the member was saying about fearmongering, picking scabs and 
taking certain issues out of context.  I take exception to that. 
What we are talking about here is the safety of our children, not 
partisan politics, and I wish the member would get that straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underneath the registry issue we are talking about, we all know 
that the average lifespan of a child who has been kidnapped for 
sexual purposes is seven hours.  After seven hours, the chances 
of that child coming back alive just about disintegrate.  My 
question to the member is, underneath this proposal, would that 
not speed up the process in helping to find the child? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with the CPIC system of 
course we continue to work very effectively and in the best 
interests of Canadians to ensure that timing is of the essence. 
This has to be something that is understood by everyone in 
Canada:  we, with the police information system, are putting in 
place the necessary tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need to do additional things?  Of course we do.  That is 
why, when the justice ministers and the solicitors general from 
across Canada met in Iqaluit, they put in place a kind of 
beginning process and mechanism, if you will, ensuring that what 
we will do as a country is ensure that in regard to those kinds 
of issues like the member's question in terms of timing, we find 
the perpetrators, the offenders, as soon as possible so that our 
children and all Canadians can feel safe and secure, not only in 
their homes and neighbourhoods but in their communities and in 
their provinces as well.

designated within the CPIC system and which is fully funded by

$115 million, knowing that the Canadian Police Association was 
asking for double that amount—would achieve the objective that—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would point out that the Canadian Alliance will 
not be able to accuse the Bloc Quebecois of being close-minded, 
after its most cavalier treatment of me yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will not be the case today because, at a first glance, the 
proposal being debated now is of considerable interest, since it 
is aimed at introducing a measure that will act as a safety net 
against a specific type of crime and criminal.   It is a sort of 
constructive control, but it is mainly a means of preventing sex 
offenders who have served their sentences from reoffending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea of creating a national sex offender registry has been 
in the air for some time.  It is, in fact, the outcome of a 
recommendation following on the investigative report on the 
murder of young Christopher Stephenson in 1988.  A consensus 
followed on the critical need for this project in order to 
preserve the safety of all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than a reflection of the public's will, the idea gathered 
the support of organizations such as the Canadian Police 
Association, the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime 
and political parties such as the Progressive Conservative Party 
of Canada, the Canadian Alliance and the Bloc Quebecois, under 
certain conditions, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all suggested the Government of Canada act without delay by 
putting an end to a situation that appeared increasingly 
symptomatic of a weakness in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has shown and research confirms a high risk of 
recidivism among sex offenders, in most cases.  This warning 
from the experts together with the reactions of a number of 
police forces in the country have bolstered the convictions of 
victims and, accordingly, of the people with respect to a 
problem we can no longer ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to take an enlightened and, if possible, a 
dispassionate look, let us examine just what the creation of a 
sex offender registry might mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping such a registry of sex offenders appears at first glance 
to be based on a legitimate principle, that of protecting the 
public from the potential recidivism of offenders sentenced for 
specific sexual offences and now at the end of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often left to themselves and facing serious problems arising 
from repressed sexual urges, this category of offender is more 
likely to be a repeat offender.  As we know, crimes of a sexual 
nature are especially heinous because they often involve our 
society's most vulnerable members.  Children are the preferred 
victims of this sort of predator, who are not always settled 
down by a period behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this potential risk, prevention remains the best remedy to 
a problem which unfortunately makes headlines all too often. We 
do not want our communities to become hostages because of the 
inadequacies of a system that is powerless to eliminate a type 
of crime that puts lives in danger. The proposed solution is a 
concrete measure to correct a situation that could deteriorate 
if nothing is done to reduce its sad consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of such a sex offender registry, which 
would include the offender's name, address and date of birth, 
and the list of sex crimes committed, would allow a much more 
thorough follow up on these people. Under such a procedure, 
offenders would have to inform local police forces of their 
whereabouts. This would allow society to keep an eye on these 
offenders who, in the absence of such a monitoring system, 
always remain a potential threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the registry 
must be established under very specific rules. The inclusion of 
all offences related to a sex crime must be included in the 
offender's record. The rules must be clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the registry must be maintained by responsible 
authorities and be consulted only by these same authorities. We 
are talking of course about police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we must ensure a long term follow up which, as suggested 
in some documents, would require offenders who have received a 
ten year sentence to report for a ten year period. Those who 
would have been handed down harsher sentences could be required 
to report to police forces for a longer period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, these sex offenders should be informed that their names 
will remain in the registry for a predetermined period. 
Thus, this close monitoring, which is not a guarantee against 
sex offences, will at least help lower the risk by reducing the 
chances of recidivism.  It will ensure that police forces have 
all the information they need to keep tabs on offenders and act 
quickly when the worst happens.  These few points form the basis 
for an approach that could be a practical way of easing the 
community's concern. 
Since every initiative rests on a solid foundation, those who 
favour such a registry have done their homework.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American model has produced interesting results, which have 
been a driving force in this project.  A number of states have 
introduced a sex offender registry, including California in 1947 
and, quite recently, Alaska in 1994.  Each state has its own 
registry, and the FBI is thinking of creating a national 
registry, which is a significant attempt to keep tabs on sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we feel that such registries do not prevent all crimes, 
they do help the police to identify suspects and eventually make 
arrests.  Such a program therefore meets a need and fulfils 
specific expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the European context, 88% of the 641 respondents 
in a survey in Great Britain said that they would like to be 
warned of the presence of pedophiles in their neighbourhood. 
Once again, this is a trend that reflects the concerns expressed 
by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our case is therefore not an isolated one and is part of an 
approach that is increasingly becoming the norm.  We cannot 
avoid it and we certainly cannot remain insensitive to the 
entirely legitimate demands of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite the enthusiasm of those in favour of creating 
such a registry, certain precautions must be taken in order to 
avoid abuses. 
To that end, the new powers assigned to the police forces must 
be given a framework, with the limits set right from the start 
in order to avoid problems later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it needs to be stipulated that the right of access 
to personal information on offenders must be given only to the 
solicitor general and the law enforcement agencies.  The general 
public must at no time have access to this bank of information. 
It must not be in general circulation and it must be intended, 
not as an alert to the population, but rather as a means to 
enable the police to monitor the offender, somewhat along the 
lines of what a parole officer would do.  The goal would be the 
same: rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to be kept in mind is that this registry must not 
become a means of allowing the public to conduct witch hunts. 
It must not be a means of stigmatizing all of these offenders, 
for some of them do manage to get over their obsessions.  It is 
a useful tool, but it must be used only for its intended 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people see the creation of an offender registry as a kind 
of attack on rights and freedoms.  Of course, the usual steps 
need to be taken in order to safeguard the basic principle of 
rights for all.  The interests of the community as a whole must 
also be considered, however.  The Alaska legislative assembly is 
one example of this.  It has adopted the creation of such a 
register, with the following statement: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—since there is a strong likelihood of repeat offences by sex 
offenders, and since it is ... vital to protect the public from 
sex offenders, protection of these offenders' privacy is not as 
important as the State's interest in protecting the public. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle also serves as the basis for an approach that 
places the community's interests above the individual interests 
of criminals who continue to present a risk to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, a ready link may be made with the other file 
being defended by the Bloc Quebecois, which, for the same 
reasons of protection, is fighting to have membership in a 
criminal group declared illegal.  Others are expressing certain 
fears about such an initiative, because of the precedent it may 
establish, for example.  People go so far as to think the 
establishment of this registry of personal information will open 
the door to other much more disquieting initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this spirit, the allusion to the centralized megafile that 
put the Liberal government on the hot seat not so long ago rises 
as the ghost of the return of this form of register, the idea 
being that there would not be a series of this type of files 
gathering information here and there on the public for purposes 
other than public security and protection.  I point out once 
again that it is by proceeding clearly from the outset, setting 
up specific guidelines, that we will prevent excesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, after reviewing the benefits of the proposal we 
are debating here, and identifying the pitfalls to be avoided, I 
believe a national sex offenders registry could function.

and, we hope, positive effect on the public.  This effect will 
be felt as a preventive measure, an approach that has always had 
good results, so the public may feel truly safe.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian

member's support for the motion.  I clearly remember her saying 
that the general public should never be able to access the 
information.  I do not think anyone would quarrel with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member consider it wrong for the police to issue a 
warning to the community once it knows of the presence of a sex 
offender in that community?  Would that be inappropriate action 
on the part of the police? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, warning the general public 
would certainly not be acceptable to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we see the bill, this would be confidential information, for 
the exclusive use of the police and, of course, the solicitor 
general.  There is no question of tacking up pictures of sexual

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I compliment the member on her previous work in the 
House on justice issues.  I respect her opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague be able to shed some light on the CPIC system 
which the police has?  I know now government members will support 
the motion to develop a national sex offender registry by January 
2002, but there seems to be some waffling on whether or not they 
see it as just the CPIC system or something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member give us some level of confidence that the CPIC 
system is doing today or even tomorrow what the people on the 
other side think it is doing?  I understand from the police that 
its CPIC information system does not look after the problem of 
sex offenders in communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne:</B> As I understand the Canadian Alliance 
member's motion, responsibility for gathering and maintaining 
the information would not lie with CPIC but with police forces, 
which would be individually responsible for all the information 
they would receive, since sexual predators would be listed with 
local forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that this would be the case if CPIC were used. 
Since we have seen how effective they are right now, it would 
perhaps be an idea to use other means and to list offenders with 
local police forces.

the registry present a high risk of recidivism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of 
deciding whether or not a sexual predator presents a high risk 
of recidivism.  All sexual predators should be listed.  This 
way, there is no discrimination, there are no supposedly 
objective criteria, all sexual predators have to register.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to say that I am tempted to call 
quorum.  The idea of the opposition day is to provide the 
opposition with an opportunity to put forward points of view to 
which the government listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was created to replace the thorough examination of the 
estimates that used to exist before 1968 or 1969 when government 
members had to stay in the House, particularly the cabinet 
minister in charge, to listen to the opposition and answer 
questions, et cetera.  When I look across the way and I see only 
3 government members out of 175, it does not exactly inspire one 
to think that there is a great zest for the House of Commons over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member opposite has been here a long time.  He knows 
full well that references are not made to attendance in the 
House.  The government is very interested— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  That is not really a 
point of order, but your point is as well taken as his.  There is 
a very clear message in his words, too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in that case, if what I 
just did was offensive, I will do what is permitted within the 
rules and I will call quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  A quorum has been 
called.  The bells should ring for a maximum of 15 minutes, but 
as they are not working are you willing to withdraw your quorum 
call? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, ask not for whom the bell 
tolls.  It is tolling for no one at this point.  Apparently the 
bells are not working and therefore we cannot even call a quorum 
when we want.  The government is let off the hook this time by a 
technological glitch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is time for electronic voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Someone says that it is time for 
electronic voting.  This is already electronic and it has failed 
us.  Perhaps that should be a warning to us.  We could all come 
in here some day to vote electronically, press the button and 
nothing would happen.  Then what would we do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  What difference would that make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  The hon. member asks what difference it 
would make.  It certainly would not make any difference to 
members of the government.  They always do what they are told 
anyway, whether or not it is electronic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in support of the motion moved by my 
Alliance colleagues on their opposition day.  I listened with 
interest to the solicitor general's reply.  I might be mistaken, 
but I had the impression as I was listening to the solicitor 
general that he was speaking against the motion.  Then of course 
at the end of the speech he announced that the government would 
be supporting the motion, which I think took the member from 
White Rock somewhat by surprise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is hard to know what is really best, whether to 
have the government oppose a motion or support it.  I have had 
this experience before.  I was reminded today of February 8, 
1999, when the government supported an NDP motion with respect to 
a national ban on water exports.  The Liberals all stood and said 
they supported the motion.  The next day they had a press 
conference to announce a policy that was entirely different from 
a national ban on water exports and said that they were living up 
to the opposition day motion to which everyone had agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bit of that going on here if I understand the 
solicitor general correctly.  The argument he was making was that 
he was supporting the motion but he did not really agree there 
was any need for the motion or any need for what the motion calls 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means to me is the government simply did not want to 
endure the political price of voting against this motion and 
being subject to the considerable vituperativeness of the 
solicitor general critic of the Alliance Party and others who 
would have called it to account for not supporting this motion. 
As I listened to the solicitor general it seemed he was saying 
the country already had one in the context of CPIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have the motion before us is that no one, except 
for perhaps the solicitor general and his parliamentary 
secretary, believes that CPIC as it now stands is anything like 
what the people who are calling for a national sex offender 
registry have in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a legitimate point that CPIC could be transformed, changed 
substantially, and used as the basis for a national sex offender 
registry.  That means it would have to include the kinds of 
information it does not now include.  It is a legitimate option. 
If that is what the government wants to do, perhaps it could have 
put it forward in a much more clear and convincing way, but it 
did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are calling for a national registry are calling at 
the moment for a stand alone registry.  Whether it happens in the 
form of a stand alone registry or in the form of a substantially 
transformed CPIC, it remains the case that the people who have to 
deal with it on an ongoing basis, the police forces represented 
through the Canadian Police Association, are saying that what we 
have now is not working, contrary to what the solicitor general 
has said, and does not constitute the kind of national sex 
offender registry which they and others think would be very 
useful to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the solicitor general to sing the praises of what they are 
already doing and support the motion, while at the same time not 
really appreciating the worthiness of the arguments being put 
forward for a stand alone national registry, seems to me to be 
somewhat politically ambiguous, if not intellectually dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion.  We think it has to be done properly. 
There has to be a balance struck between certain privacy rights 
and the protection of the public.  If there is to be any kind of 
bias, it should be in favour of protection of the public, 
particularly protection of children who are vulnerable to people 
who want to exploit them sexually or in any other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand what the mover of the motion had in mind the 
registry would be a separate thing.  It would be established and 
maintained by the solicitor general. It would contain the name, 
address, date of birth, list of sex offences committed and 
convictions anywhere in Canada.  It would be a national registry 
because it is not good enough to have it in any one province.  We 
know all Canadians move around, but some people tend to move more 
than others, particularly if they are trying to lose themselves 
in the community and reappear in a way that their past is no 
longer with them.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we and, I think, people who want a registry want, 
both for people in authority and people who may want to contact 
those in authority about people seeking positions of trust with 
young people, is for those people's pasts to in some senses 
always be with them.  This is not because we do not believe 
people can be rehabilitated, but because we think people who are 
dealing with young people have a right to that kind of 
information so that we do not have more tragedies like those that 
have already occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason why we rise in support of the motion.  We 
think it has its limits and I do not think that anyone here 
thinks this will be the answer in that this does not change the 
psychology or inner consciousness of sex offenders.  It does not 
deal with a lot of the social and spiritual problems that lead to 
sex offences in the first place and which sometimes create a kind 
of chain reaction, because we also know that a lot of people who 
are sex offenders are people who have been offended against 
themselves, although that is not always so.  There is a lot of 
other work to be done and we need to see this in context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems to me that it is something that is 
supportable.  The motion is just that, a motion, and it does not 
lay down the details.  I think as a House we should all be able 
to support the idea.  Again, that is within certain limits of 
expectation, because it is somewhat debatable whether a registry 
would be preventative or whether all this would do is help police 
forces when there has been an occasion of an offence in regard to 
perhaps finding that offender sooner because they will know who 
is in the community in which the offence has taken place.  That 
is not prevention, but enforcement, and enforcement is also 
important.  To some extent it might also be prevention if this 
registry makes it possible for people to preclude previous 
offenders from having positions of trust with children which 
would present them with opportunities to reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I cannot resist this comment in closing.  Listening to 
the solicitor general make the arguments against a registry, 
before he said he was in favour of the motion, it sounded an 
awful lot to me like what might come from the Alliance.  He said 
that offenders would not all register, that they would not all do 
this or do that.  That is his argument against a registry.  It is 
funny that these kinds of arguments did not seem persuasive when 
people were arguing against the registration of .22s, but that 
when it comes to the registration of sex offenders these 
arguments are suddenly very convincing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will relate to the member a situation that took 
place in Calgary some months back, where a sex offender who had 
offended not only in Canada but in the United States finished 
serving his time in Bowden penitentiary in Calgary.  He served 
his complete time.  Of course there was no registry in the 
province of Alberta and it just so happened that this offender 
moved to Oklahoma.  He did not tell anyone.  Through family and 
friends, word came back to my office that this offender was down 
there.  He was a serious sex offender who had served several 
years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do in a situation like that?  It is difficult.  We 
took the initiative and phoned the local sheriff where we knew he 
was staying in Oklahoma.  The local sheriff was quite surprised 
that he had such an offender in his area and said that according 
to Oklahoma law the onus is on the offender to register in that 
area.  Of course the offender had been in the States and knew 
what the laws were there, so the sheriff sought him out.  The 
driving force for a pedophile or a sex offender to react to the 
registry in a positive way in Oklahoma is a five year sentence if 
he fails to do so.  This is quite significant and it is cut and 
dried.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I understand what has 
been put forward today, there would be an onus on people to 
register themselves when they arrive in a particular community or 
within a limited time after their arrival, and there would be 
penalties for not doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously these penalties have to be sufficient to be a 
deterrent. When we get down to having legislation before us, we 
can talk about what that might be, but in terms of the principle 
that there should be some penalty for not registering, I would 
certainly agree with the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague is aware of the respect I have 
for him when he speaks in the House and the respect I have for 
his experience.  Once in a while when things happen in the House 
involving partisan politics and how the House runs, we go to our 
colleague because he has the experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue that has been bothering me all morning since 
the solicitor general said the government would vote for the 
motion but that the government is already doing what is in it. In 
fact, 30,000 policemen in the country say the government is not 
doing it.  Virtually everybody we have talked to says the 
government is not doing it and that the system does not work 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks like we have unanimous consent on the motion, but the 
trouble is that on the other side I think the government is 
saying it will agree with the motion but it will not change 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comments on how he reads the way the 
government shuffles through this kind of issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to elaborate on the point 
I made earlier, I think the government does sound a bit 
self-contradictory in supporting the motion, which clearly calls 
for something that is not now the case.  In supporting the 
motion, the government says that what the motion calls for is 
already the case.  I do not think it made a very good 
argument—at least it did not convince me—that what we have now 
is what the motion calls for.  It has not convinced the Canadian 
Police Association and I do not think it would convince anybody 
who takes a decent look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this has been the government strategy on a number of 
occasions.  One of the other things it has tried to do from time 
to time in regard to previous opposition day motions is to make a 
motion to amend the wording.  Rather than having the motion say 
“bring in X”, the government amends it to read “continue to do 
X”, as if it had always been doing it.  The government did not 
have that opportunity today, so the only way it has to blunt the 
effect of the motion is to vote for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be nothing wrong with voting for it if the 
government were actually willing to admit that what it has now is 
not adequate.  That would not be a sin.  That would not be the 
end of the world.  Part of the problem is that is very difficult 
for a government to say that what it has now is not working, that 
it realizes this, that the motion is an idea whose time has come 
and that it will vote for it.  I think that is something the 
opposition benches could genuinely have celebrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the government to say it will vote for the motion 
after it has mounted a cheerleader type of defence of everything 
it is doing now is just not quite as satisfying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In the debate, the member for Langley—Abbotsford and the member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona clearly outlined a problem facing the 
House of Commons, that is, we will be voting on a motion tonight 
and yet there is not a clear understanding of the purpose or the 
intent of the motion. 
Government members indicate that they intend to vote for it, yet 
it is obvious that—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but he is making more of a speech than a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  My point is that we are talking about 
apples and oranges.  I seek the unanimous consent of the House to 
continue the debate with the members for Winnipeg—Transcona and 
Langley—Abbotsford, to invite the participation of the solicitor 
general and his parliamentary secretary, and to hash out what we 
are really talking about today.  Otherwise it is making a mockery 
of the House of Commons.  The Liberals will vote for 
something they say is not what we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member cannot 
refer to members who are not in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has asked for unanimous consent of the House 
to give a speaker who has already spoken to the bill the 
opportunity to speak again.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on this 
very worth while and very common sense motion that has been 
brought forward.  I am equally pleased that the matter will be 
voted upon, whereby all members of the House will have an 
opportunity to express their support or lack of support for the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would deem this motion to be a very common sense, mother's 
milk type of motion that is very much aimed at protecting our 
most vulnerable members of society, our children.  This motion 
would put in place a registry that would provide information 
which would allow the police to have better access to information 
about the whereabouts of offenders and about convictions of a 
sexual nature that have been registered in the courts.  This 
would provide them with the enhanced ability to protect society 
and to carry out their appointed task.  It would simply give them 
more tools with which to do their job and protect society and, 
more specifically, protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls upon the government to establish a registry by 
January 1, 2002.  The member for Langley—Abbotsford is to be 
commended for bringing this motion forward with the honest intent 
of ensuring that the registry system is in place by that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has indicated, in its attempt to co-opt this 
motion—and there has been some discussion about methods in which 
it often does this by amending—that it will be supporting the 
motion.  One can only hope that there is a similar and genuine 
intent behind it to fulfil this commitment, but again, the House 
will have to excuse my skepticism.  We have seen instances as 
recently as a few weeks ago in this parliament, when Liberal 
members voted against a motion that essentially came from their 
own red book.  We know that in the Liberal red book there is in 
fact a reference, albeit an oblique one, to a similar commitment 
to put a sex offender registry in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have indicated today that they may support 
the motion.  Time will tell.  Similarly, I hope Canadians, and in 
particular victims' groups and police officers, will watch what 
happens after today to see if there is a real commitment.  I mean 
more than just the words, more than the mouthing of the words and 
the reannouncement of other motions and other commitments that 
have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should indicate at this point, Mr. Speaker, that I will be 
splitting my time with the indomitable, unsinkable member for 
Saint John.  I can assure the House that she will be speaking in 
favour of this motion, as am I.  We have unanimous support in the 
Progressive Conservative Party for this important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been reference to the fact that models in other 
countries are working.  I am talking about the United Kingdom and 
the United States.  Most recently, we have seen efforts made in 
the province of Ontario to support a similar type of registry. 
Other provinces are also looking at bringing this motion forward. 
Members will know that the province of Ontario has put forth 
concrete examples of how it intends to approach this problem, and 
it is a problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been acknowledged by the president of the Canadian Police 
Association, Grant Obst, that the current system is not working. 
There is not a current system in place that necessitates the 
reporting upon release of those who have been convicted of sexual 
offences to police so that it can track their whereabouts and 
ensure that individuals who have this past will be identified and 
will not, often for insidious reasons, find themselves involved 
in groups where they would be in a position of trust, able to 
prey upon children and able to perpetrate horrific crimes which 
have lifelong implications that are so damaging and damning that 
the children's lives are ruined for all intents and purposes. 
Often, and I believe it has been alluded to in this debate as 
well, the same victims go on to perpetrate this type of heinous 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be any more fundamental than that.  We should be 
tasked in this place to do everything we can, everything within 
our reasonable ability to ensure we are protecting children. This 
is a very straightforward, common sense way to go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the Ontario example to which other members and I have 
alluded was as a result of an horrific tragedy in the province of 
Ontario where Christopher Stephenson was murdered in 1988 by 
Joseph Fredericks, a convicted pedophile who was out on parole at 
the time.  There was an inquest and a lengthy examination of the 
factual circumstances of the case and circumstances surrounding 
similar crimes.  The inquest resulted in the suggestion that 
there should be a creation of a national sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as presented does not bind the House to proceed in 
any certain direction.  I would suggest that it could be used to 
complement the current CPIC system or it could be a stand alone 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly ample evidence of a contradiction, to which 
the member for Winnipeg—Transcona alluded, that the government 
would somehow justify not pursuing this as a stand alone system. 
It used the same argument, because offenders would not 
voluntarily register, when the same system used for registering 
firearms was plagued with the issue of non-compliance and 
individuals who are not voluntarily complying on pain of criminal 
conviction, one might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not prepared to put in place a system that 
would mandate that sex offenders participate in registry, but it 
is willing to put in place at huge expense to the Canadian public 
purse, $500 million plus, that if people do not register their 
long guns, being law-abiding citizens their entire lives, they 
are subject to criminal prosecution.  It is absolutely perverse, 
but it is atypical of the attitude of the Liberal government and 
the endless pursuit of bureaucracy in putting in place systems 
that will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a system being presented, a common sense approach 
to protect children, and it will apparently be sloughed aside or 
given lip service in a vote later today by the Liberals.  It will 
not be followed up.  While other governments like the government 
of the province of Ontario are pushing for the federal government 
to create a national registry, this is being rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon after the Liberals rejected Bill C-247, a private member's 
bill introduced by their own member for Mississauga East, we saw 
an attempt by one government member to bring forward a process 
that would allow for consecutive sentencing for repeat or 
multiple murderers, sex offenders, or those convicted of violent 
crimes.  There was a rejection, an outright campaign on the 
government side to ensure that type of legislation did not come 
into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario government in its wisdom passed that legislation 90 
to 0, it is worth noting, in its provincial legislature on April 
4, 2000.  Christopher's law is the first of its kind in the 
country.  It requires those convicted of serious sexual offences, 
those who are dangerous, high risk sex offenders, to register 
their names and addresses with the police in the jurisdictions 
where they will be residing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information in the registry could be available to local 
police forces.  They would have the ability to release the 
information, when required and when justified, to public groups 
such as the Guides, the Scouts, Big Brothers and hockey 
organizations or athletic organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the purpose for which this type of information could be 
used.  There is also the deterrent aspect.  Knowing that the 
registry is in place and that the information is available to 
police and to certain groups acts as a deterrent.  It is the 
equivalent of the sword of Damocles hanging over an offender's 
head if he or she chose to be indiscreet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are practical implications for such a registry.  The 
Canadian Police Association, 30,000 strong, strongly endorsed a 
registry.  The victims groups, and I would suggest hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians, see the wisdom in having this type of 
system.  Privacy rights could be protected.  The system could be 
crafted in such a way that it would not infringe the charter of 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly endorse and agree that we should always err on 
the side of caution when it comes to protecting children from the 
damage that can flow from the crimes perpetrated against them. 
The Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting the motion 
wholeheartedly.  My colleague from Saint John will be adding her 
remarks to this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it did not take long but I figured it out.  The 
Liberals have been behind the curtains in the lobbies passing out 
this document entitled “Canada's National Screening System: 
Protecting Our Children Against Sexual Abuse”.  It is stated in 
the document they have printed for all us unwise people “CPIC 
serves as Canada's national registry of convicted sex 
offenders”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the document indicates that basically it is good for a 
criminal record check.  In fact they have missed the whole point 
of what everyone has been saying, including 30,000 policemen, 
that the system is not good enough.  The national sex offender 
registry would apply to every person convicted and found 
criminally responsible.  It would require every offender who 
resides in Canada to register and there is a penalty for not 
registering.  The Liberals will agree with the vote tonight, but 
what they are saying in the brochure is that what we have is 
acceptable.  It is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague what he thinks is the problem, 
because he knows a lot about this subject.  No one in the country 
thinks the current national sex offender registry works because 
there is not one.  This document is nothing more than government 
rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he think is the hesitancy over there?  If anything, 
everybody in Canada would applaud the government for developing a 
real national sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge what the 
hon. member has said to be true.  The current system is 
inadequate.  It is not working.  Police forces indicate that it 
is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system allows convicted offenders to be released 
into the community, to change their addresses and to sometimes 
change their names or identities without notifying local police. 
In the event of an occurrence where there has been a crime 
committed, an abduction or a sexual offence, the lost identity or 
that person out there is like a needle in a haystack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police forces do not have the ability to act quickly.  Equally 
important, they do not have the ability to make pre-emptive 
strikes, that is to put the information out where necessary to 
community groups.  They do not have the requisite deterrent 
effect:  the knowledge that offenders would have that they are 
registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government not do it?  It defies logic.  The only 
point I can come up with is that the credit might flow somewhere 
other than to the government.  That is a sad comment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member when he says that the credit would go 
to the government.  People would acknowledge that this was what 
parliament was supposed to do.  There would be unanimous support 
for having a stand alone or a system that would work in 
conjunction with current computer programs to protect children. 
It is sad but there is manipulation going on when it comes to the 
facts surrounding the current system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He referred to manipulation of 
the facts.  Of course, he is referring to the fact that the 
government is opposed to what is being proposed.  The solicitor 
general gave a speech completely railing against the proposal but 
then finished off by saying that the government would vote in 
favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough stated, it is 
obvious that the reason behind it is that government members want 
to avoid the political backlash that would come from voting 
against what is being proposed.  They will vote for it, without 
any intention of doing it.  Clearly they are not supporting it, 
as illustrated in their speeches.  I believe the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona referred to that as being intellectually 
dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough believe that 
this is making a mockery of the House of Commons?  Where exactly 
does this leave us?  I think it is a pretty sad state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that one would 
hope partisanship would not be what is getting in the way.  It is 
important to have this open and full disclosure debate about the 
abilities and the shortcomings of the current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not with any pride that any member of the House would 
stand and say that we have a system that is failing.  It is 
certainly not with any pride on the part of the police that are 
currently tasked with trying to make the system work, as 
inadequate as it may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully acknowledge that there has been money put into it. 
However it is not there yet.  It does not have the ability to 
achieve what the motion envisions a sexual offender registry 
would achieve.  For that reason I hope we will go further and 
take some positive reinforcement from the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague for splitting his time with me.  I thank the 
hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford for bringing the matter 
before the House of Commons.  It gives all of us on both sides of 
the House an opportunity to correct a great injustice in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a national sex offender registry is an important 
and necessary step in the protection of our nation's children.  I 
know that the people of Saint John in my riding support the idea 
wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal note, as a mother of two and a grandmother of two, 
there is nothing more precious to me in the world than our young 
ones.  Many in the House will understand and agree when I say 
that nothing hurts us more than when a child is abused.  Many 
more will share my frustration when I say nothing angers me more 
than when responsible criminals are able to use the present 
system of laws to their advantage and to strike again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we sit in the House and do nothing while sexual predators 
attack our children, we are as much to blame as the predators. 
Each and every one of us has a responsibility in the House to 
bring forth laws that will protect young people from the men who 
do this to young people.  When we hold in place without change a 
system of laws that allows sex offenders to hurt again we are 
co-conspirators, each and every one of us. 
We have a duty and responsibility to protect Canadian families 
and to take swift and decisive action when we see Canadians are 
in danger.  We must not shy away from our duties or sit idle 
while there is a clear course before us that must be taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex crimes are not just committed against our children.  The 
victims can be seniors, adults or young men and women in the 
prime of their lives.  Sex offenders do not discriminate.  They 
are blind to what is right or wrong.  They have a real problem. 
They prey on our best, our youngest, the disadvantaged and our 
seniors without consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A month ago in my riding there was a man who was following the 
little elementary school buses.  Someone saw him going from stop 
to stop.  Finally someone called the police.  As one little girl 
got off the bus he tried to grab her and put her in his car.  Our 
people were there to protect her, and I thank God for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to applaud the vision and courage of the government of 
Ontario for doing everything in its power to create a safer 
province for its citizens.  Christopher's law, which passed 
unanimously in the Ontario legislature last April, was the 
strongest signal ever sent to sex offenders that our young would 
be protected and that they would not be allowed to strike again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Christopher's law loses its force and effect at 
the Ontario border.  Sadly, this is a fact known all too well by 
the monsters who abuse the young.  As it now stands, the sexual 
predator who crosses over the Ontario border may not surface 
again until he has abused more children in another province. That 
is a disgusting reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members on the government side of the House do not 
support the action we are debating today, they will extend the 
cover of darkness under which these criminals hide.  We were not 
elected in the House to help criminals.  We were elected to help 
and protect Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Yes, the innocent. My colleague for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough brought forth a 
motion similar to this a year ago and the government defeated it. 
Today it is telling us that it will support this one.  Let me say 
that I have reservations but I will be here tonight to watch. 
Every Canadian is going to be watching the House of Commons. This 
issue probably has a higher profile than any other issue that has 
been brought before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like others on the opposition side, we will support and praise 
the government and all those members who stand up tonight and 
vote in favour of the motion.  To those who do not, I will have 
my say about what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both sides of the chamber in Ontario, Conservatives, Liberals 
and NDPers alike, voted unanimously in favour of the 
Christopher's law.  That is what should happen here tonight.  All 
parties represented in that great place showed a wisdom and 
compassion which we should mirror here.  This decision is not a 
difficult one.  I cannot imagine anyone sitting in the House of 
Commons not wanting to bring forth a law in which we can protect 
our young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question whether this is right or wrong.  There is 
no question whether this will protect children.  There is no 
question whether parents or the police want us to do this.  It is 
just a matter of common sense whose time has come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members in the House to consider the stakes involved 
and think of that small child out there who can be abused.  Just 
think about that child.  Perhaps it is a son or a daughter. 
Perhaps it is a niece or nephew or maybe for some of us a 
grandson or granddaughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think of a sex offender living every day in our 
community.  Consider that this particular sex offender is tempted 
to strike again.  Consider for a moment that this particular sex 
offender can sit and watch that little child, like the man who 
followed the school buses carrying those little elementary 
children.

Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough brought forth his motion. 
Despite pleas from parents and grandparents alike, the government 
did not act a year ago.  It is the burden of shame that we refuse 
to carry on this side of the House and we do not want to see that 
happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad and sorry thing that we might not otherwise have 
discussed a national sex offender registry if not for the actions 
of the opposition side of this great Chamber.  Mark my words, not 
only will we be watching for those who stands against this 
motion, but the eyes of 30 million Canadians will be focused on 
the House and on these benches to see how our people vote 
tonight.  They will be watching each and every one of us.

that we all have a free vote on this issue.  I do not think we 
will be dictated to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merits and logic are clear.  There has not been a point made 
yet that would cause me to reconsider my position on this issue. 
I know in my heart that that is right.  I feel in my heart that 
all members know that we should all vote in favour of this motion 
and save our children from that type of abuse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the 
member for Saint John for her passion and usual eloquence on this 
and many other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians watching this debate must be cynical.  The Alliance 
Party put forward a motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government establish a national sex offender registry, 
by January 1, 2002. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like putting a motion forward that says the government 
should manage the fiscal resources of a government with care and 
diligence, which we do.  Of course we agree with this because the 
government is already doing it.  To put a motion in front of the 
House where the government has already implemented the policy, of 
course we will to support it.  Canadians must become cynical when 
they see the opposition party putting forward a motion on 
something that is already being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another sense of hypocrisy.  The opposition talks about 
supporting a registry for sex offenders, but it will not support 
a registry for gun control, which is an equally serious matter. 
It also talks about the members on this side supporting the 
motion and argues that there is no parliamentary dignity.  When 
we support a motion suddenly we are charged with being 
hypocritical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to the point the member for Saint John 
made.  In my riding last year a pedophile was released into my 
community, in fact about a block away from where I live.  His 
name is Peter Whitmore.  It was well documented in the media.  He 
served his full term of five years in a federal correctional 
prison and was then released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We enacted legislation to put conditions on release.  Those 
conditions were put in place and the offender was put into 
provincial custody when he breached that order.  I know it caused 
a great deal of consternation in my community and a town hall 
meeting was held.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually, because of the publicity and the reaction in the 
community, he was moved from that area to downtown Toronto.  I 
believe he re-offended again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue.  I will have no problem supporting 
the motion because the government is acting on a broad number of 
fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member, if the police are acting on the various 
infrastructures that are in place, the CPIC and other mechanisms, 
why does she think there is a problem being brought to the 
Chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has told 
us today why we need to have this national registry on sex 
offenders.  The Canadian Police Association yesterday voiced its 
support for the motion.  Mr. Grant Obst, the association 
president, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, convicted offenders may be released into a 
community, or change their residence, without notifying the local 
police service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member stated that the person who sexually abused that 
child was back on the street, was moved downtown and did it 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take stronger stands than what is in place today. 
What is there is not working and we have to correct it.  We have 
the right to do it and we can.  I ask every member to vote in 
favour of the motion.  If in the end this does not correct it 
permanently, we will come back with even further recommendations 
in the future.  We on this side of the House want to protect that 
little child. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is amazing that we would give the suggestion of 
hypocrisy in suggesting that we need a national sex offender 
registry.  The government is saying it is hypocrisy to suggest 
that because it is already doing it.  We are not already doing 
it.  The whole darn country is saying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from Saint John this question. 
In her travels across the country did she hear people saying 
there was a need for a national sex offender registry outside of 
what this group is or is not already doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I have heard it.  I 
heard it from Brownies, from Girl Guides and from Boy Scouts. 
There is an urgent need for it, more than there was 30 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have our charter of rights and freedoms which left out 
responsibilities.  Everybody has their rights and freedoms and 
they can go out and abuse children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying this issue will not go away.  It will not die.  We 
will fight it until we have that registry in place to protect 
those children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say at the outset that it is 
an honour for me to split my time with my hon. colleague from 
Provencher who is the justice critic for the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could say that it is a pleasure for me to participate 
in a debate this afternoon calling for the establishment of a 
national sex offender registry but to be honest it is not.  I am 
very grateful for the opportunity to rise and express my support 
for this initiative but it is by no means a pleasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were discussing the need for establishing laws that will 
enable us to protect society from sexual predators.  This is 
hardly a topic that anyone would enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it particularly galling that the House has to devote its 
time to debating the underlying principles of our society that 
are so fundamental for its future survival.  Clearly, the need 
for legislation in this area should be self-evident to everyone. 
That is everyone except the Liberals it would seem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the principles of safety and security, the 
ability for us to interact freely with each other without the 
threat of being targeted by undesirables who lack the social 
conscience to define right from wrong.  It has been said by many 
authorities that we cannot lay the blame solely on the 
perpetrators of these crimes.  The blame lies with society as a 
whole.  There is some truth to that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society Canadians have returned to office a government that 
has proven its inability to deal with social issues, a government 
devoid of anything resembling a spine, a government perpetually 
sitting on the fence trying to pander to both sides of every 
possible social issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are tired of this pass the buck approach to social 
policy, especially when it comes to protecting our children, 
wives and families from sexual predators.  This is one issue that 
Canadians do not want packaged off for yet another ruling by the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians elected their members of parliament to debate and 
develop government policy and it is time that the government 
recognize that it has a responsibility to all Canadians, not just 
those with Liberal MPs.  The creation of a national sex offenders 
registry is an excellent example of the kind of non-partisan 
social policy that the House should be proud to debate, develop 
and especially implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite are quick to leap to their feet to search 
for accolades, claiming to be the world leaders in this and the 
world leaders in that, and yet they are lagging behind the rest 
of the world in the most basic development and social policy. 
They are even lagging behind our own provinces.  We have heard 
about that today from other speakers, but let me reiterate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 2000, almost a full year ago, Ontario became the first 
province to establish a sexual offenders registry, passing 
Christopher's law by a unanimous 90-0 vote.  B.C. and 
Saskatchewan claim that they will follow shortly unless the 
federal government acts to establish a national sex offenders 
registry.  In my opinion the provinces have been more than 
patient with the Minister of Justice and her failure to follow 
through on the commitments she made in 1998 to amend our laws to 
finally afford some protection to potential victims instead of 
continuing to favour the rights of convicted sexual predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice system, through its misguided direction from the 
supreme court, has cultivated an environment where we are afraid 
to take any action that would infringe on the rights of 
criminals.  What has been lost in this dilution of criminal law 
is the principle that when people commit an offence against 
society by their actions they forfeit some of their rights as a 
citizen of that society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that criminals who have paid their debt to 
society have no rights, but there must be a balance between the 
rights of someone who has been convicted of violating our laws 
and the rights of the majority of us whom those laws are supposed 
to protect.  I admit that this is a very delicate balance but in 
the end the scale has to tip in favour of protecting the 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civil libertarians and other opponents of our proposal have been 
critical of the creation of a national sex offender registry 
claiming that it would be a further erosion of individual rights. 
They have been arguing that there is not a need to establish a 
new registry because the existing Canadian policy and information 
centre, CPIC, already does the job.  If it did we would not be 
having this debate here in the House today.  If it worked as the 
government alleges we would not have the Canadian Police 
Association publicly supporting our motion.  The people who use 
CPIC on a daily basis agree that it does not do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would like Canadians to believe that it is behind 
our motion and that it is being tough on sexual predators, but 
the truth is in its actions or, as the case may be, in its 
inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as we debate the motion, sexual predators are free to 
move around our country and in our communities with no 
requirement that they notify law enforcement officials of their 
location. They have been convicted but are not accountable for 
their deviant behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the government opposite we hear that the current system 
works fine, that we should just leave it alone or maybe amend it 
slightly.  We have come to expect these kinds of arguments from a 
government that was elected on a promise of maintaining the 
status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the opponents have not been broadcasting is that the 
current system is 30 years old and in urgent need of a $218 
million overhaul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past two weeks the Liberal government has been on a 
spending spree:  $2.5 billion in additional spending for HRDC, an 
agency that has proven it cannot manage its finances; $89 million 
to Heritage Canada which uses the same accountant as HRDC and is 
infamous for handing out so-called free flags; $26 million to the 
millennium bureau for new fountains; and an additional $30.5 
million to the government's propaganda department.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, the government will spend $165.23 billion this year 
and less than 1% of that spending has been allocated to updating 
the antiquated system that we have for keeping track of criminals 
who are released into our communities.  What a warped sense of 
Liberal priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the statistics for sexual offenders my stomach 
turns:  4,951 sex offenders are under federal jurisdiction, 25% 
of the total offender population; of the 3,250 in federal 
institutions, only 19% are in maximum security; 1,341 sex 
offenders are under community supervision, comprising fully 15% 
of the conditional release program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics on the probability of an offender repeating are 
even more disturbing.  A study done by Correctional Service 
Canada on recidivism among released federal sex offenders found 
that in a three and a half year period following release from 
custody, about one-third of sex offenders were convicted of a new 
criminal offence, nearly one-fifth for a violent crime and nearly 
one-tenth for a new sexual offence.  One in ten preyed on more 
innocent Canadians, creating yet more victims, and those are just 
the ones that we know about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent, I am outraged each time I hear of another child 
being molested or raped by a sexual predator who was released 
into society after having been previously convicted of the same 
disgusting crime.  As a member of parliament, I am appalled that 
the government allows this to continue.  It is time that we as a 
society and as a government act to ensure that we have an 
effective means of monitoring offenders who are deemed reformed 
enough to rejoin society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the disturbing trends of the government opposite is to 
completely discount any policy put forward by the opposition 
parties solely on the basis that it came from the opposition and 
without due consideration of the merits of that policy.  I would 
submit that it is time for this juvenile behaviour to stop and 
for the members opposite to grow up and accept that we have a 
collective responsibility as elected officials to ensure the 
safety of this country and its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the members of the Liberal Party and all of the 
members in the House to think of their sons, their daughters, 
their mothers, their sisters or their wives.  I ask them to think 
for just one minute about what they would do to protect their 
loved ones and to keep them from harm.  I would ask them to then 
recall how, as much as they wish they could, it is impossible for 
them to protect them 100% of the time.  I urge them to think as 
individuals.  I implore them to vote their conscience with the 
knowledge that this motion will go a long way to making their 
neighbourhoods and communities safer for all, especially the most 
vulnerable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the 
member's comments.  He spoke so eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to turn the clock back to maybe 1995 or 1996. We 
all care for our society and our youth.  As I have often said, if 
there is one crime it is one too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the member talked about non-partisan politics.  In his 
closing remarks he referred to juvenile behaviour.  I want to 
point something out to the member and ask for his comments.  As a 
private member some years back I brought a private member's 
initiative forward on parole request and making parole request 
contingent upon successfully completing a rehabilitation program. 
During the last election they talked about parole being a right, 
not a privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one of the saddest moments in my tenure in the House when 
the then Reform Party did not give its unanimous consent on that 
effort of mine.  Today, six years down the road, we have shown on 
this side that when good policy comes forward, we support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to give one example.  When the Conservative member 
brought forward a very good idea with respect to shipbuilding, we 
supported it on this side.  When good initiatives come forward, 
we go beyond our party politics and support them.  Why did those 
members opposite not support my effort back then on parole?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not recall the exact 
instance to which the member is referring.  I do not remember 
whether I was in the House, whether I voted or how my party voted 
on that particular item.  I would suspect that he was seeking 
unanimous consent.  Many times we deal with procedure in the 
House.  As a matter of fact, just an hour ago one of my 
colleagues asked for unanimous consent on a motion and the 
Liberals defeated it.  I suspect that if I were to check the 
records there would be some procedural reason why people voted 
against giving him unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, what clearly needs to be considered 
today, and it has been talked about by a number of my colleagues 
and colleagues from other parties, is what is taking place in the 
House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member from the Liberal Party said, it really does 
not matter who brought forward the motion.  In this case we have 
used one of our allotted days to bring forward a supply motion 
directing the government, if the motion were to pass, to 
establish a national sex offenders registry by January 1 next 
year.  It is a pretty simple request, a request that should be 
acted upon in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will note that I used the term in good faith because 
what we are seeing here today is the exact opposite.  We are 
seeing a government that will direct its members to vote for the 
motion.  It will try to delude the Canadian people into believing 
that it has already acted and will continue to act with the CPIC 
registry that tracks released criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the police association and other groups across Canada 
know that CPIC does not do it.  They have repeatedly said that 
over the last number of years.  There is no requirement for a 
convicted sexual offender, who is either released or who has 
served his time and gets out of jail, to register with local 
communities.  We have no idea who is living down the street.  We 
have no idea who we might hire to watch our children or our 
grandchildren because there is no requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues asked a question earlier of a Liberal 
member. He referred to an instance of which he was aware in the 
state of Oklahoma where there is a potential penalty of a further 
five years in jail for a convicted sexual predator if he fails to 
register.  That is a deterrent that we should consider if we were 
to even have the first step taken, which is to have a national 
sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled and I hope all Canadians who are watching the 
debate today and who watch the vote tonight are appalled at the 
government's hypocrisy in trying to claim that CPIC does the job 
when it so clearly does not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in support of 
the motion that calls for the implementation of a national sex 
offender registry by January 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Noting some of the comments by the Liberal parliamentary 
secretary made earlier to the Progressive Conservative member, to 
accuse the Progressive Conservative member of hypocrisy is the 
ultimate hypocrisy.  For years provincial attorneys general have 
been requesting some form of registry and for years the solicitor 
general and the Minister of Justice have been examining the 
issue.  Today they suddenly say that they are already doing it. I 
am sure it is news to every provincial attorney general and to 
the police departments in Canada.  The government is shamed into 
voting for it and yet it does not abandon the hypocrisy of its 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by remarking on a story printed last Friday in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
It was reported that the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council had 
been asked to rule on whether it was acceptable to criticize 
child molesters on the nation's airwaves.  The broadcasting 
council had been asked to adjudicate the matter after a viewer 
complained that Mike Bullard on his late night talk show had made 
remarks about pedophiles that were deemed to be inappropriate, 
derogative, prejudiced and inhuman. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Mr. Bullard's comments were admittedly in very bad taste 
and a poor attempt at humour, they expressed in a very blunt way 
the revulsion Canadians feel about dangerous sexual predators in 
society.  I do not excuse Mr. Bullard's comments but they 
indicate the concern, fear and revulsion Canadians feel about 
this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains: Is there a need to debate whether it is 
acceptable to express distaste for pedophiles and other sex 
offenders?  The issue demonstrates the extent to which we have 
allowed sympathy for dangerous criminals to impede our ability to 
protect children in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a weekly, sometimes even a daily basis we hear horrific 
reports of sexual assaults on children, such as the incident 
reported in Calgary last week where two girls aged six and seven 
were assaulted.  In addition to the apparently spontaneous 
attacks, I could cite hundreds of examples in which a teacher, a 
child care provider or another adult authority has unknowingly 
been given long term access to children and a tragedy has 
resulted.  The frequency of these cases demonstrates a clear need 
to keep track of these kinds of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone admits that these types of criminals are not 
cured simply by putting them in jail.  We know they need 
rehabilitation and treatment.  We also know they are not cured 
once they are released from jail.  There needs to be a mechanism 
for tracking them on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that sex offenders, pedophiles in particular, 
remain at high risk to reoffend sometimes for many years after 
they have served their sentence.  Our fundamental concern in the 
motion is for public safety.  The implementation of an effective 
national sex offender registry will give police and law 
enforcement officials an added tool to protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted the parliamentary secretary's comments when he said it 
was hypocritical that the Canadian Alliance wanted a national sex 
offender registry but not a national long gun registry.  Those 
are very interesting comments but he was not listening.  We said 
we wanted an effective registry.  We support effective crime 
control.  We do not support make work, political projects, and 
that is what the long gun registry is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system of tracking sex offenders has proven to be 
ineffective.  Although the Canadian Police Information Centre 
maintains a database of sex offenders, the information is 
inaccessible to many people in the justice system.  It does not 
adequately identify sex offenders or where they live, as 
offenders who are under supervision or have finished their 
sentences are not required to register changes of address.  This 
puts police and others working in the justice system at a 
distinct and severe disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the comments made by the Liberals, the Canadian 
Police Association has said the CPIC system does not provide 
police agencies with adequate information and notification 
concerning the release or arrival of sex offenders into 
communities.  In light of our motion, just yesterday the 
association reconfirmed its support for a national sex offender 
registry.  It is saying the Liberals are not doing it.  Police 
officers are the ones in the trenches and on the frontlines. They 
deserve our support.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed registry would include only convicted sex 
offenders, requiring each sex offender to register with police in 
the jurisdiction where he or she will reside.  The Canadian 
Police Information Centre already has a 24 hour registry that is 
used by every police force in the country to call up information 
on all types of convicted criminals, stolen property, firearms 
and missing persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed sex offender registry would require an updating of 
the legislation so that police could access current information 
on sex offenders and their whereabouts.  In this way a separate 
registry may not be necessary.  However it is absolutely 
necessary that we have legislation spelling out these additional 
requirements.  I am not particularly hung up on how we do it.  I 
am more concerned that we do it.  The present system is simply 
not doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry would assist local police in identifying suspects 
and solving sex offences more quickly.  Available only to the 
police, the parole board and the solicitor general's office, the 
registry would not inappropriately or unconstitutionally 
compromise the privacy of any individual.  It would, however, 
assist in protecting the public from sex offenders, particularly 
children, the most vulnerable and susceptible members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was widespread public backing for a registry, including 
provincial politicians of all political stripes: New Democrats, 
Conservatives and Liberals.  In the absence of an effective 
federal response to the issue the Ontario government created its 
province-wide offender registry last April.  Again, as mentioned 
earlier, it was passed on a 90 to 0 vote in the provincial 
legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What reasons could the federal government have for not taking 
these necessary and crucial steps?  Perhaps it considers the cost 
too great.  Perhaps the administration of the system would be 
difficult, complex and time consuming.  However if the registry 
were integrated into the current CPIC registry then the costs and 
administrative difficulties would be negligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government is concerned with privacy issues. 
However the registry we are proposing is almost identical to the 
database already maintained on criminal records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for an effective alternative to the current 
registry system which is clearly not working.  This is not a 
partisan issue.  It is not a political issue.  It is an issue 
about public safety and the protection of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to consider the motion carefully.  I 
especially urge the Liberals not only to vote in favour of it but 
to urge the minister to actually implement the registry so that 
police forces have the tools to protect our children.

of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, listening to the member 
opposite and the one preceding, the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River, underscores how the reform alliance people 
are prepared to push the hot buttons and always to take a 
knee-jerk reactionary position.  It is almost a lynch mob 
mentality.  It is kind of sad if we think about it.  They always 
take the simplistic view on very complex issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the Robin Sharpe case, for example, the 
pornography case.  They all screamed and hollered about how we 
should scrap the charter and how we should invoke the 
notwithstanding clause because of pornography in British 
Columbia.  Had we followed that lame advice we would be in deep 
trouble now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government, with its rational, reasoned approach, 
was able to withstand that kind of nonsense.  As a result the 
rule of law prevails, not the lynch mob mentality they are only 
too good at promoting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Earlier today in my address I talked about the need for 
discipline and proper protocol in the House when dealing with 
this issue.  What I find offensive about the member's comments is 
that they are neither complimentary to his colleagues nor to his 
party.  I would ask that he— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With the greatest respect to the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford, I believe we are engaging in 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, do you remember when their 
former justice critic Jack Ramsay said that all sex offenders 
should be locked up forever?  After some reflection did they not 
change their minds?  All of a sudden it was diluted a bit.  All 
of a sudden it became only after examination by two psychiatrists 
and then maybe they would look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ramsay was the same person, we will recall, who when 
speaking of sex offences went on to say that there should be 
blood taken from people even suspected of sexual criminal 
activity.  They have walked away from that one too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you see what I mean, Mr. Speaker?  They always have 
simplistic views on very complex issues.  That is who those 
people are.  They are always in a lynch mob mentality.  They are 
always in a knee-jerk situation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Earlier today I talked about protocol and the need for our 
colleagues in the House to speak at least respectfully of one 
another in this debate which is so important to children and 
women in our country.  The member is not abiding by any 
parliamentary courtesy whatsoever.  I ask you to reconsider— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Again, with the greatest respect, the 
authority of the Chair must be maintained.  I can only maintain 
the rules I have been given to handle and apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the knowledgeable member for 
Langley—Abbotsford, I am very cognizant that on both sides of 
the House all of us should act very judiciously and respectfully 
of one another and of course particularly regarding the issue at 
hand.  Certainly at this point we would be engaging in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member who intervened is 
the last one in this House to talk about protocol and decorum. On 
his brochure during the election he had the picture of Heather 
Thomas from Allouette Lake on it.  He is the last— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
privilege.  I think more important, what the member is about to 
report or to say in the House is absolutely 100% a lie where he 
is going.  I expect you in the chair to keep that person 
accountable for what he says.  That is shameful, disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  If I might, I want to 
begin by addressing myself to the member for Langley—Abbotsford 
for whom I have a great deal of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not question anyone's strong views on a very important 
matter before the House of Commons today.  There were some words 
used in his last intervention which require me to ask him, and 
hopefully he will see fit, to withdraw.  Perhaps I could ask the 
hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford to please withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Withdraw what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If I could be more specific, then, 
with the greatest of respect, the word lie, please.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford.  Now I turn to the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Solicitor General.  I would ask the hon. member to be 
mindful that we are in a very short period of questions and 
comments.  He has already used up a good portion of that time.  I 
ask him to direct his question immediately and to do so in a very 
judicious and respectful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to pose a question to 
the member who spoke a bit— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I want to be clear.  The hon. 
parliamentary secretary will put the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The question is simple.  In September, in 
Iqaluit, the justice ministers, attorneys general and solicitors 
general met with respect to this very important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Scarborough East.  I hope 
we can refocus our debate on the issue.  We are dealing with an 
extremely important issue and I know that we all have very strong 
feelings about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate in the debate brought about by the 
motion put forward by the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford.  I 
welcome the opportunity to demonstrate how the government has 
risen to the challenge of protecting victims and potential 
victims of sex offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past eight years the Solicitor General of Canada and the 
Minister of Justice have taken a number of initiatives, each of 
which contributes significantly to public safety.  In short, as 
other speakers will mention, the government has already taken 
action to prevent the victimization of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford basically endorses the efforts undertaken on 
this side of the House and ultimately has my support and I would 
assume my government's support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These efforts began immediately after the change in government 
following the 1993 federal election.  In 1994 the Minister of 
Justice and the Solicitor General of Canada responded to the 
needs expressed by child centred organizations and groups 
representing victims by introducing the national screening 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of one of those groups that lobbied the government as 
a result of the horrible murder of little Christopher.  I was 
very pleased to see the government listening to and responding to 
it.  I wear a button today that I have kept for many years since 
meeting the Stephensons.  Together with thousands of other 
Canadians I have worked on lobbying the government and pressing 
forward for these changes to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as in 1994, the RCMP's Canadian Police Information 
Centre, CPIC, already provides a national registry of all 
criminal convictions.  It is not limited just to sexual offences. 
Employers and volunteer groups providing services to children can 
screen all potential employees by requiring them to obtain a CPIC 
check through the local police.  Any individual who has a 
criminal record, no matter what, can be screened out by the 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist local agencies with the process, which in the 
beginning they found expensive to carry out, the government has 
also supported Volunteer Canada in providing a national education 
and training campaign for volunteer agencies to promote effective 
screening approaches for the protection of children and other 
vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This database was enhanced by government action and these 
enhancements did not stand alone and unused.  The announcement 
was followed by programs to promote awareness of its existence 
and the necessary initiatives to educate the appropriate 
individuals in the use of the database. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These efforts have enhanced the ability of child caring agencies 
to obtain the criminal records of those seeking positions of 
trust.  Great efforts have been made by government officials and 
their counterparts in the private and voluntary sectors to 
educate those who are involved in the selection of employees and 
volunteers to work with the most vulnerable members of Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, I have been referring to children as the 
potential victims of sex offenders.  I am sure that the minds of 
most members take a similar direction when they hear of sexual 
exploitation of victims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are not alone when it comes to victimization.  I 
recognize that the institutionalized, the mentally challenged, 
the physically disabled and the elderly may also be particularly 
susceptible to victimization through the sexual misconduct of 
those who prey on the most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians from all walks of life in various circumstances who 
until victimized participate in the daily life in their 
communities, oblivious to the predations of a small number of 
offenders who do not think that the rules and the mores of 
society apply to them. Nonetheless it is for our children that we 
reserve our highest level of concern.  I am sure all hon. members 
will recognize that the positive actions of the government on 
their behalf contribute to the safety of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent reform to strengthen our defences against sex 
offenders came into effect on August 1, 2000.  In the spring of 
1999 the solicitor general introduced legislative proposals to 
ensure that even the records of sex offenders who have been 
pardoned would be available for screening purposes.  This 
addition to the CPIC arsenal of information focused on the 
attention of police forces conducting criminal investigations of 
those offenders previously convicted of offences of particular 
interest to those who might otherwise engage them in positions of 
trust involving children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a successful application for a pardon is no longer a shield 
against the discovery of relevant offences by a records check. 
The legislation was Bill C-7 and its provisions came into effect 
on August 1, 2000.  Such government initiatives are not 
undertaken on a whim or without the recognition that other 
jurisdictions also have an interest in protecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 was born of the recommendations of a 
federal-provincial-territorial working group.  It was supported 
by all jurisdictions in Canada as represented by federal, 
provincial and territorial ministers responsible for criminal 
justice.  These officials heartily recommended and endorsed Bill 
C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this forum the government has studied and discussed the 
question of a sex offender registry on more than one occasion and 
conducted extensive consultations.  As requested by the 
federal-provincial-territorial ministers, senior officials have 
prepared a report entitled “Information systems on sex offenders 
against children and other vulnerable groups”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their meeting in Regina on October 29, 1998, the FPT 
ministers accepted the 10 recommendations contained in the report 
and agreed to its public release.  Since then FPT officials have 
met several times to review progress regarding the implementation 
of these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, the recommendations in the FPT report became the 
foundation for the Criminal Records Act amendments of Bill C-7 
that came into force in August 2000.  These will provide genuine 
enhancement of the protection of children and other vulnerable 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the exception of the governments of Ontario and British 
Columbia, officials from all jurisdictions supported the amending 
legislation.  We can conclude from the support that the majority 
equally rejected the notion of a sex offender registry, be it 
national or local, at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the thrust of the current proposal for a national 
registry is largely addressed through the current practice of the 
government. The current national screening process announced by 
the solicitor general in November 1994 was done after careful 
study.  The study was conducted by the departments of the 
solicitor general, health and justice.  It included extensive 
consultations across the country.  It involved victims, police 
and child serving organizations.  There was a general consensus 
that a registry system would be expensive, difficult to 
administer and not very useful.  It would also give the public a 
false sense of security rather than enhance public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a national registry of all criminal convictions which is 
provided through the RCMP CPIC database.  There is broad 
agreement that the federal government has produced meaningful 
initiatives to protect all Canadians.  In addition there is a 
degree of consensus that a national sex offender registry is not 
the answer to the problems identified by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is always open to suggestions that may promise 
positive reform.  It is open to changes in policy that come from 
time to time when provincial elections are held or senior 
officials are given different positions within the machinery of 
government.  This is a government that is open to constant review 
of its legislation to strengthen it in order to protect all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the recent meeting of the FPT ministers of justice, the 
Saskatchewan justice minister, with the support of his colleagues 
from Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, favoured another 
review that would revisit options regarding the protection of 
children against sex offenders, including a national sex offender 
registry. 
The ministers agreed that officials would again study these 
options and related issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will never be satisfied that all possible 
measures have been taken to protect the vulnerable from sex 
offenders.  As long as there are victims there will be the 
willingness to move toward a safer society.  The federal door is 
not closed to suggestions, and motions such as the one before us 
today provide a welcome occasion to review positive action of the 
recent past as well as possibilities for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the motion will lead to reinforced protection for young 
and vulnerable Canadians as well as for any other individuals who 
might fall prey to the recidivism of a sex offender.  We should 
not deny these proposals a chance to contribute to the ongoing 
improvements stemming from the government's public safety agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is amazing to listen to government member after 
government member saying that the legislation is working, there 
is a registry, there are no problems and it is all moving along 
very nicely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from a lady in my constituency that gives an 
example of just how well it is working.  This lady had two young 
boys who were lured into a large truck with a sleeper in the 
back.  They were sexually molested.  The person was put in jail 
and is now out on parole.  He is now allowed by the parole board 
to travel across the country in his truck.  He is a truck driver. 
No one knows where he is.  No one knows what community he will 
be in next.  The same government officials say the person is 
likely to reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could any member say that the parents, the grandparents, the 
people of Canada should not know where a Mr. Michael Duggan is at 
any given time?  He could pick up somebody else's kids or their 
grandchildren.  That is what this lady in my constituency wants 
to know.  I would like the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about 
issues as though he has the only caring heart.  All of us feel 
exactly the same way that he feels.  We are continually looking 
at ways of improving safety for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former police commissioner, I am well aware of the 
frustrations of the police in trying to deal with these issues. 
Bringing in a national registry or making our registry stronger 
will not be the answer.  We have committed to continually look 
for improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer at the end of the day is never having the offences 
occur to begin with, not only worrying about addresses.  I do not 
want them to happen, period.  I should like to see us put some 
emphasis in prevention and educating our children so that the 
offences do not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian

listening to this side and to that side.  They all say they will 
support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I wrong in assuming the motion says that we are about to 
establish a new registry?  That is what I understand.  Members 
opposite say they will be supporting the motion.  Are they 
supporting a new registry?  Is the member supporting additions to 
existing promises?  Just what will they be supporting tonight in 
the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I refer to a pamphlet that 
was recently delivered to us.  It refers to “CPIC serves as 
Canada's national registry of convicted sex offenders”. We 
currently have a national registry for all people who have 
criminal convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether we can continue to make it better.  Are 
there ways of looking at our current registry that will improve 
safety for all Canadians? We are always prepared to continually 
look.  It was part of the agreement last fall in Saskatchewan. 
Let us review and continually look at how we make it safer for 
all Canadians.

new registry for sex offenders.  While government members are 
paying lip service to what their whip has told them to do,

the inadequate screening they have in place now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just some tinkering we want in our motion but a 
complete overhaul, a new registry that will work to keep sex 
offenders away from our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a bit of difficulty in 
the issue of separating completely sex offenders from other 
criminals.  We all know what they are, but when they are 
convicted they are convicted.  It does not necessarily have to 
specify.  The current registry operating in Canada registers 
everyone who is convicted of a criminal offence, including those 
convicted of sexual offences or of being sexual predators.  That 
is already happening.  Can we make it better?  We are open to 
constant review, as I have indicated previously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to re-enter the 
debate.  The members opposite talk about the wording of their own 
motion.  I will read the motion to the House:  “that the 
government establish a national sex offender registry”.  It says 
nothing about a new national sex offender registry.  We are not 
trying to be pedantic, but I think the members opposite should 
read their own motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of the difficulty.  The emotions have been running 
pretty high.  This is a very serious issue.  However, when the 
Alliance brings forward a motion like this and the members of 
parliament on this side look at what the government has done, it 
is confusing.  The members on the other side are saying that what 
we have does not work and yet the information they have shared 
with other members does not seem to make that point very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, last year in my riding of Etobicoke North we 
had a sexual predator who was convicted.  His name was actually 
quite high profile and got into all the media.  Mr. Peter Robert 
Whitmore had been convicted and had served a full term of five 
years in a federal penitentiary.  He was then released, but with 
a set of conditions.  I would like to read some of the conditions 
to the House, because they were quite exhaustive.  The one he did 
not adhere to caused him to be arrested again.  He was moved out 
of the Etobicoke North area into downtown Toronto, breached one 
of the conditions and on the basis of that was put back in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a list of 11 conditions for his release from federal 
penitentiary after serving five years.  First, he was not to be 
in the presence of children under the age of 14 unless 
accompanied by an adult who had previously been approved by the 
Toronto Police Service.  Second, he was not to attend any public 
park or public swimming pool where persons under 14 years of age 
were present or could reasonably be expected to be present. 
Third, he was not to attend any day care centre, school ground, 
playground, community centre or arcade where persons under 14 
years of age were present or could reasonably be expected to be 
present.  Fourth, he was not to enter into any romantic 
relationship, cohabitation, marriage or common law relationship 
with a person who was the parent or guardian of a child under the 
age of 14 years until that person had been identified to the 
Toronto Police Service and there had been an opportunity provided 
to inform that person of his criminal behaviours involving 
children.  Fifth, he was required to report once a week to the 
Toronto police at specified times.  Sixth, he was to notify the 
Toronto Police Service of his current address and any change 
within 24 hours.  Seventh, he was to notify the Toronto Police 
Service of any employment or change of employment within 24 
hours.  Eighth, he had to make himself available for random 
visits by the Toronto Police Service between the hours of 8 a.m. 
and 11 p.m. at his place of residence.  Ninth, he was to notify 
the Toronto Police Service at least 24 hours prior to leaving the 
jurisdiction of the city, et cetera.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Robert Whitmore served his full five years.   There was a 
lot of rhetoric at a town hall meeting in my riding with some 
people saying that the reason he was back in the community was 
because of liberal attitudes and the soft attitudes of the 
Liberals.  I will tell the House that he served his full five 
years in a federal penitentiary, he was released with 11 
conditions, and one of the conditions was broken and he was put 
back in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it disturbing when members opposite cite the pamphlet 
“Canada's National Screening System” and say that it is the 
only way in which the government has responded.  In fact, the 
national screening system is one of a variety of responses and 
measures introduced by the government to deal with criminals 
and sex offenders.  I would like to remind the House of some of 
these, because I think that Canadians watching this debate could 
be very confused, as they often could be because we often do not 
really deal with the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important tool in our bag is CPIC, the Canadian Police 
Information Centre.  This centre has a criminal history database 
that provides access to criminal information for law enforcement 
agencies across Canada.  The government has just put another $115 
million into the system to upgrade it and make sure it is fully 
functional and operating smoothly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Etobicoke North I have not had division 23 
policemen tell me that what they really need is a sex offender 
registry.  We have had a lot of crime in Etobicoke North.  We 
have had nine murders or thereabouts in the last year or so. That 
is why we had the chief of police, Mr. Fantino, out to the riding 
at a big town hall meeting.  Basically the chief said that the 
whole community has to be engaged and involved.  Yes, tougher 
enforcement could be implemented, and yes, the police could 
change their routines and techniques, but we as citizens all have 
to work together, not just the different orders of government. 
The federal government obviously has a role to play in terms of 
criminal law and many other aspects.  There are the provincial 
government, the provincial court system and the police, all with 
a role to play.  However, individual citizens also have to take 
some responsibility for their own behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At churches, gudwaras, mosques or schools in my riding of 
Etobicoke North, I take the opportunity to tell people that this 
is where the rubber hits the road.  Yes, we can ask for tougher 
laws and say the federal and provincial governments are not doing 
this or that, but if we do not start taking individual 
responsibility for our own behaviour and actions, we are missing 
the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned CPIC, but the government has also lengthened 
sentences for dangerous and long term offenders.  Perhaps the 
opposition has forgotten that.  The government has tightened the 
rules for early parole.  The government has passed one of the 
toughest child pornography laws in the world.  Maybe that has 
escaped opposition members.  The government has cracked down on 
child prostitution and stalking.  We in the government also have 
implemented the very famous and very effective national screening 
system.  Let me remind the House that this system empowers 
volunteer, community and service groups to screen persons seeking 
positions of trust with children and other vulnerable people.  To 
date, over 700,000 screenings have been conducted using the CPIC 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done other things.  It has partnered with 
Volunteer Canada to promote screening and to train users.  The 
government has passed Bill C-7 to make pardon records accessible 
for screening purposes by flagging the records of pardoned sexual 
offenders on the CPIC system.  The government has put in place 
extra protection to allow police more control of high risk 
offenders even after they have completed their sentences.  The 
government also recently created a national DNA databank, a 
critical investigative tool that has already resulted in 
successful matches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition party really wants a thoughtful debate on 
these opposition days, perhaps it should elaborate more on its 
motions so members could understand them. 
We are saying we already have this and the opposition is saying 
we do not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe members opposite have much more contact with the police 
than I do.  I have a lot of contact with my police and, as I say, 
they have not been banging on my door saying that we need this 
registry.  They have been banging on my door saying that we need 
to get the community mobilized, that we need everybody to take 
individual responsibility.  Certainly there are things that 
different orders of government can do, along with the techniques 
the police use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should try to bring this debate back to some level of 
decorum and rationality.  It is a very emotional issue.  A 
pedophile was released into the community a block away from where 
I live.  The community responded.  I think there were over 1,000 
people at a town hall meeting.  What happened?  The pedophile was 
moved to downtown Toronto and then breached one of the conditions 
and was reincarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious issue.  I certainly will be supporting the 
motion, but I am not exactly sure what the motion proposes that 
we do not already have.  If the opposition parties have some 
information they could share with the House about why what we 
have does not work, I am sure members would like to listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, throughout the day we have been pointing out to my 
colleague the deficiencies in the current system and we will 
continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was encouraged by my colleague's comment that he wanted to 
work together on this important issue.  Obviously it is a very 
important issue.  He mentioned initiatives the government has 
taken.  We appreciate that, but what we are saying is this:  why 
not move forward now and take another step that we can work on as 
leaders in the country in order to protect the safety of our 
children and our communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to ask the member a direct question.  He said he will 
support the motion.  Will he, in his capacity as a parliamentary 
secretary, encourage his government to bring forward legislation 
that would put in place this type of registry across the country 
and see it brought through the process to royal assent in this 
place so that it would be put into law?  Will he do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I were clear on what the 
issues were, I would automatically and categorically say that I 
would do that, except that there is some confusion, certainly to 
my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I will do, though, is go to division 23 next time I am in 
my riding and ask what is available now, what is working and what 
is not.  If the division 23 police tell me that what is there is 
not working, I will undertake that I will work on this side of 
the House with members opposite and with the ministers involved 
to try to enhance the system.  It is a very serious issue. 
Certainly constituents in my riding believe it is and I totally 
agree with them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to hear the hon. member 
talk about how the pedophile was known in the community and how 
he was dealt with when he did not keep the terms of his release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are dealing with, though, is the issue of people 
who have offended, who have perhaps served their time and who are 
released and are not known by members of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member what he would do with the 
person if the community was not Toronto, where he was known, but 
Ottawa or Kamloops, British Columbia, where he is not known and 
is another person on the street who no one has any information 
about.  They do not know that he is a dangerous person who is apt 
to reoffend.  The problem is, and I have dealt with this 
situation personally, many of these people get out of jail with 
the officials who are responsible for them saying that they will 
probably reoffend.  That is the crime against our children that 
we are trying to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the member do with that person if he were in Kamloops 
and no one knew why he was there, who he was or what his history 
was? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me we have a 
sort of catch-22 here.  We could talk about how long people 
should be incarcerated or whether they should be let out on 
parole, which is a debate we have had many times and will have 
many times in the House, I am sure. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a person has done his or her time and the parole board has 
a certain level of confidence that the person can be reintroduced 
back into the community, the community is informed.  Some do get 
away but it is a low number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Mr. Whitmore, the people in my riding were told 
that he would be reintroduced into the Toronto area, which was a 
good thing because people at least knew he might be someone who 
they should be concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us assume that the person is someone who could come 
back into society, be productive and make a contribution to 
society.  How would the person ever do that if he or she is 
jostled from one community to the other?  How would the person 
ever re-establish himself or herself?  Some offenders can come 
back into society.  They have paid their dues, done their time 
and have been, in many cases, rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a catch-22.  The moment we let people know that an 
offender is in the community, they will do what the people in my 
riding did.  I am not arguing with what they did, but that person 
then had to be moved out of the area.  Where does the person go? 
The person gets moved around from one community to the other. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I do not wish to talk specifically about the legislation but I 
think all of us know that there is no registry for sex offenders. 
There is CPIC, which covers everybody, but most police and 
certainly the police in my constituency tell me that it does not 
work, that it is out of date, that it does not really trace these 
people, that half the files do not have addresses on them and 
that basically these people cannot be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To stand and say that the police know where they are and that we 
already have a registry is not accurate.  We do not have a 
registry for sex offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a householder I had 92% of people tell me they were unhappy 
with the justice system as it exists.  I would like to use a 
couple of examples from my constituency, which I think will 
demonstrate the level of frustration that the people in my riding 
would have if they listened to some of the members on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first case I want to speak about involves a pedophile.  We 
have them in every riding right across the country.  We were 
advised that this one pedophile would be released in March 1997 
into my riding.  There was no plan to release his name, his 
location or any details about his offence.  We found out about 
his release from his concerned ex-wife who notified a couple of 
people in the constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person had served his full term.  It was his ninth 
conviction for attacking female children.  The youngest of his 
victims was three and the oldest was six.  The person had been 
removed from a rehabilitation program because he was considered 
too dangerous.  The prison officials said that he would reoffend 
within a year.  The psychiatrists said that he would definitely 
reoffend within a year.  The parole board said that it would not 
give him parole because he will reoffend.  Canadians are 
frustrated when they hear that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents got together and had a meeting.  They were not 
violent or mad.  They were not asking for the person's head. They 
were saying that this was a sick individual and that society 
should not have to wait for another victim.  The RCMP addressed 
that meeting and said that all it could do for them was to help 
them street proof their kids.  The RCMP told them it would help 
street proof three to ten year old kids.  Has anyone ever tried 
to street proof a three year old on sex offenders and expect it 
to always work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result and after an awful lot of pressure, we received a 
picture of the person and we circulated it to let the people in 
the area know where he would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 8, 1997, I asked the following question in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on March 14 a pedophile, who is a nine time 
offender, was released into the community of Red Deer. I met with 
over 200 concerned parents in a gymnasium. At that meeting, the 
RCMP said that this person would reoffend. The prison officials 
said that he would reoffend. The parole board said that he would 
reoffend. They say that the next time his crime will probably be 
more violent.  The people in my community, the young parents who 
were there, asked whether one of their children would be the 10th 
victim.  What message will the justice minister give these 
parents? 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The then justice minister answered my question by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as a parent of young children, I recognize the 
concern that any parent feels about such an offender or such 
offences.  It is because I am a parent of young children that I 
drew particular satisfaction with the initiative of which I was 
part when the government and the caucus introduced Bill C-55 to 
deal with exactly the kind of case that the hon. member has 
described. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that the bill would solve the problem and that 
we should not have any worries.  It is like what we are hearing 
now, that we have no worries because the people are being 
registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My supplementary question was even more interesting.  I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, that is just not good enough.  I looked into the 
eyes of these parents and they are feeling scared for their 
children.  They are saying that the system and the justice 
department are failing them.  They are not delivering.  This 
pedophile committed nine other offences.  The psychiatrists say 
he will reoffend.  This individual is sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal answer that I got is not good enough.  I want the 
justice minister to tell the people what he is going to do for 
them.  This is happening right across Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His answer was “I shall have to send to the hon. member a copy 
of Bill C-55”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story gets worse.  The individuals in our community who were 
living next door to the pedophile were terrified.  I have a 
letter from a next door neighbour who described what the person 
was like.  The neighbour said “This person then went on to paint 
swastikas on my building.  He stalked me and he was fined $150 
for that offence.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirteen months later, what everyone had predicted would happen, 
did happen.  The person picked up two six year old girls who were 
playing in their sandbox.  He did not do it in that community. 
He went 15 kilometres down the road.  He now not only had his 
10th and 11th victim, but the system had failed the people of 
that community totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a record of the person.  We are not keeping track 
of these people, and that is what the motion is all about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, I again asked a question in the House.  In the 
first question I asked the former justice minister about the 
nine-time convicted pedophile who was released into my riding.  I 
was told that I should not worry about it.  The answer I got this 
time from the new justice minister was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, obviously the situation that the hon. member refers 
to is a very serious one and a very tragic one.  My colleague the 
solicitor general and I have discussed this issue and we are 
going to be looking at it further. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in May 1998.  It is fine to keep putting these issues 
off, to keep saying that we will do something and that we do have 
a registry there.  This is happening over and over again.  That 
is why we have to keep track of these people.  We have to know 
where they are.  We have to know their addresses and they have to 
report in.  It is not because we are vicious and mean. It is 
because we do not want more victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another example, a mother, Mrs. Lisa Dillman, called me on 
Friday.  She has two daughters aged five and six. She is the 
ex-wife of Dr. John Schneeberger who was convicted of raping a 
patient. He sexually assaulted his 11 year old stepdaughter for 
three years.  He was convicted in November 1999 and is eligible 
for parole in June of this year, serving less than two years of a 
six year sentence.  This person had put somebody else's DNA in 
his arm so as not to get caught but the police took a hair sample 
from him and managed to do a DNA match. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge has forced the mother of those two girls, the five year 
old and six year old, to bring the girls to Bowden Penitentiary 
for unsupervised visits with Dr. John Schneeberger.  Neither the 
mother nor anyone else can be there.  These two young girls will 
be left in a prison with a sexual offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of justice system are we talking about?  We need to 
start talking about the victims. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will be the psychological impact on these two young girls? 
The person was actually going through immigration hearings at the 
time of his criminal hearings and he said that he did not have a 
criminal record.  He lied to the immigration people to become a 
Canadian citizen.  To say that CPIC is working, that it is doing 
its job and that we know where the sexual predators are, is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked earlier about a truck driver in my constituency who had 
attacked two young boys aged four and five.  He is now driving 
across the country in a truck with a bedroom in the back to pick 
up other potential victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing nothing to keep track of these sexual predators. 
That is what the motion is all about.  It is about those little 
kids, about our kids and our grandchildren.  That is why we have 
to get a registry for sexual offenders.  Do not throw CPIC back 
in our face. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member just illustrated some very graphic 
and disturbing examples of sexual predators who the system is not 
dealing with properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are advocating a sexual offender registry that would track 
people and make reporting mandatory in order to try to prevent 
more of these types of occurrences.  We see an obstinance in and 
a refusal by the Liberal government to want to address the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the British Columbia court ruling last 
January or the January before when it ruled that the possession 
of child pornography was legal.  We put a vote in the House of 
Commons to invoke the notwithstanding clause in the constitution 
to override that.  It was basic common sense and the government 
voted it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member think the Liberal government is reluctant to 
deal with such a serious problem in our society?  Why does it 
refuse to act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this should be a non-partisan 
issue.  All of us care about our children and, in many of our 
cases, our grandchildren.  I know you do, Mr. Speaker.  The 
children are the ones I am most concerned about when it comes to 
sexual predators.  It is our job as members of parliament to 
protect the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a very liberal point of view.  I do not 
understand the psychological thinking of people who can be more 
concerned about the rights of a nine-time offender than they can 
be about the potential 10th and 11th victims.  I do not 
understand that when these are six year old kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a province where Liberals are an endangered species 
and perhaps that is why I do not understand that Liberal 
thinking.  However, that is the way it is.  It is a Liberal way 
of thinking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what I really would have liked to have seen today is 
the solicitor general stand up and say that all parties agree on 
the issue, that it is a good idea, that the government has been 
working on it and that we should take the proposal, bring it 
forward and develop a national sex offender registry.  Instead, 
he has said that he does not agree with what we have said but 
that he will vote for it because the government is doing it 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, and here is where we differ, that the country 
says we need a national sex offender registry.  It can be handled 
within CPIC but it does need legislation to mandate reporting 
systems.  It needs legislation to provide penalties if one does 
not report.  The government says that it is taking care of it in 
CPIC but we are saying that CPIC is missing part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does my colleague think we can influence the government to 
say more than just yes, it is doing it?  How can we actually get 
it to understand the severity of the case and to change it?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what has been the surprising 
is that people will stand up and say that it is covered by CPIC. 
All they have to do is talk to some of the police officers, the 
lawyers and the judges and they will tell them that the 
information is inadequate, that it is out of date and that it is 
just not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need this registry.  We need it to be accurate for sexual 
offenders.  We need to know their addresses and phone numbers. 
The police need to be able to go to them instantly.  Remember 
that this is for the police.  They need to be able to go to the 
offenders instantly if there is an offence in a particular 
jurisdiction.  What this motion is all about is to prevent there 
being more victims.  It will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there will be penalties if offenders do not register 
but those penalties need to be enforced.  Those people must do 
that.  For people to simply wash over it and say that it is 
already there, they must have their heads in the sand if they do 
not listen to what experts are telling them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the debate on the official opposition's supply day 
motion calling on the Liberal government to immediately create a 
national sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating a national sex offender registry is a non-partisan 
issue because it is about the safety and protection of Canadians 
and our children and their futures.  It is about making our 
streets, our neighbourhoods and our communities safer.  I would 
expect the Liberals to not look through the lens of political 
stripes but rather through the lens of issues and to the 
importance of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Canadian Alliance must twist the arm of the 
government.  We did that two weeks ago.  We forced backbench 
Liberal MPs, all Liberal MPs except two, to vote against Liberal 
Party policy.  In red book one the Liberals called for the 
establishment of an independent ethics counsellor.  Because they 
have yet to fulfil that promise, the Canadian Alliance gave the 
Liberals that opportunity two weeks ago, but they voted against 
their own promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the official opposition, not only do we provide effective 
criticism of the government but we also provide alternative 
solutions.  As the official opposition we carry the flashlight 
and very often show the Liberals their darkness.  Sometimes we 
even make them read their own red books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford for 
spearheading the Canadian Alliance supply day motion on the 
creation of a national sex offender registry.  He has been 
working on the issue for quite some time.  I feel that I bring a 
unique perspective to the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election the three-time defeated Liberal candidate 
advocated in Surrey Central that, if elected, he would create a 
national sex offender registry through a private member's bill. 
The Liberal candidate in Surrey Central was already told, 
probably before the election, that a new Liberal government would 
not create a national sex offender registry.  That is why he 
resorted to a private members' bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister admitted that parents have the right to be 
concerned and he virtually confessed to the candidate in Surrey 
Central that he could not stop him from trying to create the 
registry through a private members' bill.  The Prime Minister 
knew that his office and the cabinet do not listen to backbench 
members after an election.  The MPs listen to the Prime 
Minister's office and the party whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister knows that private members' business is a 
weaker tool in the House since all private members' bills are not 
votable.  Very rarely does a private members' bill or motion 
become law.  A private members' bill is like a pacifier given to 
a baby.  It keeps the baby busy and hopeful but nothing comes out 
of it. 
That is how private members' business in the House operates 
because they are not votable.  We keep working hard but very 
rarely does something come out of it.  That was the point the 
Liberal candidate from Surrey Central was trying to make.

joining my colleagues as a member of the official opposition team 
calling for the establishment of something that was promised by 
my opponent in the recent election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sex offender registry would be established and maintained by 
the solicitor general's department.  The registry would contain 
the name, address, date of birth, list of sex offences and any 
other prescribed information about a person convicted of a sex 
offence anywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information to be included in the registry would be collected 
from offenders themselves and from any other source available to 
the minister such as Correctional Service of Canada, the National 
Parole Board, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry would be available only to the minister and police 
forces for the purpose of crime prevention and law enforcement. 
The registry would apply to every person convicted of a sex 
offence or found not criminally responsible for a sex offence on 
account of a mental disorder.  This would include anyone serving 
a sentence for a sex offence on the day the registry comes into 
force and would not apply to young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every offender who resides in Canada would be required to 
register in person at his or her local police station at least 
once a year and provide updated information to be added to the 
registry.  The offender would be required to register within 15 
days of release from custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons convicted of a sex offence that carries a maximum 
sentence of 10 years or less would have to report to police for 
10 years.  Persons convicted of a sex offence with a longer 
sentence would have to report to the police for the rest of their 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any person pardoned for all of their sex offences would be 
relieved of the requirement to report to police and his or her 
record would be deleted from the registry.  Any offender whose 
name appears in the registry may ask to see the information and 
correct it if necessary.  Regulations may be made to limit the 
number of times a person may ask to see such information.  A 
police officer would be able to obtain a warrant for the arrest 
of a person failing to register and report as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If convicted, the offender would face a fine of up to $25,000 
and/or up to a year in prison for the first offence.  A second 
offence would bring a $25,000 fine and/or up to two years less a 
day in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such legislation is long overdue.  One-fifth of all offenders in 
Canada are sex offenders.  One-fourth of the total federal 
incarcerated population is sex offenders.  Out of sex offenders 
under community supervision 14% are on day parole, 31% are on 
full parole and 54% are on statutory release.  They are out in 
the community.  This illustrates the gravity of the situation and 
the importance of passing the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the registries assist police to identify 
suspects and solve sex offences quicker.  In the United Kingdom 
the sex offenders act has been in place since September 1997. The 
province of Ontario has created a provincial registry due to 
government inaction at the federal level.  Other provinces like 
British Columbia and Saskatchewan will also be establishing 
similar registries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national sex offender registry has the support of many groups, 
including the Ontario and Saskatchewan associations of chiefs of 
police, the Canadian Police Association, the Ontario Provincial 
Police and the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime. 
There is widespread support for such a registry.  In Surrey 
Central, Councillor Dianne Watts has collected a large number of 
signatures on a petition which will be tabled in the House later.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is appropriate that we are discussing the 
matter today.  Last week the police arrested a convicted 
pedophile after the man allegedly breached probation in 
Saskatchewan and was applying for jobs at Ontario day care 
centres.  He was caught allegedly shoplifting at a local 
department store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All David Caza's applications were rejected after the day care 
centres did a criminal background check.  We are debating today a 
Canadian Alliance motion to create a national sex offender 
registry which would disable people like David Caza from pursuing 
innocent victims.  The government should give police this new and 
effective tool for crime prevention and law enforcement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is somewhat of a strange day when the opposition motion is such 
that government members all agree with it.  There does not seem 
to be much argument as to whether there should be a so-called 
registry of offences.  The question is whether there should be a 
separate registry of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite think that in some measure the creation of a 
separate registry will protect people and children from dangerous 
pedophiles.  The people in Canada listening need to know there is 
a registry of offenders.  If an hon. member is convicted of a 
criminal code offence it goes into a police registry system.  It 
is called the Canadian Police Information System, or CPIC as it 
has been referred to.  It is a fairly simple system and yet a lot 
of detailed information goes into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if an hon. member is convicted of an assault, that 
information appears along with all relevant information 
pertaining to his or her blood type, fingerprints, last known 
address, age and height, et cetera.  It is a fairly elaborate 
system.  When a police officer or any of his colleagues across 
the country punch the name into the computer they have access to 
that information.  The information on the computer shows what the 
individual has been convicted of.  It also includes sexual 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little hard pressed to know how the opposition motion 
assists the concerns of Canadians that there will be somehow more 
information if we have a separate registry system.  If the 
argument were rephrased in terms of making more information 
available in the CPIC system, it would get even more support from 
members on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set up an additional registry system that would in theory 
require a police officer to look at the CPIC system and then to 
check an additional system does not make a great deal of sense on 
the face of it.  If the argument in the motion is that the 
systems should be merged and that information generated in the 
CPIC system should disclose not only criminal information but 
also information regarding sexual issues, I think all members 
could support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there does not seem to be a great deal of 
consensus among attorneys general across the country on the 
efficacy of a separate system.  From the standpoint of this side 
of the House there does not seem to be any great reason for a 
separate system if attorneys general across the country had 
consensus that the necessary modifications to the CPIC system 
could be set up.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members need to know that information can be forwarded to CPIC 
automatically if a police officer gets information on a new 
address of a convicted pedophile.  That is process rather than a 
legislated information update.  Rather than forcing it, it is 
simply good police practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario there is a strange situation where a sexual assault 
registry has been proposed.  I am hard pressed to understand how 
it works.  If people are convicted of a sexual assault of some 
kind they generally do not go to police stations after the 
completion of their sentences to tell the police where they are 
living.  To have an additional sanction of a $25,000 fine seems 
like a response to an issue, but I respectfully submit it is more 
of an appearance of a response to an issue rather than a 
meaningful response to an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers are generally at the forefront of soliciting 
information pertaining to people who are convicted of sexual 
offences.  When they come in contact with an individual they can 
certainly update the CPIC information so that all police officers 
across the country know of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should also know Bill C-7 was passed in the last 
parliament which closed an anomaly in the pardon system.  Prior 
to the passage of Bill C-7 a convicted individual who had 
completed his or her sentence for a sexual matter could have the 
record sealed and ask for a pardon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament was persuaded this was a loophole and addressed it, 
so that if an individual applies to teach school or participate 
with children in a Boy Scout's activity or something of that 
nature, a criminal record check is now done.  Even if the record 
is sealed the individual is tagged.  A little flag comes up on 
the CPIC system saying that the individual has been convicted of 
some sexual matter.  Then the organization receives the 
information.  That is significant to people who are concerned 
about known pedophiles in individual communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also need to know about subsection 753(1) of the criminal 
code which is generally known as the dangerous offenders 
legislation.  It is an extensive section that was passed to 
address this issue, if not by the last parliament, the one 
before.  Any crown attorney dealing with matters pertaining to 
sentencing can make an application concerning a dangerous 
offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be instructive to read into the record that section of 
the criminal code.  People should know that a crown attorney can 
make an application at any time after a conviction.  Once the 
sentences of individuals are completed their names can be tagged. 
They can be required to report to probation officers and to 
provide updates on their addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code says that the court may find an offender to be 
a long term offender if it is satisfied that there is a 
substantial risk that the offender will reoffend, that there is a 
reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the 
community. 
It then gives a list of sections where this application may be 
made:  section 151, sexual interference; section 152, invitation 
to sexual touching; section 153, sexual exploitation; and section 
271, sexual assault.  It lists all the sections that concern 
Canadians the most about this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crown can make that application and can say that it has 
reason to believe that an individual will reoffend.  That is 
consistent with the testimony that we heard on the justice 
committee, which was that people who are convicted of these kinds 
of offences do reoffend.  Pedophiles do not get over whatever it 
is that affects them and creates the behaviour that they 
participate in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the crown can make the case and if an offender has been 
shown to have a repetitive behaviour of a particular pattern, 
then the crown can order that at the end of the individual's 
sentence, whether it is a five year jail sentence or whatever, 
the individual would have a period of up to 10 years of community 
contact with the probation services.  That is a pretty effective 
way in which the community can be advised of the presence of the 
individual in the community and can then take whatever 
preventative measures are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two fairly significant initiatives in parliament's recent 
past that address the concerns of Canadians in a substantive way. 
The first has to do with tagging people who are making 
applications for pardons.  The second has to do with the creation 
of dangerous offender legislation.  This is a pretty substantive 
intrusion into people's civil liberties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that members opposite have mixed views on the 
rights of the accused.  They argue that there are rights for the 
accused but they want to know where the rights are for the 
victims. Members should bear in mind that all Canadians have 
exactly the same rights.  We are intruding in, on this schedule 
offences, on the notion that an individual has served his or her 
sentence and time to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an example, if I assault an individual and I serve my 
sentence, at the end of five years I will not be categorized as a 
dangerous long term offender.  However, if I sexually assault an 
individual and it is found to be a repetitive behaviour on my 
part, I can be, in effect, on parole for up to 10 years after I 
have served my sentence.  That is a pretty significant change in 
the thinking.  I would support that change because the people for 
whom the legislation concerns are people who simply do not get 
over whatever it is that they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know that when the opposition members raise 
the issue of a separate sexual offence registry, it is in the 
context of these two fairly significant initiatives on the part 
of previous parliaments, namely, the pardon issue and the 
dangerous offender issue.  Those are two very significant issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we have a better system if we created a separate sexual 
offence registry?  I submit that is a dubious proposition at 
best.  We may have some rather bizarre anomalies where an 
individual may show up in the one registry as having been 
convicted of a sexual offence of some kind, but the other 
registry would have all the material pertaining to the fact that 
the person had been charged and convicted with attempted murder 
or a variety of assaults, et cetera.  It seems somewhat strange 
that we should be arguing about whether we should have two 
registries or one registry.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the argument is simply that the current system be updated, I 
do not think that is difficult.  If the argument is that the 
current system is inadequate in some respect, again I do not 
think that is difficult.  We are into arguments about 
technicalities.  If the argument is about whether the police 
communicates properly with their communities or whether there are 
dangerous offenders released into the community, I think we can 
talk about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Etobicoke North made a rather significant 
point, that at some time all offenders end up back on the street. 
At one point or another every convicted criminal ends up back on 
the street somehow or other.  We could say that we will lock 
these people away forever.  That does not work, so the question 
is:  Can we stage it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we create with these kinds of debates an hostile atmosphere 
toward the release of these individuals back into the community, 
we have the ironical issue of creating the very conditions we 
wish to resolve.  It is a bit strange.  If we are not careful 
about what we are saying we are in fact creating conditions which 
will make hostile the release of any individual into the 
community.  Therefore we marginalize the individual and the more 
we marginalize the individual we have the ironical impact of the 
individual repeating his or her behaviour.  In effect, in some 
bizarre fashion we create more difficulties than intended.  A bit 
of Murphy's law applies here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the issues of significance to Canadians.  Canadians 
legitimately are concerned that there are people in their 
communities they should know about.  I believe, with the greatest 
respect to colleagues opposite, that we are not debating whether 
the information is not available.  The question is whether the 
information should be formatted within the greater CPIC system or 
whether it should be formatted in a separate registry altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not merely a criminal justice issue. It is as much a 
social justice issue as anything.  All criminal behaviour occurs 
in a social context.  I hope that members concerned about 
amending the criminal code regarding dangerous pedophiles would 
also be supportive of initiatives on the part of Correctional 
Service Canada and of provincial governments that in fact create 
conditions which prevent that behaviour.  My concern is that if 
we hit from the left and hit from the right we see these 
initiatives not merely in the context of criminal justice but in 
the context of social justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today marks the 12th anniversary of 
the first election to parliament of a special friend of mine.  On 
March 13, 1989, she won a byelection in the riding of Beaver 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those lonely days in Ottawa she kept the faith alive for 
a new political movement.  She acted as a leader and encourager 
of the Reform Party as that party grew and eventually became the 
official opposition.  She played key roles throughout the united 
alternative process which led to the Canadian Alliance and in the 
election in November, which saw an increase of 750,000 votes and 
an increase to 66 seats while other opposition parties decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her intelligence, her quick wit and her many skills have made 
her shine in whatever role she has played, whether as caucus 
chair, deputy leader or even as leader of the official 
opposition.  She is living evidence that someone can be 
principled and authentic and still succeed in public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her private life is also an example.  During her years as a 
schoolteacher she opened her home as a foster parent to several 
aboriginal children.  She is a hard worker and a loyal and loving 
friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great affection and respect that I say happy 12th 
anniversary and congratulations to the hon. member.

keeping with the government's priority of helping the homeless, 
the Metro Non-Profit Housing Association will open a new housing 
facility in Halifax with the help of nearly $1.6 million from the 
Government of Canada and the province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to accommodating 18 residents and a live in staff 
person, this facility will provide a base for the association's 
work.  Its community support team will provide advocacy and 
support for homeless people with complex mental, physical and 
social needs.  It will work to help them become part of a 
supportive, healthy community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal funding for this project is part of the $753 million 
the Government of Canada has committed to combating homelessness 
from coast to coast to coast.  It is money well spent.  It is a 
sound investment.

Mr. Speaker, once again yesterday the new Premier of Quebec

Quebec.   Nothing could be further from the truth, as he well

Mr. Speaker, the minister of agriculture's announcement of only 
$14.1 million of new money for struggling P.E.I. potato farmers 
falls far short of a meaningful level of disaster relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An immediate influx of over $40 million was requested to go with 
the approximately $15 million the P.E.I. government had already 
contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis over potato wart has left farmers with no option but 
to destroy millions of tonnes of potatoes due to the questionable 
U.S. ban based on a fear of potato wart found in only 24 
potatoes.  The ban continues and P.E.I. has absorbed the loss for 
the entire country, a sacrifice that has devastated Island 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CFIP is a flawed formula that will not help most producers. 
Fifty-three per cent of the Island agriculture industry is potato 
farming and farmers face a 60% drop in net income this year, a 
$30 million loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general and Liberal MPs from P.E.I. have failed 
Islanders.  They did not impress upon the cabinet the urgency of 
this crisis.  They did not deliver to farmers in their time of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
March is learning disabilities month in Canada and the theme for 
this year's public awareness campaign is “Early Help Means Early 
Success”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 100,000 Ontario children are identified as having learning 
disabilities.  As we all know, learning disabilities are not 
merely an educational issue.  They impact on all aspects of a 
person's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research has shown that by identifying a child at risk as early 
as senior kindergarten and providing the appropriate help at that 
moment in time, the need for more lengthy interventions at a 
later date is greatly reduced.  It helps prevent emotional and 
behavioural problems later in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to raise awareness of 
learning disabilities in their communities and to foster the 
understanding that people with learning disabilities are 
competent individuals who sometimes have to do things differently 
to succeed in life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that farmers believe that the minister does not and 
will not acknowledge that there is a crisis.  In fact, $500 
million is insufficient for the crisis at hand. Farmers have 
asked me to stand here to ask where the other $500 million is. 
Also, today the Prince Edward Island Potato Board is stating that 
the assistance announced today was too little, too late. 
Something has to be done for agriculture across the country.

Mr. Speaker, I think it is hardly appropriate to characterize as 
a dog and pony show a review which has not even been announced 
yet, but I can assure the hon. member that in the course of the 
last couple of years we have had a number of concerns expressed 
about the issue of diversity of Canadian voices, both on 
television and through the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure in our review of CRTC policies that we make 
more space for more Canadian voices.  That is the objective that 
we are underscoring, which I hope is supported by all political

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question to the Prime Minister is about the panel of experts 
the government decided to set up to investigate corporate 
concentration after the Asper affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the government in the Senate stated yesterday that 
she would be partial to a Senate committee study of this issue 
instead of a panel.  I wonder if she was speaking for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, will the Prime Minister bring the proposed terms 
of reference of any review to the House for advice and full 
debate prior to deciding the mandate or the membership of any 
review or panel? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the original discussion of the panel predates the 
hon. member's question by about 12 months, so we can hardly be 
accused of creating this process to meet a problem that he claims 
occurred this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that as a result of our concerns we undertook to 
have a number of reviews done by a number of experts.  They have 
been taking the course over the last number of months.  There 
have been seven studies sought by independent experts.  Six have 
been completed and we are awaiting the seventh.  When that study 
is in, we will move forthwith with the panel which can focus on 
these very important issues for the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
so much for parliament.  The Prime Minister claims that he sold 
his golf club shares to Jonas Prince in 1993, yet the 1994 
declaration of registration of 161341 Canada Inc. with the 
government of Quebec does not show Jonas Prince or any of his 
companies as a shareholder.  Nor do six subsequent annual 
declarations.  Why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister now table a copy of the agreement 
respecting the golf club shares so Canadians can know if this was 
about a sale or simply about an option to purchase?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us go through this again.  In April 1999 the 
RCMP took photos, commonly called evidence, of Gaetano Amodeo 
meeting with Nick Rizutto, a Montreal mob boss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP knew he was considered armed and dangerous.  In fact it 
had an arrest warrant.  I would like to ask the person who really 
should know, the solicitor general, why he was not arrested at 
the time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the important thing to remember is that 
we had a fugitive fleeing the law.  Because of the RCMP gathering 
the evidence and with the co-operation of Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada, the man is now arrested, in jail and going 
before a deportation hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely my hon. colleague does not want me personally to handle 
RCMP investigations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are getting somewhere.  We have a fugitive who 
was fleeing the law.  That is right.  We have evidence.  We have 
photos of his meeting with a Montreal mob boss.  We have a 
warrant that the police had for two long years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the solicitor general explain how it is that an organized 
crime hitman who had a Canadian arrest warrant out for him for 
two years, who was wanted in Italy and wanted in Germany, is not 
only not arrested but fully expects to become a Canadian citizen? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hypothesis of the question is 
complete nonsense.  The individual is not an immigrant to Canada. 
He was refused status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, what the member opposite is suggesting, if I hear 
correctly, is that without any evidence, without any warrant, we 
should pick up people off the streets and deport them.  That is a 
police state and that is not what Canada is all about.

<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the Amodeo 
affair, the solicitor general claims not to have been informed. 
He did not notify the minister because he himself had not been 
informed.  Yes, but the Minister of Justice had been informed. 
In fact, the Italian government had sent a request for 
extradition to the Canadian Department of Justice as long ago as 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Minister of Justice, who had been informed, not have 
the professional conscience to notify her colleague in 
immigration?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

aware, any extradition request is in the form of a state to state 
communication.  Those communications are confidential and it 
would be inappropriate for me to comment on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However let me say that we do know, because the Italian embassy 
has reported to the media, that an extradition request was made. 
I also want to inform the House that at no time was any court 
file opened in this country in relation to the extradition of Mr. 
Amodeo.

Justice who knows but does not tell her Cabinet colleague.  As 
far as I know, they are all supposed to have taken the same 
oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of people do we have governing us?  Who is responsible

that is not the way the system works in this country. Politicians

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  That 
is pretty clear, Mr. Speaker.  Yesterday the Deputy Prime

terrorist Ahmed Ressam years ago was because Canada does not 
deport to his homeland of Algeria.  It is part of its tolerance 
for terrorists policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we let him roam free in our country, take out a phoney 
Canadian passport and travel back and forth to a terrorist 
training camp in Afghanistan where he learned to make bombs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

a case that is before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an individual who was arrested.  Surely he would not 
expect us to give a play by play of what is happening in a court

of that trial. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

explanation of how our security can be so lax at the borders that 
these sorts of people can come in undetected and jeopardize the 
lives of Canadians and the reputation of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former CSIS director, Reid Morden, has said that as a result of 
this incident Canada has been exposed as a haven for terrorists. 
There are anti-terrorism laws in other countries like the U.S.

Why is Canada refused to bring in that kind of legislation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

experienced.  Last year 65,000 people were stopped.  Some 7,200 
of them were stopped because of criminal concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have evidence, our frontline people can refuse admission

the extradition request because it was part of a confidential 
state to state communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I to understand that Mr. Amodeo could thus have become a 
Canadian citizen with the assistance of Immigration Canada 
because the minister and the department were apparently not told 
of the extradition request from Italy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that in fact what she is now telling us?  Would the 
confidentiality behind which she is taking cover have allowed 
this gentleman to become a Canadian citizen?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

can the Government of Canada receive an extradition request and 
the Minister of Justice not inform the Minister of Citizenship

</I></B></P><P align=left>During this time, court proceedings may have been under way 
because, up until June 1999—and the RCMP knew this because the 
extradition request was made in September 1999—Mr. Amodeo was 
still on the list of those applying for citizenship or permanent

giving $1.6 billion, the highest amount since 1995.  When the

more producers before the spring of this year, before planting.

to support farmers.  We have increased that a tremendous amount. 
I will not go over the figures again.  Obviously the hon. member

generator is scheduled to be shut down in four years.  Even if

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting here is that the government and the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans have mismanaged the fishery on 
both the east and west coasts.  Now they have had to move inland 
to landlocked Alberta to ply their trade. In fact, 70 DFO 
officials have been transferred to Alberta.  Heaven help us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister of fisheries, or maybe the

better than negotiating with the Alberta government in a

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order arising out of today's 
question period.  There was an announcement made by the minister 
of agriculture on a very important issue involving a package of 
aid to Prince Edward Island potato farmers.  This was essentially 
a duplication of effort since the announcement had already been 
made at the press gallery earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a practice that the government has undertaken time and 
time again.  It has been put on record that the government House 
leader intends to address the situation and remedy it, but it has 
not happened yet.  In fact, the minister responsible for amateur 
sport similarly chose question period as the forum to make his 
ministerial announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker would be well aware that there is a place in time to 
do so.  There is a designated period during routine business in 
which a minister of the crown can rise to make an announcement, 
honour the House with his or her presence, and display an 
important respect for the Chamber in making these announcements 
through the Chamber to the Canadian people. Instead the 
government repeatedly, for reasons that cannot be explained, 
chooses to honour the media as its forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with the greatest respect that the media will be here.  If 
there are important announcements that are to be made and relayed 
to the Canadian people, it can be done more effectively and 
purposefully through the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his efforts to modernize and to put more relevance and 
importance in the Chamber, the government House leader mouths 
those words. 
Yet the evidence is clear.  The government chooses to use the 
press gallery rather than the Parliament of Canada to make these 
important announcements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like some direction from the Chair because this is 
becoming a repeated problem.  I respectfully suggest that it 
further undermines the importance of the Chamber, it adds to this 
level of cynicism and marginalizes us again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Chair to send at least some admonition of this 
practice so that the government will heed these words, respect 
the Chamber and put greater emphasis on this practice of making 
announcements outside the Chamber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first, I want to thank the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the House leader of the 
Conservative Party, for raising the matter.  I was of a mind to 
raise it myself because today we have had a couple examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was thinking particularly of the announcement made by the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  This is the kind of 
announcement that at one time would have been made in the House, 
at all times should be made in the House and today should have 
been made in the House so that members of the opposition could 
have had a chance to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that this is nothing new.  It has been a growing 
problem but it is new to this extent.  There was a time when 
governments would make much more use of the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the talk coming from the government about 
parliamentary reform, it would seem to me that one of the ways in 
which opposition members can be inspired to think that the talk 
about parliamentary reform and restoring dignity to parliament 
and to this Chamber is serious, is for the government to prevail 
upon its colleagues and cabinet ministers to not do this sort of 
thing, but come into the House and make announcements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the place where decisions are made.  This is the place 
where announcements are made.  This is the place where the 
nation's business is supposed to go on, not over in the press 
gallery.  That is why we have these things up here, so the press 
can come in and see what is going on, not so we can be somewhere 
else while the business of the nation is being conducted in the 
press gallery.  It just shows a contempt for this place and 
undermines everything the government might say about 
parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember responding to ministerial statements.  I am 
sitting beside a former prime minister.  When he was the minister 
of External Affairs, I was his critic.  I will give him the 
credit because he used to make many government policy statements 
in the House.  That was not true of all his cabinet colleagues. 
It was during that time that others started to do what this 
government now does as a matter of routine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get back to taking the House seriously.  That is what 
we are here for.  As long as we have a situation where anything 
that is really important gets announced somewhere else, and 
anything that is really important legislatively cannot be debated 
for more than a day and a half, then what the heck is the point 
of being here if the government is going to treat this place they 
way the are treating it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like just to agree briefly with the hon. members 
who have just spoken.  I would ask the Speaker to check back on 
Speaker Parent's ruling in the start of the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was confronted with the same sort of a problem where the 
government consistently made announcements outside this place 
instead of using ministerial statements.  Speaker Parent at that 
time said he was disturbed by the trend.  He urged the government 
to change its policy and to start treating the House with the 
respect it deserved.  The error, if I can say, was not in the 
ruling of Speaker Parent.  The error was in the lack of 
follow-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was that although the Speaker chastized the 
government for what was done, and although many people on the 
government side kind of nodded that they should do that, nothing 
changed.  The Speaker did not intervene at successive times to 
say that he had enough and that he wanted this place treated with 
the respect it deserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to review the ruling of Speaker Parent 
where he urged the government to change its ways.  I urge you to 
do the same, only this time say that there will be follow-up on 
it, that there will be teeth to your ruling, that you will not 
only agree with the suggestions of the opposition parties, but 
that you insist that the House be treated with respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even earlier today we could take our pick of subjects.  I 
listened to the Minister of Canadian Heritage talk about a blue 
ribbon panel that she was going to strike to talk about the 
future of the CRTC. 
What is going on?  There is a blue ribbon panel, chosen by the 
minister, with people who she is comfortable with.  The decision 
is probably already cooked up and made, instead of referring the 
future of broadcasting in Canada to a parliamentary committee 
where it should be discussed and debated by parliamentarians.

members of parliament.  It does it by fiat.  It is time that the 
government change that.  No wonder its own backbenchers cannot

I do not wish to prolong this debate, but still I would like to 
join my colleagues in saying how damaging this practice is for 
the institution of which we are a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, we are seeing the public lose interest in 
politics, a trend about which, unfortunately, it appears nothing 
can be done. 
We are seeing a growing cynicism with respect to political 
institutions, and this chamber in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that one explanation for such an attitude on the part of 
the public is the cynicism shown by the government when it 
trivializes this institution as it does when it makes 
announcements outside the House that have a direct impact on the 
conduct of the government's affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Chair to give very serious thought to this matter, 
which has quite rightly been submitted to it by the member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

briefly to this debate.  As you know, Standing Order 33 refers to 
the fact that the government may make short factual announcements 
or statements in the House under the provision of that particular 
standing order.  That does not say that government announcements 
of any kind must be made in the House, although I agree that more 
announcements should be made on the floor of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are successful in undertaking a program of reviewing our 
standing orders, together with colleagues of other parties, I 
certainly would be willing to do my share to ensure that we 
increase the number of announcements that are made on the floor

</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I am sure the Chair has probably already 
thought of this because it cuts both ways.  Today we are debating 
an opposition motion on a very important subject.  I learned of 
this opposition motion because a press conference was held.  It 
was not because the motion was tabled on the order paper or that 
it was made aware to the House in any other way.  It was because 
a press conference was called in the same room where it is now 
denounced that the cabinet minister made his announcement several 
days before the debate even took place in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, although I agree in principle with what is said, it 
is not something that applies only unidimensional in this place. 
The amount of usage of the facility of this place to make things 
known, if it is to increase, and I am one of those who thinks it 
should, it has to increase on all sides of the House. Calling 
press conferences about a private member's bill not yet released 
on the floor of the House and making it available to the public 
when a government bill for instance cannot even get that 
treatment right now, is not something that I particularly enjoy 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It works both ways.  I am willing to do my share should we be 
able to get that committee started.  I hope hon. members from 
other political parties will go at it with the same attitude to 
see what we can do to increase those kinds of statements, 
announcements, motions being introduced and so on on the floor of 
the House as opposed to elsewhere first. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think the Chair has heard enough on 
this point to be able to bring the matter to a conclusion.  I 
appreciate the intervention of all hon. members on this very 
important point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough began his 
remarks, I thought he would quote me on this point, because I 
clearly remember raising the same point from time to time in the 
House when I was in opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having done so, I have to say that the points of order I raised 
at that time were unsuccessful, as his are today, because there 
is now a series of precedents that in my view are quite binding 
on the Chair on this point.  I refer all hon. members to that 
wonderful work, Marleau and Montpetit, at page 379.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Minister is under no obligation to make a statement in the 
House.  The decision of a Minister to make an announcement 
outside of the House instead of making a statement in the House 
during Routine Proceedings has been raised as a question of 
privilege, but the Chair has consistently found there to be no 
grounds to support a claim that any privilege has been breached. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The learned authors of this work cite a series of examples 
starting in the <I>Debates</I> of November 1, 1974, and in March 
2, 1977, February 17, 1978, February 8, 1982, December 2, 1985, 
October 4, 1989, February 18, 1998, and December 3, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all hon. members interested in this point to look 
at these precedents that are referred to in footnote 145 on page 
379 of Marleau and Montpetit, to examine the words that were used 
then and to examine the rulings of the Chair in each case.  I am 
afraid I have to agree with those rulings, however reluctantly 
today, having made, as I say, the same argument myself when I sat 
in a position similar to that of the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I think the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona and I probably argued the same point at one 
time as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very sympathetic to the point raised and I think the 
government House leader has shown some sympathy, but I hope that 
in discussions between the parties suitable arrangements can be 
made.  Those are beyond the control of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all hon. members for their interventions on this point.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
I may, I will make a final point with respect to the DNA registry 
which was created in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know that in the last parliament there was a 
DNA registry created.  DNA can be obtained by two methods.  One 
is under section 487.05, which has an ex parte application. 
Canadians need to know that when an ex parte application is made 
by a police officer to a judge or by a crown attorney to a judge, 
he or she has to be satisfied that it is in the best interests of 
the administration of justice to issue a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes to a schedule of offences for which a warrant can 
be issued for a DNA analysis.  They include a number of the 
offences that members opposite are most interested in with 
respect to their motion, namely:  section 151, sexual 
interference; section 152, sexual touching; section 272, sexual 
assault with a weapon, et cetera.  There is an ability on the 
part of the police and the crown to get evidence of a DNA nature 
available to them in order for them to be able to compare their 
crime scene index with the analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament we also passed a bill which is in some 
respects quite radical and to my knowledge has not been tested 
before the courts at this point but likely will be, and that is 
the ability on the part of the crown to obtain DNA from people 
who are convicted and not necessarily make the linkage between 
one crime scene index and another.  This would apply to people 
under section 487.055, before the coming into force.  Before 
the coming into force of this section, one may make an ex parte 
application for someone who has committed a murder, more than one 
murder at different times, or who before the coming into force of 
this subsection is convicted of more than one sexual offence 
within the meaning of subsection 487.05(3).

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of applications that members opposite are 
most interested in.  They give the police a tremendous tool to 
compare what they have on their crime scene index with a 
convicted pedophile.  They can compare those two and in fact link 
individuals in prison with DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the past parliament passed Bill C-7, which tags 
pedophiles for pardon applications.  Bill C-753 is a long term 
offender designation so that people who are convicted of these 
kinds of crimes can be required to report for up to 10 years 
after they have served their sentences.  There is also the DNA 
section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite supportive of the motion and if it means that the 
registry needs to be expanded or the computer system needs to be 
upgraded, I cannot see how I would mount any argument against the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the comments of the member opposite. 
I think we are getting closer to an understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that with an upgrade of the 30 year old 
CPIC system it is possible to integrate it with a sex offender 
registry.  I hope that is the intent of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a couple of things are missing.  For a sex offender 
registry to be current it is necessary to have an obligation on 
behalf of the offender to report all changes where they occur, at 
the time they occur and to reconfirm at least once a year. That 
puts the onus on the individual to keep the system upgraded. That 
is what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association said very recently that CPIC 
does not provide police agencies with adequate information and 
notification concerning the release or arrival of sex offenders 
into their communities.  That is what we have been talking about 
all day.  The difficulty we are having on this side is that 
government members are saying they agree with the sex offender 
registry, as I think we all do, but they are saying that what is, 
is okay.  However, the rest of the country is saying that what 
is, is not okay, including the police, who ought to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague how on earth it is possible to 
just plain use what is currently in CPIC without the mandate for 
the offender showing up in person to update the record and for 
providing a penalty if the offender does not.  Let us not debate 
about what the penalty is.  However, there must be a penalty if 
the offender does not show up.  That is how we get the mandate. I 
would like the hon. member to answer that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that we are 
changing the focus of the debate.  The initial debate as I had 
understood it was that the opposition wished to have the 
government create a separate offender registry for sexual 
offences.  Now the debate seems to be focusing on whether an 
individual can be forced to report his or her whereabouts on a 
certain schedule of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I cannot argue with that point, except that I would 
then ask the member opposite if it is more important that a 
community have sex offenders report to a registry or would one 
include additional criminal code offences as well, such as murder 
or manslaughter.  If the member still wishes to limit it to a 
certain schedule of sexual offences, I would like to know why 
those offences are of more critical importance to the community 
than the knowledge with respect to other kinds of criminal code 
offences.  I am happy to debate that point, but I think that is 
the essence of it.  If we are going to open it up for these kinds 
of offences, why not for all other criminal code offences as 
well?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, certainly this would be an issue where we would want 
to examine the very point the member makes:  the protection of 
our children and the protection of our communities.  That is the 
point we are attempting to make in the House today.  Perhaps that 
is lost on my colleague.  I do not expect it is, because he is a 
knowledgeable individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to ask him a very direct question.  Will he support 
this motion, and not only that, will he also, in his capacity and 
his influence with the government, move forward to ensure that 
legislation is put in place which will be put into effect to 
implement this registry?  Rather than simply saying yes, the 
government agrees with the motion, will he take the steps 
necessary within his own group to move this forward and put it in 
place as legislation in order to protect our children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I have spoken for 
the last 20 minutes in support of the generalized motion.  What 
the hon. member is asking is how to get down to the specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that the index would have to be expanded. If it is 
within the context of CPIC, then I cannot see what the argument 
is.  If in fact we get the co-operation of all police forces and 
all attorneys general, then I cannot see what the argument is. If 
in fact there is a funding formula that would be available to 
this kind of issue, then I cannot see what the argument is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see some debate as to why it would be this kind of set of 
convictions as opposed to a more expanded set of convictions. 
That is somewhat more problematic, because we are running into 
the fundamental principle of law that once someone has served a 
sentence he or she has paid their debt to society and it is over 
with.  If we can get past that intellectual point, then I can see 
how members on this side could actually be much more aggressive 
in their support of the motion that is put forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what we are hearing today from the 
hon. member across the way is just absolutely unbelievable.  He 
is suggesting that we should get concurrence from all the 
attorneys general and all the police forces across the country—I 
do not know whether he is going to take the time to ask every 
single police dog what it thinks too—before the government gets 
off its hind end and actually thinks about passing some 
legislation to protect our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It absolutely confounds me that the government has no problem 
imposing upon every legal law abiding gun owner in the country 
that he or she must register their firearm.  When that was 
brought forward it was supposedly because if one life was saved 
it would be worth the hundreds of millions of dollars it would 
cost, worth all the inconvenience it would impose and worth the 
attack on the privacy of our citizens.  The government said it 
was fine if it saved one life, but when it comes to bringing 
forward meaningful legislation to initiate a sexual predator 
registry, suddenly we have to get all the provinces, all the 
police forces and everybody else in line.  That did not seem to 
be a problem when it imposed upon the provinces the so called 
national firearms registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the government can pick and choose?  It can bring 
in something very quickly when it wants to, like the registration 
for firearms, but it has to have everybody singing from the same 
song sheet when it comes to something as fundamental as 
protecting the lives and welfare of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a certain irony in 
the hon. member's question, because in certain arguments the hon. 
member wishes to argue that our indexes and registry systems do 
not work, that they are too expensive and that they do not catch 
any criminals anyway, but for this kind of registry, it is not 
expensive, it is protection and it is a good initiative in 
criminal law.  I must admit that it does strike me as a somewhat 
ironic argument from the opposite side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the administration of justice is a joint 
responsibility between the provinces and territories and the 
federal government.  Frankly, if there is no consensus among the 
attorneys general and the police forces with respect to this 
issue, then I would respectfully submit that we are wasting our 
time.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the police to be supportive of this initiative. At 
least the Canadian Police Association is supportive.  I assume 
the chiefs are supportive.  I assume that many of the 
municipalities are supportive.  I assume that a number of the 
attorneys general are supportive.  If all those people are 
prepared to be co-operative in this initiative then I cannot see 
why the Government of Canada would not be similarly co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate the point that if there is that high level of 
co-operation among all the participants in the system, then I 
cannot see why we would not update and upgrade the CPIC system to 
do what the hon. members have in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B> Mr. Speaker, again I cannot understand where the 
hon. member is coming from.  He says that it is ironic that the 
Canadian Alliance questions a registration system that imposes 
upon law-abiding citizens the need to register their firearms, 
but we do not impose the need for convicted pedophiles and sexual 
predators to register when they move into a community.  Can he 
not see the difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a mixing 
of apples and oranges in the hon. member's mind.  Where there is 
an efficacy that can be established in the creation of the index, 
then I do not know why we would oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To stay with the debate, the issue is:  Would this be a useful 
police initiative?  Would it be a useful initiative on the part 
of the Government of Canada?  Obviously, from our side, we think 
the motion is supportable.  We are into the how's rather than the 
principle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege and a pleasure for me to stand and 
speak in support of establishing a national sex offender 
registry.  I do so today in memory of Christopher Stephenson, an 
11 year old Toronto boy who was abducted, raped and murdered by a 
repeat sex offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Fredericks had a long history of assaulting children.  He 
spent most of his life in psychiatric institutions. He was on 
mandatory supervision when Christopher was killed.  I fully 
recognize that in this particular case a registry may not have 
prevented this sadistic killer from committing such a horrific 
act.  However, as many have argued here today, it may have 
prevented him from killing the young boy.  It may have allowed 
police officers to find and incarcerate Fredericks before 
Christopher's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted in many of the speeches already presented by my 
colleagues, we are proposing to establish a registry that would 
contain the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders. Every 
offender would be required to register in person at his or her 
local police station at least once a year.  During that time they 
would be required to provide any updated information that the 
police force may ask for in order to combat sex offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As already mentioned today, a number of provincial jurisdictions 
have established this registry already.  In the case of Ontario, 
Christopher's law, or Bill C-31, received royal assent in April 
2000.  It established a registry that aims to ensure the safety 
and security of all persons in that province by providing the 
information and investigative tools required to prevent and solve 
crimes of a sexual nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding further, I would like to caution members on 
the other side of the House, particularly those who were here in 
or prior to 1993, to carefully consider their position on the 
motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I issue such a warning because I have a copy of an April 1993 
document titled “A Liberal Perspective on Crime and Justice 
Issues”.  Contained within that document are a number of 
recommendations put forward by the then official opposition, one 
being to “combat Canada's growing violent crime problem.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Liberal Party that while it was in opposition it 
recognized and realized there was a growing violent crime 
problem.  That problem is still here today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations that was put forward appears on page 
7 of the Liberal document:  “to support the establishment of a 
national registry of convicted child abusers”.  The rationale 
for the recommendation was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex offenders represent almost 20 per cent of the incarcerated 
population and 10 per cent of the conditionally released 
population.  These numbers are not an accurate representation as 
they include only those sentenced to two years or more in prison. 
Actual figures are much higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years there has been a 20.4 per cent increase 
in the rate of admission of sex offences.  Evidently more and 
more sex offenders will be reintegrating into Canadian 
communities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal's own findings went on to reveal: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeat sex offenders are more than twice as likely to commit 
further sex offences, much more likely to violate conditional 
release conditions and more likely than any other offenders to 
reoffend with a non-sexual offence.  However, treatment programs 
for sexual offenders are sorely lacking. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When referring to the Tory government at the time the document 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is spending approximately $98 million a 
year to incarcerate sex offenders and only $2 million a year on 
treatment programs to rehabilitate them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the norm, when it should be the exception, that convicted 
sexual offenders return to communities without any counselling or 
rehabilitation therapy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not often agree with the Liberal Party, but I certainly 
agree with its findings in this instance.   Most of my colleagues 
and I agree with the information that was given out by the 
Liberal Party in 1993 to support its own recommendation for a 
national registry of convicted child abusers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal's information is fully supported by a number of good 
studies which repeatedly indicate that sex offenders have one of 
the highest recidivism rates of any criminal group, with an 
estimated 40% reoffending within five years of release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, research indicates that offender treatment programs 
have shown limited results.  Practitioners in the field of sex 
offender treatment never claim to cure sex offenders, but rather 
they claim to manage the risk of reoffending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed over the last eight years?  What has changed 
since the Liberals produced this great document on growth and 
violent crime?  What is it that has so adamantly changed their 
minds that they have not implemented the program they wished to 
implement in 1993?  Why have they not established this registry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moderately more money is being spent on treatment programs. 
According to the CSC's most recent figures, approximately $150 
million is spent to incarcerate offenders and a little over $8 
million is spent on treatment.  That is a slight improvement over 
the figures released by the Liberals when the Tories were in 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all sex offenders are fully completing the courses, the 
necessary plans that are prescribed by the CSC officials, because 
treatment is not compulsory.  When they are incarcerated it is 
not compulsory that they undergo rehabilitation programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only surmise that it must be amnesia.  Perhaps the Liberal 
Party is growing old or perhaps it is strictly amnesia that is 
causing it to forget about the recommendations or promises it 
once so believed in, or claimed to believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government forgot the recommendation to support a 
registry just like it forgot the recommendation to scrap the GST, 
just like it forgot the recommendation to forget free trade, just 
like it forgot the recommendation to have an ethics counsellor 
who reported directly to parliament.  We have a very forgetful 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better illustrate the need for a national registry I will 
read some excerpts from an article that appeared in the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I> a number of years ago.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pedophile named Martin Dubuc was convicted...for offences 
against children—again.  This is the same Martin Dubuc who, as a 
boys' hockey coach in Laval, was convicted in 1986 for molesting 
team members, the same creep who, after his release from prison, 
did not let a lifetime ban on coaching in Quebec stop him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He simply changed locales, becoming a coach and eventually 
president of the Minor Hockey Association of Southwest Montreal. 
But that neglect by the recreation establishment is an old 
scandal.  The new scandal involves the schools.  It came to light 
last week when Dubuc pleaded guilty to using the telephone to 
threaten several boys aged 10 to 13 and to incite them to touch 
themselves sexually.  Somehow, he had slithered his way into 
elementary schools as a substitute teacher.  And this was not a 
slip-up by just one organization.  In recent years, three 
different school boards in the Montreal area had hired Dubuc.

slip-up by simply one organization.  It was a slip up by many 
organizations.  One of those organizations was the Liberal 
organization across the way.  One of them was the Liberal 
government because it failed to establish the national registry 
that it had once recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I call upon members sitting opposite to honour their 
past promises.  It is better to be late than never.  Sexual 
criminal offences are all about control and power.  For the sake 
of our children, let us take control away from the offender and 
give it back to our police forces, back to those who would fight 
crime.  For the sake of our children, let us protect society and 
let us begin now with a national sex offender program and 
registry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague.  He is 
certainly right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the well known rat pack and the well known 
fighters for crime back in the good old days when the Liberals 
were in opposition have totally gone by the wayside in terms of 
the information they were trying to bring forward in this place 
to tighten the laws that protect our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they seem to have a short memory about what they intended to 
do.  They have forgotten the vigorousness they put into proposing 
their solutions to the government of the day, the Conservatives, 
about what they would do.  Now they have totally backed down. 
That is not a surprise.  After being here seven years I see that 
going on all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned that we have a major issue here where a 
number of offenders are getting very short sentences.  Our 
justice system is not doing a service to a lot of people when it 
comes to sentencing.  These offenders are in for a short time so 
we know they will come out.  They will come out in huge numbers 
because, as my colleague said, about 20% to 25% of those 
incarcerated are sex offenders.  It could even be higher than 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that the justice system treats 
offences lightly and that the justice system believes in plea 
bargaining, such as with Karla Homolka who will be released one 
day soon because of plea bargaining?  It has been stated numerous 
times that she will kill and offend again.  These kinds of 
indicators are one of the greatest reasons we should have this 
registry in place?  The government should be sitting here in 
droves to fight for the children of the country instead of the 
piddly few we see here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member beside me for such a good question.  It boils down to 
this:  Do we want to fight crime or do we want to deal with the 
effects of crime?  Do we want to put in place what the police 
forces are asking for?  They are asking for a registry that would 
not only be a record of the case or of the conviction of an 
offender but a record that would allow them to know where the 
offenders were so they could prevent it from happening again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want more than record keeping.  We want a tool put in place 
to help us fight crime.  As we learned in question period today, 
people on the most wanted list are in Canada.  They have been 
here for two years.  The government does not seem anxious about 
this until these individuals are forced to leave.  Then two years 
later it will deal with the crime and say that at least the 
individuals did not commit anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal document that I received this morning deals with the 
need to fight pornography at the root and not allow it to go the 
next step.  The document states that there should be a registry 
available to groups who would hire people who work with children. 
It goes on to talk about pornography and making it illegal to 
possess it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have sat passively by watching the courts rule on 
decisions.  The government has had no will to fight crime but 
there has been a will to rehabilitate and reintegrate.  One of my 
greatest concerns is that we are now compromising on that.  That 
is exactly what this member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now saying that not only are we not going to fight crime 
by giving police officers the ability to know where these 
individuals are, but we are going to lower the amount of time 
they are incarcerated.  We are not going to make it compulsory 
for these individuals go through education programs while 
incarcerated.  This is an injustice to our society and to our 
children.  It is time we stand up for the sake of our children 
and our grandchildren. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, the Saturday headline in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> said it all “Pedophile back in jail for the 
fourth time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally after four convictions one sex offender has been 
required by the courts to tell police where he lives after he has 
been released from jail.  A sex offender registry for one 
pedophile.  What about the thousands of sex offenders who are on 
the loose and the police do not know where they live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Calgary <I>Sun</I> headline screamed “Attack Stuns 
Community; Cops Launch Manhunt for Pedophile”.  The newspaper 
reported that the assault took place Sunday night when a male 
armed with a knife rang the doorbell and forced his way into the 
house after the 14 year old babysitter answered the door.  The 
pedophile locked the babysitter in the bathroom and then 
proceeded to sexually assault two sisters, aged 6 and 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outraged Calgary parent Carrie Kohan said “What happened Sunday 
was the last straw”.  She organized a rally last Friday to 
demand tougher first time penalties for child abuse and a 
national registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the police were able to arrest the sex offender in 
this case within a few days.  How much faster would they have 
apprehended this sicko if they had a registry of sex offenders 
residing in the city of Calgary?  Would a sex offender registry 
have prevented this attack?  We will never know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terrible that the government has lost touch with the 
priorities of the people when it comes to fighting crime. Instead 
of implementing a national sex offender registry for convicted 
criminals back in 1995, the government implemented a national 
firearms registry for law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals by their actions demonstrated quite clearly that 
protecting women and children was not one of their priorities. 
They talk the talk but they do not walk the walk.  This speech 
will expose the government's complete lack of political judgment 
when it comes to understanding people's priorities.  The Liberals 
give the impression they are compassionate but the opposite is 
true when we examine what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until today, the government opposed a sex offender registry that 
could help police prevent crime and protect the public.  Instead 
it supported spending $600 million on a useless gun registry. 
The police asked for a DNA databank for all criminals which would 
operate just like the national fingerprint system.  However, the 
government refused opting instead for a system that protected 
criminals more than it did victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government refused to give police real tools to use to 
investigate sexual crimes and violent offences, the government 
chose to blow hundreds of millions of dollars on a gun registry 
with a 90% error rate.  Now in an admission of defeat, the 
government is laying off staff, tripling production of 
registration applications and halting all attempts to accurately 
verify and identify firearms.  This is another broken Liberal 
promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may remember in 1995 when parliament was promised that 
the gun registry would help police trace firearms.  Police cannot 
trace something the registration system does not accurately 
identify.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government refuse to implement a national sex 
offender registry?  We will find the answer in a government 
document entitled, “Report to Federal, Provincial and 
Territorial Ministers on Information Systems on Sex Offenders 
Against Children and Other Vulnerable Groups”.  It was prepared 
by a federal-provincial-territorial working group on high risk 
offenders in October 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's working group reached a number of conclusions and 
arguments but not proceeding with the sex offender registry.  I 
will spend the next few minutes outlining these reasons and 
arguments and commenting on each one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the minister's working group said that a separate sex 
offender registry would duplicate a part of what has already 
available through CPIC.  The same argument is true of the gun 
registry but that did not stop the government.  Obviously the 
government thinks law-abiding gun owners are more dangerous than 
convicted sex offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the minister's working group said that a separate sex 
offender registry would be expensive and difficult to administer. 
The government has spent $600 million on a gun registry and 
employs about 2,000 government workers.  Would a sex offender 
registry for convicted criminals really have been more expensive 
and difficult to administer than the gun registry it uses to 
track law-abiding citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the minister's working group said that the sex offender 
registry raises serious privacy concerns.  On February 16 this 
year the Privacy Commissioner of Canada wrote me a three page 
letter outlining the serious privacy concerns he had with the 
information being collected and how it is used in the gun 
registry.  He said the RCMP's firearms interest police database 
of some three and a half million Canadians, which is only 
supposed to have the names potentially dangerous individuals, 
actually included the names of witnesses and victims of crime. 
RCMP sources tell us there is a 50% error rate in this database. 
Canadians will be wondering why the Liberals were more interested 
in protecting the privacy of convicted sex offenders than they 
are in protecting the privacy of witnesses and victims of crime 
and law-abiding gun owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the minister's working group said the administration of 
a sex offender registry would be particularly difficult with 
regard to the verification of identity.  This is somehow an 
insurmountable administrative problem when trying to create a sex 
offender registry.  However when it comes to the gun registry, 
the Liberals came up with a simple solution, force every 
law-abiding gun owner to carry a photo ID card.  Would the 
government please explain to victims of sexual assault why it 
forces law-abiding gun owners to carry a photo ID but a sex 
offender does not have to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the minister's working group said the information in a 
sex offender registry would be of limited value unless supported 
by a more comprehensive screening process.  The government did 
not hesitate to implement a more comprehensive screening process 
for law-abiding firearms owners.  It even asked about marital 
problems, common law relationships and financial difficulties. 
These people have not even broken a law.  Could the government 
please explain to the victims of sexual assault why comprehensive 
screening of convicted sex offenders is off limits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, the minister's working group said that the Canadian 
Police Information Centre, CPIC, is so effective that it really 
is a national registry of sex offenders.  In the very next 
paragraph it states that CPIC does not provide “compulsory 
registration of current addresses of sexual offenders beyond the 
end of any sentence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not force convicted sex offenders to 
tell police where they live?  A law-abiding gun owner can go to 
jail for up to two years if he or she fails to report an address 
change.  If the Liberals force law-abiding firearms owners in the 
country to report every time they move, why not convicted sex 
offenders?  The only conclusion one can reach is that the 
Liberals obviously think a law-abiding firearms owner is more 
dangerous than a convicted sex offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, the minister's working group said even with compulsory 
registration of sex offenders compliance would be low and that it 
would drive sex offenders underground.  Gun owners who do not 
comply face a criminal penalty of up to 10 years in jail.  Why 
does the government threaten sex offenders with 10 years in jail 
to see if they will comply?  The Liberals are already claiming an 
80% compliance rate with gun owners.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth, the minister's working group said that without 
fingerprinting identification it would never be possible to be 
certain of the identity of a registered sex offender.  The group 
says verifying the identity of the sex offender is further 
complicated by the falsification of records, misspelled names, 
duplicate names and can lead to serious problems of 
misidentification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an every day occurrence in the gun registry where 
totally innocent people are confused with someone who incorrectly 
entered the RCMP database.  Firearms officers are forced to 
investigate totally innocent people to confirm their identity. 
The RCMP records are never corrected so it happens again and 
again.  Totally innocent people are publicly humiliated and 
investigated over and over again.  Heaven forbid the Liberals 
would ever put convicted sex offenders through such a process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, as the Liberal government put millions of law-abiding 
gun owners through this bureaucratic nightmare and humiliating 
hell making them pay a fee for the privilege, the Liberals gave 
thousands and thousands of sex offenders a free hand. 
Unfortunately some of these hands ended up molesting our 
children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I did not expect there would be any Liberals who would 
get up and ask a question.  Therefore, I am pleased to do so in 
order to give the member an opportunity to tell us more with 
respect to his excellent comparison he put forward on what the 
law-abiding people, called gun owners, are going through 
regarding the registration that was implemented by the 
government, by the way, without the approval of all the 
provincial attorneys generals.  However with this particular 
registry, it insists it must have the approval of all the 
provincial attorneys general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything else that the hon. member could deliver with 
regard to this great comparison? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member makes a 
good point.  When the Liberals choose to find an excuse for not 
doing something they will find it.  They will blame other people. 
When they have ample opportunity to do something right, they do 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the government had a choice.  Sadly for our children and 
the most vulnerable in our society they made the wrong one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the next election rolls around I hope that the women, the 
children, the elderly and all Canadians who care about making our 
lives safer will remember the bad choice the Liberals made when 
they opposed the sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are good at sounding compassionate without really 
being compassionate.  I will continue to tell Canadians the truth 
about what the Liberals do.  It is always the opposite of what 
they say.  Registering law-abiding citizens but not criminals may 
be the Liberal way but it is the wrong way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard today about how the Liberals agree with this motion. 
Will they act on it?  We will see.  Their past record does not 
speak well for them.  Everyone in Canada should know it should be 
the other way around but try to tell them that when they are 
playing politics with the safety of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just today the solicitor general said that the government was 
not just going to spend dollars to create new registries.  What 
did it do?  In the next two years it is going to create a 
registry of private property, namely firearms.  It is going to 
cost a horrific amount of money and there will be no benefit to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1995 the government said that if it created a gun 
registry and it saved one life it was going to be worth it.  It 
has already cost one life.  It was so poorly drafted that it has 
already cost one life in Newfoundland.  We do not hear the 
Liberals saying anything about it.  Here we have the opportunity 
to save lives, to protect the most vulnerable in society and they 
talk the talk but they do not walk the walk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general said that politicians do not get involved 
in law enforcement.  The police in this country would like to 
have what we are calling for today.  If we talk to grassroots 
policemen they have no use for the gun registry.  It is an 
absolute useless tool to them.  Professional criminals do not use 
a registry that can link them to any crime.  It is as simple as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that when real criminals become more difficult to find, 
arrest or prosecute, the government lawmakers, the courts and the 
police turn to increasing their control of law abiding citizens. 
That seems to be what is happening in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go after the real criminal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this motion, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government establish a national sex offender registry, 
by January 1, 2002. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I am able to support that motion because there already 
exists such a national registry.  It is called the Canadian 
Police Information Centre, CPIC.  I want to make it perfectly 
clear that while I am able to support the motion, I certainly do 
not support some of the premises and some of the arguments we 
have been hearing from the official opposition in the course of 
today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we would listen to the official opposition, we would believe 
that the government has been sitting on its hands and doing 
absolutely nothing as far as protection of society is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I know that as a former Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Justice you are fully aware of many of the 
initiatives the government has undertaken over the last few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention just a few of them.  There is the 
national screening system that was put in place in 1994 and 
allows an agency serving children to request a local police 
criminal background check through CPIC on anybody wanting to be 
involved with that agency.  In 1999 the solicitor general 
announced an additional $115 million to renew and enhance CPIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has taken a number of steps to protect 
our children and other targets of sex offenders.  For instance, 
in 1997 the Liberal government passed a number of tough measures 
dealing with high risk offenders, including sex offenders, to 
strengthen the sentencing and correctional regime.  These include 
a new long term offender designation which permits supervision of 
up to 10 years following release from prison.  There is also a 
strengthening of the dangerous offender provision which requires 
judges to impose indeterminate sentences on all dangerous 
offenders.  There are also new measures in judicial restraining 
provisions for certain individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the national flagging system. In the year 2000, 
Bill C-7 was passed, which ensures that even the records of 
pardoned sex offenders are available through the screening 
process.  Colleagues have made also reference to the DNA 
identification act, whereby DNA profiles are preserved in a 
convicted offenders index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all measures that have been put in place by the 
government to ensure the protection of society, and in 
particular, children and people who might be susceptible to sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the rest of my time to concentrate on what it is 
that we are doing here today and what the gist of the motion is. 
Today is a supply day, commonly known as an opposition day, when 
the opposition gets to choose the topic for debate and put a 
motion forward for consideration by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, inasmuch as the whole issue of sex offenders is a 
very serious subject, we are once again seeing partisan politics 
coming from the opposition party.  We hear those party members 
complain about the way things function around here and about how 
the government does not listen to their concerns, et cetera. When 
they have an opportunity to bring forward serious subjects in a 
serious fashion, we get tricked up opposition day motions. They 
employ a little device whereby, in this case, they amend the date 
on the motion, which prevents the government from bringing 
forward meaningful amendments to the motion so that we can deal 
with the very serious issues that this whole topic engenders. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things we could be discussing.  There are a 
lot of implications in the subject matter we have here, but with 
the limited motion designed to entrap the government members so 
that they would be embarrassed by the vote, it is that trick 
question where a person is held culpable whether he or she says 
yes or no.  This is the type of tactic that has been employed 
here.  That is why I personally have no compulsion in supporting 
the motion on the basis that the registry already exists, because 
I think that is more or less in the spirit of the motion that has 
been presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also gets us to the point that the opposition would have 
Canadians believe that crime is out of control in our streets and 
that we need these draconian measures that have been suggested 
from time to time in order to increase penalties and in order to 
protect society.  That is the spirit I do not want to be seen to 
be contributing to and supporting through my support for this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a perfect example of this, and that was the Sharpe 
decision on possession of child pornography, where the 
opposition, in an opposition day motion, brought a motion to 
invoke the notwithstanding clause to overturn the B.C. court's 
decision.  Obviously the government was not prepared to invoke 
the notwithstanding clause to overturn a trial court decision or 
even the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision when we had 
recourse to the Supreme Court of Canada, so the government voted 
against that opposition day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, in the most recent campaign in November 2000 it 
became an issue when the Alliance candidate in my riding said 
that the member of parliament for Simcoe North obviously 
supported child pornography because he voted against an 
opposition day motion, refusing to invoke the notwithstanding 
clause to overturn the Sharpe decision.  By the way, the Alliance 
candidate was only parroting what his leader was saying on that 
same motion in the middle of the campaign.  To that I attribute 
the increase in my plurality from 45% to 51%. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Simcoe North know their member.  They know 
that he does not condone child pornography, but that these 
arguments go too far.  When one is dealing with extremists who 
take their arguments too far, this is a big help in opposing 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should also know that polls were released this week 
showing that 54% of the Canadians questioned think that more 
funding is needed for crime prevention programs. 
What we do not need are measures such as those proposed by the 
opposition, which keeps calling for tougher sentences because 
they think that is what the public wants, even though all the 
experts say the opposite. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think the Canadian public has passed the opposition 
on this issue.  The Canadian public in that poll this week is way 
ahead of the opposition and knows full well that crime prevention 
and measures that lead toward rehabilitation are the best ways to 
protect Canadian society.  The best way is not necessarily to 
bring in more draconian measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I just want to confirm that since the CPIC system 
already exists, which is in conformity with the motion, I will be 
able to support the motion, but I do want to make it very clear 
that I certainly do not support the spirit behind the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it is a known fact 
in the House and certainly I believe in Simcoe North and 
elsewhere throughout Ontario and Canada, that the hon. member who 
just spoke is a leading advocate when it comes to crime 
prevention and rehabilitation.  At the end of his speech he spoke 
eloquently about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last little while and certainly today again we have 
heard from the reformed Alliance people the knee-jerk kind of 
reactionary, simplistic view that they hold with respect to 
issues regarding law and order.  It really is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registries do not work, they said.  They are too bureaucratic, 
they said.  Registries are too expensive, they said.  They are 
too expensive to justify the crimes they prevent, they said. They 
will not work if people are expected to voluntarily register. 
There it is.  There the reformed Alliance people go again, saying 
one thing when it suits their purposes and quite another when it 
suits other purposes, and usually in different parts of the 
country.  Gee whiz, is that not always the way they are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member for Simcoe North is this:  would 
he go on to elaborate a little about the benefits of crime 
prevention and the good work the government has done in that 
area?  I know that he has worked hard and has done so, rightly 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the government 
has demonstrated through its crime prevention initiatives and in 
the most recent election platform where more funds were dedicated 
to crime prevention that this is definitely the way to protect 
society.  We need to invest in programs.  In my riding of Simcoe 
North there are several good examples of groups of people working 
with young offenders and taking a sort of sentencing circle 
approach, where the young offender is brought before the person 
who suffered the damage from the offender's acts of vandalism et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of initiatives that the crime prevention 
funds are there to support.  Those are the kinds of initiatives 
that will be successful in protecting our society.  We need to 
know that early intervention is the best method of dealing with 
these folks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not need are references to Karla Homolka, because 
that catches people's attention.  I heard it referred to again 
today.  I noticed in the TV coverage this morning that the 
corrections minister for Ontario was talking about Karla Homolka 
and using her as an example of how statutory release is not 
working, but Karla Homolka has been detained until her warrant 
expiry date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of the provincial government was referring to Karla 
Homolka in a statutory release situation and saying that the 
federal government has to fix it.  The problem with the Karla 
Homolka case was the plea bargain that was done through the 
office of the attorney general of Ontario.  It is a provincial 
issue.  There is no lax federal policy that contributes to the 
concern that people are experiencing there.  It is something that 
they can look to their own backyard and deal with, but no, they 
want to use that example because they know it catches the 
attention of the media and the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of thing we do not need.  What we do need are 
reasonable programs of crime prevention and rehabilitation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  When it comes to 
the matter of protecting children and other potential victims 
from sexual offenders, as an educator for over 20 years I 
certainly support the motion and indicate that in our society 
there are no more precious individuals than children. 
Anything we can do to protect them from the scourge of sexual 
predators is extremely important.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, it is acknowledged that our shared objective in 
the House as parliamentarians is to put into place every measure 
we can find within the jurisdiction of parliament that will 
effectively protect society from the threat posed by sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the importance of this issue, deserving of the utmost 
attention from all levels of public policy makers, it is only 
logical that any such registry does not and cannot exist or 
operate in isolation from other tools and elements in the 
criminal justice system.  These other elements include tough 
penalties in the criminal code to punish sex crimes, restrictions 
on parole and probation, peace bonds, treatment programs and 
crime prevention strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to examine the various tools that 
are already being used to respond to the threat posed by 
convicted sex offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, and in the spirit of prevention, effective 
criminal laws are key tools and parliament can be proud of its 
legislative record over the last five or so years in addressing 
the vulnerability of women and children to sexual exploitation. 
I would commend the legislative package that was passed in 1997, 
generally known as Bill C-55, which strengthened the dangerous 
offender rules in part XXIV of the criminal code and also created 
a new sentencing provision called long term offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall the dangerous offender system allows the 
sentencing judge to designate a serious offender to be in a 
special category based on proof that this individual poses a high 
risk of violent re-offending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies have shown that over 90% of successful dangerous 
offender applications involved sex offenders.  It was clear that 
the DO law was a useful tool for going after criminals with long 
patterns of serious sex crimes but that, given the limited number 
of dangerous offender designations each year, there were probably 
a lot more potential DOs out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55, which was passed early in 1997, strengthened the 
dangerous offender system.  Where it had once been possible to 
order a dangerous offender to be incarcerated for a certain 
limited period, the law now required the sentencing judge to 
impose an indeterminate period of incarceration.  The process of 
risk assessment was streamlined.  The amendments also shifted the 
initial parole review of dangerous offenders from three years 
into the sentence to the seventh year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 we have seen a doubling of a number of successful 
dangerous offender applications each year.  This is an example of 
a legislative approach that is meeting the test of effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bill C-55 package also created an innovative sentencing 
measure called long term offender.  Whereas the dangerous 
offender sentence targets the worst kind of offenders, as 
reflected in the fact that we lock them up indefinitely, it was 
recognized that there were other sex offenders who might not 
quite meet the high threshold of violence and the risk of a DO 
but who were risky enough to require an extensive period of 
supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As specified in the criminal code, sex offenders are clearly the 
focus of this sentencing category.  A convicted long term 
offender will receive an appropriate penitentiary sentence 
according to the crime for which he was found guilty, but the 
court will add up to 10 years of intensive, parole-like 
supervision.  The offender must complete his penitentiary 
sentence in its entirety before the long term supervision period 
kicks in. Federal correctional authorities will then add special 
conditions to the long term supervision order and a breach of 
those conditions may result in a person being brought back into 
custody and charges may be laid.  This innovative measure has 
already resulted in over 60 successful long term offender 
applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tragedy that any people, especially children, are 
subject to sexual abuse and exploitation. 
The government has declared that the well-being of children and 
youth is a top priority.  In 1997 and later in 1999 parliament 
passed important measures to protect children from being drawn 
into the sex trade.  The new offence of aggravated procuring was 
created with a minimum five year sentence to deal with those who 
use violence against a child and force that child into 
prostitution related activity.  Special protections were 
instituted to make it easier for children to testify against 
pimps. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I must highlight the fact that legislation is not the 
only solution to the problem of sexual abuse of children.  In 
1995, in conjunction with the Canadian law enforcement agencies, 
the solicitor general released a police manual for cases of child 
exploitation.  It is used throughout the country for training. In 
1999 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, working with the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service, added new guidelines for law 
enforcement to handle sexual exploitation cases.  The guidelines 
cover intelligence sharing, investigations, officer training and 
media awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in November of last year the government convened a 
meeting of federal, provincial and territorial officials to 
discuss integrated approaches to helping youth involved in 
prostitution.  This turned out to be a good opportunity for 
workers in the justice and child welfare systems to exchange 
ideas on prevention, physical and emotional recovery and ways of 
reintegrating these young people into society.  In fact police 
forces in Canada are steadily improving their ability to deal 
with sex offence cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another example of progressive contributions to the law 
enforcement agencies, the RCMP sexual assault investigation 
course which teaches investigative techniques to members of the 
force.  It is also a forum in which police and social workers 
communicate and co-operate in techniques to assist sex abuse 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1999 the Department of Justice launched an 
initiative aimed at these citizens who all members would agree 
are the most vulnerable.  The consultation called “Children as 
Victims in the Criminal Justice System” had the goal of 
consulting as widely as possible on four areas: deterring sexual 
offenders from reoffending against children; creating further 
child specific offences if needed; making it easier for child 
victims and child witnesses to testify in court; and reviewing 
related issues in the area of age of consent.  I understand the 
project is closely linked to the government's national children's 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that abuses continue requiring us to be 
vigilant in protecting vulnerable groups from exploitation such 
as the example of pornography.  Fortunately, the supreme court 
upheld for the most part the existing criminal code provisions 
outlawing the possession of child pornography.  However, there is 
still the risk posed by distribution of pornography on the 
Internet.  I know there are plans in the works to present a new 
anti-luring offence to parliament which will combat the insidious 
form of exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am providing this background in order to impress upon all 
members the fact that protecting our children from sex 
exploitation is a multifaceted approach.  It is the process of 
building on what has proven successful and then innovating with 
new strategies.  It involves and interlinked system of laws and 
law enforcement, of education and prevention.  The initiatives 
that I have highlight in the House have been tested in the 
crucible of the streets, the courts and the prison system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident that sex offenders would be required to register 
once they are released from prison or penitentiary, presumably at 
the expiration of their sentence, although that is not entirely 
clear.  Perhaps they would have to register even if they were 
still serving their sentence on probation or parole.  It is 
important that we know where these people are.  It is important 
that there is a penalty if they do not register.  I do not 
necessarily think the penalty would be financial.  I think it 
would be re-incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that parliament in 1997 passed a peace bond 
measure, section 810.2 of the criminal code.  This recognizance 
applies more generally to anyone who poses a risk of committing a 
serious personal injury offence.  It is not confined to 
situations where the potential victims are under the age of 14. 
I commend members to support this resolution.

my time with the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party justice system is not working.  It is long 
past time that the government went back to the drawing board to 
revise its philosophy.  Even that most liberal organization known 
as the John Howard Society seems to finally be accepting that all 
we have been doing is warehousing criminals for a period of time 
in our institutions, only to have them released back into society 
to continue their offending ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maureen Collins, executive director of the Edmonton John 
Howard Society, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some people, jail won't teach them a lesson.  It just gets 
them off the street long enough so they don't victimize any more 
people.  They go away for a long period of time and never really 
show any signs of rehabilitation and when they get back on the 
streets, they re-offend.  It's their choice.  And it's those few 
who never change their ways who may be forcing the violent crime 
rate up. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When rehabilitation does not work, and there is more than ample 
evidence that it does not, then what we are doing is releasing 
dangerous and violent offenders back into a society where they 
will commit further violent offences.  Is this any way to protect 
our citizens?  With sexual offenders, the victims are almost 
entirely women and children.  As parliamentarians we have a duty 
and responsibility to attempt to provide whatever protections are 
necessary while being fair and still recognizing the rights of 
the offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to mention some of the recidivism rates of 
sex offenders.  In 1991 the British Columbia ministry of health 
tracked the history of 30 child sexual offenders.  That study 
found that each sex offender had molested an average of 70 
children, for a total of 2,099, by moving around 62 communities 
and across five provinces.  A similar study in the United States 
found that 453 offenders admitted to molesting more than 67,000 
children in their lifetime.  Those who abused girls had an 
average of 52 victims each, but men who molested boys had an 
average of 150 victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Psychologist Vern Quinsey found that 38% of the sex offenders 
treated or assessed at the regional treatment centre inside the 
Kingston penitentiary were rearrested for violent or sex offences 
after they were released.  I am astounded that 38% reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We allow these individuals to return to our communities without 
a whole lot of supervision or control and almost 40% of them are 
caught reoffending.  I wonder how many are not caught?  We are 
deliberately permitting violent offenders to return to society 
and we do not even provide a system whereby our police become 
aware that these people are in their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing?  Is this some kind of game where we ensure 
that the police and the criminal have equal opportunity to do 
their thing?  Are we afraid to put too much information into the 
hands of law enforcement personnel so that these criminals are 
given a better than even chance to commit their hideous crimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government refuses to create a sex offender registry 
because the police would have more information on potential 
suspects within their area.  The government seems to want to 
prevent the police from becoming too successful.  We recently saw 
how the government, through the office of the corrections 
commissioner, had a quota system to get 50% of sentenced 
individuals out into the community in order to cut down on 
imprisonment costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex offenders are the fastest growing segment of federal 
offenders.  From 1990 to 1995 the number of imprisoned sex 
offenders grew by 50%.  More than 700 federal sex offenders were 
being released back into our communities each year during the 
mid-nineties.  I do not have more recent statistics, but would 
suppose those numbers rose under Commissioner Ole Ingstrup's 
regime of getting more and more criminals released in order to 
reduce the workload within our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the government seems to acknowledge the risk to our 
children of sex offenders being returned to the community.  The 
government program known as the national screening system permits 
organizations to inquire within the Canadian Police Information 
Centre, or CPIC, to determine whether potential employees or 
volunteers working with children have a criminal history.  Child 
sex abusers can be screened out from involvement with children. 
The system is only good for those sex offenders who apply to work 
or volunteer with these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The screening process is limited only to those offenders who 
decide to participate in the scheme.  The system does nothing to 
stop those who live in the community and prey on children for 
their sexual gratification.  That type of offender remains 
protected and hidden from disclosure and police supervision.  A 
sexual offender registry would assist to keep control over those 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government closes its ears to the complaints and 
concerns raised about sex offenders continuing to terrorize 
citizens, it is interesting to see the provinces being forced to 
act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan Association of Chiefs of Police, or SACP, has 
unanimously supported a provincial sex offender registry.  Terry 
Coleman, chief of police of Moose Jaw and vice-president of SACP 
states that it does potentially provide a measure of deterrence 
for offenders because it removes a degree of anonymity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario has Christopher's Law.  It received royal assent back in 
April 2000.  I understand other provinces have been looking at 
setting up their own sexual offender registry, including my own 
province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this is not the proper way to proceed.  Crime statistics 
support the fact that sexual offenders will move from one 
province to another.  We need a national system.  Only in that 
way can we have a uniform process to assess all our criminals to 
determine whether they should be included within the sex offender 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen time and time again that with justice issues a 
national setup is often necessary as it cuts the costs to the 
taxpayer by having one system rather than 13 different 
operations.  With a national system we can also utilize RCMP 
facilities to maintain the information for everyone.  For 
example, the only way a police officer in British Columbia can 
learn about a sex offender who used to live in the maritimes is 
by checking with a central agency or by checking with each of the 
maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost four years now our country has been waiting for the 
government to act and set up a national sex offender registry. 
Ontario has grown tired of waiting and has decided to go it 
alone.  It seems to care more for our women and children than do 
the Liberals, especially the majority of whom come from the 
province of Ontario.  The problem created by this situation is 
that Ontario may in fact be forcing its sexual offenders to move 
to other provinces to commit their sexual crimes.  The failure of 
the federal government to act has created a problem in and of 
itself and has put citizens of other provinces at greater risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall how the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance used 
to belittle the Ontario government when it decided to reduce 
taxes to generate the economy.  It took the federal government a 
couple of years to come to its senses and realize the 
intelligence behind that move.  Last fall the finance minister 
finally decided to follow the Ontario example and promised lower 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly I recall the Prime Minister being encouraged to 
address the brain drain a couple of years ago.  His answer was 
that there was no brain drain, that it was all fear mongering. 
Just this past week I note the industry minister was quite proud 
to announce $750 million in new money toward addressing the brain 
drain that has been dramatically hurting our country.  It would 
seem that the light does indeed go on occasionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has indicated that it will support the motion.  I 
suggest that it is attempting to scam the Canadian public.  It 
qualifies its support by saying that we already have a registry 
in the form of CPIC.  Thirty thousand members of the Canadian 
Police Association do not seem to share that few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election my colleague and neighbour from Surrey 
Central soundly defeated his Liberal opponent, Peter Warkentin, 
who proudly proclaimed to the media and anybody else who would 
listen that he had permission from the Prime Minister to put the 
issue of a national sex offender registry before parliament if he 
got elected.  I note that he had to have the Prime Minister's 
permission to do his job, but that is debate for another day. The 
Liberal campaign co-chair confirmed the commitment and is quoted 
as saying that the Prime Minister responded by saying that 
pedophilia was a big issue and that parents had the right to be 
concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Prime Minister that the issue is now before 
parliament. This is where the rubber hits the road.  Each and 
every day citizens are put at risk and we will continue to have 
needless sex offences committed against more innocent victims.

case of a 15 year old offender who had been convicted of 
molesting three children.  Indeed there were up to 22 but he plea 
bargained to 3.  He was put on probation for a year and was 
supposedly receiving treatment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He moved from Nanaimo to a Courtenay, unknown to the residents, 
the townhouse complex and the elementary school that he lived 
right next door to.  One year later he murdered a little six year 
old girl named Dawn Shaw after sexually assaulting her in the 
bush.  He was the next door neighbour.  Her parents, Ron and 
Carol Shaw, obviously did not know about him and indeed the RCMP 
in Courtenay did not even know about him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion young offenders who are convicted of violent

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to 
the Canadian Alliance motion on the establishment of a national 
sex offender registry by January 1, 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I should like to wholeheartedly thank my 
constituents in Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam for having 
endowed me last November with their trust and confidence to 
represent their best interests in the House.  I also thank the 
member for Langley—Abbotsford for drafting and raising the issue 
in the House, because it is a central concern to countless 
families in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my maiden speech, and I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to participate in the debate on what is the first 
order of responsibility of the state.  What do I mean by that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, if the government cannot balance its budget, if it 
cannot agree on a standard for weights and measures, if it cannot 
organize its monetary framework or agree on a national anthem, 
the first principle and responsibility to state, above all else, 
is to protect law-abiding citizens from law breakers.  It is to 
separate those who play by the rules of civilized behaviour from 
those who do not.  This is reflected in Abraham Maslow's famous 
hierarchy of needs that many academics speak about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance motion calls for an effective and 
meaningful national sex offender registry with teeth.  It is 
something which despite declarations from the government side 
does not yet exist.  We are talking about legislation which 
mirrors laws that currently exist in the province of Ontario and 
is being considered in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British 
Columbia.  The United Kingdom has already implemented a sex 
offender registry and all 50 U.S. states have sex offender 
registries.  There are national governing mechanisms in place to 
organize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of taking bold steps and showing leadership, the 
government has taken refuge in the Canadian Police Information 
Centre rather than offer real protection for Canadian families 
and their children through a new national sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very fact that provinces have moved to implement registries 
should compel the government to act on a national basis to avoid 
differing regional and jurisdictional standards and to prevent 
sex offenders from wandering from one province to another, 
avoiding accountability for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the exact problem that Americans faced before former 
president, Bill Clinton, established a national registry with 
uniform standards.  Different states were using different 
registration criteria and standards as well as different 
notification and database logistics.  This led to 
inter-jurisdictional disputes and confusion.  Under national laws 
that were established many of these problems have been ironed 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an opportunity to learn from those difficulties and 
establish a national registry.  This is an opportunity for the 
government to show leadership by setting up a national registry 
ahead of time and avoiding the pitfalls experienced by the United 
States.  The issue is about more than jurisdictions, amendments, 
committee work and legislation tightening.  It is about victims 
and the right to live free from fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abby Drover is a constituent of mine.  In 1976 she was the 
victim of a horrendous crime.  For 181 days she was sexually 
assaulted and brutalized by Donald Alexander Hay.  From March to 
September of that year, Mr. Hay kept the then 12 year old Abby in 
a prison under his Port Moody garage for his sexual pleasure.  He 
lured Abby to his house on the offer of a ride to school and 
forced her into a 36 square foot room.  He handcuffed the young 
child and secured the handcuffs to the wall of her cell with 
chains that were bolted into studs anchored into the cell's 
concrete walls.  He fondled, sexually assaulted and raped the 
young girl repeatedly.

to eat was two chocolate bars.  He later testified in court that 
the reason he did this was because he hoped she would just die.

around his ankles coming up from the entrance to Abby's prison.

know, according to U.S. department of justice statistics, is that 
about 50% of rapists and sexual assaulters released into society 
are rearrested for a new crime and more than one-third are 
reconvicted.  In Canada research from the federal government 
shows that the longer one tracks a sexual offender, the higher 
the recidivism rate is.  Data indicates that between 42% and 45% 
of sexual offenders will in fact reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue here is the potential to reoffend and the right of 
communities to live free from fear.  Given the statistics 
associated with sex offenders and their recidivism rate, there 
seems to be an obvious responsibility on the House, on our 
shoulders, to prevent future crimes when and where we can.  The 
registry is a tool to help do precisely that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing this reality, some Canadian provinces have already 
shown leadership in creating sex offender registries, as has been 
mentioned by the member for Surrey Central and others.  In 
Queen's Park on February 28, 2000, the standing committee on 
justice and social policy met to debate bill 31, also known as 
Christopher's Law.  The most interesting aspect of the 
committee's meeting was the cross party support for the bill.  It 
was a cross party consensus that a sex offender registry was 
needed, appropriate, and would move the province toward greater 
justice and greater responsibility to victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The all party support was not a tongue in cheek, foot dragging 
type of endorsement like we heard this morning from the solicitor 
general but a thorough commitment to a registry with teeth.  All 
NDP, Liberal and Conservative MPPs in Queen's Park supported the 
bill.  Not only did Dalton McGuinty's Ontario Liberals support 
the bill, but in committee the Liberal attorney general critic, 
Michael Bryant, who is an adjunct law professor from Osgoode Hall 
Law School, mentioned “We support this bill and this bill should 
have been passed a long time ago”.  All three elected political 
parties recognized that the government should establish a sex 
offender registry because public safety should reach beyond 
partisan slugfests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposed national sex offender registry would provide our 
police with something that they have not yet had: a mechanism to 
keep track of sex offenders from coast to coast to coast.  The 
registry would be a vital investigative tool allowing police to 
monitor sex offenders in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies from the United States show conclusively that registries 
have enabled law enforcement agencies to solve crimes quicker and 
to identify suspects sooner.  Convicted sex offenders would be 
required to register as a condition of release from custody.  Any 
failure to do so would be a violation of a condition of their 
release and result in an immediate return to custody.  The 
information would be entered into a national sex offender 
database and made available only to police services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario's law provides for effective monitoring of the offenders 
by requiring them to register with police within 15 days of a 
change of address or within 15 days of coming to or leaving 
Ontario. The offender must provide the police with his name, 
address, date of birth and other information deemed necessary by 
the police, not bureaucrats, not politicians, not posturers, that 
will best suit the safety of citizens in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an offender does not comply, Ontario's legislation mandates a 
first time penalty of $25,000 or a year in jail and for more than 
one offence, $25,000 and two years in jail.  This is a common 
sense approach to crime prevention.  It provides for safer 
streets and a sense of security in neighbourhoods like Port Moody 
for victims of sex offences like one of my constituents, Abby 
Drover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, a national sex offender registry is long overdue. 
Safe communities should be a national priority as is the case in 
the United States, our largest trading partner, and in the United 
Kingdom.  Police deserve every reasonable tool available to 
protect the innocent from the evil and the depraved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues in the House, especially the government 
members, to think of innocent victims of sexual abuse, rape, 
torture and torment when they consider supporting the Canadian 
Alliance motion to establish a meaningful and effective national 
sex offender registry tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us join with other provinces and nations, the real leaders 
of the world, in taking a solid step forward for a safer future 
for all Canadians in their communities.  Safer families and safer 
children is the way to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a quick question for the member.  Today we have 
heard a number of government members talk about prevention and 
early intervention.  I do not think any of us on this side of the 
House would disagree with that.  That is obviously the way we 
stop these things from happening in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wondered if the member would agree with this.  How can it 
not be preventative to know when convicted offenders are in a 
community?  How can that not be considered prevention? Prevention 
is what this is all about.  We know these people are in our 
communities and they are convicted pedophiles and convicted sex 
offenders.  I am not quite sure where the government side is 
coming from when it does not see this as preventative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Surrey North for the question.  This is one of those difficult 
aspects of law, where a government gives, frankly, awkward 
explanations for why it is supporting a bill.  Why does it not 
just come out and show leadership?  Why does it not just come and 
say that this might prevent some crimes, that maybe we are right, 
that maybe it should have supported this a couple of years ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members say that CPIC already provides this 
service but it does not.   If it did, victims would not be 
calling our offices and e-mailing and faxing us and asking us to 
support this motion.  I would not have had Abby Drover tell me 
yesterday that I had her consent to tell her story because 
Canadians needed to know about it and because she would like to 
know when Mr. Hay is going to come out of prison so that she and 
her family can feel safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If constituents are calling our offices and telling us all these 
stories, and if police associations, victims' right groups and 
CAVEAT are contacting us, then clearly there is something in this 
motion and something in the potential for a sex offender registry 
that is not already on the books.  However, the government does 
not seem to recognize this and that is not leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not just say that its legislation falls 
short?  The RCMP recognizes that.  Canadians recognize that. 
Abby Drover recognizes that.  Organizations and academics 
recognize that.  Everyone recognizes that.  Why does the 
government not admit that and say that it is going to adopt this 
motion and make some serious reforms because the country and 
victims deserve it? That is leadership.  Leadership is admitting 
insufficiencies and taking risks, and the government should be 
doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague for bringing up the very 
personal story that he did, with the permission of Ms. Drover.  I 
would like to add a bit to that story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a young person in that community who was very much the 
same age as Abby Drover.  I remember reading in my local 
community papers about this incident and I remember how horrified 
I was and how horrified the entire community was that this young 
girl had disappeared.  We suspected that she had been murdered, 
that something terrible had happened.  We found out that 
something very terrible did happen.  To learn that she had been 
abducted by her neighbour and kept in a closed dungeon and 
repeatedly assaulted for months was beyond the scope of our 
understanding.  It has taken her very many years to talk about 
this, which is understandable.   I think that very personal story 
illustrates why we need to move on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague could add a bit more to that particular 
story and tell us how this proposed change would make a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
my neighbouring riding of Dewdney—Alouette for his question. 
This specific story does speak volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abby Drover was abducted in March of 1976.  Three months before 
I was born she was abducted and here we are, 24 years later, 
finally seeing an ounce of progress.  She was abducted.  Halfway 
through her abduction I was born.  She was finally found in 
September of 1976.  I was born in June.  Here I am, 24 years 
later, and finally the House is moving a step closer, in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it say about the injustice of our laws that it takes 
that long, 24 years, for the government of this country to show a 
bit of sanity, compassion and respect for victims of crime, and 
to put in a mechanism so that people and police services know who 
the bad guys are and where they are living, so that we can 
separate those who play by the rules from those who do not?

make the right choice and will, in a good faith effort, take this 
to committee and establish real laws with real teeth and real 
foundations so that it can show justice 24 years later, finally, 
to people like my constituent, Abby Drover.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today in the <I>National Post</I> I read that the 
opposition MP who spoke earlier and his colleagues support this 
registration.  At the same time, he admits that this registration 
will not prevent people from committing a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare this registration to gun registration.  Why is it 
that in this case registration will help to prevent crimes but 
gun registration will not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Madam Speaker, quite frankly the hon. 
member is totally missing the point.  If a registration is good 
on one hand and not on the other, the hypocrisy is on the 
government's side.  It is absolute hypocrisy.  It would rather 
register pieces of long— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> Order, please.  It is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is 
as follows: the hon. member for Champlain, Lake Saint-Pierre. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, first of all I want to apologize.  I am sporting a bit 
of a cold, but in spite of that this is an issue that I feel very 
strongly about and that I want to speak about in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I want to say is that it is interesting to me 
that the opposition does not seem to be able to take yes for an 
answer.  I have heard member after member after member stand up 
in his place here today and say he will vote for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will vote for it.  I will put that on the record right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, maybe the motivations and the reasons are important so 
that we in fact understand what is going on with this particular 
motion.  Members opposite will know that I can be as partisan as 
anyone in this place over certain issues from time to time, but 
this is an issue that is unfortunately being used for what we can 
only call partisan political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who cannot feel sympathy when the member speaks of Abby Drover? 
Who cannot feel that the 24 years of torture she has suffered 
reliving that horrific crime is the worst thing anyone can 
imagine?  Who cannot feel frustration and anger when we read the 
inquest report on the death of Christopher Stephenson, which 
happened in a community just up the road from where I live?  A 
young man, an 11 year old boy, was sexually assaulted, tortured, 
raped and murdered by a pedophile who was out on parole and who 
was subsequently incarcerated.  These are the most horrific 
crimes imaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member for Surrey North speak.  I know of his 
personal involvement in the loss of a loved one due to violence. 
While it might not have been of this nature, it was still violent 
and it was still a young person.  I understand, I think, because 
I do not know if I truly can.  I do not know if we can truly 
understand the loss of a child.  We are not supposed to outlive 
our children.  The fact of having a child die is unimaginable in 
itself.  To have that child murdered or sexually assaulted by a 
perverted, sick individual, I do not know how I would live with 
that, I really do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the inquest into the death of Christopher Stephenson, which I 
share with you, where the members of the jury dedicated their 
report to the memory of Christopher, they said they would like to 
express their deepest appreciation to Jim and Anna Stephenson for 
showing great courage in their pursuit of the truth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing for us to bring these examples forward.  We 
cannot hide from them.  We have to talk about them.  However, 
would somebody please tell me that a national registry that 
requires convicted pedophiles who have completed their sentences 
to register their addresses is going to save an Abby Drover or 
someone else from being assaulted sexually?  Is this really the 
panacea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the government have done some things.  If the members 
would be honest when they speak, they would admit that the 
government has made some financial commitments to try to resolve 
the problem.  However, no one can stand on either side of the 
House, including the mover of the motion, and with any amount of 
sincerity claim to have the solution to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what the one solution is.  The one 
solution is the one that was imposed on Mr. Bernardo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Lock him up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  That is right.  We declare them 
dangerous offenders at the time of conviction. I recall listening 
to the news on the reports of the jury's decision in Paul 
Bernardo's trial for one of the most horrific crimes we have ever 
seen in this province and in this country.  I remember waiting 
for the report to come out and praying that this man would be 
declared a dangerous offender so that we would never—whether we 
are in elected office or anybody is, or just as unelected 
Canadians—have to face the fact of someone like that being 
released into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families of victims continue to go through these unbelievable, 
painful scenarios of having the murders and rapes of their 
daughters and young boys, their children, dragged through the 
press, and for what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have respect for the member for Surrey North who had a 
personal tragedy, but when he stands up and says that the 
Alliance members care—I wrote this down—for women and children 
more than the Liberals do, goodness gracious.  Can anybody 
honestly say that because one belongs to a particular political 
party one somehow cares more about our women and children and the 
safety of our communities?  It is just impossible for me to 
understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could have the most right wing approach to this thing, a 
lock them up and throw away the key approach, or one could have 
the most left wing approach, where one thinks that the solution 
is in mollycoddling or rehabilitating them without ever putting 
them in jail.  One could take either of those extreme positions, 
but I think it is so unfair to suggest that because someone 
belongs to a particular party or happens to belong to the 
government of the day he or she does not care about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Stick to the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member says to stick to the 
subject.  The subject is about solving and somehow finding a way 
to prevent horrific crimes against our children.  This may help, 
just as our CPIC system may help.  It does not solve it all.  I 
am the first to admit that.  That is why I am willing to support 
the motion.  It is an add-on.  It is an addition.  It is 
something else that might help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the province of Ontario has put in place is a system 
whereby the convicted pedophiles are released from jail and have 
to register where they are living.  They have to register within 
15 days where they are moving to or after they have moved.  If 
they fail to do that, they can be arrested.  They can be fined a 
minimum of, I think, $25,000 or receive one year in prison.  For 
subsequent offences, it is another $25,000 or two years in 
prison, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is a mechanism, so that if in fact the police are able 
to find these individuals, if the police happen to pull them over 
in some kind of a traffic violation, if they are arrested in some 
other scenario or if the police come across them, the police will 
be able to find out whether or not these individuals have indeed 
registered where they are living.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a panacea.  The member says we are missing the point 
when we compare the registration of weapons.  A sick pedophile is 
a weapon, without a doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  So register them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member says that we should 
register them.  We will, as I said in the beginning.  Those guys 
cannot take yes for an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are agreeing with the motion, not because it is politically 
expedient or somehow we can stand and say that only we on this 
side of the House want to stop the terrible travesty of having 
our young people raped and murdered.  We do not say we are the 
only ones with a social conscience, with a respect for justice or 
with a concern for our kids.  That is what I have been hearing 
all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Christopher's Law does is put in place a system.  Members 
opposite say the gun registry is no good and that it will not 
work because criminals will not register their guns.  That is not 
a bad point.  Are we then to say we will not do this because 
convicted pedophiles will not register their addresses?  That is 
the point.  Will it solve the problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  There is a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I understand the difference.  The 
member should not worry.  I am not picking on him.  I have been 
nice to him lately.  He should settle down.  I do not want the 
member for Wild Rose to have another heart attack at my expense 
so he should take it easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that if we are counting on all these people to 
register we should at least recognize it is only one more thing 
we can do to try to solve the problem.  If they honestly believe 
we have seen the end of pedophilia, or that we will never see 
another tragedy like Abby Drover or like Christopher, I say with 
all due respect to the mover and his colleagues that they are 
very naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the total solution is except for the Bernardo 
solution: declare them dangerous offenders.  The man who did what 
he did to Abby Drover 24 years ago was not declared because there 
was not a dangerous offender section in the Criminal Code of 
Canada at the time.  It is there now, and it has been used and 
will be used to ensure that these monsters are not allowed to 
prey on our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tell me about Karla. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  He asks me to tell him about Karla. 
Let us take a look at what the conviction is about.  It is a 
different issue and they know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone think we like that?  Does anyone in the country like 
the fact that she was able to cut a deal because evidence was not 
found by the police officers when they did their investigation? 
They had to make a deal to get a conviction against Paul 
Bernardo.  After they made the deal they found the tapes in the 
ceiling.  Does anyone like that?  Absolutely no one likes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Stay on the topic at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The topic at hand is about creating a 
registry system for convicted sex offenders who commit sex 
crimes, particularly against children.  I do not think anyone 
around here would say this is a bad idea.  I wish it would have 
been put forward in the spirit in which it was intended: to try 
to solve the problem instead of grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the story of when the Leader of the Opposition was 
in Alberta.  He decided he would publicly write to criticize a 
local lawyer-school trustee because he had the unmitigated gall 
to take a case defending someone who had been charged, not 
convicted but charged, with pedophilia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  As we started out I had hoped that all members would 
treat this subject with the respect it deserves in the House of 
Commons and not slag on one another or one another's parties.  It 
is much too delicate a subject. 
I would hope that the member would keep the subject as delicate 
as possible without the slagging.  It would help a lot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel duly admonished. 
The point I am trying to make is that we must find solutions for 
the problem that work.  I have not seen anybody in this place on 
either side, other than the dangerous offender declaration, come 
up with something that will solve the problem.  This will not do 
that.  I think we should do it but it will not solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dangerous offender aspect of it does at least create the 
ability for us to ensure, as in the case of Paul Bernardo, that 
he lives in his little cell and is locked up for the rest of his 
life.  I could care less if he watches a colour television as 
long as he does not get out on the street to do what he did to 
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we care about, how to solve that problem.  That is 
an aspect of our justice system that has evolved.  I recognize 
that it evolved too late for my friend's case in point in his 
riding 24 years ago.  Not all problems can be solved instantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerns me when we think that one way of dealing with it 
will eliminate all the problems.  I heard one member opposite 
make the statement that rehab does not work.  When the Ontario 
government to its credit brought in Christopher's Law it was 
supported on all sides of the House.  Had I still been in the 
Ontario legislature I too would have supported it.  However, it 
did something that was not talked about in its press releases or 
other information.  It cut funding to treatment by 85%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we just wash our hands and say that as long as we have a 
registry where these people can register their addresses we do 
not need to worry?  Can we say that as long as we have the CPIC 
system that allows volunteer organizations and sports groups to 
do background checks, and that as long as there is all the good 
due diligence that is required and necessary and should be done 
by anybody, we can sleep at night and have what the member 
referred to as a feeling of safety in our communities?  We know 
that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do?  Do we just ignore the treatment side of it? 
The inquest jury into Christopher Stephenson's death recommended 
a number of things over and above something like a registry.  It 
recommended that funding be provided for research into 
psychopathy and sexual disorders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it in the makeup of human beings that would drive them 
to sexually abuse a child? God knows none of us in here would 
understand it.  Should we not try to understand it?  Should we 
not put money into research to try to find out what it is that 
drives and motivates that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Nobody disagrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The funding for exactly that kind of 
research has been cut by 85% in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that would solve all the problems either.  I have 
said and continue to say that there is not one issue.  There is 
not a panacea, save and except the Paul Bernardo solution.  If 
that is what we will do, simply lock up dangerous offenders and 
never deal with anything, then I am afraid we will have jails 
full of people.  We will have serious cost implications and we 
will not be dealing with the broader picture, the societal

</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are indeed dangerous offenders, if they are declared 
dangerous offenders, then that is what should happen to them. 
Under the current justice system that is exactly what happens to 
them when they are declared dangerous offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustration is that some people opposite would not suggest 
that we deal with some form of research into what drives it and 
what causes it.  Is it a chemical imbalance?  Is it abuse by an 
parent somewhere in the past?  Did they suffer through some 
problems perhaps in school?  What has driven them to this 
situation in life?  With this registry how do we control the 
person who lives in Brampton where Christopher was murdered and 
decides to travel across Canada?  I do not see that here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry system in Ontario provides that they will give 
their name to the police, that it will be registered and that 
they must continue to register it for a period that approximates 
the time they were incarcerated.  If it is a 10 year sentence it 
will be a 10 year registration period, but then it is over.  What 
happens in the 11th year?  Do we say we have not spent any money 
on research and therefore do not understand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will support the bill but I think we all collectively need, as 
much as possible in a non-partisan way, to find better solutions 
than just simply having a registry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened for 20 minutes to the hon. member for 
Mississauga West going through his rendition of how he sees this 
bill coming into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he has concentrated, as have most members on the Liberal 
side of the House today, on the value of CPIC as a form of 
registration.  Yes, CPIC is a tool.  It is a tool used by the 
police.  That is what it is designed for.  It is designed to 
collect and build up a database on the criminal pasts of many 
people.  Sex offenders certainly would be part and parcel of that 
whole affair.  Nobody denies that CPIC is a tool.  However we are 
talking about something far beyond what CPIC provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a police officer for 22 years I know the value of CPIC.  I 
also know it does not track pedophiles or sexual offenders.  It 
does not require sexual offenders to register.  That is the 
downfall of relying solely on the CPIC system that is designed 
for a police database and expecting it to account for that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the member realizes that CPIC is not the total 
panacea.  It will not fix everything.  This registry, I believe, 
will be a leap forward in making sex offenders more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the CPIC situation, what happens if a pedophile 
changes his name?  They do that on a regular basis while in jail. 
What happens if a sex offender has a pardon?  That is as much a 
part of the process as it is for any criminal.  They are changing 
their names and receiving pardons, and a stop by a police officer 
on the street or even a check on the CPIC system will not reveal 
that they are in fact a criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  What if they are out on parole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Or if they are out on parole.  There are 
a myriad of things that must be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are questions I would like the member to answer.  The one 
thing I feel is probably the most important, and I think other 
jurisdictions have really come to grips with this issue, is 
placing the onus on the sex offender to keep the registry 
current.  CPIC does not track an offender if he goes from Halifax 
to Vancouver.  These characters are very crafty.  Sex offenders 
are probably the most manipulative of all criminals when we look 
at how they operate just to get hold of our kids.  On that basis, 
I would like the hon. member to comment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  In my opinion the 
yeas have it.  The Chair sees four members standing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I am simply trying to clarify what is happening here. 
You called the vote on the motion and as I recall most people 
said carried.  You called for yeas.  Everybody on the government 
side of the House said, yes, carried and you said the yeas have 
it.  Then the members of the Alliance stood, but only four stood 
to request a recorded division.  Is that right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, we had agreed and we want 
a standing vote.  Under the provisions of getting a vote that is 
the way we had to do it.  I hope the Liberals understand that we 
want this vote on a national sex offender registry recorded. 
That is all we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Madam Speaker, everybody agreed 
to the motion in the name of the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford.  Obviously he stood up and voted against his 
own motion.  How can that be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  We will call in the 
members because, I have to admit, members of the opposition were 
up and down.  There were four to six members standing but I 
believe the consensus among the House leaders was that there 
would be a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And more than five members having risen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Call in the members.

Bill C-247, an act to amend the Criminal Code (forfeiture of 
property relating to child pornography crimes), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to 
once again present my bill, Bill C-247.  For those who do not 
have a copy in front of them, Bill C-247 is an amendment to 
section 163.1 of the criminal code which would allow a court that 
convicts a person of an offence under those provisions to order 
the forfeiture of anything by means of which or in relation to 
which the offence was committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start, I would like to recognize a number of people who 
have helped me with this process.  One of the main drives behind 
this bill and this initiative is Detective Inspector Bob 
Matthews.  He is the head of Canada's lead agency in the fight 
against child pornography.  That is the 16 member Ontario 
Provincial Police child pornography unit, project P.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Detective Inspector Matthews is a widely respected voice in the 
debate between free speech advocates and law enforcement, and is 
one of Canada's top law enforcement agents in the field of child 
pornography investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second person I wish to thank is Detective Noreen Waters of 
the Organized Crime Agency of British Columbia.  Detective Waters 
has been a child pornography investigator for eight years and was 
part of the team that brought in the now infamous John Robin 
Sharpe.  She has been an enthusiastic supporter of our bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank Sergeant Randy Brennan of the 
Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police high tech unit. Sergeant Brennan 
has been involved in many successful child pornography 
investigations and is a valuable source of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to recognize Mr. Steve Sullivan, the hardworking 
president and CEO of the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of 
Crime.  Steve has been a tireless advocate of victim's rights and 
has worked with members of parliament to change the justice 
system to place the rights of victims before criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on.  These individuals and many other law 
enforcement officers, victim's advocates, federal 
parliamentarians, provincial justice ministers and everyday 
normal Canadians from across this country have contacted me and 
offered their support.  I want to thank these concerned Canadians 
and tell them to keep up the good work.  I also want to thank 
them for fighting to protect children because today more than 
ever they need our help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to broaden the theme of my speech today to discuss the 
challenges of controlling child pornography in today's Internet 
age.  In my speech I hope to expose the depth of the problem 
facing policy makers and law enforcement. I also wish to share 
with members and viewers some of the ideas that I have to tackle 
these challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the root of these challenges lies the hydra like nature of 
the Internet.  In its humble fledgling as a forum for academia 
and the military, the Internet was boring and difficult to 
navigate.  It contained only dry text, no images or flashy 
graphics.  However the creation of the graphical interface known 
as the worldwide web in 1993 has created a surge in popularity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From just over 100 sites in 1993, the web has exploded to the 
point where some industry experts estimate that over 800 million 
web pages exist today with some 160,000 pages being added each 
and every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet has revolutionized communications.  Most of us in 
the House did not even know what e-mail was up until five years 
ago, yet today our children and our grandchildren are growing up 
having never known anything else but instantaneous communication. 
Businesses, organizations, government agencies and individuals 
have seized upon this technology by setting up websites and 
revolutionizing the interaction between people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in all facets of life there are decent, virtuous online users 
and there are deviant predators making use of this potent tool. 
In his report “Innocence Exploited: Child Pornography in the 
Electronic Age” prepared for the Canadian Police College, 
Winnipeg Professor Doug Skoog estimates that there are at least 
one million pornographic images of children on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Detective Waters shared recent statistics with me that estimate 
that 53% of Internet traffic is concerned with sexually explicit 
material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calgary police detective Butch Dickens of the vice unit had this 
to say about child pornography on the Internet in a newspaper 
article last year.  He states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago, we probably only got one phone call a month about it. 
Now we get four a day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the advent of the worldwide web, child pornography 
detectives around the world could say with confidence that they 
were winning the war against child pornography.  The old methods 
of creation and distribution were extremely perilous.  Carefully 
arranged meetings, secret mailing lists and postal drops placed 
pedophiles at tremendous risk of being caught and punished. Those 
days are gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inspector Bob Matthews relates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet has become almost the perfect vehicle for pedophiles 
to distribute child pornography, the reason being that at the 
stroke of a key, anyone can send large volumes of information 
from one country to another without being detected by the 
authorities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anonymity offered by the Internet allows child molesters to 
stalk their victims in their homes, schools and libraries without 
ever being physically present in any of those places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are a few of the techniques they use to exploit 
children:  Chatting online, Internet chat rooms, where users can 
send type to each other in real time, provide plentiful hunting 
grounds where child pornographers can stalk their young victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next one is the sex tourism trade.  With the increase in use 
of the Internet for the sex trade and sexual abuse against 
children, the number of websites providing information to 
travelling pedophiles has increased dramatically and is extremely 
explicit in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another technique is image morphing.  With a decent computer and 
a little skill child pornographers can turn almost any picture 
into a pornographic image.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the worst of all is real time molestation, or streaming 
video, which shows live video on the Internet and enables child 
molesters to display their victims in real time to selected 
members of child pornography rings and clubs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Skilled child pornographers will encrypt their messages, 
rendering them unreadable to outsiders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the ways that they have been intruding into 
our homes and the lives of our children using the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who were once confident that living in a small town 
would insulate them from the troubles associated with big cities 
can no longer be unmindful about the security of their children. 
With the click of a mouse, children in remote areas can be 
exposed to the seamy underside of the net.  In what is becoming 
an all too often occurrence, cases are occurring where children 
under the age of 18 are being threatened or even molested by 
someone they met online. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July of last year, a 45 year old man from the P.E.I. town of 
Summerside plead guilty to a child pornography charge.  He had 
secretly videotaped a 14 year old girl whom he had coerced into 
doing a striptease and then played it live on the Internet for 
viewers in a special interactive online chat room.  That same 
month, on the other side of our country, police arrested a 28 
year old Washington man in the ferry line up, ready to leave 
Vancouver Island.  Police found a 14 year old B.C. girl in his 
van.  They had been exchanging e-mails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of last year, the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> reported that an 18 
year old man was arrested and charged with possession and 
distribution of child pornography.  An undercover police officer 
met the man online while the accused was looking for a partner in 
a plot to kidnap, rape and kill a young child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While for pedophiles, child molesters and pornographers the 
Internet is like a dream come true, it has become a nightmare for 
decent Canadians.  The downward spiral into child exploitation 
usually commences with the collection of child pornography, 
progressing to sexually explicit online conversations with 
youngsters and eventually seeking child victims online for sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, authorities can only act when the pedophile acts on 
his urges.  Experts report that before they are arrested, the 
average child molesting pedophile abuses 35 children.  They will 
share methods and techniques in finding children, gaining their 
trust and facilitating seduction.  Along the way many, 
compulsively save mementoes to validate their actions.  This is 
how child pornography is created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, understanding the problem, as difficult as it may be, 
is only half the job.  Problems require solutions.  Some of those 
concerned about this problem advocate complete censorship and 
regulation of anything that appears online.  Others lecture that 
any restriction on speech is unacceptable and prefer to place the 
responsibility on the users.  The answer lies somewhere in the 
middle of these two polar viewpoints.  As policy makers, it is 
our task to strike that balance, for we alone have the democratic 
mandate of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after her swearing in as chief justice of the supreme 
court, Madame Justice Beverley McLachlin predicted the court 
would deal extensively with issues of computer crime.  The court, 
she said, would have to find ways to cope with offences that were 
international in scope, given the breadth of the Internet and 
computer communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong, effective legislation is one way the impact of child 
pornographers can be reduced.  The supreme court did the right 
thing in upholding the ban on this illicit material in the Sharpe 
case, but now we must provide another tool to the justice system 
to stem the tide of child pornography flooding the web. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, in the wake of the R. v Butler decision, parliament 
passed Bill C-128, criminalizing all aspects of child 
pornography, including the creation, distribution, importation 
and possession of such material.  It is considered among the 
strongest anti-child pornography legislation in the world.  That 
is something of which all Canadians can be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, a provision ordering forfeiture of equipment was 
omitted.  This omission can be best described as an oversight 
when one considers forfeiture orders exist in 55 different 
federal statutes and in various places in the criminal code. 
This clearly demonstrates the justice system is not opposed to 
such penalties for criminals.  To correct this omission in the 
law, I introduced C-247, which would have given courts the 
authority to order forfeiture, providing police with an extra 
weapon in their fight against child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, forfeiture of equipment, in the context of a child 
pornography offence, is handled differently across the country. 
In Ontario the equipment is often forfeited as part of a 
bartering between the defence and the prosecution.  In British 
Columbia prosecutors rarely ask for equipment to be turned over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To see the danger in this patchwork practice a little insight is 
required into how charges under Section 163.1 of the criminal 
code are dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must struggle to conceive of a crime more horrible than the 
sexual victimization of children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the strong public condemnation of child pornography, 
many offenders will do anything to keep their names out of the 
public domain, often eagerly agreeing to plea bargains, resulting 
in reduced sentences and often with no jail time.  This creates a 
situation where the case law on this section is scant because the 
courts have had few opportunities to comment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More dangerous is the fact that these plea bargains often allow 
the offender to return to the same environment in which he 
initially committed his crime.  Returning him to that environment 
with high tech equipment intact is a temptation that could prove 
too strong to resist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By ordering forfeiture, I believe the risk of recurrence can be 
lowered.  Because a child pornography addiction is fueled by 
psychological problems, not by profit, many offenders will have 
limited means.  Indeed, their compulsion likely creates financial 
hardship as the individual spends much of his free time and money 
in pursuit of his fantasy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confiscating several thousand dollars worth of computer 
equipment and perhaps even a vehicle or something more 
substantial will create a financial barrier to reoffending.  I 
understand it is only money and does not address the root of the 
problem, but it is one way we can slow down the traffic in this 
repulsive time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology of our rapidly changing world continues to create 
legislative challenges for parliament.  Expanding the 
legislation, filling in the holes, adapting to change, as we are 
trying to do, is necessary.  Criminals do not stand still and 
neither should we. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is out of my concern for the safety of Canadian children that 
I took this initiative, researched the issue of child pornography 
and the Internet and tabled the bill.  I acknowledge that my bill 
may not have been written in the most precise of legal 
terminology, but I am nevertheless disappointed that it was not 
deemed votable this year, as it was last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took on the challenge of tabling a private member's bill, a 
justice themed bill no less, knowing the odds were stacked 
against my success, but I did it because I believe in the spirit 
of the bill and I could not stand by without doing something to 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to take some time to think of the difference, 
even if it is a small difference, that the bill could make in the 
fight against child pornography so that one like it may return to 
the order paper in the near future.  I implore the justice 
minister to take the spirit of the bill and enshrine it in law. 
Consider the law enforcement agents who have made it their life's 
work to make our country safe from the perversions of these child 
molesters.  Think of the victims of these cold-blooded criminals 
and help us make a difference. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in the second reading debate of Bill 
C-247, an act to amend the criminal code, forfeiture of property 
relating to child pornography crimes.  I share the hon. member's 
concern about child pornography and I congratulate him for 
introducing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that the concern about protecting 
children from predators is also of primary concern to the 
government.  The Speech from the Throne was clear on that point. 
In the Speech from the Throne our government stated its full 
intention to “act to safeguard children from crimes, including 
criminals on the Internet” and to “take steps to ensure that 
our laws protect children from those who prey on their 
vulnerability”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that our children are the most vulnerable 
members of our society and we must do all we can to protect them 
from harm.  No one will deny that child pornography seriously 
harms children.  It does so in at least two ways.  It creates a 
permanent record of the sexual abuse of children and it 
perpetuates the message that children are appropriate sexual 
objects.  Indeed, they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child pornography was specifically prohibited by an amendment to 
the criminal code enacted in 1993.  This amendment, which is now 
163.1 of the criminal code, creates new offences for the 
production, importation, distribution, sale, possession for 
purposes of sale or distribution and simple possession of child 
pornography.  All these offences carry a greater penalty than the 
offences prohibiting obscene materials involving adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These criminal code provisions against child pornography were 
enacted to respond to the prevailing practices at the time. 
These practices were still primarily paper oriented and involved 
mechanical production and physical distribution practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the current offences have been successfully applied to 
electronic practices relating to child pornography, no one in 
1993 anticipated the technological advances that were experienced 
in the last five years.  No one anticipated how quickly new 
technologies would be embraced by such a large portion of the 
population, particularly young people.  In particular, it was not 
anticipated at the time that computer systems, including the 
Internet, would become the instruments of choice for trading 
child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet has made it easier to communicate valuable 
information and carry on discussions on all kinds of subjects 
with people who share similar interests.  Unfortunately, it has 
made it easier to disseminate and collect images of child 
pornography. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the time has come to take a close look at the child 
pornography provisions in order to determine whether they still 
apply to current practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-247, like the purpose of Bill C-321 
introduced by the hon. member for Lethbridge in the previous 
parliament, is to create an additional deterrent to the 
commission of a child pornography offence.  The bill would add a 
component to the sentence currently available under the criminal 
code and deprive the person convicted of the offence of all tools 
and instruments that were used to commit the offence.  The bill 
would provide for the forfeiture of these instruments to the 
crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the hon. member has added to the bill an element that was 
lacking in Bill C-321.  It now specifies that an order cannot be 
made in respect to a thing that is not the property of a person 
who is not a party to the offence.  It also specifically excludes 
the forfeiture of communications facilities and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that these changes make the bill more sound. However 
I have some questions on the working of the provisions as 
drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, while the bill provides that the judge should not 
order forfeiture when the person guilty of the offence is not the 
owner of the thing, it does not provide for the manner in which 
the owner would have his or her right to the property recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for introducing the bill.  It is a 
step in the right direction in our fight against child 
pornography.  I support the principle of the bill.  However more 
must be done if we want to adequately protect our children 
against sexual exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has a bill currently on notice.  The 
hon. member might be pleasantly surprised when he sees it after 
introduction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
too must congratulate the member on his tenacity when it comes 
to this issue because, in an earlier parliament, he introduced a 
similar bill.  He made certain amendments in response to 
comments made in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have a bill that is, all in all, very acceptable.  I 
would immediately say to the member that he has the full support 
of the Bloc Quebecois in his efforts to have the criminal code 
amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the third member to speak.  Those members of the House who 
are listening are aware of the bill and the amendments. 
I just want to remind them, and I will do this quickly, that the 
primary purpose of the bill is to protect some very vulnerable 
people, children, from actions of adults which are completely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, of all the offences mentioned in the criminal 
code, those involving child pornography, using children for 
sexual purposes, are the most serious.  Amending the criminal 
code to permit the seizure of any thing used by the offender for 
child pornography, for these very reprehensible actions, has my 
full support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian Alliance member noted, many of Canada's 
statutes, including the criminal code, provide for the seizure 
of certain property in certain cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example familiar to everyone, from the Tobacco Act. 
When people smuggle cigarettes, when they have contraband 
cigarettes in a vehicle, the vehicle is seized because it was 
being used to break the law, to seek to commit an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not apply this to computer equipment, since more and more 
people have computers, and computers are more and more powerful, 
and can yield far more information?  Why not allow police forces 
and the justice system to seize these assets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was a mistake made when the government amended section 163 in a 
previous parliament without allowing such a seizure? 
Perhaps it was, and perhaps not. At that time, I did not 
consider it a priority or a goal in itself to seize computers 
that had been used to view images of child pornography.  Today, 
however, I think we need to conclude that yes, seizing these 
assets that have been used by the offender would be a normal 
thing to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording would, I believe, allow this to dovetail very nicely 
with the section of the criminal code. 
It is also in keeping with the philosophy of the criminal code 
and related legislation allowing police and crown prosecutors to 
impose a sentence on the individual who has been found guilty, 
to impose a fine, but, more importantly, it sends a fairly 
strong signal that computers are not intended for such purposes 
and that individuals caught using them for those purposes stand 
to have their computer confiscated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point the member has added in his bill, from the 
remarks made in the House when Bill C-321 was introduced, concerns 
the restrictions on the assets of third parties in order to 
protect people who lend their computer to a friend or employers 
who are not aware what employees are doing at lunch with office 
equipment. 
Just like that, because the individual is caught at child 
pornography sites, the computer loaned by a friend or belonging 
to the employer is confiscated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 163.2(2) included in the bill provides a restriction to 
the effect that the equipment or computers will not be seized 
because they belong to a third party who was unaware of the use 
being made of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, when we debated the bill in the House, this was our 
greatest concern.  Today, we note that, on the whole, the 
remarks and adjustments made in this clause with respect to the 
amendment of the criminal code fully satisfy the concerns of the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, we offer the hon. member our full co-operation and 
support this approach.  We hope that we will find these 
amendments in the criminal code one day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for Lethbridge for his efforts on this file and 
for the opportunity to denounce child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Saint John and my party support the bill with 
great enthusiasm and with a strong determination to stop the 
creation, production and distribution of child pornography. 
<I>Hansard</I> will show that it is not the first time I have 
risen in the House to denounce the sexual abuse of our children. 
When I rose earlier this afternoon I said that there was nothing 
that hurt or saddened me more than when a child was abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was some time ago that one of the hon. members on the 
government side brought forth a bill to make changes to the 
criminal code.  It would have allowed the RCMP or the police 
department to enter a home and seize material, where it was 
suspected that a person was dealing in child pornography and had 
pictures and other material.  As hon. members know, it went 
through the process and it was not changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Prime Minister a question at the time and he assured 
me afterwards by saying that he did not believe in child 
pornography and that the government would straighten it out 
sooner or later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight members on both sides of the House voted on a national 
registry to try to put a stop to sexual abuse of children.  Once 
again we have again another opportunity to do what is right for 
our young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear when I say that we consider child pornography to 
be nothing short of child abuse.  I will not hold back from 
saying that I believe child pornography is not only disgusting 
but that those who take pleasure in it are sick and perverted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  You can say that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  I will say it again.  They are sick and 
perverted.  They truly are.  It is only logical therefore that 
anyone who seeks to participate in this obscene trade should have 
the tools of the trade seized by authorities and destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws of Canada and the charter of rights and freedoms must 
not be used as a shield for those who would seek to corrupt and 
exploit our very young.  Any just society must balance the rights 
it extends to its citizens with the responsibility it expects its 
citizens to undertake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons violating the spirit of the law should not be afforded 
any protection by the mere letter of the law.  Canadians are 
compassionate and understanding.  We are a patient and respectful 
people who have on many occasions sent our sons and daughters 
into harm's way to protect our way of living.  Yet when the 
system, whatever its best intentions, becomes a tool for evil it 
should not be left unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today we debated a national sex offender registry.  I 
said then that we had a duty and an obligation as representatives 
of the people to take the action required to protect our people. 
Tonight we are fortunate to have another opportunity to send to 
the government a clear signal on what action is required for the 
sake of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that our plea falls on the same compassionate ears that 
heard our call this afternoon for the national sex offender 
registry.  I hope that the same courageous members on the 
government benches that saw fit to support that registry will 
stand with us again on Bill C-247. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There comes a time in public life when we are forced to decide 
on a personal course of action.  We sit down with a piece of 
legislation to try to determine what the people who elected us 
would want us to do.  We have before us an excellent piece of 
legislation and one that I know my people back home in Saint 
John, New Brunswick, would cheer with a loud chorus of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House would suspect that I find pornography in any form to 
be distasteful and degrading.  If it were possible for me to 
detest one form of pornography over all others, it would be child 
pornography.  The House knows that I am a mother and a 
grandmother.  To think that someone could do this with my 
grandson or my granddaughter, I will fight that tooth and nail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House knows that I have tried to use my time in public 
service to work with children and families in need, not only in 
Saint John but across the country.  It is for these reasons and 
many more that even the thought of someone profiting from the 
illicit trade of child pornography makes me feel very ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that the Minister of Justice has wrestled with the 
same issues for some time.  I know that various members on the 
government back benches have been forced to hold back tears in 
the past because they have not seen their government take the 
decisive action against the disgusting child pornography problem. 
We saw it with that man out in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider Bill C-247 to be a solid first strike against the 
child pornography trade.  It would give pause to those who deal 
in this perverted trafficking.  The hon. member for Lethbridge 
has ensured that we remain as respectful as possible to property 
rights of law-abiding Canadians.  Bill C-247 is clear in its 
limitations and clear to avoid the unlawful seizure or forfeiture 
of the property of those who are not a party to child pornography 
offences.  It is a necessary limitation and one that strengthens 
the legislation and the laws it seeks to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may not recall that my cousin is Gordon Fairweather. 
He stood side by side with John Diefenbaker when they first 
crafted the bill of rights.  I know that when they set out to 
protect the rights of Canadians they did not do so with the 
intent of protecting criminals or the tools of their trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the charter of rights and freedoms was being crafted it was 
not created to shield those who would seek to abuse and exploit 
children.  Knowing this, I say without hesitation that Bill C-247 
is in keeping with the best intentions of both the bill of rights 
and the charter of rights and freedoms.  If my cousin Gordon 
Fairweather were back here, he would be with the hon. member for 
Lethbridge all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a step worth taking to strengthen the security of our 
children from the clutches of truly depraved individuals. Even if 
one child is spared from exploitation and abuse by the child 
pornography trade, and it is a trade by its very nature, it will 
have been all worth while.  That said, could we deny our families 
that added security for mere partisan political reasons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not support Bill C-247 are we not saying that we accept 
in some form or another that child pornography is tolerable?  Is 
that the message we want to send out to the mothers and fathers 
of Canadian children?  Is that the message we want to send out to 
my grandson Matthew and granddaughter Lindsay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a duty and obligation to all Canadians to deliver them 
from evil and to protect them from injustice.  We have a duty and 
obligation to every generation of children to make them safer 
from the generation before them.  This is the mantle of 
responsibility we all assumed when we put our names on the ballot 
last fall.  It is a duty from which we must not shy away.  I 
fully support Bill C-247 and so do my colleagues in the PC Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I too commend my colleague from Lethbridge for 
bringing forward this very important bill.  I know he has worked 
very hard behind the scenes gathering support from many 
organizations, groups, police associations and those involved in 
having to deal with the issue firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged tonight by the debate I have heard in the House 
from members of all parties who have spoken in favour of the 
bill.  It is fitting that we would be debating this topic on the 
evening where we also, as was indicated by my hon. colleague from 
Saint John and others, worked together to support the creation of 
a national registry for sex offenders.  It is a great 
accomplishment that we have been able to achieve together in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the debate was a little off topic today and somewhat 
partisan at times, but for the most part it was not.  That is 
encouraging.  The legislation fits very much into that very same 
category.  Who could stand in the House and defend child 
pornography?  No one has tonight and no one will.  We understand 
the seriousness of the issue.  The bill being brought forward by 
my colleague is another tool being offered as a way to combat a 
very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By focusing on important issues, it is time that we work 
together in the House.  We must look to build with each other on 
the commonalities, across party lines, including government 
members, to solve the issues before us.  That is what people are 
looking for, from those of us who have been sent as leaders to 
this place.  It is with passion, conviction and strength of mind 
that we must work together to solve these very serious issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of child pornography is one that has a very great 
implication.  Our children are our greatest resource.  There is 
nothing we could hold more dear than the health and well-being of 
our children, the next generation coming up behind us, not only 
for ourselves as individuals, as members, as families and as 
communities but for the future of our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A big part of the health of our children has to with protecting 
them.  We only have the opportunity to live as children once in 
this life.  We have all experienced that.  We are involved in the 
joys, triumphs, tragedies and moment to moment involvements with 
children in our families, or those without children with 
relatives.  We know this is a very important thing to focus our 
attention on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are individuals involved in activities that will 
harm children.  Child pornography is one of them.  My colleague, 
the member for Erie—Lincoln, the parliamentary secretary, raised 
some very good points.  I agree with what he said on those 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned two points about the crime of child pornography 
creating a permanent record of the abuse of children.  For that 
very reason it is wrong to be participating in such an action. 
The creation of child pornography creates victims itself.  This 
causes not only great damage for those children who are victims 
of those crimes, but they are then a part of this permanent 
record that is being used, abused and displayed on the Internet 
and other ways.  It is at the very hub of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It violates what is right.  It is wrong to be involved in child 
pornography.  It causes children to be abused by creating a 
permanent record of that.  My colleague's bill attempts to 
address that.  The bill attempts to shut this down.  It is to be 
used as a tool to help stop the spread of this issue of child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will agree with my colleague from Saint John when she said it 
was evil.  We have the right as members in this place to say such 
things because it is truly wrong.  I believe there is such a 
thing as right and wrong.  Many of my colleagues would agree with 
this particular point.  Let us build on what we can agree on and 
we can agree.  Tonight we heard that we agree child pornography 
is wrong.  This is a bill that is being introduced to help 
address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was encouraged by my colleague for Erie—Lincoln who said 
changes will be coming to the criminal code.  I can only hope and 
encourage him to work with his government.  We will work together 
to bring these changes forward, to incorporate this forfeiture 
clause that my colleague brought forward, so we can help stop the 
wrongs that are occurring.  We can help stop the individuals who 
are involved in this industry.  We can help stop the wrongs that 
are being perpetrated against our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have indicated inadvertently in my earlier comment that I 
do not have children.  I would like to correct that because I 
have four young children.  My oldest daughter is 10 and my 
youngest, who is a son, is four years old.  The others are six 
and eight.  This is an issue that strikes at home for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked for 10 years as an elementary school teacher.  I was 
able to see the need for our children to be protected, not only 
in our homes and communities but in our institutions like schools 
and in other areas.  Those who attempt to abuse children in this 
way find their way into those areas of protection that are 
supposed to be safe havens for our children.  We need to be on 
guard for that.  With the tools suggested in this piece of 
legislation from my colleague from Lethbridge, we need to be able 
to shut down this kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the agreement tonight from all parties on 
this issue.  In fact, we have agreed that child pornography is 
wrong.  This amendment should move forward and should be put into 
practice immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wonderful if we could do that tonight, on a 
night where we have already had agreement on a major issue having 
to do with protecting our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not wait another day.  We should move forward on this 
issue right away.  Our children are our most valued resource.  We 
need to show, not only in our words but in our actions, that we 
mean that.  There is an opportunity to do that tonight.  I hope 
we speak loudly with our words on things that need to be fixed, 
but even more loudly with our actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to commend my colleague, the member for 
from Lethbridge, once again.  We do not care who gets credit for 
the idea or the issue, we want to see it put in place no matter 
where it comes from.  That is why I think there would be 
agreement on this issue from all members.  We need to move 
forward on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to lend my support to Bill C-247, tabled in the House by the 
hon. member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House was seized with the issue of child pornography, 
probably polarized mostly by the Sharpe case, the B.C. case where 
the constitutionality of our laws on the possession of child 
pornography were challenged in the B.C. court.  In fact the court 
case was lost.  As members will recall this was quite outrageous 
to Canadians at large and certainly to everyone in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have a process and that process led that case, not 
only through the B.C. Court of Appeal but also right to the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  I think we are all very grateful that 
the decision of the supreme court upheld the law.  However, in a 
way that raised some interesting questions for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the member has brought forward a bill that 
addresses another element of the child pornography issue, 
probably should remind us that we should continue to work on 
developing good legislation, step by step, to be sure that we 
deal with many of the items which hon. members have raised in the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill seeks to provide the court with the 
discretion to forfeit anything by means of which, or in relation 
to which, a child pornography offence was committed.  It 
basically says that the tools of the person who was in possession 
of or creating child pornography would be forfeited to the crown. 
There were some questions raised by the parliamentary secretary 
with regard to this matter, but the questions are resolvable. 
Fundamentally, the proposal is sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know this is a non-votable matter.  That is unfortunate 
because when items like this come before the House, especially 
when they are so important, not only to the members proposing it 
but to Canadians in this case, there should be a greater debate. 
Using it as a starting point, we can make it deal with the 
principle that has been raised by the bill.  We can work on the 
technicalities to make sure that the protection of third parties 
is dealt with.  We can make sure that, for instance, employers 
are protected in the event that an employee would use employer 
assets for the perpetration or production of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to lend my voice as support.  Members know that today 
we unanimously passed a resolution before the House to consider 
the creation of a national registry for sex offenders. 
It is characteristic that the motion was unanimously endorsed by 
the House.  We all want to be constructive and productive on 
legislation that will create a safer and healthier environment 
for our children and our families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for bringing this bill forward.  I am 
sorry that it is not votable but I think it is encouraging that 
the Ministry of Justice has indicated that the principle is a 
good one and that it will be dealt with by the government.  The 
member should take full credit for it when it happens.  I hope 
that he will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business is a maligned part of the business 
that we do in this place.  I cannot say that I am very happy with 
the way it works.  I have seen many good bills come before this 
place that were not votable and I have seen some questionable 
bills come before this place that were votable.  I am not sure 
whether the system right now is serving the best interests of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also lament the fact that so few private members' items ever 
get through the full cycle of second reading, committee 
consideration, third reading and report stage, as well as Senate 
review.  It is unfortunate because many good ideas do come 
forward to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members will remember this particular bill the next time 
we come around to a debate on the propriety of how we handle 
private members' business.  Perhaps they will use it as an 
example of just another good idea of members of parliament that 
somehow have to be set aside for the wrong reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member's thoughtfulness in bringing this bill 
forward to the House.  I think it is important to have every 
opportunity to talk about issues that are important to Canadians. 
This is a non-partisan issue.  We should be grateful to the 
member for raising it in the House today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, a few minutes is all the time I will need.  I want to 
say just a very few things in the highest support possible of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today has been a really heart-rending day in the House.  We have 
been dealing with issues which really in a respectable society 
should not even have to be mentioned.  We have been dealing with 
sexual predators.  Now in this evening's session, we are talking 
about a bill that would limit and restrict advantages that people 
can make in producing child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want it on record that I fully support this bill.  I am 
very concerned that in our society we somehow think that by 
passing a whole bunch of laws that we can make people good.  I do 
not think we can.  We have to really do what a number of members 
said in the debate; that is we have to look at moral teaching 
when these children are young, so they grow up to be responsible 
adults and behave in a socially acceptable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of law is still to restrict those who will not conform 
to that.  While law cannot make people good, it can serve to 
restrain the evil.  I think that is really the essence of what we 
are dealing with today and in this bill as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the member for Lethbridge for the bill. 
We need to support it.  I sincerely call upon the government to 
act, not just to engage in a bunch of nice words here, but to act 
and to put into place mechanisms that would fulfill what this 
bill requires.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank all members who spoke tonight for their support. 
This is obviously an issue that needs to be addressed.  As the 
member for Elk Island said, we have talked all day about the 
things that happen in our society that we should not really have 
to talk about but we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to give our law enforcement agencies and our courts the 
tools to do a good job, and that is where we went with this bill. 
The research that was done on it was to add one small item to 
their arsenal that would help them put a pedophile or a 
pornographer out of business for as long as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the comments made by the parliamentary 
secretary.  I will take him at his word that there are some 
changes to the criminal code coming down and that this particular 
aspect of the amendment to the code to allow for forfeiture will 
be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when the legislation comes before the House again 
there will be a public and open debate on it and all Canadians 
will have input.  Literally thousands of Canadians have supported 
me in this endeavour.  The Canadian Police Association on down 
through the police organizations in Canada have supported this 
bill as well. This is something that needs to be done and I am 
encouraged to hear that the government has recognized that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of our children and the Internet scares me.  I have 
two granddaughters, aged five and eight.  The five year old can 
sit down at the computer and make it do things that I cannot. 
This scares me but that is the way of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing I would like to leave with the people who are 
watching is that as parents we have to be diligent when our 
children are on the Internet and on the computer because there 
are all kinds of people on the Internet system who like to prey 
on kids.  Parents should keep an eye on what their children are 
doing and be aware of who they are talking to and the agreements 
that are being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
make this bill votable but I will take the parliamentary 
secretary at his word, that this bill will be included in the 
amendments that are coming in to the criminal code, and leave it 
at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LAKE SAINT-PIERRE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on February 26 
of this year, I asked the Minister of National Defence a 
question in the House about Lake Saint-Pierre.  The answer did 
not satisfy me, nor did it satisfy those who live on the shores 
of this body of water and even use it to earn their living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lake Saint-Pierre is one of the lakes which purify the St. 
Lawrence River.  It purifies the water from the Great Lakes, 
from cities such as Montreal, and from tributaries and various 
rivers.  UNESCO has recognized Lake Saint-Pierre as a world 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lake is extremely rich in flora and fauna.  There are 
professional fishers and hunters.  For fifty years now, the 
Canadian army has been firing shells into Lake Saint-Pierre, for 
training purposes I believe. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 40% of the southern section of Lac Saint-Pierre, some 
22 kilometres starting with the channel, belongs to the Canadian 
Forces.  The lake has been polluted by some 300,000 shells, 
8,000 to 10,000 of which are potentially dangerous.  They are 
moved around by the ice in the lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They travel so far that every year helicopters scan both shores 
of the St. Lawrence right up to Île d'Orléans to try to recover 
shells that had been carried away by the ice.  Even last year, a 
little girl found one, which most fortunately was disarmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking of the minister, on behalf of the users of Lac 
Saint-Pierre, is that it be restored to a safe condition, so that 
it can again be used as it ought to be.  It is nonsensical to 
say that it cannot be cleared because there are no known 
techniques for doing so.  This is not true.  There are 
techniques known at this time for clearing the lake, and even 
people prepared to bid on cleaning up the lake and removing the 
potentially dangerous shells in and around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore calling upon the minister to promptly review the 
Lac Saint-Pierre situation.  It is extremely important for the 
flora, the fauna and the users of the lake, both those who make 
a living from it and the tourists.  It is a huge tourist 
attraction, because it is a large lake, some fifty kilometres in 
length and some twenty wide, stretching from Trois-Rivières to 
the islands at Sorel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told it would be too costly. 
However, if the Canadian forces spend some $200 million on 
shells they say are no longer used, I think we could perhaps cut 
part of this money and take some $40 million a year to clean up 
this body of water.  This is what I am asking the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said “Yes, eventually.  We are studying and 
perhaps”. I say to the minister that this needs to be done 
urgently.  Every year the ice carries shells, and they are found 
along the shore of the St. Lawrence.  Action must be taken 
before something dramatic happens.  There has already been loss 
of life.  It could be even more serious, because some of these 
shells could be armed just by fishing gear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to cause anyone to panic, but Lac Saint-Pierre has 
to be cleaned up.  The Canadian forces, responsible for its 
pollution, have to do their job as user-payer. 
Companies are asked to clean up the sites they have polluted, 
but the Canadian forces have been polluting this lake for 50 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think urgent that the Minister of National Defence ask the 
Canadian forces to return the body of water to the state the 
users want it in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
sustaining and protecting the environment as well as human life 
are priorities for the Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Proof and Experimental Test Establishment at Nicolet, 
Quebec, has provided technical services and carried out munitions 
proof and engineering tests for the Department of National 
Defence since 1952. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ammunition tested at Lac St-Pierre is used by Canadian 
forces members on military operations all over the world as well 
as in their day to day training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of the munitions testing program is to ensure 
the safety of the men and women in the Canadian forces who use 
the ammunition.  We must have absolute confidence in the safety 
and suitability of our munitions.  Firing a small sample from 
each new lot of ammunition that is produced is the only way to 
ensure the safety and suitability of the ammunition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lac St-Pierre was initially selected because of its proximity to 
several munitions factories.  This rationale still holds. Testing 
at Lac St-Pierre minimizes the costs of transporting the 
ammunition as well as the public safety hazard associated with 
the transportation of live ammunition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence takes its public safety 
responsibilities very seriously.  It has always had an open 
relationship with local residents, working with them to satisfy 
their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the department also have a close working relationship with 
Environment Canada and provincial officials, and we ensure that 
all our activities comply with provincial standards and 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the early 1990s, we have cut test firings in half and 
reduced noise levels.  Almost all firings are now done through 
mufflers and all ammunition is now fired into a mound of earth 
from which we can recover the ammunition.  We no longer fire into 
Lac St-Pierre itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always undertaken measures to clean up projectiles. 
Every spring and summer the shoreline of Lac St-Pierre is 
examined for projectiles that have been freed from the lake bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, in 1999 DND began an environmental study of the 
sediments of Lac St-Pierre in co-operation with Environment 
Canada.  The study will be completed in the fall of 2001. 
Preliminary results indicate that the ordnance on the lake bed 
has not caused any environmental damage.  DND is also examining a
