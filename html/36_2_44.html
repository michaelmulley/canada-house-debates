<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MEMBER FOR WENTWORTH—BURLINGTON—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will now deliver my ruling on the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Athabasca 
concerning the use of his signature in support of Bill C-206, an 
act to amend the Access to Information Act and to make amendments 
to other acts, in the name of the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was originally introduced during the previous session, 
on October 23, 1997, as Bill C-264.  The member for 
Wentworth—Burlington gathered over 100 signatures in support of 
this bill, including the signature of the hon. member for 
Athabasca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 11, 1998, by unanimous consent, a different text was 
substituted for the original text of Bill C-264.  In the second 
session this bill was reinstated on October 14, 1999, in the same 
form as at prorogation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with Standing Order 87(6) the bill, supported by 
100 signatures, was placed on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complaint of the hon. member for Athabasca arises from the 
use made of his signature in helping to have his revised bill 
placed on the order of precedence.  This support, he maintained, 
was limited to Bill C-264 in its original form and the use of his 
signature for any other purpose constituted “false 
representation to gain unjust advantage”.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington claimed that he never 
intended to mislead the House by his use of the list nor did he 
feel that its use in support of Bill C-206 was illegitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his view, the signatures indicated only that the issue at 
which the bill was aimed was one deserving of debate.  He 
further maintained that the revisions to the bill in the 
previous session were, for the most part, of a technical nature 
and that no one had indicated any difficulty concerning them in 
the 19 months since they were placed before the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to all hon. members that the procedure at the heart 
of this issue is a relatively new one.  Standing Order 87(6) came 
into effect on February 1, 1999, as part of a small number of 
changes to our standing orders designed to further increase the 
opportunities that private members have to present their 
initiatives for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first paragraph of the standing order reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any time after the holding of the first draw in a Session, a 
Member may file with the Clerk a list containing the signatures 
of one hundred Members, including at least ten Members each from 
a majority of the recognized parties in the House, who support a 
specific item, sponsored by the Member, eligible to be placed in 
the order of precedence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An item supported in this way is then placed in the order of 
precedence provided that the member presenting it does not 
already have another item there and that only one such item at 
any time may be placed in the order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this is a new procedure.  The bill presented by the 
hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington is only the second to have 
been placed in the order of precedence pursuant to this standing 
order.  There are no previous rulings to which the Speaker can 
turn for guidance in such a case, nor were comments made in the 
House prior to the adoption of these new standing orders which 
might be of assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member signing such a list does not appear to be seconding the 
item, for which we have other procedures, but the exact meaning 
of placing a signature on the list is not clear.  Does such a 
signature represent support for the content of the item, or 
simply that the item be given precedence? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our new procedures to increase the opportunity of members to 
present their own initiatives are to be a success, we must 
ensure that we proceed on the basis of a common understanding 
and agreement as to how the rules governing them are to 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have my own views on these matters, it is not my role as 
Speaker to impose them on the House. There does not, at first 
glance, appear to have been any actions carried out other than 
in good faith.  However, given that important questions have 
been raised about how this procedure should work, I feel that it 
would be unfair to the House and to the hon. members concerned 
to simply turn our backs on this problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not disposed to give a final ruling at this time.  This, in 
my opinion, is an issue which should be considered by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs so that the 
Speaker has guidance about how to proceed both with Bill C-206 
and with future cases related to Standing Order 87(6).  I would 
ask the committee to give its attention to this issue as an 
urgent matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to afford the committee time to examine the questions 
raised concerning this matter, I am ordering, pursuant to the 
power afforded me by Standing Order 94(1)(a), that Bill C-206 be 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence.  When we have 
had the benefit of the committee's advice I will make a further 
ruling if it is necessary at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for Athabasca, the hon. 
member for Wentworth—Burlington, as well as the other members 
who contributed to the discussion of this issue which relates to 
the fundamental nature of our relations with one another in the 
House.

spousal benefits in federal legislation: (<I>a</I>) please list the 
types of spousal benefits under federal jurisdiction; (<I>b</I>) where 
have such benefits been extended to same sex couples; (<I>c</I>) when 
were these benefits extended to same sex couples; and (<I>d</I>) 
through what means were they extended, i.e. via a court decision

</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> (a) The question 
asks about spousal benefits in federal legislation. It is 
difficult to define such a term as federal legislative treatment 
of spousal relationships includes direct economic benefits, 
indirect economic benefits, non-economic advantages and 
obligations. Listed are the major federal statutes which grant 
direct economic benefits. Some statutes which grant direct 
economic benefits to dependants may not be reflected in the list. 
The majority of the statutes listed set out criteria for 
eligibility beyond spousal status. For example, some are 
available only to low income couples, others to federal 
employees, and yet others provide for garnishment of wages and 
pensions in the case of court ordered support.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) As mention in (b), the changes to the federal public 
service pension plans were introduced through legislation, Bill 
C-78. However a series of recent court and tribunal decisions 
have found generally that there must be equal treatment of 
opposite-sex common law couples and same sex couples in most 
instances. The government continues to believe that policy and 
legislative changes should be made by parliament, but that it is 
reasonable to seek the guidance of the courts on difficult legal 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major court and tribunal decisions include: The provision of 
the Income Tax Act which allows employers to register pension 
plans was ruled contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in the Rosenberg decision, as it did not allow 
registation of pension plans where employers chose to offer 
survivor benefits to same sex partners of employees, Ontario Court of 
Appeal, 1998. The decision of the Federal Court, Trial Division 
in Moore and Akerstrom affirmed the decision of the Human Rights 
Tribunal that the federal government must grant the same 
employment benefits under collective agreements to same sex 
couples as those offered to common law spouses of public service 
employees, 1998. In May of 1999, two challenges before the 
Pension Appeals Board to the survivor benefit provisions of the 
Canada Pension Plan were conceded, Hodder and Boulais, and a 
similar case was conceded before the Federal Court of Appeal in 
September, Fisk, resulting in a payment of survivor benefits to 
the three individuals involved. In November 1999, the Government 
of Canada settled a number of cases, including White, which 
involved the challenge to the voluntary quit provisions of the 
Employment Insurance Act. There are a number of arbitral 
decisions and decisions under provincial jurisdiction which have 
also awarded benefits to same sex couples, including the recent 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in M. v H., (May 1999). 
There are many pending court cases in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the category editorial project is not a separately coded 
category. Nor is it necessarily supplied by the researchers in 
the list of key words they give for their projects. The current 
corporate storage and retrieval system thus cannot provide a 
reliable and comprehensive report of the funds granted under the 
category editorial projects. It should be noted that the council 
awards its grants through a highly selective competitive process 
which considers the research, intellectual and social 
significance as well as the overall excellence of the projects 
submitted.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the RCMP ownership of at least one 0.50 calibre 
Browning M2 machine gun, and the ability of the RCMP to access a 
number of other 0.50 calibre Browning machine guns as dictated by 
operational requirements at various locations across Canada: 
(<I>a</I>) what are the circumstances under which such weapons might 
be used by the RCMP; and (<I>b</I>) would the RCMP in such 
circumstances be fulfilling a role which would normally be carried 
out by the military? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
With respect to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, (RCMP), 
ownership of a 0.50 calibre Browning M2 machine gun, the 
deployment of such weapons is as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) It is conceivable that under certain operational conditions 
the necessity to deploy weapons of this calibre will be a 
requirement. Currently the 0.50 calibre machine gun capability of 
the RCMP is restricted to the armoured public and police safety 
vehicle program and could be deployed when there is a requirement 
for the protection provided by such vehicles. Because of the 
capability of this system very careful consideration will be given 
to every request for deployment. It is conceivable that 
additional restrictions could be imposed prior to authorization 
being granted to deploy the entire system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) With respect to the role of the military in Canada the RCMP 
cannot comment, except to say that under the National Defence 
Act, the Canadian forces could be requested to provide assistance 
if the situation is beyond the capability of the police. A 
situation such as a natural disaster might elicit a request for 
military assistance.

A few minutes ago, the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit

to have the first report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries 
and Oceans adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to draw to your attention, since you seem not 
to have heard him, that my colleague from Charlevoix clearly 
indicated that he was not in agreement with the adoption of this 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore did not seek the unanimous consent of this 
House to present this motion. He proposed it.  It is a motion 
contained on the notice paper, of which he has already given the 
House notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion was proposed and I asked if any members wanted to 
use their right to take part in a debate.  No one stood up and 
so I put the matter to a vote and the motion was agreed to 
unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone did say no, I did not hear it, I am sorry to say. 
However, the motion in question was not a matter of unanimous 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a daily occurrence in this 
House, when the parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader wants to table documents, he asks for unanimous consent 
of the House to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You did indeed ask for it, because our colleague asked for it 
through you.  As the Speaker, you asked “Does the parliamentary 
secretary have unanimous consent?”  I said no, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> I am a witness to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Then it must not be tabled, as there was no 
consent— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The point raised by the hon. 
member is right but not exactly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary did not ask for the unanimous 
consent of the House to table documents.  He is entitled to do 
so.  He asked for the unanimous consent of the House to table a 
motion for the adoption of a committee report because he did 
not give notice of motion on this point.  It was refused so he 
could not present that motion.  That is the end of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have indeed understood—and 
your explanations were very useful but unnecessary—that 
this motion was on the Notice Paper.  I did indeed understand 
that you asked whether members wanted to speak to the question. 
I indeed understood that you put the motion to a vote and that 
there was, apparently, from what you heard, unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to draw to your attention the fact that there was 
not unanimous consent, since my colleague from Charlevoix said 
no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am asking to have today's <I>Hansard</I> record that there was not 
unanimous consent and that the report was adopted on division.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If you were to decide— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

order.  This is not to suggest what your decision might be, 
because you make the decisions and we appreciate and 
respect that, but energy is the underpinning of our economy. 
Everything we do depends upon the price of energy.  Right now the 
price of gasoline is about 10% higher than it was when the price 
of oil was 25% higher.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our subject will be the supply motion which deplores the 
mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars by the Department of Human 
Resources Development and expresses our total lack of confidence 
in the minister.  If the motion is carried by the House, the 
minister would be obliged to resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the debate, my colleagues and others will be 
laying before the House the evidence that taxpayers' funds have 
been grossly mismanaged by the minister.  In my remarks, however, 
I want to address violations of the principle of ministerial 
accountability by the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
violations which in themselves should oblige the resignation of 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many definitions of the principle of ministerial 
accountability but one of the latest and best is contained in 
Erskine May's treatise on the law of privileges, proceedings and 
usages of parliament, the 22nd edition, 1997.  It reads as 
follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...the following principles should govern the conduct of 
ministers of the Crown in relation to Parliament:  ministers have 
a duty to parliament to account, and to be held to account, for 
the policies, decisions and actions of their departments and Next 
Step Agencies; it is of paramount importance that ministers give 
accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any 
inadvertent error at the earliest possible opportunity. Ministers 
who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their 
resignation to the Prime Minister; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the handling of money through the 
transitional jobs fund has been suspect for years.  Numerous 
questions have been asked concerning its administration, 
particularly respecting funds allocated to the Prime Minister's 
riding during the last session of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As late as December of last year, inside and outside the House, 
the minister repeatedly denied that there were any problems 
worthy of concern.  The appropriate approval processes were being 
followed.  No moneys flowed until the approval process was 
completed.  Nothing inappropriate was done.  On and on she went 
denying any mismanagement and constantly affirming that all was 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we discover that while the minister was making these very 
statements to the House, she had on her desk a departmental audit 
covering some 459 project files which revealed the following: 
72% of the projects reviewed had no cashflow forecast; 46% had no 
estimate of the number of participants; 25% had no description of 
the activities to be supported; 25% provided no description of 
the characteristics of the participants; 11% did not even have a 
budget proposal; 11% had no description of expected results; 15% 
did not have an application on file from the sponsor; 8 out 10 
files reviewed did not show evidence of financial monitoring; 87% 
of project files reviewed showed no evidence of supervision; and 
97% of the files reviewed showed no evidence that anyone had 
checked to see if the recipient already owed money to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is overwhelming evidence of gross mismanagement of 
taxpayers' money.  However, the fact that the minister knew these 
things and continually repeated and reassured the House that all 
was well, is an obvious violation of the minister's obligation to 
give accurate and truthful information to parliament.  Because 
the minister has repeatedly violated this principle, the House 
should express its lack of confidence in the minister by passing 
the motion and she should resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In enforcing the principle of ministerial accountability, it is 
imperative that the House dig deeper into the root causes of 
ministerial accountability for funds spent by the human resources 
ministry.  Here the trail leads right back to the Prime Minister 
himself and the use or misuse of the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to becoming Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister 
said in 1991: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we form government, every minister in the cabinet...will 
have to take full responsibility for what is going on in his 
department.  If there is any bungling in the department, ...the 
minister will have to take responsibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a statement of ministerial accountability by the Prime 
Minister but it has never been put into practice.  The Prime 
Minister's ability to put it into practice has been compromised 
by his own conduct with respect to the use of the transitional 
jobs fund in his own riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When a transitional jobs fund grant was put into a trust fund to 
help a failing company in the Prime Minister's riding and someone 
eventually got $1.19 million from the suspect trust fund, which 
later proved to be illegal; when that someone was Claude Gauthier 
who had already purchased land from the Prime Minister's golf 
course and donated $10,000 to the Prime Minister's election 
campaign; when the business then being run by Gauthier got the 
money and laid off all but 62 of the original 115 employees for a 
net job loss of 53 jobs, all this done in the name of job 
creation; when Mr. Gauthier had already received a $6 million 
CIDA government contract; when another $11,000 got into the hands 
of René Fugère, a man who was under RCMP investigation for doing 
illegal lobbying for three other companies; when, in a memo to a 
department official, one of the human resources minister's staff 
instructed that the dollar amounts given to the two hotels in the 
Prime Minister's riding had to be artificially inflated to “keep 
the same amounts suggested by the Prime Minister during 
discussions with the promoters”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all these things happened with human resources funds in the 
Prime Minister's riding, and the Prime Minister excuses these 
things and refuses to accept any responsibility, what message 
does this send to other ministers, the civil service and the 
public at large? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister can play fast and loose with taxpayers' 
money, allocated under inadequate financial guidelines for job 
creation, what is to stop other ministers or MPs from doing the 
same thing?  What is to stop high and lower level bureaucrats 
from assuming that this type of conduct and handling of federal 
funds is perfectly acceptable behaviour? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that happens, when there is no example of financial 
accountability, responsibility or integrity at the top, the fish 
rots from the head down.  Now the little scandal in Shawinigan 
has mushroomed into a billion dollar boondoggle at human 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister refuses to enforce the principle of 
ministerial accountability in the case of the human resources 
development minister.  Why?  Because he lacks the moral authority 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore the duty of the House to enforce ministerial 
accountability in this case.  It can do so by simply supporting 
the motion that is before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it extremely ironic that the Leader of the Reform 
Party should be calling for transparency in the government, when 
his party just today and yesterday blocked a private member's 
bill that would open the access to information bill and enable 
members on all sides of the House to access all kinds of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to draw to the attention of the member who just spoke 
that the government House leader of the Reform Party attacked my 
private member's Bill C-206 based on false information. 
Yesterday, the member for Fraser Valley said that the reason my 
revised bill should be blocked was that it unfortunately excluded 
polling information on the national unity file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read to the member who just spoke what the bill actually 
says.  It says that a head of a government institution may refuse 
to disclose any record requested under this act that contains 
advice or a recommendation developed by or— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The Chair is 
reluctant to intervene without being provoked or pushed.  I am 
feeling a little bit of provocation because I think the member 
for Wentworth—Burlington knows the rule, which is that a 
question or comment must be relevant to the speech of the member 
who spoke. I must say I am having trouble understanding how the 
Leader of the Opposition got into a discussion on the hon. 
member's private member's bill.  I hope his question or comment 
will become correctly relevant to the Leader of the Opposition's 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say that 
clause 21(1) says that opinion polls will be available under my 
revised Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simply that when an opposition party calls for 
transparency on the part of the government, which the member just 
did, surely it should not try to block private members' 
initiatives that bring out that very transparency.

want to talk about it.  The issue has nothing to do with the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue has everything to do with the mismanagement of a 
billion dollars of taxpayers' money and the fact that the

is the issue being discussed here and not the subject being 
raised by the hon. member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr.

it appears, will not be accountable either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue and one which the leader of the 
opposition and the Reform Party have undertaken to bell the cat, 
so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Leader of the Opposition give us his views on the 
Minister for International Trade, who was brought from Quebec by 
the Prime Minister as the person who would save Canada, the 
éminence grise who was going to do all the wonderful things to 
back up the Liberal Party and make our country united, the man 
who was put in charge of the department, and who has, in my view 
and I think in the view of all Canadians, been a royal American 
disaster? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Leader of the Opposition tell us whether we should have 
both the Minister for International Trade and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development resign or just the Minister for 
International Trade?   Also, would he support an investigation by 
a parliamentary committee or the RCMP into this terrible waste of 
taxpayers' money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member that the responsibility for this boondoggle does not stop 
with the current minister.  It does go back to the previous 
minister of human resources.  I would argue that it even goes 
back to the minister for human resources before that, who is now 
the foreign affairs minister but who was there when the 
government set in place this type of program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be quite in favour of those ministers being held 
accountable for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of an investigation, the current minister should resign 
immediately.  I would like to see the auditor general take a full 
look at this.  There are other investigations that could be 
conducted and then further accountability both at the ministerial 
and the bureaucrat level be determined and appropriate 
disciplinary actions taken at those levels as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is an important debate for Canadians because it 
involves their money.  This is not government money.  This is the 
money of Canadians and we must never forget that because 
Canadians work hard for the dollars they trust us with and in 
this case they have been sadly let down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, we in the opposition can do our very best 
in the most competent, able manner we know to hold the government 
to account but in a democracy the people do rule.  The people, in 
the final analysis, will have to decide what messages they will 
send to their elected representatives, what pressure they intend 
to put on the government and what they intend to do in giving 
their support to the people they want to entrust with their 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how effective people can be.  We saw this recently when 
the government made an extremely ill-advised effort to give $20 
million to professional hockey clubs.  The public outrage was so 
strong that the government immediately backed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to Canadians watching this debate that they need to 
make a judgment about what they will do, what they will say and 
what their attitude will be toward this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are saying that the opposition is exaggerating. Let 
me read from the audit report that was produced by the 
government.  It is entitled “Program Integrity/Grants and 
Contributions”.  The first part is a misnomer, I would say.  The 
report is dated January 2000.  I will read from page 7. 
I urge Canadians to get their hands on it and read it for 
themselves because I do not have time to read a lot of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 459 project files reviewed, 15% did not contain an 
application.  This is not the opposition making an exaggerated 
statement; this is the government's own audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the remaining applications, the following elements were 
missing:  72% were missing cash flow forecasts; 46% were missing 
the anticipated number of participants; 25% were missing a 
description of the activities to be supported; 25% were missing 
the characteristics of participants or the audience; 11% were 
missing a budget proposal; 11% were missing a description of 
expected results.  There was no documentation on internal or 
external consultations in 70% of the project files reviewed. 
Two-thirds of the files reviewed did not contain an analysis or 
rationale for recommending or accepting the project. In 97% of 
the files reviewed, there was no evidence on file that sponsors 
had been checked for outstanding debts to HRDC prior to project 
acceptance.  In 100% of the files there were no documented 
attempts made to identify debts outside of HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an exaggeration by the opposition.  This is the 
government's own document giving these horrendous numbers, 
proving government ineptitude and negligence of massive 
proportions in the handling of public money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is trying to say that only 37 projects are a 
problem.  He said that 37 projects have some problems 
representing $30 million.  Let me talk about the facts.  The fact 
is that this audit was a representative sample of all the 
projects that spend $1 billion every year of taxpayers' and 
public money.  If this is a representative sample, then it is not 
37 projects that had some problems; it is projected upward to 
cover all the projects that were studied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the audit, the numbers show that in 100% of the cases there 
were no background checks done on what kind of money these people 
might have owed to the government.  There are some other 
disturbing numbers too.  In 87% of the cases there was no 
overseeing or supervision of how the money was spent.  In 80% of 
the cases there was no financial checking.  These numbers are so 
massive they cannot be exaggerated.  One cannot exaggerate 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know that the government not only is not 
acknowledging the scope of the problem, it is actually misleading 
them by trying to minimize it, by trying to bring those numbers 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said she brought this forward because she 
wanted to be transparent.  Let us look at the facts.  The audit 
was done last summer.  It is inconceivable that numbers like 
this, numbers in the 80%, 90% and 100% range, would not have rung 
alarm bells through the department right up to the minister's 
desk and the Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that was not the case then clearly the government is not in 
charge.  It does not know what is going on.  It is in the dark. 
It really is not in charge of our affairs because it does not 
know of massive problems.  That is inconceivable.  That is 
unbelievable.  That explanation insults the intelligence of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elected people who are in charge of these affairs did know 
and they chose to hide that in the House.  Here are some quotes 
from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After he was elected, the Prime Minister said on June 16, 1994, 
“There can be no substitute for responsibility at the top.  I 
vow to you, to this House, to Canadians, that I will never 
abdicate that responsibility.  I will never pass the buck”. 
What did he do? 
This is what he is saying when these scandalous numbers come out, 
“I didn't know”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the former minister who is now the Minister for 
International Trade said on October 9, 1997 when there were 
allegations that there was an exchange of grants for 
contributions to the Liberal Party, “They have been approved by 
the department and are based on merit all the time, so much so 
that after I called the police in I asked my deputy minister, Mel 
Cappe, to review the whole process in which my department was 
proceeding”.  This was in 1997.  We were assured that everything 
was under review and everything was under control, no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the present minister on November 4, 1999 said, “Mr. 
Speaker, let us be clear here.  The appropriate approval process 
was undertaken in this regard.  The department did the due 
diligence on the opportunities. The stakeholders reviewed the 
information and recommended investment.  No moneys flowed until 
the approval process was complete”.  This is when the government 
knew there were massive problems that could not even be 
exaggerated if one wanted to because the numbers are so bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to tell Canadians the truth about this matter. We need 
to do it clearly and they have to have the facts. I would say to 
Canadians listening to this that they need to make a judgment 
based on the facts. The facts are in the audit. The facts are as 
I have quoted.  The facts were covered up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party requested this audit on January 17 when we found out 
about it and guess what happened two days later.  The minister 
stepped forward two days later and said, “Because I want to be 
transparent, I am releasing this audit that was done last summer 
that I have known about for months because I am so honest and 
transparent”.  She was hiding the fact that she knew very well 
that the truth was going to come out because we were going to get 
the facts and we were going to make them public if she did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable.  Canadians have a right to expect that 
their money is going to be properly managed.  They have a right 
to expect that there will be no hiding of the truth, no 
minimizing of the truth, that the government will step forward, 
be candid with them, have full disclosure and deal with the 
problem in an appropriate manner. That is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be watching this debate. They should get the 
facts and they should make a judgment about the competence and 
trustworthiness of this government in managing their money, 
Canadians' money, and that is the fact we must never forget.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a 
question, through you, of my colleague from the Reform Party who 
has just spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too easy for the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, to hide behind 
the present Minister of Human Resources Development.  I believe 
the one billion dollars lost in the departmental boondoggle, 
money belonging to the workers and to the unemployed who also 
made contributions, is too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, during oral question period, many members of all 
opposition parties called for the minister to resign. 
It is my personal conviction that the Prime Minister will 
continue to refuse the resignation of the present minister 
because he knows the responsibility is not all hers, that the 
former Minister of Human Resources Development, the member for 
Papineau—Saint-Denis, is also responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will not be able to call for the two of them 
to resign either because, as we saw on television, he 
trivialized the matter, saying that it was nothing serious, an 
administrative error, something that happens fairly often.  He 
treated it as if it were just a few crumbs under the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree to acknowledge that the primary 
responsibility lies with the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development, now the Minister of International Trade, and that 
the present Minister of Human Resources Development inherited 
this mess?  Unfortunately, she too has a duty to resign, because 
she misinformed the House. 
The two of them must resign. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an accurate 
observation that the former minister also bears responsibility. 
This shocking mismanagement happened on his watch as well.  Just 
a year ago, on February 4, he said in the House in response to 
one of my questions:  “Mr. Speaker, I want things to be very 
very clear.  Officials from my department reviewed these project 
applications as they do with much diligence.  They review all 
projects the same way.  They recommended them for approval after 
they met all standard eligibility criteria”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this was not the case.  The former minister knew or 
ought to have known this, misled the House and also handed over 
this huge mess to his successor. His successor unfortunately had 
the same course of dealings, denying the problem, covering up the 
problem, refusing to be candid when questions were asked in the 
House and letting the mess continue until the whistle was blown 
by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there have been two inept ministers appointed by this 
Prime Minister.  They have been in charge of the largest spending 
department of this government.  This department spends $60 
billion of our money every year.  A billion dollars is a thousand 
million dollars.  These are huge amounts of money.  We have a 
right to expect competence, believability and trustworthiness in 
the ministers the Prime Minister puts forward. He has failed us 
on every count.  They have failed us and they must be held to 
account for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the member for Calgary—Nose Hill.  She 
has done a tremendous job in bringing forward much of the 
information that enlightens Canadians on the style this 
government has undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question very much flows from the question posed by the 
previous member.  Throughout this scandal we have seen that 
efforts have been made almost to point the finger at the past. It 
is almost unprecedented that a minister of the crown blames her 
predecessor.  I would suggest and I would like the hon. member's 
response as to whether this is very much systemic.  This goes far 
beyond one minister of the crown or even the previous minister. I 
would suggest this goes back almost to the very beginning of this 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old maritime expression that the fish stinks from 
the head. I would suggest there are a lot of maggoty fish in the 
barrel.  Does the hon. member agree this is a systemic problem 
that should be investigated in a much broader fashion?  We have 
37 projects of 459 projects of 30,000 in one year.  I suggest it 
is much more widespread than the current minister would have us 
believe.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly this is just 
the tip of the iceberg.  When we have in a government a culture 
of gross mismanagement which is ignored, which is then covered 
up, which is then denied and minimized, then there is something 
very wrong in the whole administration of the government.  This 
cannot be an isolated case because the Prime Minister himself is 
defending this course of inaction and negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if Canadians knew all the truth and had full 
disclosure about how grants and contributions have been 
mismanaged by the government and how the departments across the 
board have been mismanaged, there would be a huge outpouring of 
outrage.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  There has to be 
independent audits and examinations now of how the government 
administers our affairs because the questions have been raised 
and the signals that the government is not doing a good job for 
us are too strong to ignore any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Because of the member's excessive knowledge on this topic and the 
interest being shown, and I noticed the member for Durham had a

unanimous that the question and answer period be extended by five

I want to spend some time talking to the Canadian people about 
some of the facts because I have some information they might be 
interested in.  Members opposite will of course have their fun 
heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first fact was used by the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
when she recently said that “the government ordered the audit”. 
That is interesting; the government ordered the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I serve as vice-chair of the public accounts committee which is 
chaired by a member of the opposition.  The public accounts 
committee hears from the auditor all the time.  Every week he and 
his staff come in.  They talk to us about areas they have audited 
which were not ordered by the government for which the agenda was 
set either by the public accounts committee or by the auditor 
himself.  The important thing to establish is that the auditor is 
independent.  Every member in the House must agree with that. The 
auditor is totally independent of any political interference 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of the auditor of the government of this country 
is second to none.  Anyone who knows him and his staff knows they 
are dedicated, fair and extremely thorough.  They will go through 
programs, whether requested by a committee, the government, a 
minister or on their own, in such minute detail that some of the 
things they find out are truly quite amazing.  Guess what 
happens.  From time to time regardless of what party is in power 
around here, the auditor comes up with some problems.  That is 
what he is there for.  That is what the whole system is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary—Nose Hill stands in her place and says 
the government ordered the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to a group of young people yesterday, high school 
students who were touring our precinct.  They were quite 
astounded when I gave them the facts because what they had read 
about this supposed boondoggle were headlines screaming “A 
billion dollar boondoggle”.  I explained to them, and they are 
obviously more intelligent than some of my hon. colleagues 
opposite, that the actual program is a job creation program. It 
takes $1 billion and funnels it out into community groups from 
sea to sea to sea to create jobs for young people, to supplement 
wages for small businesses, to assist in hiring people, to deal 
with people who need training, to deal with people with 
disabilities, to help aboriginal Canadians with a hand up to get 
jobs, training and skills so they can get on with becoming 
participants in our society and to develop partnerships with 
community groups. 
That is what this program is all about. Members know this.

is it continues to go on simply for one reason and that is that 
the opposition smells blood and indeed all of us know that this 
is a blood sport.  We have to be tough and we have to stand up 
and defend and make them accountable because being in opposition 
they can say whatever they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the Reform Party's accountability.  We know that 
the Reform Party fires caucus members faster than Brian Mulroney 
changed his Gucci's.  We know that if there is one person out of 
line or out of sync in the Reform Party, even the venerable House 
leader, he is simply booted out of caucus by the leader who 
stands in front of Canadians and purports to say they have a new 
way of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party kicks people out of caucus faster than it takes 
to change the name from the united alternative to CCRAP.  I 
should not say it because children may be watching.  We all know 
what the acronym is.  The Reform Party kicks people out of caucus 
faster than it takes to change the acronym from CCRAP to some 
other one. They woke up and there was this word which they 
normally associate with something on their— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for 
Elk Island on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>   Mr. Speaker, this member is speaking in 
favour of being truthful.  The name of the party is the Canadian 
alliance.  The member is not correctly expressing the name of the 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am not sure that is a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is another name but 
I guess that is the short form.  Who would want to wake up and 
see CCRAP as the name of the newly formed party? I understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The member for Elk Island did not 
have a point of order the last time. It was a point of debate. I 
hope he is not doing the same thing this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the interests of 
truthfulness, the name of the party is the Canadian reform 
conservative alliance.  The member has it wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that 
the party is struggling in that regard. The point is that Reform 
Party members talk about accountability and telling Canadian 
people the truth and putting forward issues of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress this point.  We are talking about an entire 
project of $1 billion. The audit was done on 459 individual 
projects within the $1 billion program representing a total of 
$200 million.  One-fifth of the HRD job creation program was 
audited.  Out of that one-fifth, 37 files were identified as 
having problems.  Those problems ranged from as small as not 
putting all the paperwork in the right order to as serious as not 
having the proper documentation at all.  This is not acceptable 
to the government and it is certainly not acceptable to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister came forward and indicated that an audit had been 
done and she provided us with the results.  She gave us the six 
point plan that will be put in place to deal with the mistakes. I 
do not think any Canadian would expect an organization the size 
of HRD or indeed the entire government to be without its share of 
problems.  But to suggest that because an auditor requested to 
come in by the Government of Canada has identified some problems 
in the files and that a cabinet minister needs to step aside over 
that is political hysteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know full well that they are churning the pot and 
feeding the hysteria through the media. The only thing that would 
make their day a success would be to force a cabinet minister as 
dedicated and as hardworking as this one to resign from the job 
because of some trumped up nonsense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say the government does not recognize there are 
problems.  The government asked for the audit in the first place. 
I do not know how many times we have to say that. The minister 
released it.  The opposition would take credit for that saying 
“She heard we were going to ask for it”.  Excuse me, I am under 
the impression it was on the Internet.  We do not get much more 
public than that. The minister came out with it and said “Here 
is the result of the audit.  Here are the problems we have 
identified and here is the action plan that we will put in place 
to fix it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really bothers me about all of the hysteria by the members 
opposite and frankly by the media is that the real victims in all 
of this will be the community groups in British Columbia, in 
Newfoundland or in Ontario.  They will be young people who need 
summer jobs.  That is what this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to hon. members to put themselves in the position of a 
bureaucrat sitting down somewhere in Halifax, Mississauga or 
Vancouver with an application before them while all of this is 
going on in the media.  Might one not just be a little nervous? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is the party that demands less red tape.  In 
fact we will potentially see more red tape and more concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have rules in place that the bureaucrats must follow. 
There must be financial accountability.  The minister has said 
that she has put forward the plan that will do that, but we will 
drive wedges between the offices of HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask any of these members, some of them I am sure have 
but I know many of them have not, to go to the HRDC office and 
look at who is there.  There are single moms looking to get 
retraining in computers.  There are 45 to 55 year old men who 
have been displaced in their jobs and are looking to find a new 
career, a new alternative.  They need our help and why should we 
not help them?  If we can help them with a grant that creates a 
job, then they have a job and they will pay taxes and they will 
become productive, proud members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risk here in all seriousness is that we will damage the 
relationship our dedicated HRDC offices have.  I have one in my 
community on Glen Erin Drive that services Peel and Halton.  We 
will risk the relationship those offices have with the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an organization in Mississauga called the Centre for 
Education and Training.  It does tremendous work.  It would 
access funds through the HRDC office to provide training, 
retraining and motivation.  It provides job skills and job search 
skills.  It helps people develop resumes.  It helps people get 
back on their feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we face is that we tend to be in such a strong 
economic climate.  Unemployment is at the lowest rate it has been 
since the 1970s for all levels.  Whether it is for women, for 
youth, or for the entire sector of society, the unemployment rate 
is at its lowest for all levels.  Interest rates are low. 
Inflation is virtually non-existent.  The economy is humming. The 
books are balanced.  We are in a surplus and are awaiting a 
budget at the end of February that I believe will deliver tax 
cuts to Canadians.  Yet people are sitting around saying that 
there has to be something wrong here, it cannot be all that good 
and they will not sit back and accept all this prosperity. We 
have too many problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say we do not do anything for the homeless.  Our minister 
went to Toronto and announced $743 million in partnership with 
the municipalities, provinces and the private sector.  They 
should be able to leverage that $743 million into a couple of 
billion to create housing and help people get off the streets. Is 
it enough?  I guess not. 
Maybe we would like to do more.  I am sure many of us would.  The 
government is trying to respond.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is a feeding frenzy of mass hysteria that is 
absolutely unfair to the Canadian people, who, because they have 
read the headlines, think that somehow we have lost a billion 
dollars.  We have not lost one cent.  They know that.  What has 
been potentially lost is the faith and the confidence that the 
community groups have in working with HRD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meet the men and women who deal in this business.  Meet the Ray 
Fernbacks of this world, a dedicated civil servant who wants to 
help young people, people who are without jobs and people who are 
without hope.  There are people like him all across this country. 
Simply because of the hysteria and the nonsense we are in danger 
of losing people like him and losing the relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members know full well that many of the job fund 
programs have gone into their ridings.  The hypocrisy of being in 
the House and listening as they wax on is terrible.  Let us read 
what they have actually said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Dauphin—Swan River said: “I am writing to 
express my support for the TJF application made by the Rolling 
River First Nation”.  The member for Selkirk—Interlake said: 
“I strongly recommend that the TJF provide funding for this 
excellent creation program”.  The member for Vancouver Island 
North said: “This is a great opportunity for creating new jobs 
and new wealth in the Comox Valley”.  The member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminister said in a letter to the minister: “I 
would like to ask that you seriously consider the request for 
funding and give the Voice of the Blue Rose Advocacy a favourable 
response”.  The member for Nanaimo—Cowichan, regarding an 
organization called “Loaves and Fishes”, said: “I would like 
to request that any and all avenues of financial resources be 
considered in assisting this important work to continue.  I fully 
support the TJF application put forth by Tough Duck”.  It is 
interesting that these are all Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this is really about is that the Reform Party wants to kill 
this program.  The Reform Party thinks it is more important to 
give tax cuts to the rich than it is to help those small 
community organizations.  It will not be tough duck; it will be 
tough luck.  That is what will happen if the Reform Party has its 
way and runs its scalpel through the human resources development 
ministry.  It will slash, burn and destroy programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these names might seem funny, but these are community 
organizations that are working in the community.  The money goes 
to hire people to help them deliver the programs.  We should not 
laugh.  Reform Party members, of all people, should not laugh at 
funny names.  Goodness knows, they have so many up their sleeves 
that we never know what they are going to come out with.  That is 
the real agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, one of the few in 
the Reform Party whom I respect, said:  “I believe that it is a 
worthy, viable and visionary undertaking which warrants your 
consideration and ultimately your approval of the applications”. 
Another quality member in this place, the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, said: “I hope that the money will be 
forthcoming from the transitional jobs fund to bolster the 
economy of Port Renfrew.  My hope also is that other projects 
will be considered in the future that will provide for job 
training opportunities that are sustainable over the long term”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some real mixed messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-seven projects have been identified. 
Interestingly enough, out of those 37, which represent $30 
million—not $200 million, not $1 billion, but $30 million—which 
is still a lot of money—three of those projects have already 
been investigated.  The files have been put in order and no 
further action is required by the ministry staff.  Those three 
projects represent almost $12 million of the $30 million, which 
is almost half.  Certainly over one-third of the entire area 
which was identified has already been dealt with, cleaned up and 
put to bed.  The recommendation is that no further action need 
take place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the investigations are ongoing.  We can rest assured 
that in every HRDC office in the country people probably spent a 
fairly busy weekend going through the files, and so it should be. 
Because we refuse to buckle to the nonsensical demands of the 
opposition does not mean that the government, the minister and 
the prime minister do not take this seriously.  This is serious 
stuff.  When the auditor says “We have identified problems”, 
any government had better react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness, why not allow for a reasonable length of time for 
the government to do the work to clean up the mess?  If there are 
not changes put in place, then perhaps the opposition's demands 
would make sense.  If the government does not correct the 
problems that are there, whether they are systemic or they happen 
once, it has to investigate these things because Canadians expect 
no less than that kind of accountability, openness and 
transparency, that kind of serious effort by their government. 
Frankly, that is what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the Reformers.  I will share with the House what 
the Conservative member for New Brunswick Southwest said:  “It 
would not be fair to suggest that party affiliations play a role 
in the awarding of money”.  I agree.  They got over half the 
projects.  He went on to say:  “The resulting employment during 
construction and the permanent jobs to be created from the 
project will greatly benefit the people and the economy of the 
St. Stephen area”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the importance and the significance of this job 
creation fund.  We know what it means to our youth, to our women, 
to our aboriginals, to our people who have lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own.  We know the importance of the 
partnerships and the relationships that occur right across the 
land, and we have the serious potential of doing damage to 
programs that are fundamentally important to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reject this motion, as will my colleagues.  It is 
unworthy of the opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what a lot of bluster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member minimizes this by saying that there are routine 
audits.  Thank goodness we have audits.  He uses laudable 
platitudes to tell us about the efficacy of these programs. 
However, schools of public administration, academics of 
management science will always say that these kinds of programs 
are wasteful and may actually do more harm than good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cash transfers without comprehensiveness really do not work. For 
example, the Compass program described today in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> said that the analysis of programs given under the same 
rosy kind of outlines that the member describes shows that the 
clients who had reduced their reliance on income support was not 
significantly different from zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member work within his caucus to end these kinds of 
vote buying programs and actually try to develop programs that 
really help people, rather than these types of programs which 
sprinkle money around the ground to try to grow votes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I apologize if the 
member thought it was bluster.  I get a little excited at times 
trying to make a point.  However, I think that Canadians need to 
hear from some of us who will, as demonstrably as possible, put 
the facts on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member just said it all.  He has proven what I said and have 
suspected; that is, that the intent of the Reform Party is not to 
get the head of a minister. 
The intent of the Reform Party is not even to embarrass the 
government.  The intent of the Reform Party is to kill the job 
creation funds that are in HRDC which go to the communities. 
They want to take that money, rip it out of the system and give 
it to their wealthy friends in the form of tax cuts.  That is 
what he said.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the 
member if the fact of choosing a minister—as was the case with 
the current Minister for International Trade and the current 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs—includes as a criterion the 
ability to properly place the knife in the public's back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether this criterion did not lead us to this scandal 
involving the management of Human Resources Development, that 
is, that the sole function of the minister, who is no longer in 
the position today, but was in it for at least three, if not 
four years, was to report to the House without either question 
or audit, to respond to the opposition and to say pretty much 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques spent three months 
at least questioning the minister on his management, on who were 
and were not likely to receive employment insurance after paying 
fairly significant premiums. 
When we told the minister that not even 42% qualified to draw 
what they had paid in insurance and the minister gave us any old 
answer, was his answer based on actual figures or on what his 
officials were telling him?  Did he manage his officials?  Did 
he look into his department's internal administration?  No. 
Because his only talent was an ability to denigrate the 
Quebecers who elected him.  He became the Prime Minister's 
accomplice in manhandling Quebecers, as we called it in Quebec. 
Now we end up with the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if he is not afraid that we will soon find 
ourselves with the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs facing 
a similar situation and that we must repudiate him or criticize 
the management of his department in its entirety?  These 
questions need to be asked and I put them to the member who has 
just spoken. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand that members 
of the Bloc are only interested in discrediting, in whatever way 
they can, any member on this side of the House who happens to be 
from the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the minister is in a different portfolio and 
the audit was requested by the Government of Canada.  I do not 
know how much more transparent we could possibly be.  The audit 
identified 37 out of 459 projects—$30 million out of $200 
million—as having some difficulties.  Three of those 37 have 
been investigated, representing almost $12 million, and they have 
been put in proper shape.  I do not know how much more 
transparent and fair the government could be, except to continue 
investigating the remaining 34 files, representing about $20 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member wants to attack someone from Quebec so that he can 
make headlines which will somehow further the only thing these 
people care about, which is the destruction of this country and 
their attempts to take the province of Quebec out of Canada.  It 
will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is responding to the issues at hand.  She has a six 
point plan that will put in place the kind of transparency and 
accountability that is needed.  Any money that has been 
improperly spent, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, will be 
recovered by the government.  We will not tolerate any of that 
nonsense.  The situation at HRDC will be cleaned up and it will 
be cleaned up by the current minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Mississauga West for a very entertaining 
presentation.  It is always good theatre when he speaks.  I think 
he has the toughest job in the country, trying to gloss over what 
absolutely has to be the worst public relations disaster 
imaginable. 
I admire that he has the courage to stand there and spout that 
kind of thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was gracious of him to concede that there is definitely a 
problem with the administration of the programs.  What he failed 
to comment on is that there is a huge problem in the allocation 
of the programs and who gets the benefits from the particular 
funds.  The transitional jobs fund is the one that most comes to 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistically I have the third poorest riding in the country. 
Does the hon. member know how many transitional jobs funds grants 
we got in our riding?  I can tell him.  None.  Zero, not one red 
cent, because we were told we did not qualify.  With an incidence 
of poverty of 32% or 33% in the whole riding we did not qualify 
because of some magic formula that they cooked up so they could 
allocate it all to their own ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Edmonton West is where most of the country goes to 
get a job because there is so much prosperity there.  The 
Minister of Justice is pulling in transitional jobs fund grants: 
$1.3 million to band trees to prevent Dutch elm disease.  There 
is a meaningful and significant project.  We did not get any, not 
one red cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the administration of the fund, would the member agree 
that one of the biggest problems is that one cannot hack, cut and 
slash 30% of the public service and still expect to get the same 
amount of work done?  Would he agree that maybe the Liberals cut 
too deep when they laid off a third of the public sector?  Now 
they have lost track of the administration of their programs. 
Could the member explain just what the rules are to qualify for a 
TJF grant?  I would like to know.  It just seems to change from 
day to day.  Could he answer those questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his questions.  He actually made an interesting point.  He said 
that I was standing here defending what he called a public 
relations disaster.  I think that is what it is, actually.  It is 
a PR disaster.  We have not been able to get the message out 
because of the hysteria and misrepresentation by members in the 
opposition and frankly in the media.  How do we defend a headline 
that says a billion dollars is lost when in fact it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old axiom in politics that says when one is trying 
to defend something one is losing.  I understand that.  It is 
very much public relations, and the public happens to be the 
voters and citizens of the country.  The reason I stand here and 
say what I say is that it is our job and responsibility to get 
the facts out.  It is not just the one-sided nonsensical 
arguments put forward by the opposition.  There are a government 
position, an explanation and an action plan put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also tell the member in relationship to his other question 
that the minister informed the House on February 7, as reported 
in <I>Hansard</I> that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 250 projects across Canada that qualified for transitional 
jobs fund money where the unemployment levels were less than 
12%...half of them were in opposition ridings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry if the member has not been able to somehow persuade 
or have some influence, but I would suggest that he should keep 
trying.  He should get himself someone in the ministry with whom 
he can deal and work.  If his riding needs these funds, I want 
the member who I think is a very caring and socially well 
balanced conscientious member to know that the danger we are 
facing with all this stuff is that there will be no transitional 
jobs funds for anyone in the country, whether in his riding or 
mine.  They will kill this program as sure as I am standing here 
through the misrepresentation and misleading hysteria that is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Canadians to know that government accepts the 
responsibility to clean this up.  The government accepts the fact 
that some mistakes have been made and it will be cleaned up by 
the minister.

the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development since 
1994. I have been working with that committee for several years 
and a number of issues have been referred to us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read you today's motion from the Reform Party: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House express its concern over the gross mismanagement 
of more than one billion annually in grants and contributions 
from the Department of Human Resources Development, its support 
for the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, and its lack of 
confidence in the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we find ourselves in that situation? In early January 
2000, the current Minister of Human Resources Development—who, 
unlike the Prime Minister, did not consider this issue to be a 
minor problem involving only 37 cases—released an internal audit 
report which told Quebecers and Canadians that “there is a 
serious problem in the Department of Human Resources 
Development. The department has lost control over at least $1 
billion. An internal audit investigation was conducted”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that people know what an internal audit is all 
about. It is really a sampling. In this case, 459 files were 
pulled out and reviewed. We were told that they took 459 files 
out of 30,000 in the department. So, it is a very small sample. 
Out of these 459 files, 37 were found to be very serious cases 
involving some $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister tells us that the present situation is 
not serious, that only 37 projects are problematic, he is 
abusing statistical science and misrepresenting how internal 
audits are done.  I urge the Prime Minister to find out from 
chartered accountants what such an internal audit means.  It is 
a test done to check whether in fact a department or a company 
is operating properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a certain number of cases are unacceptable, a red light 
goes off.  This is what the Minister of Human Resources 
Development made public on January 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we now have is the government trying—and the remarks by the 
member who preceded me were irresponsible—to tell us that in the 
whole of the department there were 37 problematic projects, when 
the number of projects audited was 459 out of a total of 30,000. 
Statistically speaking, these 37 projects represent almost 2,400 
problematic cases.  This could involve nearly $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the fact of the matter and that is what the motion 
before us is critical of.  If the federal government, because of 
the position taken by the Prime Minister, says there are only 37 
cases, it is being completely irresponsible.  We see the result. 
The result is that the parties opposed to job creation programs 
are saying that such programs are no good.  In an attempt to get 
itself out of hot water, the government is accusing the Reform 
Party of wanting to kill these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we are now facing is not the relevance of job 
creation programs but the Liberal government's management of them. 
In so doing, the Liberal government ends up negating the 
effectiveness of the job creation programs, and that is very 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the scandal itself, what the internal audit showed up, 
let us recall that, out of the 459 files examined, 15% contained 
no application from the promoters.  This means that, in 15 of 
every 100 projects, the project promoter could not be 
identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 72% of the remaining applications there were no forecasts; in 
46% there was no anticipated number of participants; in 25% 
there was no description of the activities to be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so it goes on.  Most impressive. 
If something like this happened in a small five-employee business 
in the private sector, the boss would call operations to a halt 
and say “Everybody into my office.  We are going to see what is 
going on.  This makes no sense.  We're in an awful mess here”. 
The fact is the business would likely have already closed, if it 
were in such a situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other very important elements.  For example, 97% 
of files bore no indication that the promoters had been checked 
for outstanding debts to HRDC.  In 70% of project files, there 
was nothing about expenditures.  In other words, 7 out of every 
10 files contained no invoices or payslips to justify 
expenditures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> That is the right word for it.  Scandalous it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the government had two responsibilities in a 
situation like this.  It ought to have decided to lay all the 
cards on the table, which would have been the ideal situation, 
because we are faced with a rather peculiar situation here as 
far as parliamentary operations are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Minister of Human Resources Development, in that 
portfolio only since the summer of 1999, has some responsibility 
because she learned of the situation as early as last fall but 
waited until January to make it public, while parliament was not 
sitting, so as to keep things as quiet as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember her announcement was made at the same time the 
Minister of Industry was getting involved in hockey clubs.  But 
between her announcement and the end of the hockey club saga, 
the Minister of Industry withdrew his proposal because of the 
hooha it raised from the public.  So the grand announcement, 
which was meant to be hidden while parliament was not sitting 
and be kept as quiet as possible, moved into the limelight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did it move as far into the limelight as it is today? 
Primarily because the public, who pays taxes and thinks it is 
already paying too much, did not like having its money wasted. 
The current Liberal government was getting hot under the collar 
about Emploi-Québec, which had just been set up, was beginning to 
operate and was established to make a success of providing 
proper manpower services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even heard the Prime Minister say, when I was in Hull as an 
observer at the Liberal convention, “My God, that is really 
embarrassing for us Quebecers”.  At the same time, his 
department, which had been in operation for several years, is 
unable to account for a billion dollars. 
The department is faced with a situation where the number of 
scandalous cases uncovered by the internal audit is such that as 
much as $2 billion may have disappeared through programs, with 
no one knowing where the money went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why taxpayers find this unacceptable. No one in Canada 
is buying the Prime Minister's claim that there are only 37 
cases. Indeed, we all know that we are talking about an internal 
audit involving only a small sampling of overall government 
operations. It is important to realize that. We are stressing 
that point because we know people will understand it. We must 
take what was said and go to the bottom of the issue if we can 
get all the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, at the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, we will be asking that not only the current 
Minister of Human Resources Development but also her predecessor 
appear before the committee to tell us about the period targeted 
by the internal audit, that is from April 1997 to June 1998, 
when the current minister's predecessor was in charge. He was 
the one responsible for that department at the time. That period 
also encompasses the election campaign. This is a good example 
of what this government attempted to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday morning, two rather uncomfortable deputy ministers 
gave a 90-munite briefing in the press lounge, to explain the 
status of those 37 cases. The government is acting in an 
irresponsible and petty way by trying to make public servants 
look like they are the culprits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of the transitional jobs creation fund. 
When officials in Quebec working for the Department of Human 
Resources Development meet with a sponsor, they open a file, 
complete it, have it approved at the regional, provincial and 
Canadian level and the minister signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a project operates this way, usually things go reasonably 
well, but what is now coming to light is that there is a group 
of projects that, instead of working their way from the bottom 
up, proceeded from the top down during the election period. 
Looking at the whole of Quebec, 54% of the projects approved in 
the three years between April 1996 and April 1999 received that 
approval in the months immediately before and after the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scenario goes like this. 
The previous Minister of Human Resources Development who, during 
the election campaign, found himself being pressured, receiving 
telephone calls or visiting a business, told people not to worry 
and promised to see that things were sorted out after the 
election. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And we are talking about an election campaign.  During that 
period, they were not just spreading their favours in Liberal 
ridings; they also went after other ridings.  Fortunately, 
however, Quebecers do not go for this sort of bait.  They 
resisted the temptation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now we are looking at a group of projects that public 
servants inherited on June 10, July 1 and in August, for which 
the minister had given his word. The word went out that the 
minister had given his word and that now it was up to them to 
produce results. Now, two years later, an internal audit reveals 
that no sponsor was listed for 15% of the projects. 
No problem; they got their money anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 70% of the files, there was no financial monitoring. No 
problem, they got their money anyway.  Today they are trying to 
tell us that this is not possible, that there were just the 37 
cases.  No way.  They did not look at just 37 cases during the 
election campaign; it was way more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that what we have here is a shocking scandal, because 
this was going on in the department that had launched an all-out 
an attack against the unemployed, one that has been going on for 
several years.  On the one hand they were unable to manage 
employment programs, while on the other they knew very well what 
their objective for recovery was.  Every Canada employment 
centre had an objective setting out how much had to be recovered 
from the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They looked at eligibility in order to ensure that as few people 
as possible would be entitled to benefits. 
They organized things to ensure that as few as possible would 
receive benefits.  They put on more employment insurance 
investigators while at the same time, at the other end of the 
system, there was no monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, they were acting like a business and decided to 
focus only on increasing revenues. However, we are not dealing 
with a business here, but a department, the one responsible for 
the social function of the federal government of Canada.  It is 
the department most responsible for sharing the wealth, and here 
it is being used to gain votes for the Liberal Party of Canada. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that had been the only problem in the department, one might 
have said that there was a crisis relating to the management of 
those particular programs. 
However, over the course of the past four or five years, there 
was also a scandal over the use of social insurance numbers, 
because in Canada there were more people over the age of 100 
than in the entire world with a social insurance number.  It 
took an opinion from the auditor general; it took a unanimous 
report by the committee to call for a change in things, and the 
answer we kept getting from the predecessor of the current 
minister, the member for Papineau—St-Denis was “Everything is 
fine.  There is no problem”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is in fact what this minister keeps saying.  They have the 
same tape.  I think the prime responsibility of the current 
Minister of Human Resources Development is to not have changed 
the machine; to have taken the recording of her predecessor and 
played it endlessly.  I think she has a lot of responsibility in 
this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we learn—and this is another incredible example—that the 
youth employment strategy, which served as the weapon of the 
minister's predecessor, the member for Papineau—St-Denis, when he 
was Minister of Human Resources Development, who said “See how 
the Government of Canada does good things”, that 33% of the 
money allocated produced no results. This program did not create 
the jobs it was supposed to create.  It has not brought young 
people back to work as it should have done, and it is in the hot 
seat, like the Canada jobs fund, like the youth employment 
strategy and like all the other programs that were evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has been mentioned is literacy programs. 
Do members think that Canada can afford to waste money?  Can it 
afford to squander literacy funding?  I think that this funding 
is needed to do something about the problems of our illiterate 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if the money is improperly spent and the use to which it is 
put unknown, I think that the desired results have not been 
achieved.  Perhaps what is most tragic about the whole affair, 
when all is said and done, is that there are people who need 
these programs, and we have argued in favour of programs to 
revitalize the economy in areas of high unemployment.  We have 
never challenged the need for such programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be challenged is when the minister directs funding 
to her riding for a program for which only ridings with 
unemployment rates of 10% and higher should qualify, when 
unemployment in her riding stands at 6%, and at the same time 
turns down funding for the Gaspé with its 22% unemployment rate. 
That is dishonest and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we get to this state of affairs?  How did this situation 
come about?

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to the heart of the problem. There is a Prime Minister 
who appoints ministers. He is the one who appointed the 
incompetent individual who is now the Minister for International 
Trade.  At least he pulled him out of a department which gives 
out a lot of money and assigned him to the part of the job he 
can handle, which is public relations.  But appointing him 
Minister of Human Resources Development was an incompetent move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By appointing the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis Minister of 
Human Resources Development, the Prime Minister showed his 
incompetence.  He went for first impressions. 
The Prime Minister told himself “He will make a good 
spokesperson. He will repeat exactly what we want for the 
department. He will keep saying for years that everything is 
fine and then, when things get too hot, when I know the results, 
I will move him elsewhere”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister then appointed the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development. During the period that she has been in 
charge, there has been no concrete information on the situation 
in her department. It was only in January 2000 that she said she 
inherited a department that was coming out of the middle ages. 
The middle ages are a dark period of our history, a period when 
civilization did not exist, a period when people did not know 
how to make things work. But patronage was thriving then. This 
is the period to which the current minister is referring when 
she talks about her predecessor, the member for 
Papineau—Saint-Denis. He was the one in charge during that dark 
period, during the middle ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague says, we were also able to see—with the figures 
provided by the Bloc Quebecois on the impact of the election 
campaign—that this was not only a dark and black period, but very 
much a red period as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to find out who is responsible for this 
situation. We mentioned that the Prime Minister appointed 
someone who was not competent for the job, but who remained in 
charge of the department for several years. Then, the Prime 
Minister appointed another minister. We did give that minister a 
chance, did we not? Just last week, the Bloc Quebecois was 
saying “We need all the information. We will not ask for heads 
to roll. We will not ask for people to resign, but we will ask 
questions in the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I did ask a question to the minister. 
I asked her why, between December 1 and December 16, 1999, she 
continued to defend the programs here in this House, whereas she 
had been aware of the audit since November 17, 1999.  I was 
expecting an honest answer, one that would say “I became aware 
of it and in fact—”, with an attempt to find an intelligent 
answer.  But no, off she went again with the same old tape from 
the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, the one that says that 
everything is fine, even if the place is burning down.  The old 
story of “Don't worry, be happy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister continued along the same lines, which is 
why I find that the motion of the Reform Party is in order. When 
they refer to their “lack of confidence in the Minister of Human 
Resources Development”, it is because she is the one who took on 
the burden of the situation created by her predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had she been responsible, she would have said right from the 
time that the situation became known, “I am going to encourage 
my predecessor to come and testify; I am going to ask Mel Cappe, 
the deputy minister responsible for the entire Government of 
Canada, the top civil servant, to come and testify”.  He was, 
after all, the deputy minister of the department the whole time 
that this was going on, during this whole scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one more example of the responsibility of the Prime 
Minister of Canada.  After appointing the member for 
Papineau—Saint-Denis as Minister of Human Resources Development 
and then, after he proved incompetent, the present minister, who 
is incapable of taking on her responsibilities, he also 
appointed Mel Cappe to the highest position in the public 
service. 
Now we know that the Government of Canada is, at the top deputy 
ministerial level, being managed by a person who has created a 
scandal in all of Canada's social programs.  This is totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the primary responsibility for all this lies with the 
Prime Minister of Canada. He appointed successive ministers 
incapable of doing their job; he took advantage of their 
inconsistency to create the transitional jobs fund in order to 
get himself and his Liberal colleagues re-elected.  He tried to 
dump all the responsibility onto the public servants.  This 
whole attitude of disregard for democracy, which means making 
things known so that there may be transparency in order to allow 
people to make the proper choices, leads us to vote in favour of 
the motion. 
The primary responsibility for this scandal lies with the 
present Prime Minister of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know 
members of the Bloc have fought very hard and very long for a 
fair employment insurance system.  I would like to hear their 
comments because many aspects of it have bothered me.  One was 
the minister's comment that there was no witch hunt of those 
within her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised at how quick they were to let themselves off the 
hook, that they would presume innocence on their own part, but 
when it comes to any poor soul who has ever made a mistake on an 
employment insurance form there is never a presumption of 
innocence.  I know of people who have been hounded for two to 
three years for an innocent error on an employment insurance 
card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is to be so quick to assume that everyone in her 
department and herself are innocent, that everything was just a 
bit of a mistake, then that sort of standard should be applied to 
Canadian citizens who have made innocent mistakes on their 
employment insurance forms.  I would like the member's comments 
on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has raised an excellent 
point. We must not forget that the Employment Insurance Act is 
based on the presumption of guilt. If there is any doubt about 
someone, that individual is guilty until he or she has been able 
to prove his or her innocence before the whole bureaucratic 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case before us, it is the opposite. There is a proof of 
guilt, we are sure the person is guilty, but someone—not just 
anyone, the Prime Minister of Canada himself—is telling us that 
an internal audit has shown problems in 37 cases out of 459. He 
claims that only 37 cases are problematic, and the rest does not 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He denies the fact that this department handled 30,000 cases. 
hope the auditor general puts these facts on the table next 
fall. He will be asked to appear before the committee so that we 
can look specifically into this matter. My assumption is that, 
once our review is over, these 37 cases out of 459 will not look 
like a little sore but rather as the sign of a growing cancer 
within the department, a cancer which has been tolerated by the 
present government, which wanted it and took advantage of it in 
the 1997 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense, the member is perfectly right. There is a double 
standard, and we are here to speak out against this situation 
and to bring the Canadian government to put all the facts on the 
table so that we can make a final judgement on these issues. 
government, particularly the predecessor of the present 
Minister of Human Resources Development, is responsible for 
wasting billions of dollars, which is totally unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I was a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development before the election. We had suspicions as to what 
was going on, but we realize today that things were even worse 
than we expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example to my colleague who is now a 
member on that committee, and ask him whether there is a link. 
Before the election, members used to be consulted about the 
summer career placements program. When the election was called, 
strangely enough, the former minister mentioned by the hon. 
member took it upon himself to make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from the Quebec City area, and, before the election, we 
used to have a centre where the unemployed could get help in 
dealing with all the red tape. It was moved to the Prime 
Minister's riding—such a coincidence—where there was no 
unemployment office. 
We used to have about ten offices, and their number had to go 
down to just two. They closed down all of them and opened two, 
one in Montreal and the other one in the Prime Minister's 
riding. Of all the ridings in Quebec, guess where they got the 
best percentage during the election? Something tells me it is in 
the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is absolutely right. The former minister is to 
blame, and the present minister is also to blame, because she 
does not want any light to be shed on this issue. However, who 
was it who appointed these two ministers? Always the same 
person, the Prime Minister. Does he not have the primary 
responsibility for this boondoggle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I took notice of what by my 
colleague from Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière said about the summer 
career placements program. It is true that hon. members stopped 
being consulted during the election campaign. That is part of 
what we could bring up if we are ever allowed to have some light 
shed on this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could check if discretionary choices were purely partisan 
choices. There were two ways to go about this. On the one hand, 
there were the summer careers placements program and other 
programs. On the other, contributions were coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, we had a good indication of the way things were 
going. Members probably remember the Corbeil case. Supposedly, 
that meant nothing. HRDC was as pure as the driven snow. Corbeil 
was found guilty, but that did not trigger any alarms and 
nothing changed in the government's ways. It took an internal 
audit which the minister was made aware of on November 17 and 
which she made public in January for the government to start 
dealing with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental problem with this government, and that is 
the Prime Minister's style of politics. Throughout his political 
career, the Prime Minister has been known to resort to 
partisanship, to show contempt and to disregard democratic 
principles and the will of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the Prime Minister in terms that he will 
understand. If he sees the Government of Canada as his business 
and his business alone, I remind him that the shareholders of 
his government are the citizens of Canada. They are the ones who 
want us to shed light on this situation. Not only will 
parliamentarians not stop, but people all over the country will 
ask for clarifications on this issue. At a time when people are 
paying so much in taxes, we simply will not let the government 
waste that money. It cannot afford to do so. 
This is a period when the federal government has money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, it had developed a habit of wasting money and 
creating deficits. Now that fiscal balance has been achieved, 
the government is back at it again. However, the internal audit 
that was conducted revealed a deep and serious problem. We 
absolutely must shed light on the whole situation at the 
Department of Human Resources Development and also see what is 
going on in the other departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, a deputy minister from Treasury Board wrote a memo to 
all the departments that give grants and subsidies. He said “Are 
you sure that what is going on in Human Resources Development 
Canada is not also going on in your department?” You can be sure 
that we will get to the bottom of this and see to it that the 
Prime Minister takes full responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is 
right. During the election campaign, in 1997, the members were 
not authorized to sign job creation programs for students in 
their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister traveled a lot; he came to Charlevoix. Two 
investors from Montreal accompanied the minister to 
Saint-Hilarion, in the riding of Charlevoix. The “Poulette 
Grise”, in La Malbaie, was closed; 150 jobs were lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days before election day, to benefit from the situation, 
he came to announce that Aliments Charlevoix would export 
chicken and reopen the La Malbaie slaughterhouse, that 
everything was all right, thanks to the savior, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development of the day, the member for 
Papineau—Saint-Denis. I am sure the Prime Minister found 
shortcomings in that department. 
After the 1997 election, he saw what had happened in Canada, 
chiefly with the minister we are talking about, the former 
Minister of Human Resources Development, the member for 
Papineau—Saint-Denis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques if he 
would agree with me that the Prime Minister probably noticed the 
incompetence of the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development and stripped him of this department, which involves 
a lot of management, a lot of money and a lot of 
responsibilities and gave him a department involving no 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can hardly read the Prime 
Minister's thoughts. I am convinced that he had a very good idea 
of what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, he denies being aware of those issues. He said he was not 
aware that there was an audit on an amount of $2 billion at 
Human Resources Development Canada. If the Prime Minister is not 
aware of such situations, what kind of work does he do?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the government's monitoring role. 
Governments are not only responsible for announcing projects. 
They must also make sure that those projects yield results, see 
that they are out in the open so that we can see, for instance 
in the case of a job creation program, that jobs actually have 
been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister cannot be evaluated only on how he makes an 
announcement. In this regard, I agree that the former Minister 
of Human Resources Development at announcing things, but he 
certainly lacked the other necessary skills. Personally, I 
consider his appointment as Minister of International Trade as a 
demotion. 
However, in a way, this may have allowed us to avoid an ever 
greater mess than the one we appear to be in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all this will all be out in the open as soon as 
possible. Otherwise, we would not be fully doing our duty as 
parliamentarians if we did not get to the bottom of the issue 
and allow all Canadians to see the whole truth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
the spokesperson for the federal New Democrats on Human Resources 
Development Canada, I am very pleased to speak to this opposition 
day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats concur and support the motion because we believe 
it gets to the issue that we have been debating and it certainly 
expresses our concern about the gross mismanagement of more than 
$1 billion annually in grants and contributions by the Department 
of Human Resources Development, as the motion outlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion and the issue that we are debating today gets to the 
core of something that is very important in our democracy and in 
our system of governance, the issue of ministerial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After looking at the information that has come to light over the 
last several weeks about the internal audit of HRDC, it is clear 
that this is an issue on the proper management of public funds. 
This is an issue on the integrity and credibility of the 
government.  Even members of the government have admitted that 
the practices that have gone on in that department have been 
astounding and scandalous and, as the minister has said, she 
herself has called for further information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most disturbing about this issue is that the government 
itself is also in denial about what is really taking place. 
Yesterday in question period, and in other debates that have 
taken place, it has been very interesting to see the government 
now madly back-pedalling to defend its record and to defend what 
has happened.  It is now switching tactics.  It is now saying, as 
I heard today in the House from government members, that 
opposition members do not support job creation or job 
development, and that the government is now the big defender of 
job development in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's second tactic is to attack opposition members 
on legitimate projects that were approved in various ridings 
through existing programs, with all the rules in place, with the 
proper application forms and so on.  The government is now in 
denial and is trying to put up some smoke and mirrors to switch 
the line of attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As New Democrats, we have always supported legitimate and worthy 
job development programs.  Many of us represent ridings in Canada 
that have high unemployment and high poverty.  It was in fact our 
party that pushed the government to be more forthcoming in its 
support for job creation and helping the unemployed.  Let us be 
very clear that the issue is not about whether a job development 
program is good.  We are the first to say that job development 
programs and job creation are very critical in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not fooled by the Liberal counteroffensive.  They 
understand that at issue are the findings of the government's own 
audit which gave very clear evidence about the mismanagement of 
this fund.  The issue is the absolute mismanagement of huge 
amounts of public funds and the partisan political decision 
making that is taking place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partisan political decision making is the nicest way to say it. 
To be quite frank, it is also a slush fund.  The concern has been 
that public funds have been used by the Liberal government, 
breaking its established criteria for the transitional jobs fund 
and other programs, and basically shovelling the money into its 
own ridings, which are not in need, when other areas are greatly 
in need.  What is at issue is the management of the fund and how 
it has been administered in a very political and partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What disturbs us as New Democrats is the complete lack of 
accountability, not only in the management of the fund and what 
has come from it but, now that this has been put on the table and 
the internal audit has become public, the lack of accountability 
in the government's response and the lack of accountability from 
the current minister and the previous minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our democracy, our parliamentary system, there is a very 
honourable tradition that when there has been a lack of 
accountability and mismanagement, at the end of the day it is the 
minister who must take responsibility.  The minister is 
accountable and the government is responsible for decisions that 
have been made.  That is why opposition parties have been very 
clear in telling the current minister and the previous minister 
that we want accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of questions about this fund.  Looking at the 
internal audit, we see that it was only a sample audit, not a 
full detailed audit.  In reading the report, we read “there was 
concern with respect to some political presence in the programs 
at times.  While a certain amount of political involvement is 
expected in a program involving partners from the various levels 
of government, there was nevertheless some uneasiness amongst 
some respondents regarding projects which may have been approved 
for political reasons rather than based on the strength of the 
business plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has a huge amount of concern about the very diplomatic 
language that is being used in an audit that clearly points to 
the political decision making and political management that took 
place to the advantage of the government for their Liberal 
members and its party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have questions as to where those funds ended up.  Why did 
they end up in the minister's riding, the Prime Minister's riding 
and other Liberal member ridings that clearly did not meet the 
criteria for the fund?  Why did affluent ridings receive a 
disproportionate amount of these funds?  They may have had some 
unemployment but certainly not as high as other parts of Canada, 
such as Vancouver East, the area that I represent.  Look at the 
downtown eastside which has the lowest income postal code in 
Canada.  There was one transitional jobs fund program approved in 
1997, before I was a member of parliament.  It is an area of 
incredibly high unemployment.  Why has that area not received 
anything?  Why has money gone into the member's riding?  Why has 
it not gone into the riding of my colleague from Winnipeg Centre, 
which also has high unemployment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very serious questions about why a massive amount 
of public funds have been directed in such a way that they have 
clearly benefited government members and to the detriment of 
other needier areas in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our critic for EI, the member for Acadie—Bathurst, wrote a 
letter to the auditor general calling for an immediate special 
audit of the situation in HRDC.  The letter he received back made 
it clear that the staff of the auditor general, who were 
conducting an audit into the grants and contributions, believed 
that there was so much work that needed to be done that the audit 
would not be completed until the end of July and the report 
published in October. 
It is important that the audit be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP support the motion because we believe it is 
very important to get to the bottom of what took place.  We know 
that Canadians support legitimate, transparent and accountable 
job creation and job development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP have always supported those programs.  What we do 
not support is the denial, the lack of accountability, and what 
is now obviously political management of the fund that is 
benefiting government members and denying areas most in need. 
Those are the questions that we want to see fully made 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the motion deals with the issue of accountability 
and integrity of the government.  We think that is very critical. 
At the end of the day the current minister and the former 
minister who are both involved in this matter must be responsible 
and must do the responsible thing in terms of being accountable 
for what has taken place within the department.  We have called 
for their resignation and will continue to do that.  We support 
the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for her remarks.  As the member might 
be aware, I as a backbench MP have done a number of studies on 
NGOs, non-governmental organizations, particularly charities and 
non-profits.  I have encountered a lot of problems with 
transparency and accountability in these organizations and I have 
reported on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she be of the view that if we are going to clean up this 
whole issue of giving government grants and contributions to 
organizations one shoe should fit all and that non-profit 
organizations should be required to meet the same standards of 
transparency, accountability and corporate governance as 
for-profit organizations in order to be eligible for public funds 
and, moreover, that they should submit themselves to performance 
reviews in order to be subject to further grants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
but again it is another example of how Liberal members are really 
trying to deflect what is taking place in the debate.  They are 
shifting the attack and now saying is it not non-profits that are 
somehow at fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a long history of close to 30 years of working with 
non-profit organizations and NGOs.  I can tell the member that 
non-profit societies in terms of their democracy, in terms of 
their transparency, are probably the best model that we have in 
the country of how things should work.  If the member wants to 
look for where there is corruption or where there is 
mismanagement then perhaps he should go into the business 
community, into some of the financial institutions, to see what 
is going on there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we expect that non-profits will make applications in 
good faith, will fulfil those applications and will meet the 
mandates of the program.  The groups I have dealt with spend a 
huge amount of time doing that and trying to meet all the 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what this issue is about, though.  This issue is 
about the mismanagement of the government, the political 
mismanagement in the administration of the fund.  Why is the 
member not raising that question? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is refreshing to hear a member from 
the NDP talk about fiscal responsibility.  What we are looking at 
today is that the old way of spending for votes is with us, 
rather than wisely administering the public trust.  That is what 
is staring us in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of HRDC seems to be characterized as a starry-eyed 
idealist defending cash transfer programs, taking from the many 
to give to the few.  The Liberals are like the Liberals of old, 
the do-gooders for their friends who stupidly believe that top 
down broad bureaucratic job creation programs actually create 
lasting economic transformation.  The Liberals cannot manage. 
Especially starting in the Pearson-Trudeau years, federal 
ministers are inherently expansionary.  They exist; therefore 
they will spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member vote against the socialism of the Liberals in 
the next budget?  What we are looking at today was in last year's 
budget.  The Minister of Finance has to bear a lot of 
responsibility for the philosophy and the program allocation, 
what were the stated goals of the program. 
I am looking for a critical evaluation come budget time if there 
is an appearance of these kinds of programs in the next budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  Previous Liberal budgets or the ones we expect are 
certainly not my idea of what socialism is about, but I assure 
the member we will provide very rigid scrutiny of what the budget 
contains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question really pertains to fiscal accountability and 
responsibility.  It is unfortunate the member has the idea that 
somehow New Democrats do not stand for that.  Of course we do. If 
he looks at the Government of Saskatchewan or the NDP Government 
of British Columbia, and if he looks at the work we do in the 
House, he will see that we take very seriously fiscal 
responsibility and ensuring that public funds mandated under 
specific programs go where they are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why in terms of this issue we are scandalized and 
outraged at what has taken place under the Liberal 
administration.  There has been a complete lack of 
accountability, a complete lack of proper political 
administration of the program for very political purposes.  This 
is fiscally irresponsible and we are the first to stand and say 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague from Vancouver East for agreeing to share 
her time with me.  As she has correctly pointed out in her 
speech, our two ridings share a great deal of common items, most 
of which are not very enviable.  The very things we share are 
things people would probably not want to share.  One of them is 
that both our ridings suffer from chronic long term poverty and 
all the predictable consequences that come with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member pointed out, she represents what is the poorest 
postal code region in the country, downtown Vancouver East.  My 
riding is the third poorest riding in the country when measured 
by the incidence of poverty and average family income.  However, 
the point I would like to make is that neither of us qualify for 
any transitional jobs fund money.   Although we are suffering 
from crime, violence and all issues surrounding chronic long term 
poverty, we do not qualify for the help these funds were 
presumably set up to assist ridings in dire straits.  Frankly 
there has not been one red cent for the riding of Winnipeg 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really irks us.  It is galling, as we see the onion being 
peeled back layer by layer and the truth starting to come out, 
that the ridings benefiting from these funds are fairly affluent 
and well to do ridings.  More often than not there has been some 
political influence in how these grants were allocated to various 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most glaring and best example we could use is the riding 
represented by the current minister of HRDC.  With an 
unemployment rate of 6.6% and an incidence of poverty of 10.7% in 
her riding, how does she justify pouring job creation money into 
the particular riding?  Most of us in poor inner city ridings 
look to statistics such as these and are envious of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another glaring example came to light when we looked at the 
Edmonton East riding of the current Minister of Justice.  Most of 
the country is flocking to Edmonton because there are jobs and 
opportunity and prosperity.  I am not sure what the unemployment 
rate is in Edmonton West but I am sure it is not the 12% that we 
were told was necessary to qualify for these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $1.3 million grant went to banding trees to prevent Dutch elm 
disease in the riding of Edmonton West.  This is a laudable 
concept.  I am all in favour of saving elm trees, but why do we 
not qualify for anything with an unemployment rate that is 
staggering in the inner city of Winnipeg and an incidence of 
poverty that is 31.1%?  Some 31.1% of all people living in my 
riding are poor and we do not get anything, zero, zippo.  We were 
told that we do not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules keep changing.  First there had to be 12% unemployment 
to qualify. 
Now we learn that maybe in the riding of Edmonton West it is not 
under 12% but that there are pockets of unemployment.  That is 
the term they are using.  Aboriginal people in her riding are 
disproportionately unemployed.  That is a legitimate point but 
she did not tell that to us. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same argument in Vancouver East or Winnipeg Centre. 
I could point to and illustrate pockets of unemployment all over 
my riding, but we were told that we do not get anything.  This is 
what is really galling and grating to people who are representing 
areas in genuine need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Vancouver East pointed out two flaws in the 
current system.  One is the glaring errors in the administration 
of the fund.  That is really what came to light first.  Nobody 
can deny there is a serious problem.  Even the minister is 
recognizing that there is a serious problem.  I can indicate why 
we have this serious problem.  It is because when one-third of 
the public sector is cut, hacked and slashed and everybody is 
laid off, how could we expect the same amount of work to be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unreasonable to think the same kind of scrutiny can be 
applied to these projects when everybody has been fired. In the 
federal public sector 50,000 people have been laid off.  Now the 
chickens are coming home to roost.  We are starting to see the 
predictable outcome of laying off all those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next glaring point about the TJF is the allocation.  It was 
a mystery to all of us how some ridings got these grants and some 
did not.  Now it seems pretty clear.  It is political influence. 
The Liberals are using it as a Liberal slush fund to further 
their own interests in their own ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously on a personal level I can point out that it is tragic 
we did not get any of it in my riding, but the real tragedy is 
that it makes members of the general public even more cynical 
than they already were about the political process and about what 
we do in this place as politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they were not jaded enough already, as the real horror of 
this disastrous story unfolds more and more Canadians will be 
even more cynical about their government.  That is the tragic 
point I would like to make.  It is tough enough to do our job and 
try to maintain some semblance of dignity without this kind of 
thing tarnishing the image of every person who stands in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Prime Minister's riding there were 17 of these TJF 
grants.  Let us imagine the millions and millions and millions of 
dollars.  Actually we have a total list of all grants that went 
into the riding of the Minister of Human Resource Development. 
Over three years there were $30 million in grants or $10 million 
a year.  It is a booklet as thick as the Manhattan phone book. 
Virtually every little business in the whole riding has had 
something shovelled toward them from these many, many, many 
programs.  Not all of them were TJF grants.  I think there were 
only three transitional jobs fund grants in her riding, but in an 
area with 6.6% unemployment, not even half the minimum standard 
which the rules say have to be met before a riding qualifies for 
anything, it makes one wonder how that money was directed to that 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us on the prairies look to Ontario as a land of 
opportunity and prosperity.  How do towns like Brant qualify for 
these grants?  I am sure that there are problems all over the 
country and everybody deserves equal access to these types of 
training funds and subsidies, but it seems it is 
disproportionately going to areas that cannot really argue they 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average family income in the riding represented by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is $45,000 a year. The 
people in the core area of Winnipeg can only dream about aspiring 
to that level of income.  The average family income where I live 
is $28,000 a year.  We are talking about a disparity.  It may 
just be a different standard of poverty, but it is certainly a 
lack of understanding of what it means to be locked into the 
inner city core area without opportunity.  These programs should 
be there to assist on a broader level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the Prime Minister's riding with 17 of these 
grants worth $7,296,000.  Is this justifiable when other ridings 
are being given absolutely nothing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I echo the comments of my colleague that frankly the NDP is not 
against job creation programs.  If the transitional jobs fund did 
not exist the NDP would probably be calling for such a program to 
be created.  We are in favour of this kind of thing, but we make 
the argument that everybody should have equal access to those 
opportunities.  They should not be spread out in as 
disproportionate a way as they are currently.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really does make me wonder how the minister of HRDC with 6.6% 
unemployment can qualify for any kind of grant at all. Then of 
course there is Edmonton West with $1.3 million to band trees to 
prevent Dutch elm disease.  There is a Dutch elm disease problem 
in Winnipeg too, but I do not think anybody would be so 
presumptuous as to apply for a transitional jobs fund grant for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that the NDP will be voting in favour of the 
Reform Party's opposition day motion.  We think we are seeing 
only the tip of the iceberg here as has been pointed out over and 
over again.  As we get deeper into this scandal, and that is the 
only word we can use as it is going to be the scandal of the 
spring, I regret as well that we are being diverted from the many 
other pressing issues of the day. Frankly, it is a bit of a 
diversion that we are concentrating on this subject instead of 
all the important work that we could be doing, but it is 
necessary.  To restore the confidence of the general public it is 
a process we are going to have to go through as painful as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real tragedy is not seeing one minister toppled, if that is 
to be.  The real tragedy is that the general public is so 
disillusioned as they watch this unfold that we are doing 
permanent damage to the reputation of the whole political system. 
This should be dealt with swiftly.  If the government were 
honourable it would not be dallying around.  It would not be 
trying to build barricades and fences around the issue.  It 
should treat this issue honestly and admit that something 
terrible is taking place.  A very transparent process must take 
place to heal the wounds because some cuts do not heal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,  this 
is a very interesting opposition day we are having today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a real scandal before us.  Even in the opinion of the 
Prime Minister, it hearkens back to the great Mulroney years. 
The Prime Minister got carried away last week saying that things 
were no worse than they had been in Brian Mulroney's time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they are worse.  Here, a deliberate effort is being made 
to play with democracy. 
For example, in the riding of Saint-Maurice, the week before the 
election on June 2, 1997, there was an avalanche of often 
questionable grants, including to the golf club and to a certain 
motel the Prime Minister is quite familiar with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, my friend and former colleague, 
Roger Pomerleau, was beaten by my former union head.  Thanks to 
the abuse, his election cost taxpayers $25 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding of Brant, where there is almost no unemployment, 
millions and millions of dollars were invested in mismanaged 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the polls, as they put it so well, if the trend 
continues, we have taken at random 459 files, which we have 
systematically studied and have come up with 37 nebulous cases, 
really nebulous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for me to mention Vidéotron, McGill or the 
natives who repaid jewels with taxpayers' money.  Off the top of 
my head, this represents an 8% rate of error in the 
administration of HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are in fact 10,000 files, at the rate of 8% there would 
be 800 cases, and 37 have been found.  There are another 763 
they will have to start looking for tomorrow morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand.  I wrote a letter to the former Minister of 
Human Resources Development because, through his delivery 
assistance program, an arbitrary decision, he had allocated a 
certain questionable amount in my riding.  I wrote him saying 
“Be careful, Mr. Minister.  You are playing with public money. 
You are cutting the benefits of the unemployed and using the 
money to pad those who do not need padding.  They are already 
well padded financially”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Three months later—he often went to Paris too often, apparently 
—he wrote me to say “I do not understand, Mr. Chrétien, your not 
being proud at having $35,000 distributed in your riding”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to have him give $35,000, but properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>   The hon. member has already used three 
minutes of his time and many members would like to ask 
questions.  That is not fair, I feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre, to give a short answer to 
the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
comments which are very much in keeping with my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the member's first point, it does remind us of the 
Mulroney years and we should be reminded of what the Prime 
Minister said during those Mulroney years when he talked about 
the corruption that was so rampant in that cabinet. This is a 
quote from the Prime Minister in 1991.  He said, “When we form 
the government every minister in the cabinet that I will be 
presiding over will have to take full responsibility for what is 
going on in his department.  If there is any bungling in the 
department, no one will be singled out.  It will be the minister 
that will have to take the full responsibility”.  Those are very 
strong words and it was a zero tolerance attitude maintained by 
the current Prime Minister as the opposition leader in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the same sort of swift action, take no 
prisoners.  If we are going to restore the public's confidence, 
swift action must be taken.  Frankly the minister is going to 
have to go.  We are going to hold the current Prime Minister to 
his word and the comments he made in 1991.  The same should still 
apply today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with my colleague the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saga continues.  Let us go back in time.  We have heard 
different members get up in the House of Commons today and speak 
about whatever we want to call it, shovelgate, or Place du 
Portage gate, which is the building which houses this department, 
or the bunker.  We could name it what we want but it is certainly 
a huge scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to January 19 when the minister of HRDC came into 
the foyer of the House of Commons and delivered the internal 
audit dated January 2000.  That very same day I called the 
department for a copy of the audit and it was so kind as to send 
a copy to my office.  Then 10 minutes later I got a phone call 
from the same department to tell me that I had been sent the 
wrong cover sheet and I was asked if I would destroy that cover 
sheet and throw it in the garbage.  I asked to be sent the other 
cover sheet and I would take a look at it. When I received the 
other cover sheet, there was no date.  The date of October 5 had 
been deleted. I checked with the various media to see what cover 
sheet they had received and they had received the one with no 
date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious from that that the department was in a massive 
cover-up.  It might be a strong word but it is certainly a lot of 
money.  We are talking about a billion dollars here, not a 
million.  We are talking about a billion dollars of taxpayers' 
money, money that people work hard for every single day, and they 
pay hard taxes as well. We have come to find that a billion 
dollars has possibly been mismanaged.  I think it has been 
mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at 459 cases out of 30,000 cases and 37 could be 
very serious.  Let us do the math. The math was done to do the 
audit.  They picked 459 different cases.  If we do the math and 
take 37 cases out of 459 out of a universe of 30,000, that would 
give us 2,400 files with a problem for a possible total of $2 
billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two billion dollars is a lot of money and we are only talking 
about one department, HRDC.  Out of this big universe in Ottawa, 
HRDC is not the only department that gives out grant money. 
There is Heritage Canada and industry.  There is a serious 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking for an external audit on this.  The minister 
sent out to the press conference yesterday the very same people 
she accused of being in the dark ages just the week before. I 
have questions for the House and the minister.  Who is in charge 
of the department?  Is it the senior bureaucrats we saw yesterday 
or is it the minister? We all saw the scrum coming out of the PMO 
last week. We have good reason to think why she was not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also asked yesterday for the resignation of the minister 
because the buck stops there.  The buck stops with her desk, not 
with anybody else.  She accused bureaucrats of bungling this.  I 
state in the House of Commons that when I deal with the 
bureaucrats in my riding, they are very thorough and very 
transparent. If she is going to point the finger at somebody, she 
had better put a mirror in front of herself and point at it. That 
is the person she has to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also find with this audit that there was a concentration of 
grants given during the 1997 electoral period, 54% to be exact. 
That can be put in the calculator too.  Fifty-four per cent of 
the grants were given during an election period.  It is 
absolutely scandalous that taxpayers' money that was supposed to 
go into regions affected by employment insurance reform was being 
used to try to elect Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Buying votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  It was pretty well that.  I hear members 
of the opposition saying it was to buy votes.  We will certainly 
let the public decide that.  We will tell them the facts and let 
them decide what is really going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs were brought in to help regions with high levels 
of unemployment, regions which under TJF had to have 12% and 
higher, like my riding.  I was fortunate enough to receive TJF 
funds and the funds worked well.  But mishandlings went on in the 
department and that is the problem. We have to find out exactly 
what is going on with the department so we can maximize the 
impact of what this was supposed to do in helping the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's own riding of Brant has an unemployment level of 
6.6%.  Where is the justification for qualifying projects in that 
riding?  If my riding had 6.6%, we would not have received a 
cent, but it has something like 25% to 30%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bureaucrats yesterday, when being questioned by the media, 
stated that there are pockets of unemployment within that riding. 
We have a hard time getting the unemployment rate in a riding. 
How can we get a reading of the unemployment rate in a pocket of 
a riding?  In my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, the 
Restigouche portion is calculated with the area of Charlotte in 
southern New Brunswick.  How can we calculate a pocket within a 
riding?  Is it by street number?  I am not sure, but I would 
certainly like to see how it is done.  I would like to see the 
pocket in my riding which is the highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned with what has gone on in the past couple 
of weeks, and probably the past couple of years.  We are talking 
about $1 billion, maybe a lot more.  We could call it shovelgate, 
or whatever we want, but it is the biggest scandal in Canadian 
history and it is on the Liberal government's head.  The only way 
we can get around this, the only way we can bring transparency 
back to this parliament, is to ask for an external audit.  We 
cannot ask the very same department to audit what it has done. 
That is like asking the RCMP to investigate the RCMP.  We cannot 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility as a parliament to the people of Canada 
to be transparent.  Therefore, I ask the minister to call for an 
external audit to get to the bottom of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate my colleague for putting forward this 
motion.  This party wholeheartedly supports the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to many of the comments which were made 
today.  What absolutely amazes me is that the member would 
suggest that $1 billion— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  It is $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Now we are up to $2 billion.  It has 
been suggested that somehow every dollar of the total went to bad 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said himself that he applauded the work of the public 
servants in his riding.  Right off the bat, I would presume he is 
saying that the work which was done in his riding by those public 
servants was satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  It was excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  It was excellent.  The member said 
that the work done in his riding by public servants was 
excellent.  I believe that in the House of Commons, with almost 
301 members, the member does not have the only team of public 
servants whose work is excellent.  I happen to believe that about 
my own riding and I know there are other members who feel the 
same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there files on which ongoing investigations needed to be 
pursued?  Everybody has acknowledged that on the sampling of over 
400 files, 37 needed extended work.  That is happening.  This is 
totally transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member not concerned that by casting aspersions on every 
single grant that was given in every single riding he is casting 
aspersions in a way that many of those people with good solid 
projects that have served his riding, my riding and many other 
ridings well are going to feel tainted, poisoned or stained? 
Does the member not feel that within that $1 billion there were 
many good projects?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.  However, the person who accused the public 
servants was the minister of HRDC, not the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche.  The minister was trying to pass the 
blame to everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, in certain areas these programs have worked.  But that is 
not the question.  The question is the billion dollars of 
mismanagement.  It could be more.  We are talking about 30,000 
projects at HRDC.  It could be much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week a former cabinet minister told me to be careful of 
what I said.  I could jeopardize the programs.  I will tell the 
House something.  It is important to know where every bloody cent 
goes that taxpayers pay.  That is not going to buy my silence. 
We are going to get to the bottom of it.  We need an external 
audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to protect taxpayer money, if we are going to 
maximize what we do with these funds, we need to bring 
transparency back to this parliament and ask for an external 
audit.

<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
not only do I wish to congratulate my Progressive Conservative 
colleague and counterpart, but I am going to ask him a question 
in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we agree with an external audit but, as a member in an area 
of high unemployment, does he not find it strange that there 
were more projects in ridings with much lower rates of 
unemployment, when his own constituents were suffering? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that his colleague in the New Democratic Party told me 
that he was feeling the effects of this situation because the 
unemployed do not necessarily have money to invest in a project 
and because, in other more prosperous regions, such as the 
present minister's riding, there is more money to launch 
projects to help the unemployed. How would he describe this 
situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be better to have a criterion based on the number 
of unemployed people for this program, which is aimed at the 
unemployed?  Would he agree that this should be the criterion 
for deciding how to distribute funds fairly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the member for 
Lévis, for his excellent question, because I know that there are 
also problems in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at these ridings with high unemployment and see how 
the funds are being distributed under this program, I find this 
absolutely deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to defend itself. This morning, someone 
said that when an individual makes a mistake in filling out his 
unemployment cards, he is immediately considered to be guilty 
“You're guilty, so off to jail with you”. But what we have here 
is evidence that there was a lot of mismanagement or a huge lack 
of management, and the government, as well as the Prime Minister 
is rallying around the minister to try to protect her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is what we are used to seeing with this government, but 
some limits and policies must be implemented in order to help 
all the regions affected by high unemployment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate.  As 
alluded to by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche, it is very timely that the official 
opposition brought forward this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As time passes it is like the dance of a thousand veils that we 
are seeing from the government.  We are seeing more and more 
information coming forward.  I would suggest this is not coming 
forward in a very voluntary and forthright way, as members of the 
government would have us believe.  In fact, the minister 
literally had the proverbial gun to her head when she knew that 
access to information requests had been made and that this 
information was inevitably going to be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the premise that the HRDC ministry is set up 
for a very legitimate purpose. 
There are areas in the country which obviously need assistance in 
job creation.  As the hon. member opposite suggested, we are not, 
as an opposition, suggesting that every single program in the 
country was somehow not legitimate.  We are suggesting that it is 
coming to light daily that a significant portion of them were not 
legitimate.  It is absolutely astonishing when we hear, and when 
the Canadian public hears, that there are companies which 
received money that did not even fill out an application.  It is 
absolutely astronomical when one considers the implications. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the money get from the government coffers into the hands 
of an organization that apparently did not even request it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the most appropriate characterization of all of this 
is mismanagement.  I would suggest that the minister has been 
very economical with the truth when it comes to the disclosure of 
information.  She has suggested in numerous statements that HRDC 
knows where the money is, that it is all accounted for.  We can 
go to our bank accounts and see that withdrawals were made. We 
have the cheques to suggest that the money was received.  The 
question is:  How was the money spent?  Was it spent in line and 
consistent with the applications, if there were applications? 
Was the money accounted for?  Was it tracked?  Was there any 
mechanism or system in place which guaranteed the legitimacy of 
the company or the exercise for which the money was applied? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough there are 
regions, in Guysborough County for example, where unemployment is 
in the range of 20% to 30%.  It is devastating for the people in 
that part of the country.  This program, if we are to have faith 
in it, is aimed specifically at helping depressed regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy in all of this, and my colleague from the NDP 
alluded to this, is the absolute cynicism and the absolute loss 
of any remaining shred of credibility that the government and 
parliament might have in the country.  It is on the chopping 
block.  It is now on the altar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that when people look at this 
their trust and faith is going to go further underground.  We 
heard members of the government, these same individuals and the 
Prime Minister when in opposition, assuring Canadians that things 
would be different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only a matter of time before someone raised the terrible 
spectre of Brian Mulroney.  By comparison, and time will tell, we 
will see just how legitimate some of these claims are when 
stacked up against the Mulroney administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recall that image we saw of the rat pack, appropriately 
named.  Who can forget the image of the current minister of 
heritage scrambling over desks, howling like a banshee, to get at 
a member of the Mulroney government?  Where is she now?  The 
silence is deafening when it comes to questions being asked of 
her own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from New Brunswick also alluded to the fact that 
this is hard-working taxpayers' money.  This is the blood, sweat 
and tears of Canadians who give their money to the government in 
good faith, on the understanding that it will be spent in a 
responsible fashion, in the belief that the money is going to be 
used for legitimate purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need from the government is an accounting.  What we need 
is some semblance of responsible reaction, some transparency. 
These are the types of words the Prime Minister was very free to 
throw around while in opposition but very reluctant to embrace 
now that he is sitting on the government benches.  Of course, 
that is not new.  We saw similar platitudes and comments made 
about things like the GST and free trade.  All of these were 
going to change.  They were scrapped along with the helicopter 
program and most of the red book promises after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need now is for the government to be completely open 
about what has taken place.  It appears that this so-called 
scandal goes back to the very beginnings.  It goes back to 1993, 
almost immediately after the government came to power, under the 
ministry of that now infamous name, Doug Young.  The voters of 
New Brunswick had the good foresight to send Mr. Young a message 
in the last election. 
I suggest, and again time will tell, whether under his tutelage 
in this department the policies, principles and infrastructure 
were put in place to allow for this scandal to brood, fester and 
continue for years after.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw an unprecedented attempt by the current minister.  It was 
a simultaneously behind covering and face saving exercise to 
point behind her to the previous minister, but I think she has to 
go back a little further to Mr. Young, to the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I credit the media for this truth seeking exercise.  It really 
began in the off season.  It is astronomical when we think about 
it, but we know the Prime Minister in his comments to his caucus 
last week said that they should sit tight, batten down the 
hatches and this would go away.  They have a budget coming and 
there are other things they can distract the Canadian public 
with.  They can talk about clarity.  They can talk about the 
muddy, ill timed, ill conceived bill they have foisted on the 
country, and hopefully the real issues of the country will go 
away, such as the problems in health care, the overburdened 
taxation system, the problems in education, crippling student 
debt, underfunding to the military and underfunding for the law 
enforcement agencies, all of which are not priorities.  They will 
talk about constitutional matters which in the meantime will 
hopefully distract from the burgeoning and ballooning scandal 
taking place in the HRD department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing and sequence of events set out by my colleague from 
New Brunswick about the infamous fax sheet that was sent with the 
deleted date were very interesting.  Obviously I suggest an 
attempt was made to distance the minister from knowledge of the 
first instance when the matter was brought to her attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there was a shuffle in cabinet or a change in ministries 
in August.  It stands to reason that an extensive briefing would 
take place when a new minister took over.  The audit was already 
under way.  Surely the previous minister would have had some 
conversation with the minister to let her know that this was 
something that might happen on her watch because it had already 
begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communication breakdown is not new is this instance.  We 
know of a similar situation.  The current Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans had dropped in his lap the fact that the Marshall 
decision was before the supreme court.  His predecessor did not 
take the time to let him know that there was a crisis brewing. A 
lot of Chinese walls and walls of silence seem to surround the 
government when it comes to sharing bad news.  It certainly does 
not want to share bad news with the opposition or the Canadian 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that goes to the very root of democracy.  This 
goes to the very confidence of Canadians in their government.  As 
painful and as ugly as it may seem, this entire exercise of 
uncovering what has taken place in this department is necessary 
if we are somehow to try to restore some semblance of integrity. 
It is very sad that using the word integrity in the political 
process has almost become an oxymoron. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members opposite do not like to hear this.  It is 
really tough to get hit with the truth, but I want the Canadian 
public to know that the Progressive Conservative Party supports 
the motion wholeheartedly.  This is perhaps the beginning of the 
end for the reign of error of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are cynical beyond belief and apathy has begun to set 
in.  Parliament has been darkened by the performance of the 
minister and the government in this regard.  The flag over the 
Peace Tower should be flying at half-staff today.  The death of 
what remaining faith there was in the hearts and minds of 
Canadians may be on the altar today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an external audit.  It is obvious to everyone in this 
place and to the millions of Canadians who are watching that this 
has to take place if there is to be any shred, any scintilla of 
credibility left in the government.  All of what it has said and 
now all of what it has done are before the Canadian public and 
have to be laid bare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to have taken part in this debate and 
I welcome the opportunity to continue to ask relevant questions 
of the government.  Hopefully we will get some answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just have to caution members opposite that when they 
make comparisons between the last election of 1993 under the 
Mulroney government they have to watch out if they start to look 
at multiculturalism funding.  There are those of us who have 
documents and have done research in this area.  They are liable 
to find, just as an example, the Parents for French organization 
used to get a $130,000 annual contribution from the Mulroney 
government but just prior to the election it went to $424,000. 
There was a lot going on in that year about funding special 
interest groups of all kinds prior to an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make to the member is that there is an 
opportunity to take advantage of the situation.  I asked a 
question of members of the NDP and they dodged the reply.  I ask 
this question of the member opposite.  Is he willing to see the 
same standards of transparency, accountability and performance 
review that we wish to see in HRDC apply to all other 
organizations that we see getting funding from government, 
including those organizations involved in unions, involved in 
poverty, non-governmental organizations, charities and 
non-profits?  Does he not think one shoe should fit all in terms 
of accountability and transparency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to 
that question.  We know in the past the government has said one 
thing while in opposition but when it made that stroll a couple 
of sword lengths across the floor it did something completely 
different.  Of course we want the same standard applied across 
the board.  We are very anxious to see transparency and truth in 
government.  We are sitting here on the edge of our seats in 
anticipation that it will happen, but will it happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite loves to raise the spectre of Mulroney, 
but I will tell the House that when this is all over I think the 
name he knows well will replace it.  The promises of a new 
approach, the promises of a new administration, are all in 
jeopardy now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member from the Conservative Party made a very good and 
interesting speech.  I am amazed at the questions and comments of 
Liberal members, especially the member who asked a question two 
minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same member supported the $20 million payment to the NHL. I 
heard the Liberal member on CBC Radio supporting the program. Yet 
his own caucus was opposing it and that is why the program was 
cancelled.  I am amazed that I do not hear any objections coming 
from that side.  As a matter of fact that side is trying to say 
that this was a good program, not understanding that it was 
totally mismanaged and, as my colleague has said, the biggest 
scandal to hit the government.  Perhaps he would like to comment 
on what we are hearing from Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my learned friend knows 
that hypocrisy is not a word we can use in this place.  There is 
something rotten in the Liberal dome.  The malevolent king of 
slush playing Robin Hood in reverse has somehow been caught in 
the squeeze.  There is a big difference between giving money to 
the NHL, giving money to the banks, giving money to fat cat 
Liberals.  When it comes to a job creation program we are 
supposed to be helping Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that my friends in the NDP have not raised the 
issue that changes to the EI system took place in the early part 
of this administration which now keep money away from needy 
Canadians if they are a few hours short of qualifying. Yet the 
government seems prepared or more than willing to put money into 
companies that are already making money.  It seems prepared to 
give money to businesses.  Yet it will keep money away from needy 
Canadians who are a few hours short of qualifying for EI.  This 
is a very shady approach on which Canadians will judge the 
government harshly in the next general election.

problems with Human Resources Development Canada are nothing 
new. On the eve of the June, 1997, election, a man by the name 
of Pierre Corbeil received from the minister who has now left, 
the former member for Hull—Aylmer, a list of people who would get 
significant amounts of money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre came first and he asked for a ransom, in cash, please. We 
do not know whether all the funds he received went directly to 
the Liberal Party of Canada or if some got lost in his car along 
the way but, nevertheless, it was seven months before the RCMP 
were able to bring charges against him and before he recognize 
his wrongdoing. But nothing was done within the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is almost like Douglas Young, the guy from New Brunswick. 
He got his punishment. I would like my colleague to finish this 
story. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague has brought 
the name of Pierre Corbeil into this debate.  We know there were 
actually criminal convictions registered in that instance.  We 
know that it arose out of HRDC where a Liberal fundraiser armed 
with lists of pending HRDC transitional jobs money went knocking 
on the doors of companies that were perhaps eligible to receive 
it and said “A little something for the effort and we might be 
able to speed up the process”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were criminal convictions registered.  The trail is now 
cold but I think more and more watchdogs have become aware of it. 
It comes down to a question of priorities.  Do we spend money in 
this reckless fashion or buy MRIs?  Do we allow for some form of 
accountability or some form of student debt relief?  The 
government has to make priority decisions.  The government has 
mismanaged taxpayer moneys and is now being held to account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to stand in defence of the people of Canada, 
particularly the people of my wonderful riding of Elk Island, and 
to address this very timely issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I moved a concurrence motion in the report of the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts.  The report which was 
tabled in the House last November would have addressed this 
question.  Of course the government has been sitting on it.  We 
began the debate and the very first Liberal member who rose moved 
to stop the debate.  Of course the Liberals have the majority and 
stopped the debate on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One gets the impression that the Liberal pork-barrelling the 
program we are talking about represents is a favourite program of 
the government.  The Liberals just do not want to see it attacked 
or criticized or repaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to note today that all members on the 
opposition side have spoken in favour of this very timely motion. 
It is time that all of us, not only members in the opposition but 
members on the other side, to do so.  They were behind their 
leader in the last two elections.  They said they would follow 
the leader of the Liberal Party who would take them into power 
with integrity and who promised a new trust in government.  That 
is wonderful.  I believe that people voted for the Liberals 
because of that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I venture to say in all sincerity that members on the government 
side will apparently today, so we are told, stand on command and 
vote against the motion in defiance of their own sense of 
integrity because they know that this problem has to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use a bit of my time this morning to give a little math 
lesson because it has been overlooked so far.  The Prime Minister 
has tried to diminish the size of the problem by saying that only 
37 projects are suspect and that the rest are all fine.  He is 
also saying that the 37 being questioned will be clarified and 
all will be well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways of dealing with a problem like this.  One way 
is by denial, get out the damage control troops to see whether 
the damage to the Liberal Party and the government of the day can 
be minimized.  The other way is to honestly face up to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have told this story in the House before.  I will briefly 
repeat it and anyone who wants the full story will have to go 
back. I remember one time in my life when I did something that 
really was bad.  I mentioned this story in the House a couple of 
years ago.  I was a youngster and I suppose I was following the 
lead of some of the older people in the group.  We were out for a 
bike ride and we ended up at a neighbour's place in the farm 
country of Saskatchewan.  The house was vacant.  As I said the 
last time I related the story, much to my sorrow and personal 
regret now, when we left not a single window was left in the 
building because we had broken every one of them by throwing 
rocks at them.  It was dastardly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the other parents did, but my father took me 
to the owner.  I will not mention his name again; the last time 
<I>Hansard</I> misspelled it because I forgot to give the correct 
spelling.  I had to look that man in the eye and say, “I broke 
the window”.  He also required that I pay it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a youngster on a Saskatchewan farm in the late forties. 
We did not have a great deal of money.  Money was hard to earn. 
I picked up beer bottles for about two years and sold them in 
order to repay the debt.  I am grateful to my dad for the lesson 
he taught me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, that is a way of solving a problem.  When one has erred, 
the best way of fixing it is to face up to it, admit it and then 
make restitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a situation where the Prime Minister is trying to 
minimize the problem and explain it away instead of saying to the 
people of Canada, “Yes, the auditor general in his report 
brought this problem to our attention and we will do something 
about it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, nothing was done.  The previous member from the Tory 
party brought out this point too.  One of our people made the 
access to information request.  I do not know whether Canadians 
know this but when a request is made under the Access to 
Information Act one of the first things that happens is that the 
department getting the request fires off a warning memo to the 
minister that says, “Hey, they are looking into something here. 
Let us be prepared”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense that becomes part of the damage control team trying 
to get the defences ready even before the attack is launched.  It 
just so happened that within a couple of days of that access 
request being filed the minister said, “Oh, oh, we have been 
caught.  They are on our trail.  I guess now we will have to be 
honest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to say this, but an honesty that is forcibly 
extracted somehow rings hollow.  I do not want to impute any 
improper motives to the Prime Minister or to the various 
ministers who have been involved in this scandal but I think it 
rings hollow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to my math lesson, as members know, I have been an 
instructor of mathematics at the technical institute in Edmonton. 
I did not specialize in statistics but I know a little about it. 
One of the things that happens when a sample is done, within a 
statistical range of error, it is appropriate to apply the 
results of the sample to the entire population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Liberals like to gloat that right now if 2,000 
Canadians were asked how they would vote in the next election, 
something like 35% or 36% would say they would vote Liberal. How 
did they get that?  Out of the 2,000 people maybe there were 800 
or so who said they would vote Liberal. They took the 800 out of 
2,000 and extrapolated it to the entire population and said that 
is how the entire population would vote. That is how statistics 
work. 
As a matter of fact statistical methods are used all the time in 
many different industrial processes and certainly in 
socioeconomic studies and investigations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case there were some 30,000 projects.  The internal 
audit came as a result of the auditor general putting his finger 
on a problem.  That is when the internal audit was called and 
appropriately so.  The auditor general pointed out there was a 
problem way back last April, almost a year ago.  The department 
said that it needed to look into it and fix it, which was an 
appropriate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The internal audit looked at a random sample of 459 projects. 
These projects were not chosen because they were suspect; they 
were picked statistically at random.  That is my understanding of 
how these projects were chosen.  Of the 459 we have these 
percentages.  These are the numbers plus or minus a certain range 
due to statistical variation which is very normal in statistical 
studies.  My guess is that it could be plus or minus 5% or 
thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking a sample size of 459 and extrapolating it to 30,000, this 
is what we have.  Of the projects that were reviewed, 15% did not 
have an application on file.  That means out of all of them we 
could extrapolate to say that there are 4,500 projects that were 
approved without even having an application on file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  A member opposite is saying no but I stand 
by my numbers.  It is the same percentage applied to the whole 
population as it is to the sample plus or minus a very small 
range.  If he wants to say 4,400 or 4,600, I will go along with 
that, but it is 4,500 plus or minus a small number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those that had no cash forecasts, there would be 21,600 
projects.  Eleven per cent of them had no budget proposal.  That 
means we could conclude that some 3,300 of these projects did not 
even have budget proposals, and they were approved and received 
taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have signalled that my time is up and I wish I 
could go on.  I am trying to give a message to the Liberals on 
the other side. Today when they are asked to vote on this 
important motion, I appeal to them to do as will all other 
members on this side.  Let us vote for the people, for the 
taxpayers and not just for our own self-preservation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted the member for Elk Island raised the 
issue of the Access to Information Act because that is a subject 
of great sensitivity to me today.  As he will realize his party 
blocked a private member's bill that would reform the Access to 
Information Act, increase transparency and increase accessibility 
to the very kinds of documents and information that the member 
for Elk Island is citing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I would like to ask him how he could expect me as a member on 
this side of the House who is most interested in getting to the 
root of government documents, in getting to examine the way 
government functions and indeed who has had legislation before 
this House that would enable members to better do their job in 
this regard, to take this motion seriously when his party has 
deliberately blocked the very kind of legislation that we need in 
this House to enable backbenchers and opposition members to 
assess how government operates?  Legislation is transparent and 
yet that party, the party on the other side, has rejected that 
legislation.  And they expect me to support their motion?  Well, 
I am sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It appears that the hon. member is again challenging your 
authority.  You shut him off on this before but he persists.  Can 
we not get back to the debate on the subject at hand which is the 
scandal in HRDC? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure we will with the hon. 
member for Elk Island who now has the floor to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the member 
for Wentworth—Burlington is saying. 
He had a very important bill.  He came to members of the Reform 
Party and got them to sign a sheet of paper which said we want to 
make sure it is debated in the House.  Reform Party members 
agreed to that.  Then he changed the bill.  Now it has a 
different substance in some areas.  The signatures no longer 
stand.  It was simply on a matter of principle that he was given 
a set of signatures that applied to something other than what he 
was presenting in the House.  It is a completely different issue. 
He should understand that.  We want to preserve the integrity of 
Private Members' Business which is so important.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he has brought up the subject of integrity and I will 
just conclude with a simple statement.  I expect him as a result 
of his commitment to integrity, honesty, openness and 
transparency to rise in support of this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, every time I hear the member for 
Elk Island talk about his window story, I get very nervous about 
the beautiful stained glass windows in the House.  I hope he does 
not salivate over those beautiful windows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank his party for bringing this very timely motion to the 
House today.  It is very important. Throughout this country, we 
as politicians and members of parliament are held in low esteem 
regardless of this boondoggle. We need moral leadership that 
encourages people not only to become members of parliament but to 
run for elected office at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member should the minister be asked to resign, 
which I suspect she should do to show leadership, but should not 
the previous minister of that department also resign? These 
problems are systemic.  They did not just happen overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear the Conservative Party talk about 
accountability.  When it was in power a lot of money went into 
areas and was not really accounted for.  I am glad to see the 
Conservative Party has changed its tone and has seen the right 
way of doing things now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should not the previous minister resign as well for this 
boondoggle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has a valid point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to assure him that when I was nine years old, 
having gone through that lesson, I learned not to break windows. 
To my knowledge I have not broken one since then, even 
accidentally, so do not worry about the windows here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the idea of ministerial 
responsibility because the Prime Minister said that the ministers 
would be responsible.  Indeed it is a measure of integrity that 
when things have really blown apart the minister resigns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
regret that I have to stand in the House to talk today on a 
subject of this sort that represents what we would expect to be 
the very best for Canadians in terms of their use of tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come to sleuth and to understand more of this big scandal 
which some would suggest is certainly major mismanagement of 
taxpayer dollars.  I do definitely, individually, have major 
concerns with the management and the minister's and the whole 
government's lack of competence in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask this more as a question and the members in the House 
and people in the gallery and those watching in TV land would be 
the ones to respond. This government vaunts and boasts often of 
its competence, managerial ability, fiscal prudence and sound 
government.  We see quite the contrary it would appear.  I ask a 
question and I do not prejudge the outcome but everyone can draw 
their own conclusions.  Is there something of a fraud in the 
Prime Minister's brag of managerial competence, fiscal prudence 
and sound government? As I lay out my understanding of what has 
occurred here I will allow the audience to draw its own 
conclusions today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very considerable way what has happened over the last 
number of weeks, or at least what has been exposed, has drawn 
into question the jobs fund as a matter of principle and whether 
it is effective in creating jobs.  That is sad in a certain 
sense.  I am a believer that there can be tax dollars targeted 
for social programs for individuals who are disabled and so on. 
They need equipment and special access. That maybe is another 
matter.  That is a social program. That is policy set in place to 
help those who need that leg up in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government handouts are very poor at creating jobs in the 
general sense. 
If that were not the case then the maritime provinces would 
obviously be booming, as might other parts of our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, when we are not talking social programs—and 
there is need for that with respect to disabled and other 
people—job creation, for the most part, should be done by the 
private sector.  It is the engine that drives job creation. 
Studies have shown that.  It is beyond dispute.  Reducing 
corporate tax, payroll taxes and those kinds of things provide 
incentive and release money for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real shame that this $1 billion or more boondoggle seems 
to be endemic and systemic in the government.  It is money that 
could well be used in other areas.  When we have had significant 
cuts in health and post-secondary education and we have not had 
the kind of support for farmers in terms of a subsidy war across 
the world, it is a real shameful thing in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax dollars are justifiably used for things like health care, 
post-secondary education and a basic social safety net.  After 
that we do have a consensus to break down from there. 
What is so preposterous about this is that tax dollars have been 
used for things that they should not be used for and on the other 
hand we have had a deficit in respect to health, education and 
basic social needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need social programs that help people with disabilities 
and so on, but we do not need them as the driving engine to 
create jobs.  This is a fundamental flaw.  They do not create 
jobs as effectively or in any proportion as the private sector 
would if it was left to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When seats throughout the west were held by Reform, we did not 
say, as some people may have thought, that we did not want our 
share.  We said that we had enough of these kinds of programs. 
We have had enough of the old way of doing things, the dark ages' 
way of doing things, by patronage and pork barrelling which comes 
out of the 1800s and 1900s.  In a modern democracy, we should not 
be doing programs in this manner.  The west was not asking 
“Where is our share?”  It was saying “Enough of this kind of 
stuff, enough of these fiascos”,  which are now very apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government failed to create jobs in many cases.  It gave $14 
million to 32 companies but no jobs were created.  We can list 
many of them and we will over the course of the days ahead. 
Companies in my own province that created zero jobs were Clifford 
Smith Trucking, $72,000, and Saskatchewan Dutch Elm Disease 
Committee, $100,000.  No jobs were created.  I could go on with a 
list of companies and projects that received money but where not 
a single job was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could list companies that have closed.  A Cape Breton coffin 
factory received $400,000 to make fibreglass coffins that would 
float or last forever underground.  Only three of those coffins 
ever sold and the factory closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could list companies that have wasted money.  In the 1988 
audit we found, among other ridiculous kinds of examples, that a 
road that went nowhere was built through the riding of the then 
revenue minister Elmer MacKay.  Two bridges were built but no 
roads connected to them.  It goes on and on.  As a matter of 
principle, the government has clearly not been creating jobs and 
in fact cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has used this fund and the grants and 
contributions to give politically motivated handouts.  Some have 
called it a slush fund.  I will leave that for others to state. 
However, the minister certainly did not keep her own rules. There 
are 15 pages of grants given to the minister's Brant riding, a 
riding which should not have qualified for grants. Since April 
1999, she has approved other projects.  Her riding did not have 
an unemployment rate of over 10%.  The earlier qualifying rate 
had been 12%.  She was signing cheques for her own riding 
contrary to the most basic rule of the Canada jobs fund criteria, 
which was to create permanent jobs, new jobs, sustainable jobs 
and so on in areas of high unemployment, areas where there was 
more than 12% unemployment, later relaxed to 10%. She clearly 
violated that rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canadians put their trust in a minister who mismanages 
the money that goes into her own riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of other examples that have been mentioned in the 
House during question period.  I refer to the Grand-Mère Inn in 
the Prime Minister's own riding, the Pierre Corbeil story, an 
enterprising young Liberal, an individual who thought that he 
could lever some money for the Liberal coffers by going to them 
and saying “If you give me a donation, we will make sure your 
TJF application gets approved”.

member said.  He was charged with that and there was a 
conviction.  These programs are rife with that stuff.  It would 
not be surprising if many more instances of that turn up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, a special assistant in the justice 
minister's riding of Edmonton West by the name of Greg Fergus 
handled these special representations by ministers, which led to 
grant approvals in areas that did not strictly qualify.  Justice 
Minister McLellan's riding received $1,350,000 and $888,000 from 
the transitional jobs fund even though the unemployment rate was 
lower than the TJF rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no accountability to taxpayers and the records are 
poor.  This is not just sloppy, it is systemic.  If a dot or a 
decimal is missing, that is sloppy.  If it is patterned like this 
throughout, that is systemic.  The problem the government has is 
that these are not just a few isolated cases.  They run like a 
thread in terms of patronage and pork barrelling throughout the 
government.  It is endemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the recent TAGS program:  34% did not contain any 
proposal to support the project; 83% did not have any supporting 
documentation; 80% were not checked to see if recipients owed 
money to HRDC; and 76% did not show any evidence of financial 
monitoring.  That was under the Atlantic groundfish strategy. 
Other examples could be cited from across various departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe some cover-up is going on.  We have said before that 
the minister appeared to have misled the House.  On November 17, 
1999, she would have had the information in hand and had been 
fully briefed, yet subsequent to that, on December 1 and again on 
December 7, she talked about the wonderful and extraordinary job 
being done to make sure Canadians got back to work.  What a 
wonderful play act.  On December 7 she talked about how Canadians 
approved of this when she was withholding information that would 
have pointed to the contrary and would have exposed this whole 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have to ask, and I believe some have rightly done so, 
whether the minister is staying in that role because of 
bloodlines or genetics because her father did not fiscally manage 
things accurately.  Significant dollars were in question when she 
was in the aboriginal affairs department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's spin on this whole thing is that there are 
only a few cases.  Let us consider that the scathing audit of 459 
projects is a representative sample of between 50,000 and 60,000 
projects.  According to Ms. Brigitte Nolet, a spokesperson for 
the ministry of human resources, the sample of just under 500 
projects represents about 60,000.  With that proportion, we still 
have about 4,800 that have been badly mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major problem.  We cannot just minimalize it as the 
Prime Minister does.  It is endemic.  It is systemic. It is a 
pattern of the government and deserves to be dealt with in this 
manner on this day and rebuked for the good of the Canadian 
taxpayer.

like to use might be unparliamentary, and I cannot use all the 
words that come to mind.  I hope the members opposite will 
understand that many of the words I would like to utter will 
remain unsaid out of respect for the Chair, who would judge 
these words to be unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use a very simple language. 
A billion is a long string of zeros with a one in front of them. 
It is a thousand million dollars that were squandered, handed 
out to friends and supporters, particularly those who contribute 
to the liberal election fund.

this country.  If we took $1 billion and divided it by 1.5

support.  But that was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, next year, it will be reported that once again the 
number of children living in poverty, and parents living in 
poverty of course, has grown.  I know that, in my riding of 
Matapédia—Matane, where unemployment is very high, from time to 
time someone makes a mistake and claims one week too many in 
benefits and there are penalties for doing so.  They come and 
get them and they are almost prepared to send them to jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the $1 billion that disappeared and went into the pockets 
of some rich people, I ask my colleague, whom I listened to 
intently, how he would qualify this scandal. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend is 
quite right.  Words fail, at least in this place, in terms of 
words that are allowable to use.  Without a doubt, in terms of 
just the scan of it so far and in the research that we have done, 
it shows that a disproportionate amount of those dollars have 
gone into Liberal-held ridings.  It would certainly bolster what 
has been said before in terms of being used, being levered for 
contributions to the Liberal Party and so on.  I think that is 
what outrages the public in the whole matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are now trying to minimize it by saying that it is 
just a few projects, when in fact this is a representative 
sampling of a far bigger piece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we do have a problem.  Frankly, the whole system needs to 
be changed or started from scratch again where we deal with 
handicapped people and provide the resources and so on there.  We 
need to get away from the kinds of things that are subject to 
political interference, patronage and the kind of pork-barrelling 
that has been used by the Liberal government over the course of a 
number of years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to give the hon. 
member an opportunity to respond to a couple of concerns.  He 
talked about the private sector being the economic engine that 
creates jobs.  There is a downturn to that as well.  For example, 
the Royal Bank in my area made $1.76 billion this year and 
announced a layoff of 340 new jobs.  Next year the bank plans to 
make $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the private sector does create jobs, but there has to be 
some sort of corporate responsibility when it comes to economic 
opportunities in the outstretches, or what I call the extremities 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that what we need in the country is moral 
leadership, people who will stand on principle.  My question is 
for the previous member who spoke, as well as for the member for 
Elk Island.  If the minister is to resign, should not the 
previous minister resign as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would again agree 
with my hon. colleague.  I do think this sends a signal with 
respect to the activities and competence of the previous minister 
as well.  It taints the record of when he was there. It was on 
his watch over a period of time when a significant part of the 
program began and then changed over to the Canada jobs fund.  He 
was able to skittishly get out of there just in time. Some might 
say that he was lucky or fortunate, but perhaps it was planned. I 
am not sure.  I think it also sends a signal in terms of the 
competence of the minister who was in that position previously.

Human Resources Development.  The minister announced a six point 
plan to deal with this particular situation with which I do not 
think anyone in the House is pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear though from the opposition terms like scandal, 
pork-barrelling and slush fund. 
We do not hear anything from the opposition about what we should 
be trying to do to fix the problem.  How can we constructively 
participate in making sure that this problem does not happen 
again?  But no, we would rather bandy about cheap terms that have 
little credence.  We know that it was not $1 billion missing, but 
we continue to hear the $1 billion figure.  Unfortunately, if we 
say something long enough we tend to believe it, which is 
certainly the case across the aisle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
privilege.  I urge my colleague to stick to the facts and to the 
facts only.  If five cents are diverted by this government, by this 
party, it is five cents too much. According to the figures, we 
are talking about an amount between $1 and $3 billion, not 
$300 million. Let us stick to the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I fail to see how this could be construed as 
a question of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is hard to stick to 
the facts when people over there are not listening.  I have 
indicated that there was not $1 billion missing.  I have 
indicated many times, both in the House and outside, that if 
there is $1 missing we should all be concerned about it. 
Clearly, on this side of the House, the minister is taking 
appropriate steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded very quickly to the call to attend the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development on Thursday. 
Normally, instead of 10 working days, we have the minister there 
on Thursday to answer questions, to put the facts on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues on the other side have already started to 
dismiss the role of the standing committee because they seem 
surprised that the minister, who wants transparency, openness and 
accountability, as everyone on this side of the House and I am 
sure on that side of the House would like to see, is willing to 
ensure that the questions which members might have—and I mean 
questions, not rhetoric—are put on the table.  There is no 
question that we have to have confidence in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the audit was released some colleagues on the other side 
of the House spoke about projects in their ridings as being 
worthy, visionary and all so important.  Now they cannot wait to 
say “scandal”.  They cannot wait to say “pork-barrelling”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where has this money gone?  It has gone to literacy programs. It 
has gone to job creation programs.  It has gone to programs which 
have benefited communities from one end of the country to the 
other.  Yet we hear these terms being bandied about, without any 
interest it seems in looking for real solutions to deal with the 
administrative problems which are clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than simply shrugging it off, we have designed a six 
point program.  It may not be exhaustive.  There may be other 
constructive suggestions which the committee will be able to 
present on Thursday to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has responded already by indicating that she will 
provide quarterly updates on the action plan.  It is important 
that every member of parliament be involved to ensure that the 
dollars my colleague across the way referred to will go to the 
people and the organizations which have applied, to ensure that 
there is accountability and to ensure that the proper paperwork 
has been done.  It is unacceptable in this day and age for moneys 
to be handed out without the proper documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit never suggested political interference.  The audit 
never at any point suggested that there was $1 billion missing. 
What it indicated was that there was very sloppy bookwork.  It is 
very clear that the six point program that is being implemented 
as we speak is designed to deal with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House one example of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the payments are made properly, the director will 
have to certify the particular project.  There will have to be a 
signed agreement.  There will have to be signing authority. 
Payments will be advanced only when the documentation is there, 
and I am speaking of documentation in terms of claims, expenses 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since many members wrote letters of support for projects in 
their communities, at some point we all believed there was value 
in the projects they were touting, whether they were literacy 
programs, job creation programs or whatever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the point is that we want to make sure there is 
confidence in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members opposite bandying about terms without any 
constructive or supportive comments as to how we might fix the 
problem together.  They would rather attack the minister, saying 
that she should resign.  The minister released the report, the 
action plan, and has made it the number one priority of her 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is prepared to accept business as usual, certainly not on 
this side of the House.  We want to ensure that we have a system 
which is strong and comprehensive.  We must ensure that the 
payments are made with every <I>i</I> dotted and every <I>t</I> 
crossed.  They must be carefully checked.  All of the files which 
are active are being reviewed by the department and will be 
reported on by the end of April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we not lose sight of the fact that these 
steps are being taken.  The auditor general has endorsed the 
action plan before us.  I would like to hear the comments of 
members opposite in regard to the action plan and the 25 
recommendations which were made in the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in the media and in the House about the projects 
that have been approved across the country, how they have 
benefited the various ridings.  Yes, the system has broken down, 
but we are fixing the system to make sure it never happens in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be folly to continue to use terms and figures which 
members clearly know are inappropriate.  I too am restricted in 
the terms that I might use in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, if we are improving the literacy skills 
of Canadians, if we are giving the people who have disabilities 
an opportunity to work, if we are giving them meaningful 
employment opportunities, as has been suggested by many members 
and organizations, we should not minimize the important role 
which HRDC plays in communities, and in many cases very visibly, 
from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term the minister is taking corrective measures to 
ensure that payments meet certain financial and program 
requirements, as well as checking for and correcting problem 
files.  In the longer term we will look at equipping our HRDC 
staff with the right tools.  It is important that they have the 
tools to do the job.  We want accountability, openness and 
transparency.  That is part of the action plan.  We want to have 
measurable and achievable results.  And we want to report back 
not only to the House, but to the public at large.

competition, it does not deal with the issue of pricing at the 
pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the farm crisis, there is not one member on this

crisis.  The minister has put forth dollars.  Maybe you should

publicly insisted that depleted uranium is essentially safe even 
though its own internal documents warn personnel to wear safety 
gear when handling this substance.

ministers must be accountable for their own departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of following through on its ethical obligations and 
instead of helping students who are suffering under record high

through his policies he helped shut down.  Is that ethical?

received information about a riding.  I have received information 
about the city of Calgary.  Yesterday somebody mentioned my own 
riding so I checked, because the programs had to be approved by 
the Government of Quebec, the Parti québécois.  Of the 17 
projects that were submitted, only five were approved before the 
election.  Twelve were approved after the election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  So that was okay then.  That 
proves that we did not use it.  Of the five that were approved 
before the election, if they were to help me to get elected it is 
probably because Lucien Bouchard wanted me to remain Prime 
Minister of Canada.

asked them to look into the files of my riding because I was

for money from the department.  Very often we agreed when they 
had a good case.  That is why this program exists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is

that the HRDC minister has the information.  I think she gets it 
on a need to know basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to that information.  If the Prime

We have the right to do that.  This is public information and she

the results of that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I insisted on a strong management response that includes a six 
point plan that has been reviewed with the auditor general, who 
himself says “In our opinion the proposed approach represents a 
thorough plan for corrective action to address the immediate 
control problems that were identified”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work with the auditor general to implement this plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, while the Prime Minister engages in the age old 
tactic of accuse the accuser, aided by the co-driver of the 
getaway car, the government House leader, Canadians are waiting 
for answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missing is some semblance of accountability.  We know 
that money went missing.  We know that money went from government 
coffers to Liberal backers, who turned around and made 
significant contributions to the government.  How can the public 
have faith in this system that is so politically tainted and 
advantageous to the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister call for a full, independent financial audit 
of her department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I said that this is an audit by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said yesterday that previously the auditor general could 
report only once a year.  Now he can report four times a year. We 
want all of these cases to be known as quickly as possible so 
that we can remedy the situation as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the public money to be well administered and all moneys 
disbursed to the programs they were intended to serve.  That is 
exactly what we are doing and what we will keep doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
another day, another example of how rotten to the core this 
government has become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest rip-off is that the government sent $200,000 to a 
water bottling company in the Indian affairs minister's riding. 
Today that company is bankrupt and the money is all gone.

appalling pattern of mismanagement and misuse of funds, many just 
prior to the 1997 election.  The human resources minister ignored 
that audit.  The minister was so irresponsible and so needy of 
attention that she handed her own riding three-quarters of a 
million dollars in grants as late as November, in spite of the 
fact that her riding does not qualify.

made.  Clearly there is complete disagreement here, a 180 degree 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the sense that the Prime Minister used that prop or that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on the same point of order as the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Centre.  I think it is important in the House, if we are to have 
genuine debate and questions and answers, if we are seeking 
information and asking questions of the government, that there be 
some modicum of respect for truth in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a question is asked about a particular fund, in this case 
the transitional jobs fund, then the government, if it is going 
to make claims about what goes to certain ridings and what does 
not go to other ridings, needs to stick to what the question 
asked is about.  In this case it is the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has evidence as it claims that there were 
transitional jobs fund money, not other money but transitional 
jobs fund money which is what the question was about, going into 
the riding of Winnipeg Centre, then I invite the government to 
table it now because it cannot.

rising in support of the member for Winnipeg Centre on a couple 
of points.  As we know Beauchesne's citation 495 requires that 
documents quoted from in the House should be tabled in the House. 
That is one with which we are familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also turn to Erskine May at page 63 which talk specifically 
about ministerial accountability in the House.  This is a 
relatively recent ruling adopted by members of the House in 1996. 
To read briefly from it, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the following principles 
should govern the conduct of ministers of the Crown in relation 
to Parliament: ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, 
and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions 
of their departments and Next Steps Agencies; it is of paramount 
importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information 
to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent errors at the earliest 
opportunity.  Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be 
expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister; 
ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing 
to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the 
public interest— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last couple of days we have seen a spectacle of the 
House leader and others on the government side providing 
information on a regular basis to the Prime Minister and other 
ministers and then refusing to table that same binder, that same 
information which they have collected from across the country. It 
is in the public interest.  It is not in the public interest to 
withhold that information.  It is in the interest of all 
Canadians to see that information.

across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a spectacle where the government is using information 
garnered from the department, using departmental resources and 
using ministerial gag orders saying that the information is not 
to be shared with anyone else.  A video has been sent out to all 
HRD offices explaining how to answer requests for information and 
how to stymie the process to make sure that information does not 
get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have?  We have a government using departmental 
resources to keep information away from members of parliament and 
from the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's request to table the document, which is a 
reasonable one, should be extended to the entire packet of 
information the government has on each and every member of 
parliament in this place which it is using selectively and to 
provide information that is not truthful, and which Erskine May 
says is a contempt of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should table not only the documents that were quoted from 
today and this week in the House of Commons, but I would ask you, 
Mr. Speaker, to ask the government House leader to do the 
honourable thing and look after ministerial accountability and 
responsibility.  He should do what Erskine May and the House of 
Commons collectively decided in 1996, and that is not withhold 
information that is in the public interest.  This information is 
in the public interest and should be tabled in the House of 
Commons.

Mr. Speaker, I know hon. members are very upset by this matter, 
but I would attach myself very much to the remarks of the 
previous speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is not only an officer of his 
government.  He is also an officer of the House.  I respectfully 
request that the House leader is very familiar with House 
procedure and with the previous precedents quoted by the 
opposition House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is duty bound, I would suggest, to table these documents, not 
only the documents that were handed quickly as back-up to the 
Prime Minister throughout question period over the last number of 
days but, as has been previously stated, all documents being used 
to fortify and deflect attention away from this issue.  Those 
documents should be before the House and accessible to the 
opposition and therefore accessible to the Canadian public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to corroborate to some extent what the two 
previous speakers have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in this House 16 years, and it is customary when 
quoting a document for the Prime Minister or the minister 
concerned to table the document, in order to be able to use it 
subsequently in answering questions or to use extracts from it 
in answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister or minister quotes from documents or 
reads excerpts from them, however, they are required to table 
the entire document so that each member of the House may have 
the same use, view of, and ease of access to the documents in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no document or file had ever been quoted to the members, he 
could say “Go and get the documents you want under the Access to 
Information Act”, but this particular document is pertinent to 
the debate and to the events as they are unfolding.  All of the 
files must therefore be tabled, and parts of the document must 
not be quoted during question period only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally legitimate for each member to demand this right.

rise on the same point of order.  I also asked a question in the 
House today and was amazed to hear that $37 million had gone into 
my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way for me to verify that information.  It is not 
clear whether it was the transitional jobs fund or other 
programs.  It is patently unfair for this information to be at 
the beck and call of government members and not to be disclosed 
to all members of the House.  It is unparliamentary and 
undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about public expenditures and if that information 
is being used by the government in debate, in question period, 
and there is no way for members to be able to verify that 
information or how to respond to it, it is very unfair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

number of points that were raised today.  I do not agree with too 
many of them and I intend to share with you why I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver East alleges that because answers were 
provided to her the government should automatically supply 
written material to support an answer.  We could equally claim 
that the government should have supporting material for some of 
these unsubstantiated allegations from some of the members 
across.  That would probably be far more constructive in terms of 
the good governance of the country with one difference which is 
that the numbers we have used I maintain are correct to the best 
of our knowledge. I would say that is hardly the case with some 
of the questions being asked. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Richelieu raised the point that, when a minister 
cites a document, he should not only table the document cited, 
but all of the documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw your attention to citation 495(4) of Beauchesne's, which 
reads as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the document cited need be tabled by a Minister.  A complete 
file need not be tabled— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is citation 495(4). 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Cite what the Prime Minister was 
referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  I am glad the House leader for the NDP 
is interjecting.  It permits me to refer to citation 495(3) of 
Beauchesne's which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public document referred to but not cited or quoted by a 
Minister need not be tabled. <I>Journals</I>, November 16, 1971,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  What are you hiding, Don? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Table it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in terms of the document 
that I have before me, I have my ministerial briefing book 
prepared by my staff.  This is my own personal briefing book. 
Ministers historically have had these to assist them in preparing 
constructive answers to the questions that are asked of them from 
time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Otherwise known as the book of lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Some things I do hear, some things I 
do not.  I would ask the hon. member who is a veteran 
parliamentarian to please cease and desist from words such as 
that.  I call on hon. members to listen to the explanations that 
are being made and then I will make up my own mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will ignore that for the 
time being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition House leader also requested that a minister table 
his briefing book.  He further alleges that my briefing book was 
prepared by officials of a government department.  That is 
factually incorrect. I would like him to substantiate that 
accusation if he has any way of providing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the opposition House leader, I offered yesterday to 
table the letters that were quoted yesterday.  I asked him across 
the floor of the House by way of interjection to ask me to table 
the letters because I had annotated them and offered to table 
them.  It is interesting to note that he did not seem to think 
that it was a good idea to have his own quotes tabled with those 
of his colleagues in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough would like me to 
table documents which were not referred to in the House.  I would 
love to table the letter that he sent to the department asking 
for funding for MacPherson's Trailer Services and the one for the 
brewery in his constituency. I will drink to that. There is the 
one he sent for the Dunrite Blasting company, the one for 
Trans-Atlantic Transport, the one that he sent for Scotia Aqua 
Farms, the one that he sent for the amusement park, the hair 
studio, Caren's Shear Magic Hair Design, and the one for Fitness 
Xpress, but Mr. Speaker, I did not quote from those documents. 
The rules do not permit me to table in the House of Commons these 
documents that the hon. member sent, so obviously I do not intend 
to do so.

internal documents, I will gladly table.  For instance, I am 
prepared to table the householder of the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche which made all sorts of very praising 
remarks about the human resources department.  I will gladly 
table that particular document because it was actually quoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a member from Winnipeg asked about the amount that 
human resources development contributed to his constituency.  I 
believe that he asked specifically about the transitional jobs 
fund.  The Prime Minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I will hear this and then I 
will hear your point of order.  The hon. government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The Prime Minister in his response 
answered that the total human resources development money given 
to the constituency represented by the hon. member, which I 
believe to be Winnipeg Centre, that information is correct, was 
in the amount of $139,469,824. That is the riding in all of 
Canada that has received the most human resources development 
money for the combined years of 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 at 
least to date. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As a general rule, when we 
have a public document that was quoted from and cited, yes, we do 
have it tabled in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat citation 495 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3)  A public document referred to but not cited or quoted by a 
minister need not be tabled. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from a decision in 1971. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4)  Only the document cited need be tabled by a minister.  A 
complete file need not be tabled because one document in it has 
been cited. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if something was quoted from in the House and it is 
cited, then that document would be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a question of do ministers have the right 
to have materials in the House that they refer to to give answers 
in the House.  I would judge that if all of the briefing notes 
which were prepared for the ministers had to be tabled, then I 
think that that would perhaps put the minister at somewhat of a 
disadvantage and that all of the information that he uses would 
be cited in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review the blues, and if the blues do state a specific 
document was cited and where it was cited, then I will come back 
to the House if it is necessary.  But I will not order that notes 
that are made either in the House or before they come in the 
House as briefing notes be released to the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other point brought up about accountability of the 
ministers, I am sure that if the hon. member looks through all of 
that and if what the hon. member is claiming is that not that 
there is a matter of opinion on both sides but that there 
was—now this is my word, the hon. member did not use it—but 
that in fact there was a deliberate lie, then we are dealing with 
something else altogether.  The minister of course is appointed 
by the Prime Minister.  If the minister feels for whatever reason 
that he or she should be resigning for whatever reasons he or she 
has, then that would be his or her decision.  Conversely I think 
that the Prime Minister would have all of the authority that a 
leader of a party has to dismiss or change the ministers as they 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On both counts, one the releasing of the information, I would 
rule that yes, if it is in a public document cited—and I commit 
to reviewing the blues to see if indeed there was a document 
cited in there—and two on the accountability of ministers, I 
would rule on both cases that the point of order is not granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point of order is over.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B> My

moneys that had flowed into my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West is referring to material that he 
has access to out of the HRDC department or from the hon. House 
leader of the Liberal government which I as a member do not have

to send our fellow citizens householders four times a year. 
This is a recognized privilege in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out for your consideration the fact that, when 
the government leader, with a lack of fair play and something 
nearing unparliamentary practice, hijacks this mailing in order 
to change the meaning we have given it as opposition parties, we 
are put at a disadvantage in relation to all the information the 
government has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close simply by respectfully submitting that, if the 
government leader can rise in the House and use our 
parliamentary mailings for devious purposes, we as opposition 
parties must have the same information as they do to on the 
subsidies awarded in our respective ridings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member.  If he is referring 
simply to the householders we send out to our constituents, as 
the member pointed out, four times a year, we all have an 
opportunity to read them, as they are in the public domain.  If 
we want to use them in debates here, that is acceptable and it 
has always been so.  >The hon. member may do so if he wishes, as 
the other member did today.

I rise on a point of order.  The member for Selkirk—Interlake 
referred to my speech this morning and suggested that somehow I

</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted from documentation that was not provided by the

it, the documents referred to by the Prime Minister both 
yesterday and today in the House are what is being sought, and

</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK262">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this debate is on a tripartite motion by the Leader of 
the Opposition.  The first element goes to internal management of 
the Human Resources Development department.  The second relates 
to ministerial responsibility as a constitutional principle.  The 
third relates to the particular minister actually holding the 
office of minister.  The last two questions are related a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be worth noting that the present minister was Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development until as late as 
August 1999.  I had the opportunity of negotiating at great 
length with her on native land claims in British Columbia as late 
as August.  Most of the matters under discussion occurred or had 
their origins and were completed well before she entered into 
office.  The issue of ministerial responsibility in the 
particular case thus has a certain artificial quality to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the general issue of ministerial responsibility, we might say 
with some disappointment that the debate in the House has not 
been very edifying or very useful.  It is a principle that 
developed in the early 17th century constitutional struggles in 
Great Britain.  At that time there was a clear constitutional 
dichotomy between prerogative power and legislative power, and 
most of the principles were developed in that context.  They 
apply with difficulty to a situation of fused governmental power. 
The parliamentary executive was developed in the 19th century and 
continued to the present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, what one might call the modern concept of ministerial 
responsibility relates to the period of constitutional 
laissez-faire and limited government and probably has little 
practical relationship to the sort of problems we face today in a 
period of big government with very large spending power on the 
part of the government and very large departments of which we 
have two or three within the present post-war Canadian 
governmental system.  In a certain way it surpasses the 
capacities of ministers to administer without considerably more 
sophistication in the administrative processes and structures 
available to them. 
It is perhaps a little disappointing therefore that so little has 
been said in follow up to the principle of ministerial 
responsibility and what it means in terms of concrete changes and 
modernization of governmental structures and processes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted with interest the present minister's immediate responses 
to the situations that have been discussed in the House in the 
last two days: the internal changes which are being made without 
constitutional amendment and intensified staff training on 
administration.  They involved the introduction of the principle 
of accountability of managers for the results of their programs; 
disciplinary action if gross mismanagement or fraudulent 
activities are revealed; the creation of a new audit group; the 
review of all active files by April 30, 2000; and ensuring files 
are complete before the contract is signed and that all requests 
for payment are accompanied by a check list containing necessary 
financial information.  These are good steps and we welcome their 
introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should ask members of the House, both government and 
opposition but I think with particular reference to opposition 
members, what exactly they did or saw as their function as 
members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. 
These are all-party committees.  The agenda is subject to 
consensus formation.  The opportunity to ask for files and to 
review them is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that there seems to have been an absence 
of information on the part of members when specific issues have 
been raised of grants made to their constituencies. They do not 
seem to have been aware of that fact, and one wonders why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility of a member of parliament or a member of a 
committee is to keep oneself appraised of the details of 
administration.  It is always within the power of a committee to 
demand production of files or to demand the appearance of 
officials.  With certain of the committees of parliament this is 
a fact of life.  Some of them have been quite robust committees 
and quite rambunctious in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with particular interest the surprise of the member for 
Vancouver East, a very much respected individual, that a total of 
$37 million in grants went to Vancouver East.  As a resident of 
Vancouver I cannot think of a better area of the city to receive 
$37 million.  I might even wonder whether that is enough.  But, 
again, are members of parliament not utilizing to the full their 
role as members of committees or their role of individual 
members?  In other words it is a case, as Bentham said, of judge 
and company, in this case government and members of parliament. 
There is more than one party involved in this whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every file that comes to my office, infrastructure, millennium 
grants and the like, is scrutinized closely.  I have a 
subcommittee within my parliamentary offices and we go through 
them in great detail.  We rank the applications hierarchically 
and I think it has been one of the factors in enabling us to 
present cases to ministers and to others for grants.  I think 
that is part of the responsibility of a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago I gave evidence to the McRuer commission set up by the 
Government of Ontario.  James McRuer was a great chief justice of 
Ontario and was concerned with complaints of administration of 
grants and other programs within the Government of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice McRuer asked me to appear as a witness and to 
present evidence on this issue.  Is there a crisis in government? 
Does it affect individual rights?  Could we have advice on 
structures and processes of government?  I repeat these simply 
because I think they are germane to the problem of the growth of 
big government in Canada, the phenomenon of certainly the last 25 
years, the big spending governments, when we have accepted social 
responsibility for the welfare of citizens in health care, 
education and related matters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the McRuer commission was set up there were a series 
of debates in universities and elsewhere.  Professor Hayek of 
<I>Road to Serfdom</I> was predicting the end of democratic 
government because administration was becoming so complex. 
Professor George Keeton, who was a top English jurist at the 
time, wrote a book, the <I>Passing of Parliament</I>.  Parliament 
was disappearing simply because of the strains on executive 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious conclusion was that the post-modern British derived 
system of the parliamentary executive was not responding as well 
to these problems as other systems that have the separation of 
powers like the United States and other countries have, and to a 
certain extent like Great Britain had in the early 17th century 
when the great constitutional struggles on ministerial 
responsibility emerged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States set up a commission under ex-president Herbert 
Hoover, the Hoover Commission on Government.  It recommended 
substantial reforms within the United States system, which I 
brought to the notice of the McRuer commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a certain sense the pro-active concern of the Canadian 
parliament under all governments in the last 40 years with the 
Quebec issue at the expense of other and larger constitutional 
administrative law reform issues has hurt us in taking effective 
action in advance of problem situations, situations such as we 
face today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations made to the McRuer commission was the 
establishment of a uniform administrative procedure code applying 
to all government departments.  A second was for a specialized 
Conseil d'Etat administrative tribunal having jurisdiction over 
all governmental operations.  A third was personal liability of 
civil servants and others for misconduct, including gross 
negligence in the administration of their operations, personal 
liability, civil law damages and the like if that is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister proposes recovery of misspent funds.  It is 
a step in that direction.  I recommend to the House, if we can 
carry this debate constructively further and if all parties would 
agree, that a priority should be a general overall structural 
review of administrative processes in government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my hon. colleague from 
Surrey Central.  It is a pleasure to speak to the situation if 
for no other reason than it brings to light an endemic and 
systemic problem within the government that has been occurring on 
the government's watch since it was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is nothing that began overnight.  It did not begin with the 
audit for which the member for Calgary—Nose Hill had been 
pushing for a long time.  It did not bespeak the 459 programs 
that have been brought to the floor of the House, showing a 
miserable lack of accounting.  It bespeaks a problem that is 
running through many departments.  I will begin with the HRD and 
will go to a few others after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What actually took place here?  Some 459 plus projects were 
looked at randomly in the audit that was done as a direct result 
of Reform Party insistence and pushing for a very long period of 
time.  Of those programs, 15% did not have an application on 
file.  Of the remaining applications, the following elements were 
missing: 72% had no cash flow forecasts; 46% had no estimate of 
the number of people participating; 25% had no description of the 
activities that were being supported; 25% had no apt description 
of the participants; 11% had no budget; 11% had no description of 
expected results; and 97% of the files showed no evidence that 
anyone had been checked to see whether they owed money to HRD, a 
requirement to determine whether or not the program fits the 
bill.  Eight out of ten files reviewed did not show any evidence 
of any financial monitoring on the part of HRD, and 87% of the 
project files showed no evidence of supervision.  I could go on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response from the Prime Minister is that in this small 
cross-section are all the problems we have.  That is absolute 
nonsense.  To think that this random cross-section, which shows 
such endemic mismanagement, represents the only problems faced by 
HRDC is, at best, short-sighted and, at worst, refers to things 
that we cannot mention in this place because they would be in the 
realm of unparliamentary language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it actually bespeak?  It bespeaks mismanagement and a 
lack of respect.  It is a lack of respect for the taxpayers of 
Canada who break their backs to pay money to this institution, 
which should spend it in a responsible manner.  It is a lack of 
respect for all Canadians and it is a lack of respect for the 
money the government receives.  It is looked at as the 
government's money, and the government demonstrates that time and 
time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the government's money.  It belongs to some poor sod 
who is paying taxes on the $19,000 a year which he earns.  It is 
his money.  It is the money of 30 million Canadians.  It is not 
the Liberals' money.  It is not the Reform Party's money.  It is 
the people's money.  It is up to the government to manage it 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has prized itself, falsely as we can now prove, 
on being a good manager of the public purse.  We have shown that 
not only is it an appalling manager, but when faced with 
irrefutable facts of its mismanagement, it obfuscates, it puts 
the issue under the carpet and pretends there is no problem. 
That is not only an insult to this institution; worse, it is an 
insult to all the taxpayers who pay money to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West stood this morning to go on a 
pathetic tirade over issues that are completely irrelevant to 
what is taking place.  The member stood and said that the Reform 
Party is against job creation, that it is against developing 
programs for places with high unemployment rates, particularly in 
certain sectors of Canada and in aboriginal communities.  That 
money is meant for this purpose.  We do not dispute that at all. 
We want to make sure that these places have higher rates of 
employment.  However, every member of the opposition wants the 
money to be spent in a responsible way.  We do not want the money 
to be used as a tool for pork-barrelling.  We do not want it to 
be used cynically as a means to gain power.  But that is exactly 
what has been taking place for far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This did not happen overnight.  For over 10 years the auditor 
general has been saying that HRDC has had a great deal of 
difficulty keeping its finances on track.  In previous reports it 
has been stated that HRDC has been unable to monitor what was 
going on to ensure the money was being spent wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question which I pose to the government is:  Why did it take 
until the year 2000 for the government to admit, in a backhanded 
way, that it has a problem?  It does not have a little problem; 
it has a massive problem.  It is a chronic problem that is faced 
not only by the programs within HRDC but by a lot of other 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked on reserves and I have seen some of the most 
impoverished people of the land.  The money which is targeted to 
help those people, to deal with the rampant unemployment amongst 
them, to give them the skills which they need, does not get to 
them.  We can go to many reserves and see people living at levels 
of poverty which are akin to what we would see in third world 
countries.  Children lie on concrete slabs in the middle of 
winter. 
Multiple families live in houses that are boarded up, without 
central heating and with soiled mattresses on the living room 
floor.  There are drunk people all over the place and children 
who have infections all over their bodies.  We probably would not 
see this situation outside these communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is earmarked to help these people, but for years they have 
not received that money.  That is in part why there is 
deplorable, abject poverty in those communities.  It is not 
because the money is not there.  There were billions of dollars 
involved in the minister's previous portfolio.  She knew full 
well what was going on.  The member for Skeena brought it up time 
and time again, as did the member for Wild Rose, the leader of 
this party and other members of the opposition.  Money is being 
spent by the department of Indian affairs, but that money is not 
getting to the people.  The auditor general has brought that up 
time and time again, but the government puts its blinkers on and 
says it does not have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the tip of an iceberg that is very large.  The 
honourable thing to do, beyond the minister resigning, would be 
for the government to finally come clean with the Canadian public 
and say that it will do an audit or it will listen to the auditor 
general and others and fix the problem.  If the government does 
not fix the problem and make sure that taxpayer money is used as 
it was designed to be used, to help those who cannot help 
themselves, then it should leave because it is not doing its job. 
If the government professes to be the manager of the public 
purse, then it should do the honourable thing.  Those responsible 
should either resign or fix the problem, together with opposition 
members.  All members have people in their ridings who are 
suffering and the problem needs to be fixed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things, such as western economic diversification 
and ACOA.  The people at CIDA just found $850 million.  The 
member for Surrey Central will speak later about the $850 million 
of CIDA money that was given with no or minimal accountability to 
Canadian companies.  That money was designed to help the poorest 
of the poor.  It has gone into the pockets of companies making 
millions of dollars.  Why should the Canadian International 
Development Agency be giving money, with no accountability, to 
private companies to spend onshore?  That is not what taxpayer 
money is for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should do the honourable thing.  The minister 
should quit, the government should fix the problems right away 
and come clean in all of the other ministries to ensure that 
taxpayer money is spent wisely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the comments of my hon. 
friend and I found them to be both thorough and thoughtful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party has always believed in giving a helping 
hand to people in any region of Canada when they need it.  On the 
surface of things the transitional jobs fund was supposed to 
serve exactly that purpose.  It was supposed to help people in 
regions of high unemployment, higher than 12%.  We in the NDP 
support that initiative and we always have supported that kind of 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar did not 
qualify for this job creation program because, thankfully, our 
unemployment rate is far below 12%.  There are very few areas in 
Saskatchewan which qualified for this program because our rate of 
unemployment is considerably lower than the threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that people in my constituency and throughout 
Saskatchewan would support a program that would move resources to 
regions of the country where there is high unemployment.  Where 
there is high unemployment there is always resulting poverty. 
That was what the program was intended to do, if it had been 
administered cleanly, but this program was not administered 
cleanly.  This program became a vehicle for Liberal 
pork-barrelling and political interference.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Prime Minister's riding alone received grants of 
over $7 million, 17 of them.  We know that the human resources 
development minister's riding also benefited liberally, even 
though her riding, like mine, did not officially qualify.  There 
is real evidence that there was political interference to the 
benefit of Liberal ministers.  My friend mentioned the word 
“cynical”.  I find this a cynical and disgusting attack on the 
unemployed and the poor.  This Liberal slush fund is a shame and 
a scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend mentioned, government ministers must take 
responsibility for their actions, and I agree with him that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development must resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can my hon. friend comment on the effects of this kind of 
pork-barrelling and the other examples he mentioned, like CIDA? 
That is an example which is of much interest to me.  Can he 
comment on what effects this kind of pork-barrelling and cynicism 
have in the long run on the electorate and on the body politic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
from the NDP for his excellent question.  There is a great deal 
of apathy and cynicism among the public today.  We can see on the 
basis of what has been brought to the floor of the House with the 
HRDC scandal that it is to some extent, unfortunately, justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, within the context of the problem we have today there 
is hope, hope that we as members of the opposition, and I hope 
hon. members of the government, can fix the problem.  If we fix 
the problem, then perhaps we can start to rebuild the trust that 
elected officials should have with members of the public, trust 
that this institution and parliament should have but do not with 
the public.  We need to mend those bridges by doing the right 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned his riding.  There are farmers.  There is 
the aboriginal issue.  There is ACOA.  There is the western 
economic diversification fund, and on and on it goes where moneys 
are used by the government of the day to pay off friends and to 
win support for the next election.  It has little or nothing to 
do with helping the poorest of the poor or those people in need 
of jobs.  If it were, then we would all be in agreement, and the 
ministers on the other side know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Give me a case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  The member says “Give me a case”.  He 
need not look any further than the audits of CIDA.  The member 
need not look any further than the audits of HRDC and where the 
money has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to stand here and slam; we want to fix the 
problem.  The government should do the same thing, as soon as 
possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
after the thorough, thoughtful and to the point speech by my hon. 
colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, I rise on behalf of the 
people of Surrey Central to speak on the Reform Party's supply 
day motion expressing our deep concern and the outrage of many 
Canadians over the gross mismanagement of grants and 
contributions by the Department of Human Resources Development 
totalling more than $1 billion annually, which is not a typo but 
$1 billion annually, and our lack of confidence in the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House will take this opportunity to let 
Canadians know that we endorse the doctrine of ministerial 
responsibility, something that is sorely lacking under the 
current Liberal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the second day of the sitting of the House in the new 
year.  On New Year's Eve, which I spent with my constituents in 
Cloverdale, everyone was excited as we moved from the past 
millennium to this millennium.  I looked through the eyes of my 
constituents, and all Canadians, to their dreams.  Canadians were 
dreaming of the government of the day building a strong and wide 
bridge over which all Canadians would cross from the previous 
millennium to this millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new millennium their dreams are that their taxes will be 
reduced, that jobs will be created, that there will be no brain 
drain.  We are hoping that the government will return the 
billions it has cut from health care and education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are dreaming of pension reform, policies that strengthen 
families and family values that are respected.  Their are 
dreaming of a criminal justice system that will serve the needs 
of the victims not the criminals.  They are dreaming of a 
federation that will be based on equality and democratic 
principles that will be followed in federal institutions.  They 
want accountability in government and they we want the government 
to listen to the people.  These are their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weak Liberal government has no political will and no 
vision.  Rather than fulfilling those dreams, we have 
unfortunately come back to the House in the new millennium 
confronted with the biggest boondoggle yet.  This billion dollar 
boondoggle shows us that maybe every federal department is being 
mismanaged.  It seems to be a systemic problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With only 1% of the grant moneys spent by HRDC being examined, 
we have discovered a great deal of mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat the facts, percentages and figures reported in 
the audit because my colleagues have already highlighted them. I 
will give some examples to the House to show the kinds of cases 
we are talking about.  In one case, a sponsor submitted a $60,000 
proposal but received $150,000.  After verification, the sponsor 
indicated that only $30,061 should have been claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another case, out of the $50,547 in verified claims for one 
file, more than half of that money was the salary of two persons 
during the first three weeks of the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example shows that a firm was paid $150,000 out of which 
$30,000 was used for overhead expenses with no accompanying 
explanation.  There was no business plan, just two pages of 
description; no feasibility study and no rationale on the file 
for recommending it.  The project's length was extended and the 
grant increased to $420,000 with no clear explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples.  In the Prime Minister's own 
riding, where most of the money went, the job creation rate was 
negative.  Bankruptcies were filed after receiving the grant 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of businesses disproportionately located in the 
hometowns of Liberal cabinet ministers received government grants 
without anyone checking where the money went.  In some cases, out 
of those 459 examined, the grateful recipients did not even fill 
out any application forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem does not stop there.  The worst is yet to come. This 
is only the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transitional jobs fund name was changed to Canadian jobs 
fund.  I suggest to my Liberal friends that they should change 
the name again to the Liberal slush fund and amalgamate all the 
slush funds from other organizations so that they can pork-barrel 
and use this slush fund for buying votes as they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998, I questioned the minister responsible for CIDA on 
the lack of accountability in spending of CIDA's industrial 
co-operation program called CIDA Inc.  Out of that $815 million, 
half of that money was spent in Quebec.  This taxpayer money was 
given out without follow-up processes to monitor how the money 
was spent.  The question is not where the money was spent but how 
the money was given out.  Canadians do not get money for 
feasibility studies from the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit commissioned by CIDA Inc. concluded that the benefits 
were overestimated and that information on projects and companies 
were incomplete and inaccurate.  The minister could not account 
for CIDA Inc. funds to the tune of almost one billion dollars. 
The audit also identified other serious problems, including the 
fact that 33% of the money was allocated to just 7% of companies 
that applied.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's office prodded CIDA to conduct a follow-up 
audit last year and the depressing results were quietly released 
just before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 version of the audit showed that the problems at CIDA 
Inc. were not only continuing but in many cases had become worse. 
In more than 33% of the cases, money was paid out even though 
mandatory reports were not filed at all.  No reports were filed 
on 10% of the projects and 33% of the money went to only 4.4% of 
the companies that applied.  This was worse than the 1997 audit 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of proper accounting at both CIDA Inc. and HRDC, and 
many other government departments, like Western Economic 
Diversification or ACOA, is part of a much larger problem of 
billions of dollars being spent each year on grants and 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are charges of political interference from the top down, 
interference from government cabinet ministers, including the 
Prime Minister.  Incidentally, the former minister of CIDA was 
also the former minister of HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one has assumed responsibility for these boondoggles even 
though they are backed up by the audit and the cases number in 
the dozens.  The amounts involved are huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of the civil service has refused to take responsibility 
for his bureaucrats.  In turn, the human resources minister has 
refused to take responsibility for him.  The Prime Minister, in 
turn, has refused to take responsibility for her.  The former 
minister of HRDC has blatantly refused to assume the 
responsibility.  Why can they not take responsibility rather than 
cover up and engage in damage control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear that the government has issued gag orders to 
government officials so that they cannot share the information 
with opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a private member's bill in the House, which I will be 
introducing soon, concerning whistle blower legislation.  If that 
was in place these problems would probably have been prevented 
because the government's weaknesses, the corruption and 
mismanagement of those funds, would have surfaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions that remain unanswered.  Canadians want 
to know if the Liberals will admit that these grants are 
political slush funds to buy voters with their own money.  They 
also want to know if the previous HRD minister will admit that he 
knew about the missing money and, if he did, why he did nothing 
about it when he was in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other questions.  Will the Prime Minister take 
any action?  He has always campaigned that he would show 
responsibility in government.

picked out, the auditors came from Montreal.  They went through 
the college's books and said that everything was fine, but that 
it could only claim 50% of the GST not 100%.  So Fanshawe College 
had to give back $200 in GST.  That is one of the 37 examples 
that those people across the floor keeps saying is mismanaged 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Summer jobs for students is vitally important in my riding.  The 
jobs that Fanshawe College has provided, and the jobs that the 
department and the minister have provided in terms of more money 
going toward summer student employment, has helped my riding and 
the young people living there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hearing that fact, does the hon. member not agree that without 
knowing all the facts on these cases the motion put forward by 
his party is a little off base? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to answer 
this question because it shows the ignorance and arrogance on the 
government bench.  It shows that the Liberal government has no 
vision and is so weak that it cannot see what is happening on the 
national scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to go a bank and withdraw money without 
signing a withdrawal slip.  Can he get money from the bank?  Can 
the cashier give him any cash without him signing the withdrawal 
slip?  How can the government withdraw the taxpayers' money? 
This money belongs to the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to be accountable for this money, every 
dollar and cent.  How can millions of dollars be given to Liberal 
friends or to some other business without having a paper trail or 
any application on file? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is very much needed because it will demand 
accountability from the government.  We will demand the 
resignation of the minister who first tried to cover-up the 
issue, who then misled the House, who then denied all 
responsibility and who then went into a damage control mode.  It 
is shameful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, my concern 
is in the real disparity in accountability.  It is clear that 
there was no accountability with this program.  I have to say 
that I do support the transitional jobs fund.  It has been 
important in the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was accountability in other programs, such as the young 
entrepreneurs program where everything was filled out in 
triplicate.  It did an incredible job.  However, its funding was 
cut by two-thirds without any warning after the agreement had 
been signed.  This volunteer group was left high and dry and 
scrambling to find money to cover the unexplainable cut in its 
funding, which was never to be returned.  This was a volunteer 
group that was unbelievably scrutinized.  It had to present 
everything in triplicate.  It was accountable.  What bothers me 
is that there is not the same kind of accountability on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, maybe there was no 
vote bank for the Liberals.  They have been telling voters to 
vote and support them and they will reward them.  There were no 
rewards given because there were no votes for the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these programs are working as slush funds.  Maybe there 
was no way of buying votes in that riding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this 
opposition day motion because it gives me a chance to clarify the 
areas in my department that do need strengthening.  It also gives 
me a chance to explain to the members in the House and to 
Canadians the things that we are doing at Human Resources 
Development Canada to set things right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first to acknowledge that the internal audit that we 
received identified deficiencies in the administration of our 
grants and contributions programs.  The grants and contributions 
we are talking about are moneys that go to Canadians with 
disabilities to help them to obtain the skills they need to get 
and hold a job.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is money that goes to young Canadians for summer jobs, for 
internships so they can get that very important experience that 
they need to continue over the course of their lives to 
participate in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is money that goes to Canadians who want to learn to read, to 
our literacy grants and contributions; Canadians who are not at 
the rate and the level of literacy so they can participate fully 
in society and the economy and get an opportunity to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is money that goes to Canadians who have not been able to 
find work through targeted wage subsidies, through 
self-employment assistance and to their communities where there 
may not be a diversified economy to help build new opportunities 
and jobs for men and women who want and need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of programs we are talking about.  I can 
tell the House that when I got the results, I was concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my point of view the right thing to do was to make it 
public, to tell Canadians that we have a challenge in the 
department but we are prepared to fix it.  From my point of view, 
Canadians can have greater faith in a department that is prepared 
to identify its problems and commit itself to improve them, to 
fix them, than in a department that sweeps them under the carpet 
and does not pay attention.  For me, that is what government 
should be about, to be able to continuously improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians appreciate and understand that times change, people 
change, circumstances and technology change.  We have to keep up. 
But we have to be able to recognize where the challenges exist 
and then have the capability and the force to make those 
improvements.  That is what this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually looked at the audit and what it said and did not say 
and there are some points I want to make.  First and foremost the 
audit did not say that $1 billion disappeared.  We know where the 
cheques have been sent.  They have been sent to educational 
institutions, to community organizations, not for profit 
organizations, to small and medium size businesses and to 
individuals in the ridings of every single member of parliament 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit did not measure the results of these programs.  We do 
that every year in our performance analyses which are part of the 
estimates that are presented to this House and debated in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit did not talk about political interference. How could 
it?  As I said, these programs, these grants and contributions, 
are found in the ridings of members from the New Democratic 
Party, the Reform Party, the Bloc, the Conservatives and indeed 
here among Liberal members of parliament.  But they are there to 
help communities and individuals in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put my focus on what the audit did say. The audit looked at 
how we administer these very important projects.  It looked at 
whether there were applications on file.  It looked at whether 
the rationale for a project was included in the file.  It looked 
to see if we were monitoring the receipts that we got from groups 
and organizations and individuals that identified and itemized 
the ways in which they spent the money that had been forwarded to 
them. These are important things because they are the foundation 
of the programs that we are managing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit said that we can do a significantly better job.  As 
the audit indicated, because in some cases there was not an 
application, it did not mean that there had not been one or there 
was not one somewhere else.  It just meant it was not in the 
file.  If there was not a rationale it did not mean that the 
project was not a good project.  It just meant it was not written 
in the file. But for me, the files do have to be complete. We 
have to be able to confirm to Canadians why the investments we 
are making with their tax dollars are the right investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken this audit very seriously.  As I say, from my point 
of view the administrative management is the foundation of our 
work.  It supports these grants and contributions, these projects 
that we know are important in the lives of Canadians and their 
communities.  My job as minister is to shore up this foundation, 
to make sure it is strong, because when a foundation shifts or is 
weakened, that which it holds up can also become weakened. For 
me, the responsibility that I have as minister is to take this 
seriously, to do what I have to do to shore up the foundation, to 
make it strong.  I am prepared to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting about this is that that is the story, the 
story of a department that through its own series of checks and 
balances identified an opportunity for improvement, that made 
this information available to Canadians in a transparent fashion 
and asked Canadians to recognize what we are doing and then to 
measure it by the work that we do to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition says that we are hiding something.  How can that 
be when we have made the report public, when it is available for 
Canadians to deal with?  I guess they do not have the same values 
of transparency and openness that we on this side of the House 
feel to be very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is interesting is that we hear from 
individual members of parliament that they do not think we should 
be investing in hotels or in golf courses or in Bible colleges. 
What those members do not understand is that they are talking 
about people.  They are talking about the people who have had the 
opportunity to get employment at these hotels, at the golf 
courses, or to get a summer job at a Bible college.  Those people 
who listen to the members of parliament challenging those 
undertakings must be asking is this job not good enough? We know 
it is good enough for them.  They know and they appreciate and 
they want the government to participate in providing 
opportunities for them so that they can benefit from the 
greatness that we know is ours as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this from our side of the House we know that the 
government can play a significant role in the lives of 
individuals and that we can partner effectively with communities 
to create opportunities to strengthen both the social and 
economic realities that are theirs.  That is what we believe in 
on this side and no one will change that.  That is why for me it 
is so important to take this audit and to deal with it wisely, 
effectively and fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to share with the House some of the letters 
that we have received that tell us we are right to support these 
grants and contributions.  We hear from Eric Boyd, the managing 
director of the Canadian Paraplegic Association.  Mr. Boyd 
writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the $1.7M provided by the Opportunities Fund over 3 years, I 
am pleased to report that we have been able to lever an 
additional $1.5M from our Corporate Campaign to support our 
employment programs.  I'm even more pleased to report that the 
Association has been able to increase its annual job placements 
from 500 to 750 in just one year, resulting in annual savings to 
taxpayers in excess of $18M. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another from Carolyn Emerson who is working at Memorial 
University of Newfoundland in the women in science and 
engineering program.  She writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for the WISE Students' salaries during the ten years of 
the program has come primarily from HRDC's Summer Career 
Placement Program from almost all of the Canada Employment 
Centres around the province.  That support is most gratefully 
acknowledged and has been a real investment in young Canadians, 
an investment that is reaping dividends as they enter the 
workforce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one is from Barbara Mulrooney and Barbara Linehan.  They 
are the co-owners of B & B Crafts.  They are in Placentia, 
Newfoundland.  They say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this fund we are proud to say how we feel about the 
difference our business has made in our lives.  This fund has 
enabled us to get up every morning and proudly say that we have 
to go to work.  It has raised our self-esteem and confidence 
through the pride we feel and see in our work. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I just point out that from our point of view these grants 
and contributions are extraordinarily important.  They make a 
difference in the lives of Canadians and in their communities. 
From my point of view as Minister of Human Resources Development, 
when I see that there is a job to be done to improve our 
administration, I take that seriously, and I will ensure that we 
work to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard we have worked very, very closely with experts to 
build a plan that will ensure that this problem is fixed; to 
ensure that this problem never happens again; to ensure that our 
foundation is strong and these grants and contributions are 
supported. I would like to give the House the highlights. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we will ensure payments meet our financial 
requirements.  That means that no payments will go out until the 
local director at a human resources development centre, or the 
director general, certifies that the project file meets the new 
financial criteria.  There are no new agreements that will be 
approved until we have signed confirmation that the project file 
contains all the essential elements.  All active files will be 
reviewed by April 30 to certify that they are complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will check and correct all problem files.  We have 
been talking about this.  We are investigating 37, now 34 because 
we have completed some, audit cases where financial rules may 
have been broken.  I underline may, because in the three we have 
already closed we found no difficulty.  The paperwork was found 
and things were as they should have been.  We also note that any 
similar cases that are identified through a review of active 
files will be investigated and resolved in the same way, and any 
cases of suspected fraud or other illegal activity will be 
referred to the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and this is very important, we will provide improved 
training and support for staff.  This means that we will provide 
them with the direction, tools, training and additional resources 
that are needed.  We will review and improve accountability and 
management structures and work processes to make sure we have our 
structures right.  We will complete the first round of training 
and make sure that by February our financial criteria are 
understood by all and that their responsibilities are understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a point I want to make here.  What I do not want to do 
is build a system that sucks the accountability and 
responsibility all back to headquarters.  We have worked very 
hard to build a service delivery model.  We are at the local 
level.  We can deal with individual citizens and with their 
community members to get the important grants and contributions 
into their hands in a timely fashion.  That has worked well and 
that has been a great success in our department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now what I want to do is work to provide them with a system that 
will also allow them to be fully accountable and transparent to 
the Canadian taxpayer and ensure that the investments we are 
making, the tax dollars we are investing, are followed dollar by 
dollar.  This is important to me and it is modern comptrollership 
that we are talking about here and that we can achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth aspect of our six point plan says that we will ensure 
accountability to judge results.  We will ensure that the 
implementation of the action plan is part of the basic job 
requirement for all managers involved in grants and 
contributions.  I am going to receive quarterly reports on our 
progress starting in April 2000.  Those reports will be made 
public because I do want Canadians to judge us against our 
actions.  We will have external reviews of our progress in June 
2000 and January 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we will get the best advice available.  We have presented 
the new system to the Treasury Board comptrollership standards 
advisory board and we have incorporated its advice. We have 
incorporated the suggestions from our meeting with the auditor 
general.  We have also contracted with Deloitte & Touche who have 
advised us on the integrity of our plan and have given us 
suggestions on modern comptrollership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and this is extremely important, we will report on our 
progress publicly.  As I have mentioned, to me that is a 
priority.  We will report to the media on our follow-up of the 37 
cases.  We will brief the media on our quarterly reports.  We 
will provide information to the Canadian public and I will appear 
before the parliamentary committee of human resources on this 
topic this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share for the record the reaction of the auditor 
general to this plan.  He said in his letter to our deputy dated 
February 7, “In our opinion, the proposed approach represents a 
thorough plan for corrective action to address the immediate 
control problems that were identified”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking the job as Minister of Human Resources Development 
seriously.  I can also say that my department is taking this 
seriously.  I have spoken with employees from coast to coast to 
coast.  They want a better system.  They want better tools.  They 
want to continue to serve Canadians in the best possible fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is committed to this plan.  It is committed to 
this work and supports it fully.  Together we are going to ensure 
that we have the best administrative practices when it comes to 
grants and contributions. 
We will continue to support these projects which are so vitally 
important in the ridings of each and every member of the House of 
Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For me this is about ministerial responsibility.  It is about 
taking information that says we can do a better job, making it 
public, building a plan of action that is approved by experts 
from the outside, and then committing to the people of the 
country to implement it, to fix the problem, to make it work and 
together to continue to build a strong Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the speech of the minister could be summed up in three 
words:  promises, promises, promises.  They fly totally in the 
face of the failure, failure, failure of the minister and the 
department over the past few years.  That is the real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the minister up on her promise of openness 
and transparency.  We have asked through access to information 
for the files relating to the TJF grants that went into the Prime 
Minister's riding.  When those requests came back they were about 
half whited out.  In many cases the papers had their headings but 
the rest had been cut off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the minister at her word, and because she has 
promised full disclosure and transparency to the Canadian people 
I would ask if she is prepared to table in their entirety those 
documents relating to all the TJF grants in the Prime Minister's 
riding in the House this week.   I would like an answer to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the hon. member 
knows there are aspects under the Privacy Act that have to be 
considered when files that are offered to requests for access to 
information are presented.  Those are the laws of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note that the department of human resources has a good 
record in responding to access to information requests.  We have 
sent out many, many pages.  Thousands of pages are presented to 
those who request them because that is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here includes Canadians, the Privacy Act, and the 
information that can be forwarded is forwarded. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
somewhat uncomfortable with the minister's speech, because she 
downplays a situation that has been going on for several years. 
The minister also confuses two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She confuses projects on which individual members are expected, 
by virtue of their functions, to make a decision with the 
documents on file. That is my first point, and I believe all 
members here do support these programs in good faith. However, 
program management does not concern the members of this House 
who are not government members and representing the minister's 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister familiar with the Public Service of Canada Act, 
which calls for public servants at all levels to be accountable? 
If a company were managed the way her department is, it would 
have gone bankrupt a long time ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is precisely what 
this is all about.  It is about taking responsibility.  As I say 
again, the department through its own series of checks and 
balances, an internal audit, identified that there were things 
upon which we could improve.  I received the information and I 
took it seriously.  I have asked the department to make it a 
priority, and in so doing we have worked with outside experts to 
develop a plan that will ensure this problem is dealt with, that 
it is fixed, and that it will never happen again.  That is about 
taking ministerial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to being in a circumstance where Canadians are 
being provided with the information, which we will now have on a 
continual basis, to measure us by our results.

way.  She has said—

would like to ask her questions. You said there would be 
four questions and there are four opposition parties. I would 
appreciate it if our party had the opportunity to ask a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Unfortunately, time is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we in the New Democratic Party have been very 
clear that we are not, nor have we ever been, against job 
creation initiatives.  God only knows in my part of Cape Breton 
that we have had enough flimsy job creation programs from 
agencies of the government like ACOA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister.  I have a concern with respect 
to what appears to be the flexibility of the role.  My 
understanding is that the criterion was 12% unemployment.  It had 
to create at least one sustainable long term job.  The riding of 
my colleague from Winnipeg Centre has an unemployment rate of 13% 
and the riding of the minister has an unemployment rate of 6%. My 
question is quite clear.  Why has the minister's riding qualified 
for TJF funds when my colleague's riding of Winnipeg Centre has 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to talk 
about this matter.  It gives me a chance to explain to the House 
the circumstances in my riding of Brant.  The hon. member is 
wrong with the numbers that she is quoting on the unemployment 
rates in 1995 and again in 1997.  The rates were acceptable and 
part of the CJF and TJF programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Brant has suffered extraordinarily in the course of 
the last decade.  The businesses that supported many men and 
women in Brantford, Massey Ferguson and White Farms, closed up. 
The rates of unemployment were extraordinary.  We had to 
diversify our economy.  As a result of the transitional jobs fund 
we have really helped my community turn the corner.  That is what 
this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as another point of interest, as part of transitional jobs 
fund three-quarters of the projects were in ridings of 12% or 
greater, but a quarter were for projects in ridings where the 
unemployment level was a pocket of high unemployment, and the 
majority of those projects were found in opposition ridings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my region of Canada has suffered quite a bit.  We have 
been fortunate enough to qualify for these grants and we have 
received some too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that the TJF was put in place was the reform of 
employment insurance.  It was put in place to help regions 
throughout the country like mine.  We realize today that money 
has gone to other areas which did not qualify.  The minister 
talks about pockets but it is the first time that I have heard 
about pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite the example of the $16,000 given out of the TJF fund in 
Tobique—Mactaquac and the $7,500 given to the Liberal campaign. 
There is something wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister speaks about the six point plan.  I have a serious 
question.  When TJF was brought in by the government was there 
not a plan in place to monitor the moneys that were handed out 
throughout the country?  Was there not a plan then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Madam Speaker, there was a plan.  The 
point of all this is that we are to improve the application and 
the implementation of better measures of management because that 
is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I would like to make. 
I say to you, Madam Speaker, that if the hon. member has any 
evidence of wrongdoing please have him bring it forward so that 
we can have the officials in the appropriate jurisdictions deal 
with it.

Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
in the House on the motion presented by the official opposition 
which holds in question the department of human resources and the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals prior to the elections of 1993 and 1997 supposedly 
took the high road when they approached Canadian voters.  I quote 
the Prime Minister as reported in <I>Hansard</I> in 1991: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the people of Canada that when we form the 
government, every minister in the cabinet that I will be 
presiding over will have to take full responsibility for what is 
going on his department.  If there is any bungling in the 
department, nobody will be singled out.  The minister will have 
to take the responsibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also quote the Prime Minister as reported in <I>Hansard</I> in 
1994: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no substitute for responsibility at the top.  I vow 
to you, to this House, to Canadians, that I will never abdicate 
that responsibility.  I will never pass the buck. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess that leads us into the motion today and what has 
happened.  Canadians have an expectation.  Canadians are those 
hard working taxpayers who work long hours.  They are the men, 
women and young adults who are starting their careers as workers. 
They give part of their money to the Government of Canada to 
spend on their behalf to provide programs for other Canadians and 
for themselves.  They expect the government to manage the 
spending of their money with due diligence and to make sure that 
it is not wasted. Lord knows that Canadians pay enough taxes. 
They certainly are not looking to the government to waste it on 
their behalf.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  What did Canadians actually get?  The 
auditor's report is quite clear as to what they got.  They got a 
government which takes very lightly the responsibility of 
managing taxpayers' money.  They got a government which does not 
seem to understand that the money comes from the taxpayer and not 
some location like a tree.  Canadians got a government which 
refuses to assume responsibility for the management of that 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor's report revealed that money had been given out but 
there were files which did not even have applications for the 
money. It revealed that there was a lack of supervision, a lack 
of concern as to where the money was supposed to go.  There was 
no plan as to where the money was supposed to go.  There was a 
real lack of management and administration.  There was a lack of 
supervision, a lack of documentation, but, more importantly, a 
lack of understanding by the minister in charge of the 
department.  She is responsible to make sure that the department 
manages the spending of taxpayers' money properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians are getting is a message from the Prime Minister 
and from his government that we do not have to take 
responsibility for our actions.  That is the message the Prime 
Minister is sending, not only to us, but to other ministers; that 
they will not be held accountable for things in their departments 
that would represent poor decision making, bad management or lack 
of accountability.  The Prime Minister is sending the message to 
his ministers that they will not ever be held accountable for the 
misuse or mismanagement of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message he is sending to Canadians in general is that they 
do not have to take responsibility for the way they report to 
government through government programs.  They do not have to take 
responsibility for fudging figures or accounts, or losing 
documentation which may be required by Revenue Canada.  How can 
it be all right for the department to access money or submit a 
report without all of the documentation but not be all right for 
the ordinary Canadian?  Canadians are getting the message from 
the Prime Minister and his government that they do not have to 
take responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak about Canadians I want to single out young 
Canadians who are just entering adulthood and the workforce. What 
kind of message are they receiving by the government's actions? 
What message are they entering adulthood with?  That it is okay 
to walk away from problems?  That it is okay to cover up reality, 
the truth?  That it is okay to give out questionable information? 
What message are we giving to the young people who will one day 
sit in the House of Commons in leadership positions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  My colleague says cynicism and he is 
quite right.  That is what bothers me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have leadership in our country which is sending the wrong 
message, which is showing a bad example to Canadians.  I think 
that Canadians deserve better.  I think that Canadians deserve a 
government which will use due diligence in managing taxpayers' 
money, which will respect the fact that its money comes from 
ordinary Canadians who are working day in and day out to raise 
families and to provide not only for their families but for 
themselves and their communities.  I think that Canadians deserve 
to have a government which recognizes that there are people who 
cannot look after themselves, who need assistance, but that 
assistance is given on merit and not for political reasons. 
Canadians deserve to have a government which recognizes that 
politics should be separate from government; that government, 
when it is spending taxpayers' money, should not be making 
decisions based on raising election funds or gathering votes.  It 
should be a government which spends taxpayers' money to provide 
programs for Canadians, programs and funds based on merit and 
merit only.

making decisions based on politics rather than merit.  There is 
never a reason for having one set of rules for the minister and a 
different set of rules for everybody else.  There is never a 
reason for covering up what actually happened.  That is not what 
Canadians deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve a government that will give the truth as it 
is, not as the government sees it.  Canadians deserve a 
government that will do the right thing for the right reasons. 
They do not deserve a government that will hide behind the back 
of the Prime Minister or the skirts of the minister of HRDC. They 
deserve a government which will face the responsibility that was 
given to it by the voters of Canada to govern with integrity. 
Canadians deserve nothing less.  Unfortunately they do not have 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister said that she was taking 
credit for bringing the internal audit public.  She was taking 
great pains to show her willingness to discuss this in an open 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I recall, it was members of the official opposition which two 
days before actually let it be known that we had our hands on 
this document.  Could it be assumed that the minister only made 
it public because she was caught in some sort of nest that she 
could not get out of and she knew we had the audit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the facts are that the 
official opposition put in an access request on the 17th and the 
minister released the audit report on the 19th, two days later, 
because she knew that it would become public anyway.  She did the 
damage control by releasing it before we did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
response to the last question shows how ridiculous is the Reform 
Party's thrust.  The member opposite has no proof that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development released the document on 
the 17th because the Reform Party did what it did on the 19th. It 
might have been the other way around.  The Reform Party might 
have had information that the minister was doing her job 
adequately, which she has shown she was doing.  She said there 
would be corrections.  Maybe the Reform Party decided to go the 
way it went to create an avenue going the other direction.  Maybe 
that is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing allegations from the Reform Party that do not have 
substance.  The answers today from the Prime Minister and the 
human resources development minister clearly show that we have 
projects that are good right across the country.  Will the hon. 
member not admit that these projects are good? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will let Canadians 
decide for themselves.  The minister had the auditor's report 
for five months. 
The official opposition put in an access request on the 17th and 
the minister released it on the 19th, five months after the fact. 
Circumstances show that it was probably the pressure of the 
official opposition's access request, which would have resulted 
in it being released anyway.  Damage control says that it is 
better to release something than it is to have it otherwise 
released.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member was talking about politics and 
partisanship rather than merit.  The facts are that in targeted 
wage subsidy programs the average spending in cabinet ministers' 
ridings was $350,634.  The average spending in a Liberal riding 
represented by a Liberal member of parliament was $335,730. 
However, the average spending for targeted wage subsidy programs 
in a riding represented by a Reform Party member was only 
$149,529, less than half of a cabinet minister.  Those are the 
facts.  That relates to the heart of what the member was talking 
about; politics and partisanship rather than merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot disagree with my 
colleague's comments.  The interesting thing, and the minister 
reiterated it today, is that the margin was 12% for the jobs fund 
and yet Statistics Canada figures, government figures, show that 
the figure was 6% in 1999 in her riding, not 12%.  The rate of 
unemployment was 8.4% in 1996.  It shows that the rate of 
unemployment was going down in her riding.  It certainly did not 
meet the 12% requirement of the minister's target level for the 
program.  Her riding took money that should have gone to a more 
needy riding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to address the opposition day motion.  We 
are taking head-on the issue of whether the government should be 
engaging in the types of actions that it has engaged in over the 
last months and years.  It has taken taxpayers' money and spent 
it on all kinds of questionable activities without doing the 
proper accounting.  In fact, we would argue that in many cases 
there seem to be absolutely no rules at all when it comes to how 
the government spends money through the Department of Human 
Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start by running through some of the facts and 
reiterating some of the things my colleague said a minute ago. 
They bear repeating because they are important.  I do not think 
anyone could argue that this is one of worst cases of neglect and 
abuse of taxpayers' money in the history of Canada.  I do not 
think people could argue that.  We are talking about a billion 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned a minute ago that two days after the 
Reform Party filed an access to information request for a copy of 
an internal audit done in the Department of Human Resources 
Development the minister called together a very hasty press 
conference and revealed that there were all kinds of problems in 
her department and the fact that she had known about this for 
months and months on end but had done absolutely nothing about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what that audit revealed.  Of the 459 project files 
reviewed, 15% did not have an application on file from the 
sponsor.  Of the remaining applications the following elements 
were missing:  72% had no cash flow forecast; 46% had no estimate 
of the number of participants; 25% had no description of the 
activities to be supported, yet cheques were cut and money went 
out; 25% provided no description of the characteristics of 
participants; 11% had no budget proposal; and 11% had no 
description of expected results.  Ninety-seven per cent of all 
files reviewed showed no evidence that anyone had checked to see 
if the recipient already owed money to HRDC or to the government. 
Eight out of ten files reviewed did not show evidence of 
financial monitoring, and 87% of project files showed no evidence 
of supervision.  That is what was happening in this department 
for months and months on end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that this went back before the current human 
resources minister and that the previous minister, now the 
Minister for International Trade, was also aware of this. 
My colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill questioned both ministers at 
various times and they assured the House there were no problems 
in that department, that everything was above board and that all 
the applications were being scrutinized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that simply was not true.  The audit proves that. But 
what does the government do?  It does not say it is sorry. The 
minister does not resign, which is the honourable thing to do 
when one blows a billion dollars.  The minister somehow finds the 
courage to stand and say it is no big deal.  I do not know how 
she can do that.  I do not know how she can say that they have 
implemented a six point plan and it is no problem now.  We are 
talking about a billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if my colleagues across the way have been out in 
their ridings over the last month and a half, but if they have, 
they will have found that people are concerned about the state of 
health care in Canada today.  They are asking how is it that the 
government can blow all this money on these grants and not really 
know where it ended up, yet health care goes lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we were promised emergency aid for the farmers. I 
should point out in fairness to the people in my riding that they 
are not simply asking for subsidies, but they do say they were 
promised this.  They are wondering what happened, because they 
told the bankers that they would be getting this.  It has not 
shown up but a billion dollars has just blown out the door 
through human resources development.  It is absolutely 
scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we analyse this what do we find?  First of all I have run 
through some of the facts.  Obviously there are simply no rules 
when it comes to spending money in human resources development. 
We are talking about a program where they really do have 
freestyle grant giving.  There are no rules.  It is chequebook 
politics.  The department cuts all kinds of cheques. There are no 
application forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there were a lot of questions about the propriety of 
what happened in the Prime Minister's riding. The few rules that 
there are were seemingly broken in order to ensure that money got 
into the hands of people who were big political supporters of the 
Prime Minister.  It is absolutely scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found out that once the cheques were sent out there was no 
real accounting.  The best examples are some of the things that 
were in the paper today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McGill University was seeking $60,000 and someone made a little 
error and gave it $160,000.  That can happen, but if there is 
some kind of financial system in place we get the $100,000 back. 
But those guys over there did not catch it and $100,000 is just 
gone.  McGill says “We decided that we really needed it so we 
will just hold on to the $100,000”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the situation where the native band in British 
Columbia ended up taking money that was supposed to be used for 
child care study and using it to buy jewels.  It is unbelievable. 
That is what happens when we give a Liberal government a bunch 
of money and an open chequebook to do with what it will.  That is 
precisely what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about, and I think Canadians are concerned 
about, is that a culture of neglect runs right through this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough it was the human resources minister who was 
previously the Indian affairs minister.  On her watch the auditor 
general came before parliament to present his report. Over and 
over and over again were all kinds of examples of how the 
government was not monitoring money that was going to Indian 
bands.  There was example after example.  Did anything change? 
Have things changed?  Obviously not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example in today's newspapers of what has gone 
on.  It is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is what do we do in a situation like this?  The 
very first thing is that we exorcise the cancer.  We get it out 
of there.  Do we know who that is?  It is the minister, the 
previous minister and probably the minister previous to that one. 
Three ministers in a row sat there knowing that this was going 
on and allowed that $1 billion to be spent year after year after 
year with no proper accounting.  Meanwhile high priority things 
are left wanting.

do all kinds of great and honourable things and put their lives 
on the line without proper equipment.  The government is blowing 
$1 billion a year out the door.  It is absolutely unbelievable 
but the government sits and justifies it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the minister with her pathetic justifications today.  It 
was unbelievable.  She said, “Well you know, some of it goes to 
things that are really good”.  Well, guess what.  We know that. 
We know there are some things out there that if they had some 
money it would be good. We do not question that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We question which ones should get the money and where that money 
should come from.  Should it come from big daddy government in 
Ottawa 2,000 miles away from all these projects, or should it 
come from local levels of government and private individuals?  I 
would argue it should come from the latter because those are the 
people who know which programs are most important in their 
ridings.  They know what they can afford because they are the 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a government that coercively takes money from 
people and we have the highest personal income taxes in the 
western world, and it hurts my friends across the way when we 
point these facts out and they are painful, rather obviously in a 
situation like that people would like to have the choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that Canadians being as generous as they are, 
they would overwhelmingly support worthy programs.  They would. 
What they resent is a government that reaches into their pockets, 
drives taxes through the roof to the point where we have the 
highest taxes in Canadian history, and then wastes their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one department.  I would love to peel open the books on 
those other departments because I know we would find the same 
thing in myriad other departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends across the way to climb down off their 
high horses and admit they are wrong.  The minister should 
resign. Probably the previous two ministers should resign.  Maybe 
then Canadians would start to have some faith that the government 
actually cares about what it does with people's money.  I do not 
think they believe that now.  They have seen too many examples of 
waste and cover-up and mismanagement from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that very shortly there will be another 
budget.  I hope that the finance minister does not have the gall 
to ask Canadians for more money to increase spending.  Rather 
obviously, there are billions of dollars of waste in the 
government, yet my friends across the way do nothing to root it 
out and to save taxpayers a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the minister to heed the message to clean up the 
waste and mismanagement before he asks for one more cent in the 
next budget.

projects where not a single job was created, not one job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sets aside whether or not jobs would have been created if 
that money had been left in taxpayers' pockets in the first 
place.  We argue that a dollar left in the taxpayers' pockets is 
far more effective than a dollar in the hands of a bureaucrat or 
a politician, and my friend just made that case for me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with only one thing that has been said in the 
debate today and that is that the most important thing we do as 
parliamentarians is to be accountable and responsible for 
Canadians when it comes to the use of their money.  What I find 
astonishing from the opposition today is the complete lack of 
recognition that the government has any role in working for the 
public good of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the members opposite are in the dark about what is 
happening in their ridings.  I personally am not. I personally 
visit every project in my riding that gets funding from the 
Government of Canada, so I know exactly who these projects are 
hiring.  I know exactly what kind of training they are providing 
and I know exactly what successes they are achieving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As examples hundreds of new Canadians are being trained on how 
to get a job in Canada and on what job skills are required. There 
are people being trained for industry and for available jobs. 
There are students getting work during the summer that will allow 
them to return to university. These are people I know in my— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but I 
need to interrupt.  We will see if we can get a question out of 
that for the hon. member for Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that is the 
problem.  A lot of these politicians do go and see who is getting 
hired.  In fact that is our criticism.  We do not think 
politicians should be involved in making those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have a program like that, and I sure do not 
believe we should, the last thing we want is politicians 
interfering with it.  Can the member not see that there is all 
kinds of room for abuse?  Did she not pay attention when we 
grilled the Prime Minister about what went on in his riding? That 
was shameful. We see millions of dollars wasted, millions of 
dollars which should be used for things that are good going to 
political things.  We do not believe that is a proper use of 
taxpayers' money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one of the ways in which government makes sure the money 
it spends is well spent is to involve the local people.  The hon. 
member asked why people in Ottawa should be making these 
decisions.  He may not be aware but in ridings such as mine it is 
actually the local people who come together in various fashions 
and who sit down and work with the Canada Employment Centre 
offices to make sure that money goes into the area specifically 
where it is needed most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a lot of areas, in particular in an area like southwestern 
Ontario, there are pockets of high unemployment.  That is really 
where we want those moneys to be directed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like Brant? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Yes, exactly like Brant.  In Brant 
particularly there are pockets where the unemployment rates are 
much higher than 12%.  That is why this program was made, to make 
sure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please.  I am afraid 
there is no more time.  There are barely a few seconds for the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is a 6% 
unemployment rate in Brant and my friend across the way is 
defending pouring money in when the standard is 12%.  Obviously 
that is the minister feather bedding her own riding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to offer my comments on this very 
misguided Reform opposition motion which we are debating today. 
I find it quite astonishing that some members, especially those 
of the Reform Party, would claim that the government is trying to 
hide something here when it was the minister herself who made the 
internal audit known to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the hon. member for Medicine Hat talk about pathetic. 
What is pathetic is what the Reform Party and others are trying 
to do in this debate, which is to misrepresent the facts to the 
extent they are.  It is absolutely shameful but it is so typical 
of the pathetic Reform Party.  What it is good at— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is clearly in the parliamentary rules that one cannot charge a 
member with misrepresenting the facts.  It is against the 
standing orders and I would ask you to ask the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure that if the 
hon. member said anything that was questionable he will correct 
it right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure the hon. member 
opposite understands when I say how pathetic the Reform Party is 
as it twists and turns in its own self-flagellation.  It is 
unbelievable how those people opposite are intent always on 
pitting Canadians against Canadians, region against region, group 
against group, people against people. 
That is all those people who are nothing more than disunity type 
people have in common.  They deserve each other and they deserve 
what they get.  However, we on the governing side—

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Industry review policies currently 
in place that affect the Canadian shipbuilding industry in order 
to assess their ability to provide a competitive and equitable 
environment for growth of the industry in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the 
opportunity to rise in this place to discuss a very important 
issue which I believe is critical to the economic well-being of 
the country and in particular Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today as a member of parliament for the riding of 
Fundy—Royal which borders the city of Saint John.  I am one of 
many members of parliament who have spoken in this place over the 
last number of years to put forth the need for us to modernize 
our current shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from all sides of the House have spoken on behalf of 
this initiative.  It has a wide breadth of support from a number 
of political parties, for example the New Democrats, and a hot 
and cold relationship with the Liberals.  The member from Lévis, 
Quebec, has been a strong advocate of the need to revitalize our 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No member in the House of Commons has fought more tirelessly 
than the member for Saint John to ensure that the people of Saint 
John, New Brunswick, are able to earn their living at the 
shipyard located there and that Saint John Shipbuilding Limited 
will work again.  The member for Saint John has spoken in the 
House on countless occasions, whether it be during debate or in 
question period.  I rise today on behalf of all individuals who 
are trying to advance this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 71 calls on the Standing Committee on Industry to 
complete an indepth review and analysis of current shipbuilding 
policies and how they affect the growth or lack thereof of the 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion does not compel the government to make any changes. 
It only requests that the industry committee assess the current 
system for its ability to promote growth in the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry.  Put simply, it proposes that the 
committee complete an indepth review of the file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about what we need to do to revitalize our 
shipbuilding as has been advocated by an unprecedented number of 
individuals. 
Only last March the motion put forward by the member for Saint 
John on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 
called on the House to develop a national shipbuilding policy. At 
the same time the member for Saint John utilized the exact same 
language the Liberal Party of Canada used on two separate 
occasions to put forward a resolution by its members at its 
national convention concerning the need for us to develop a 
national shipbuilding policy.  At that time in the House the 
Liberal government chose to reject that initiative.  I find this 
a bit shocking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a document with me which I hesitate to use as a prop by 
any means.  It is entitled “Atlantic Canada:  Catching 
Tomorrow's Wave”.  I do not know if members have had a chance to 
review this document, but on page 104 it notes that one of the 
critical initiatives needed to develop a modern economy in 
Atlantic Canada is a new shipbuilding policy.  Maybe the Liberals 
are actually listening to the member for Saint John, to me and to 
all other individuals who have put forth this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 106 goes on to say that Canada is the only country which 
does not provide any direct construction grants, loan guarantees, 
preferential rate export financing, research and development 
grants, preferential tax treatment or customs duties on imported 
ship materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That document was produced by Liberal Party members from 
Atlantic Canada, what few it might actually have.  A number of 
them were able to coalesce to put together a document on 
September 30, 1999, less than six months after they turned their 
nose down on trying to advance the debate we had put forward back 
in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am advocating something that is almost unprecedented.  These 
individuals are calling for us to modernize the shipbuilding 
industry.  They represented all 10 premiers of this great country 
of Canada not just once but on two separate occasions:  in St. 
Andrews in 1997 and again in Quebec City in 1998.  All 10 
provinces have actually put their shoulder to the wheel and said 
that we need to ensure we have the financial instruments to 
develop a shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to all 10 premiers, the ship owners, the 
shipbuilders and labour have coalesced around the same principles 
and are advocating the exact same things that we need to 
modernize our shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the actual issues in terms of what I am 
advocating the Department of Industry and the Minister of 
Industry bring forward, I want to make it very clear to everybody 
in this place today or watching at home on CPAC that we are not 
looking for subsidies in any way, shape or form for the 
shipbuilding industry.  We are looking for the government to do 
two principal things.  One is to give it sound, viable access to 
its market and the other is to provide a proper tax regime for it 
to be able to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sound and viable access to its market for most commodities might 
be roads, rails and other direct infrastructure like ports and 
airports, for that matter.  We have those challenges near my home 
in the riding of Saint John.  That is normally the kind of 
infrastructure we speak about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another role in terms of what we are looking at in terms of a 
sound, viable access to its market is an international trade 
regime so that it actually has a marketplace in which to 
establish.  I will come back to that in a few moments as I 
progress through the course of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to develop an international tax regime whereby we 
can be competitive in Canada.  The corporate taxes in Canada are 
completely uncompetitive in other regimes.  In fact, Canada has 
the second highest corporate taxes in the industrialized world, 
second only to Japan.  It is difficult for any industry to 
compete and make a profit in Canada, in particular the 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four points I will advocate would be the cornerstone for 
developing a modern shipbuilding policy supported by all 10 
premiers, labour, ship owners and shipbuilders. 
I know the member for Saint John can attest to them as well as 
every family, every man and woman who actually has earned a 
paycheque in shipyards whether it be in Saint John, New 
Brunswick; Marystown, Newfoundland; Port Weller, Ontario; Lévis, 
Quebec; or elsewhere throughout the country.  These are the 
initiatives we are looking at doing.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, we understand categorically that any time a 
large capital good is purchased in Canada or anywhere in the 
world the available financial package is a cornerstone of whether 
or not the bid is competitive.  That means access to capital at 
the most aggressive financing rates possible.  That is why we are 
advocating that a loan guarantee program be adopted similar to 
the one in the American title XI program which guarantees under 
very prudent criteria the loan of a potential ship buyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title XI program has been in place place since 1936.  Do 
members know how many loan defaults it has had since then?  The 
member for Saint John knows the answer.  The answer is zip, zero, 
not one loan default.  If a student in university copied 
something and got in trouble it was called plagiarism.  In the 
real world, if it works it is called being resourceful.  I am 
advocating that Canada develop a loan guarantee program similar 
to the one in title XI and adopt it in the Canadian context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a natural vehicle to deliver that in the departments of 
industry and international trade, the Export Development 
Corporation.  It will guarantee a loan for a foreign buyer of a 
ship.  We also need to adapt it to guarantee a loan for a 
domestic buyer of a ship, especially given the fact that we have 
a aging fleet on the Great Lakes, one of our principal markets in 
terms of where we can build ships on a competitive basis in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I am advocating is that our punitive tax regime 
in Canada needs to provide accelerated depreciation combined with 
revising Revenue Canada leasing regulations.  Lease financing has 
become a very natural vehicle for purchases of large capital 
goods.  We need to ensure that our tax regime is competitive with 
that of the United States.  I am not looking at subsidies.  I am 
looking at a loan guarantee program.  I am looking at changing 
the Canadian tax regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I am advocating is that we need to ensure that 
we find sound, viable access to our markets.  I spoke about the 
need for a trade regime.  The result of the free trade agreement, 
NAFTA, in general has been very positive for Canada. Prior to 
1988 we traded essentially $80 billion each year with the 
Americans.  Today we trade around $240 billion to $260 billion 
each year with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Jones Act which has been in place in the United 
States since 1936 has blocked our penetration into the American 
market.  That is fine to some degree.  We can compete if we have 
a proper tax regime and a proper loan guarantee program with the 
markets in the EU.  We can build ships in our own waters and on 
the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent on the government, the Minister for 
International Trade and the Minister of Industry, to step forward 
and talk with the Americans about opening up some kind of 
bilateral accord on building certain types of ships.  The example 
of offshore drilling rigs comes to mind.  The member for Saint 
John and I have spoken about it on countless occasions.  There is 
an actual demand for more capacity to build drilling rigs for 
development off the banks of Newfoundland in the Terra Nova, 
Hibernia, Ben Nevis and White Rose oilfields, in terms of the 
development that has taken place along the Carolinas and what we 
have seen in the Gulf of Mexico.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could develop shipshape drilling rigs, which are in demand 
with the States, and we could open up a bilateral accord in that 
way.  Maybe we should look at ocean-going tugs, which are 
manufactured in P.E.I.  In Georgetown, P.E.I., in the solicitor 
general's riding, they manufacture a very cost-competitive ship. 
Maybe we could develop a bilateral accord in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking at is a loan guarantee program similar to 
what the Americans have under Title XI, revising our leasing 
regulations so we have a competitive tax regime and opening up 
some form of bilateral accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard, sadly, in the House on a number of occasions the 
government say “You, the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada, negotiated the free trade agreement and at that time you 
missed out on an opportunity to ensure that shipbuilding was 
exempt from any kind of protectionist regime under the free trade 
agreement”.  I would like to remind every one of those members, 
categorically, that free trade has been a win for Canada.  In 
1988 our trade with the Americans amounted to $80 billion.  Today 
it is around $240 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in office for almost seven years and it 
has not knocked on the door of one congressman or one senator in 
the United States of America to say that maybe it is time we 
actually tried to do something in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this issue is that there is no leadership in 
advancing the file.  This is where I am at a loss.  The Minister 
of Finance says that it is not his file.  The Minister for 
International Trade says that the EDC is under his jurisdiction 
but it is not really his file, that it comes under the industry 
file.  The Minister of Industry says that the instruments we are 
looking for belong in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have a quarterback in place who is willing to 
advance the shipbuilding industry in this country, then it is 
time we change the quarterback.  We should change the Minister of 
Industry so that we can ensure we get people back to work in 
Atlantic Canada, in Quebec, in Vancouver and in Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise to respond to Motion No. 71 presented by the hon. member 
from the Tory party.  The motion calls for the Standing Committee 
on Industry to review the policies in place which affect the 
Canadian shipbuilding industry in order to assess their ability 
to provide a competitive and equitable environment for the growth 
of the industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a noble cause.  Canadians want to sympathize with the 
hon. member who laments the days when Canada was one of the great 
shipbuilding nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower taxes would help all factors of our economy.  If the 
government would lower taxes it would help our industries.  Lower 
taxes would help all companies across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition policy calls for private sector 
self-reliance without the federal government providing tax 
dollars to support any specific sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the shipbuilding industry in Canada.  With only .04%, 
that is 1/25th of a percentage point of the world's 
shipbuilding production, Canada cannot sustain a shipbuilding 
industry.  Rather than try to match these subsidies and other 
incentives offered by other countries, we should concentrate our 
efforts on negotiating down unfair export subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from guaranteeing loans to Canadians who purchase Canadian 
built ships, we should drop the 25% tariff we have on non-NAFTA 
ship imports so that all Canadian shipowners and ship purchasers 
are not penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada can tell us about the problems in the 
shipbuilding industry.  It is a declining industry, a dead in the 
water industry.  There is an overcapacity in the world of over 
40%.  Canada is not even in the ballpark.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals and Tories have done to the shipbuilding 
industry in Canada is a study on what not to do in terms of 
productivity.  Yet the industry department continues to have a 
shipbuilding policy which has technology partnership grants, 
research and development grants and the Export Development 
Corporation supporting it.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology partnerships program is available to firms for 
research and development, if they so wish.  It is repayable based 
on success.  It is a risk sharing, reward sharing program.  No 
one should use this program for shipbuilding because there would 
be no way to pay back the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the world shipbuilding industry.  This industry 
has moved away from North American and European markets to 
southeast Asian markets.  Japan and South Korea continue to 
control over two-thirds of the total international market for 
shipbuilding and ship repair.  China is emerging as a rival. 
When combined, these three countries control over 75% of the 
world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to extreme pressure from Asian shipbuilders many traditional 
shipbuilders, including the Norwegian company Kvaerner, have 
chosen to get out of the industry altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot build major ships.  We can manufacture only minor 
and smaller vessels here.  Both of these markets are already 
operating at over 40% of their capacity.  Demand and prices are 
already weak and are forecast to continue to decline.  Prices for 
1999 are down by 6% to 24% from last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international market is experiencing a significant 
downsizing.  Market conditions for shipbuilders are not about to 
change.  The total employment in Canada's shipbuilding and ship 
repair industry as of May 1999 was about 5,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be done?  We should not turn to taxpayers and make 
them pay for a shipbuilding industry in Canada that will never be 
a viable industry.  On this side of the House we support 
de-politicizing economic decision making by eliminating grants, 
guarantees and subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Tories do about the shipbuilding industry when they 
were in power for nine years?  The destruction of the 
shipbuilding industry during their time in government was 
devastating to our eastern provinces and to B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at subsidies as a solution.  The Tories think, as 
the Liberals do, that all we have to do is get the industry 
committee to approve millions of dollars worth of subsidies and 
we can resurrect Canada's shipbuilding industry.  That is 
typical.  The Liberals use the industry committee and its 
minister to try to give millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds 
to hockey teams.  This is all very disgusting to those of us who 
are building an alternative to the traditional way of doing 
things here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last session the House debated shipbuilding.  A Bloc MP 
wanted to establish a federal loan granting program that would 
cover up to 87.5% of the money borrowed to purchase a commercial 
ship built in Canadian shipyards.  That bill would also have 
provided a favourable and generous tax treatment of lease 
financing for the purchase of Canadian built ships.  The Bloc 
MP's bill proposed a refundable tax credit for refitting 
commercial ships in Canada.  This was not just another attempt to 
do some Liberal bashing over this issue; maybe the Bloc Quebecois 
also wants Canadian taxpayers to continue pouring millions of 
taxpayer dollars into Quebec up to the last minute, until they 
leave Canada, but it is very clear that the people of Quebec will 
not be following the Bloc Quebecois anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the industry committee.  In November of last year 
the industry committee dealt with the shipbuilding matter.  The 
committee heard the sad details of the worldwide industry, which 
spelled poor prospects in the industry for our country in the 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals on the committee did not know or were not willing 
to admit that their minister for the homeless was secretly 
lobbying cabinet, trying to broker a common ground between 
industry and the government.  Canadians think that she is in 
Toronto working on the homeless problem.  We know that she is not 
in B.C. helping Vancouver with its homeless people.  The media 
caught her working on shipbuilding.  The Liberals only want to 
meet to talk about helping the shipbuilding industry.  This 
garners votes in eastern Canada and Quebec, and they hope in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could be wrong, but it does not want to have to 
face Canadian taxpayers and our foreign trading partners with the 
facts and figures on actually how much money it would pour into 
the industry.  That is a big question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that cannot account for $1 billion 
in HRDC spending, which we were debating earlier today.  The 
concentration on this issue could be construed as a thinly veiled 
attempt to orchestrate the immediate building of five or six 
ships which the federal government plans to construct in four or 
five years.  We are watching for an attempt to have these ships 
built this year or next.  This may save the taxpayers money or it 
may not.  Maybe the ships could be built cheaper offshore.  That 
would save taxpayers some money.  Let us look at a viable 
solution.  Maybe the Liberals will have these ships constructed 
just before the next federal election so they can throw the 
industry a bone.  No one will be fooled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will support the review of the shipbuilding policy.  However, 
I will support it reluctantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions are:  How many times do we have to review this 
matter?  How much money is it going to cost taxpayers?  Canadians 
know that the current Liberal government is maintaining a high, 
artificial level of taxation.  It is hurting our economy, our 
productivity and our growth with high taxes, as the member from 
the PC party mentioned.  It is hurting our consumers and it is 
discouraging foreign investors from coming to Canada.  It has 
caused a brain drain that threatens our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has to be done about the high level of taxes that is 
killing jobs, our economy, our industry and the country.  Our 
employment levels are too low.  With our vast resources and our 
ability to create wealth with other nations in the global 
economy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member as his time has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to speak to the 
motion moved by the member for Fundy—Royal in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say pleasure, because this member, along with certain others, 
has long been calling for a real shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the motion, I have a few comments about the 
speech by the Reform Party member.  I was somewhat taken aback 
because I have been on the Standing Committee on Industry since 
the 1997 election, and I noticed that the party is on its third 
industry critic.  The first two shared our vision, but all of a 
sudden, perhaps seeing the possibility of political gain in 
their fight with the Progressive Conservatives for a certain 
percentage of the voters, they are switching their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the Reform Party member who has just 
spoken and who is not listening to me—but I will say it again—that 
20 members of his party supported my Bill C-213 just a few 
months ago.  So some consistency is called for on the Reform 
Party side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I will return to the motion by the member for the 
Progressive Conservative Party, the member for Fundy—Royal.  His 
motion made sense and perhaps still does.  What he was calling 
for at the time was for the issue to be considered by the 
Standing Committee on Industry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were at least three sittings of the Standing Committee on 
Industry where we met with Department of Industry officials.  In 
response to a question by a Reform member, a deputy minister 
replied that the Reform member was wrong, that the federal 
government had no particular policy on shipbuilding and that the 
member could rest assured that no more was being done for that 
sector than for any other.  I then rose to say “That is exactly 
where the problem lies.  You are doing nothing in particular for 
this sector.  You have abandoned it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet that party had committed, in its red book and in 1993, to 
hold, within a year of its election, a summit on the future of 
shipbuilding in Canada.  Since then, nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little later on, management and the unions appeared before the 
committee.  We asked the unions “Do you feel that there is a 
shipbuilding policy in Canada?”  They said there was not.  Then 
we asked management “Do you feel that there is a policy?”  They 
said “Yes, there is the customs duty”.  Clearly the CEO of the 
Shipbuilding Association did not want to overly displease the 
Liberal Party.  He said “Yes, there are certain policies, 
including the customs duty” but that is all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again I asked “Do you feel that you have a true 
shipbuilding policy?”  In the bill we are going to address 
tomorrow evening, moreover, the three measures I am referring to 
are the three ones being requested.  I stated further “You are 
supported in this by the unions, by the Chambre maritime du 
Canada, by the provincial premiers.  You have the support of 
150,000 people who sent a mail-in postcard to the Prime Minister. 
You even have the support of members of the Liberal Party of 
Canada who are holding their convention.” Some Liberal members 
attending the convention voted with the grassroots, urging their 
government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour tried to do something. She appointed a 
delegate to the Maritimes to look into the matter. The Reform 
Party member noticed and he criticized the minister for it, 
telling her “You should not have done that. You did that in 
secret”. As for the Minister of Industry, he did not want to do 
anything, while the Minister of Finance could not do a thing. 
That has always been his line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the Minister of Finance not act? He will not tell the 
House. He lets the Minister of Industry answer, but we are 
asking for tax measures. Outside the House, the Minister of 
Finance says “You see, I have some interests in the shipbuilding 
industry. 
These interests are now in a trust, but I cannot answer. I would 
not want to be seen as someone who wants to promote that sector 
because I happen to have some interests in that particular 
sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are not good when the one person who could do something 
does not dare do so for fear of being criticized. When she saw 
that her industry colleague was not acting, and even though this 
was not her responsibility, the Minister of Labour tried to do 
something, but the Reform Party member criticized her for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the Minister of Labour to know that she did well, as did 
her colleague from New Brunswick. She wants to look into the 
matter. I have nothing against that, but we have been asking for 
reviews for seven years. The industry got organized and 
conducted a review. The Standing Committee on Industry 
considered the issue from a productivity point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures in hand, the unions appeared before the committee to 
testify that Canadian shipyard workers were paid 20% less than 
their American counterparts, and 50% less than workers in 
Germany and Japan.  Only two countries, Korea and communist 
China, pay their shipyard workers less, and that is the example 
the Reform Party member would have us follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who claim to be experts on the shipbuilding 
industry while never having set foot in a shipyard.  I would 
like the Reform Party member to try this line in Halifax or 
Vancouver, where there are two large shipyards.  Or he could try 
out the audience in Lévis.  He would be well-advised to pre-record 
his press conference because he is going to run into trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position is indefensible and inconsistent with the earlier 
positions taken by the Reform Party.  Now it is trying to teach 
us a lesson about free enterprise. 
All they are trying to do is lower individual income taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fundy—Royal told us that Canadian corporate taxes, 
which take in shipyards, are among the highest.  That is one of 
the problems.  Why do Canadian shipowners have their boats built 
outside Canada?  Why do those people who have had ships built 
sometimes sail them under foreign flags?  Because corporate 
taxes are not the same everywhere in the world, and there are 
tax havens.  The Minister of Finance knows this.  He chairs a 
committee of members of the group of 20 and he should give this 
some thought.  That is the problem, not what workers are paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is a serious lack of guaranteed financing. 
No one here in this House is asking for funding.  The Reformers 
keep saying it, and the member himself keeps saying that the 
member from the Bloc is asking for a refundable tax credit.  The 
words mean what they mean: refundable.  It is not funding.  A 
loan guarantee is not funding, it is support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Reform Party, which is trying to copy the American 
program, trying all the time to tell us that things are better 
in the United States?  What is called for in Bill C-213 is 
exactly what the Americans have been doing for the past 100 
years.  We in Canada are doing what?  We are exempting the U.S. 
from paying 25% duty.  However, our Canadian shipowners cannot 
go to the United States, because of the protectionist measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fundy—Royal said “We have to look at that.  It 
cannot be included in a bill”.  It is not in my bill either 
because the Minister for International Trade is the one to go 
and negotiate some similar measure with his American counterpart 
or a change to NAFTA—and that is very difficult—or have the Jones 
act amended to exempt Canada from such a policy.  If this were 
the case, with the current rate of exchange there would be work 
in Canadian shipyards, incredibly more than Canada could 
generate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently did a study on the Internet and by phone.  In the 
United States, shipyards are currently working at full tilt. 
The remaining European shipyards are also working to capacity 
because following the Asian crisis the Asian shipyards are not 
working at full capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member does not know what he is talking about when he 
speaks as other detractors of the shipping industry.  He said 
that China, Korea and Japan are building 500,000 tonne boats. 
No Canadian shipyard is in that league.  They do not go beyond 
100,000 tonnes.  Why?  Because they build ships that have to go 
through the Panama Canal which will accept nothing over 90,000 
tonnes.  So, let us compare oranges with oranges and apples with 
apples.  If you do not know what you are talking about, better 
not to speak.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, first, I wish to praise the hon. 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for being so 
passionate and caring for the shipbuilding industry in this 
country.  There is no member of parliament who has worked harder 
on this issue for workers in the shipbuilding industry all across 
the country.  He, his party and the Conservative Party should be 
congratulated for bringing this motion forward.  I applaud their 
efforts in bringing this to the forefront and to debate in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by saying that I am wearing the CAW/MWF pin from 
the Marine Workers' Federation.  Mr. Les Holloway and all those 
wonderful people in Halifax, in Saint John and in other shipyards 
around the area have worked tirelessly on this issue to get the 
government to listen.  What this nation needs is a shipbuilding 
policy.  Holland, Italy, England and the United States have one 
but we do not.  If we did, it would be working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We constantly hear from the industry minister that there is an 
overcapacity in the industry, yet Canada only produces .4%. 
What the industry has been asking for is that the level be 
brought up to 1%, a .6% increase, in order to create and sustain 
thousands of jobs in Atlantic Canada, Ontario, Quebec and 
Vancouver.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that the government will not listen.  It is 
absolutely unbelievable.  The reason it does not listen is 
because its focus is between Windsor and Quebec City in terms of 
central Canadian thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a farming crisis and the recent fisheries crisis but the 
government refuses to listen to the extremities of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, in all honesty, that any time we have a labour leader 
like Buzz Hargrove and the owner of one of the largest 
shipyards in the country, J.D. Irving, singing out of the same 
hymn book on this policy, one would think that the government 
would grab at that, but it does not.  It absolutely ignores the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly believe the government does not understand the 
industry at all.  It is completely blank.  It is like a deer 
caught in the headlights of a car.  It just cannot figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fundy—Royal mentioned the book <I>Atlantic 
Canada:  Catching Tomorrow's Wave</I>.  Unfortunately, the 
government missed the boat on this one.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the appointment of Senator Boudreau from Nova Scotia who 
is now in the Senate draining the taxpayers' purse promoting this 
red book wherever he goes.  The problem is that he has absolutely 
no clout with the government.  If he did, the government would be 
listening to everyone on the shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a great book written recently by a great author in 
Nova Scotia who lives in my riding, Mr. Lesley Choyce.  He wrote 
a book entitled <I>Nova Scotia: Shaped by the Sea: A Living 
History</I>.  In it, he describes how Nova Scotia was one of the 
finest and largest shipbuilding provinces in the 18th and 19th 
centuries.  What has happened in this new millennium?  The thing 
has fallen apart.  Why?  Because the government refuses to 
institute a policy of fairness so we can keep workers in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, shipbuilding workers from the Saint John dockyards 
are being lured to the United States to build ships. It is 
unbelievable that the United States has such an overcapacity of 
work that it has to get Canadian workers, who are the best in the 
world when it comes to building ships, to build ships in the 
United States.  We could easily be doing that in the yards of 
Saint John, Halifax, Marystown, Lévis and Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that the government cannot figure this out. 
Hundreds of workers are leaving this country and their families 
behind to build ships in the United States when the work could be 
easily done in this country.  It is absolutely incredible that 
the government would ignore the needs of Atlantic Canadians, 
Quebecers and British Columbians when it comes to building a 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it scandalous, to the highest degree, when I hear where 
the finance minister, who has Canada Steamship Lines, has his 
ships built.  Where does he have his ships built? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  In Taiwan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Yes, in Taiwan, an Asian country.  He 
could not even build his own ships in this country.  This is from 
a man who wants to become the leader of the Liberal Party and the 
prime minister of the country.  It is not much of a commitment to 
working people in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member is taking shots at one of the cabinet 
ministers.  It is totally inappropriate and totally unwarranted. 
He should tailor his talk in a way that does not do that because 
it denigrates this whole House and all Canadians.  That is 
absolute rubbish.  He should withdraw it and get to his point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that it 
is really a point of debate so we will allow the hon. member to 
carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Unfortunately, the truth sometimes 
hurts.  The reality is that the government has completely ignored 
the needs of the 10 premiers of the country who have said 
that they need a national shipbuilding policy.  It has ignored 
the needs of thousands of Canadians.  It has ignored the needs of 
hundreds of communities in the country that rely on shipbuilding 
for their livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government tell these people when those yards 
eventually shut down?  What will happen then?  Oh, I know, there 
will be a traditional transitional jobs fund grant.  That should 
be good.  Maybe that is what the problem is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry should go to the human resources 
minister for money and grants.  That way it would not have to 
file any papers or anything.  It could get the money or whatever 
it needs right away.  Maybe that is what the NHL should have 
done. Instead of going to the industry minister it should have 
gone to the human resources minister.  There is all kinds of 
money for those initiatives but absolutely not one shred of 
concern for this country's shipbuilding industry and that is an 
absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on.  People like Les Holloway of the Marine 
Workers' Federation and many other communities across the country 
are asking for leadership. They are asking the government to 
listen to them, to work together with the industry, the 
communities and the workers to come up with a comprehensive 
policy that will make the shipbuilding industry what it once was 
in Canada.  Our workers and our industry people are the finest in 
the entire world when it comes to shipbuilding.  We can be proud 
of that instead of having rusty shipyards throughout the country.

this opportunity to respond to the emotional and passionate 
presentations I have just heard from the Conservative member who 
brought the motion forward, the Bloc Quebecois member and my good

wanted to say about the good work that was done in committee and

industry, I heard about the farmers and I heard about HRDC.  I 
heard everything but constructive input.  I find that shameful. 
They were referring to ministers and their businesses which are 
in trust.  That is shameful.  That is not what we are supposed to 
be doing here tonight.  We are here to discuss shipbuilding and 
to bring some constructive points forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take this opportunity to refer to my notes and 
talk about how enthusiastically and aggressively the committee 
addressed this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to Les Holloway and all the other great 
people.  I am glad he is doing this. He should do it to get their 
votes if that is what it is going to take to get their votes and 
if that is what it is going to take to get a contribution to 
their campaigns.  That is fine.  I have no objections to that, 
but I do object when we go totally off the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member, my good friend from the Liberal Party, 
is insinuating that I made comments for vote getting. If that is 
the case, I guess J. D. Irving will be voting for the New 
Democratic Party as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>   I am afraid that is 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is not what I said. 
I was saying we should compliment, congratulate and support 
people who support us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to respond to this motion brought forward by the 
hon. member for Fundy—Royal that the Standing Committee on 
Industry review policies currently in place that affect the 
Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are very open to the idea of a 
parliamentary review of the shipbuilding industry, but this 
motion seems to be caught in a time warp.  I understand where the 
members from the Bloc, the Conservatives and the NDP are coming 
from.  I understand the regions.  I understand the members have 
to address a specific industry in their ridings and be so 
passionate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of standing up and bringing something forward 
that has already been addressed?  Is it showcasing?  If it is, I 
congratulate the member.  I think he is doing a great job. 
Tomorrow he can send a press release to his local newspaper 
saying “Look, here is what your member for Fundy—Royal has 
done”.  But we have a responsibility when we come to this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He 
is wondering why. It is because Davie Industries is under the 
protection of the Bankruptcy Act. There are 200 people—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank you for your 
clarification.  Let me get to the essence of the whole debate 
here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that last November and December the Standing 
Committee on Industry had already begun reviewing Canada's 
productivity and competitiveness with respect to shipbuilding. 
I want to make it crystal clear that the member's motion comes a 
little bit too late, as I said earlier.  Let me emphasize the 
valuable work already done by the Standing Committee on Industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before taking a few moments to review the testimony provided 
during the hearings, I want to once again remind all members that 
there is a national shipbuilding policy in Canada and it includes 
the following support.  They said there is no shipbuilding 
industry.  There is an accelerated capital cost allowance for 
Canadian built ships; a 25% tariff on most non-NAFTA ship 
imports; domestic procurement by the federal government in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars; Export Development Corporation 
financing for commercially viable transactions; and a very 
favourable research and development tax credit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the very elements that the industry committee has 
examined. On November 16, the first day, the committee heard from 
several government officials.  Committee members were provided 
with a global portrait of the shipbuilding industry. We have to 
look at it in that context, one in which most shipbuilding today 
is done in Asia, Japan, South Korea and increasingly I might 
point out in China.  These governments heavily subsidize the 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Japanese have built a strong niche in the construction of 
large vessels and have managed to hold on to that niche.  The 
newly developed countries see shipbuilding as an outlet for their 
steel production and steel production is a key to their 
industrial development. Other countries, including the United 
States, have non-tariff barriers to buying foreign built ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials also maintain that overcapacity has been a problem for 
Canada's shipbuilding industry today.  For some time now the 
industry has been undergoing rationalization.  Officials have 
suggested that the industry itself acknowledges that 
rationalization has improved its competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more positive note, officials pointed out in committee that 
the Canadian manufacturers are on a par with just about everyone 
in the world when it comes to designing innovative products, 
manufacturing them efficiently and marketing them to the world. 
They said that there are niche opportunities for the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry.  Ice-breaking vessels, ferries, offshore 
equipment and self-unloading vessels are areas in which we have a 
great international reputation. We are also well regarded as 
builders of military frigates.  Unfortunately there is not that 
big of a market for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials from the Export Development Corporation also appeared 
before the committee.  They reported that EDC has concluded 17 
transactions with the shipbuilding industry for a total of $247 
million worth in business. Here is one government program which 
indeed is showing a positive result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finance officials also explained how Canada's tax system 
supports shipbuilding, including giving the industry a higher 
capital cost allowance and noted that Canada has the most 
generous R and D regime in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings the hon. member for Fundy—Royal referred to 
the financing available in the United States under the title XI 
program. I remind the hon. member for Fundy—Royal of his 
exchange with the finance officials concerning his suggestion 
that Canada should provide a combination of lease financing and 
accelerated depreciation.  The hon. member also may believe that 
in providing these incentives the government would end up 
increasing federal revenues because there would be more economic 
activity.  Finance officials clearly pointed out in their reply 
that rarely does the government's return on such incentives 
amount to more than a fraction of the amount of taxpayer moneys 
committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the points raised in the first day of the 
standing committee's hearings on shipbuilding.  As you can tell, 
Madam Speaker, we had a vigorous and exciting debate during that 
session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee went on to hear testimony from labour 
organizations including the Canadian auto workers, the Marine 
Workers' Federation of the CAW and the ship workers union of 
Lauzon.  We were presented with a document entitled “The 
Shipbuilding Strategy for Canada” which talked about the need 
for a level playing field, emphasizing the role of the Jones Act 
in the United States in closing its markets to Canadian built 
ships. 
They offered suggestions including financing terms that would be 
similar to what the Americans have with their title XI program. 
Once again the committee had a very probing, thought provoking 
exchange with the shipbuilding industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 14 the standing committee met for a third time on 
the topic of shipbuilding to hear from industry representatives. 
The Shipbuilding Association of Canada spoke of the impact of 
subsidies on the market and the need for competitive financing 
arrangements.  He referred specifically to the title XI financing 
of the American shipbuilding industry.  The Chamber of Maritime 
Commerce spoke also about the advantages that labour practices 
and low labour rates give the shipbuilding industry in newly 
developed countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by thanking the member for bringing 
forward the motion and giving us the opportunity to debate this 
issue in the House and the opportunity for the government to put 
some of the data on the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to conclude this evening's debate. I compliment 
the members of the House who participated in the debate 
like my colleagues in the NDP. I know the member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore has been a strong 
advocate in advancing this debate.  The member from Lévis has 
been a champion for advancing the cause to have a modern 
shipbuilding policy that actually works compared to the one which 
we currently have that does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my greatest compliments go to the member for Surrey 
Central for what he essentially has done for me in the riding of 
Fundy—Royal.  He has augmented my vote by about eight to ten per 
cent.  He categorically said this evening that the shipbuilding 
industry in Canada is dead.  That was the cornerstone of his 
debate.  The result that I can go to the polls in Fundy—Royal 
and say categorically that Reform will do nothing, zero, to 
augment the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the Reform member missed the fundamental 
issue.  The cornerstone of what all 10 premiers are advocating, 
every single premier including the Progressive Conservative 
premiers Michael Harris, Ralph Klein and Bernard Lord, is tax 
reduction and an incentive based modernized shipbuilding policy 
based on reducing taxation. The problem is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have been listening to the debate and I did not want to 
raise this issue because usually we are on point but the member 
has just misquoted and misrepresented me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that is a 
matter for debate.  It is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  You are right, Madam Speaker, it is 
a point for debate and it is a wrong debate, a wrong position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone has three prongs we are advocating which are 
having a loan guarantee program, bilateral trade with the 
Americans and tax reduction.  I know Reformers are not real 
Conservatives by any means.  They do not understand what tax 
reduction is in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleagues in the Liberal Party of Canada, I know that 
they categorically want to help individuals.  We are not asking 
them to spend any amount of money, but I have to remind the hon. 
member who spoke on behalf of the Liberal government that its own 
members from Atlantic Canada are advocating the need to improve 
its shipbuilding policy that is incentive based, not subsidy 
driven, so that we can get those men and women back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, perhaps the thing I am most shocked about is the very 
fact that every single time we have had a shipbuilding motion 
before the House they have never permitted on any occasion any 
member from the Liberal caucus who has a seat in Atlantic Canada 
to actually participate in the debate.  I wonder why that is.  Is 
it because the Minister of Industry is blocking it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member from Moncton, the Minister of Labour, 
really wants to advance this particular debate.  In order to do 
so I would hope that she participates in the debate tomorrow. We 
are going to be debating shipbuilding again with respect to the 
private members' motion by the hon. member from Lévis. 
What we are doing today from a shipbuilding perspective is not 
working.  We have an unprecedented coalition of individuals who 
are looking for tax reduction, not subsidies, to modernize the 
shipbuilding industry.

that they did not support it.  They cannot make up their minds. 
Maybe in tomorrow's debate we will get a new Reform speech and 
have a new perspective in that regard.

<A NAME="LINK297">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a legislative committee of this House be instructed to 
prepare and bring in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 
68(4)(b), to remedy the weaknesses of the Privacy Act, including 
providing relief or compensation for persons who suffer as a 
result of improper disclosure of their private information and 
imposing penalties for those who wilfully violate the provisions 
of the Privacy Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hate to interrupt but I want to point out something for 
the record before we start debate on the motion. 
In his comments the PC member misrepresented the facts, so I 
want to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that we 
are now on a new private member's bill.  The other one is a thing 
of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to 
this motion and to tell the House and those people at home who 
may be watching why the motion is important and should be 
supported by the House.  I am referring to a motion that would 
require the Government of Canada to toughen up the privacy 
commission's role and responsibility in safeguarding the rights 
of Canadians and their right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian citizen has the right to the security of the 
person under our charter of rights and freedoms.  It is my 
contention, and I think most if not all members of the House 
would agree, that the security of the person would include the 
security of the private information held by government 
institutions or other institutions which could in some way 
jeopardize or prejudice the individual if the private information 
were to be distributed among the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most sensitive and private information on Canadian citizens is 
held by government institutions.  We should think about the 
tremendous amount of information Revenue Canada has on each and 
every one of us as taxpayers and about all other information held 
by government in terms of birth certificates, marriage 
certificates and so on which the government routinely collects 
from us in one way or another, largely through Revenue Canada. 
Revenue Canada is the institution most people would be most 
concerned about because it concerns financial matters, but there 
are other matters as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal body of legislation known as the Privacy Act 
safeguards the privacy of Canadian citizens.  The privacy 
commissioner and his office were established to oversee the 
administration of that act, to receive complaints from Canadians 
when they feel their privacy or their right to privacy has been 
violated, to investigate those complaints, and to make 
determinations on whether or not those allegations are well 
founded. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privacy Act is a good idea.  As a matter fact it is 
absolutely imperative to have the Privacy Act, the privacy 
commissioner and his office to field complaints from Canadian 
citizens, to investigate those complaints, to make determinations 
and to discharge those complaints to the best of their ability. I 
take no issue with the privacy commission or the privacy 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are dealing with today is not that the Privacy Act 
is deficient in the sense of defining a person's rights, what 
private information ought to be held as private, and how 
government, financial and private institutions ought to act with 
respect to information that is sensitive or is considered to be 
private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we face right now is the Privacy Act has no teeth in 
it.  In other words we have a body of legislation, and it is 
absolutely correct, which protects the rights of Canadian 
citizens and to safeguard their privacy and their right to 
privacy.  However, if anyone violates that act, even if the 
violations are wilful or intended to prejudice the individual or 
individuals involved, there are absolutely no penalties contained 
within the body of the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to reflect on how ludicrous that is.  It is the 
same as having laws that govern how we drive our vehicles.  We 
have posted speed limits and laws on how we conduct ourselves on 
the road when we operate motor vehicles.  For example, it is 
against the law to be operating a motor vehicle if one is 
impaired.  In most places in Canada it is against the law to 
operate a motor vehicle without wearing a seat belt.  It is 
against the law to be driving faster than posted speed limits. It 
is against the law to disobey stop signs.  There are penalties 
attached to each and every one of those laws and regulations. The 
penalties more or less reflect the severity of the violation or 
the potential violation of each of those regulations or laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human nature being what it is and human beings being what they 
are, we can only expect people to behave in a certain way when 
there is a real deterrent for them if they violate the laws upon 
which society is based.  In the instance of the Privacy Act where 
there are no penalties or downside to violating the act, how can 
any Canadian citizen feel good about expecting the privacy laws 
to protect him or her? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House how the lack of protection within the 
Privacy Act first came to my attention.  A couple of years ago a 
fellow in Alberta by the name of Bruce Starlight, an aboriginal 
person living on the Tsuu T'ina reserve, wrote a private letter 
to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that 
was not circulated to anyone else.  In his two page letter he 
made a number of observations and allegations with respect to 
financial mismanagement on his reserve.  In her capacity as the 
minister responsible for that department he asked her to 
investigate and determine whether or not what he was alleging was 
true.  Mr. Starlight did not receive a response to his letter 
from the minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>About two and a half or three months later he received a knock 
on his door one night.  It was somebody serving him legal notice 
that he was being sued for defamation for making allegations 
against his chief and council.  Part of the evidence of his 
allegedly making defamatory allegations against the chief and 
council was the letter he had written to the minister with her 
actual office stamp on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That private letter was received in her office in Ottawa.  To 
this day we still do not the exact trail, but it was handed back 
to the chief and council against whom the band member was making 
allegations.  It put Mr. Starlight in a very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He contacted me, as a member of parliament and as critic for 
Indian affairs and northern development, and asked for my 
assistance.  He asked “Is the government wallowed to do that? If 
I write a letter to a minister, which is considered to be a 
private matter, is the minister allowed to circulate my letter to 
anyone in a way that may possibly prejudice me, my family and my 
position in my community?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We contacted the privacy commissioner and the privacy commission 
on Mr. Starlight's behalf and posed the same question.  We asked 
the privacy commissioner to investigate.  I have to tell the 
House and anyone out there who is listening that we received 
absolute co-operation from the privacy commissioner's office and 
from the privacy commissioner himself.  We were very pleased with 
the way they responded to our requests.  We were very pleased 
with the way they conducted an investigation.  We are very 
pleased with the fact that at the end of the day they did come 
back to us and to Mr. Starlight.  They concluded in a very 
substantial way that Mr. Starlight's privacy had been compromised 
very badly by the minister of Indian affairs and her department. 
The minister of that day is currently the minister for HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner also advised us at the time that 
although there was a violation of privacy there was no penalty. 
There was no recourse for Mr. Starlight at all.  The fact that he 
was put in a very difficult situation and in a position of 
financial hardship because he ended up having to partly finance a 
legal suit out of his own pocket did not give him any recourse 
whatsoever to go back and initiate any kind of action against the 
minister of Indian affairs and/or her department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the investigation the privacy commissioner 
determined that there were at least 61 or 62 people within the 
minister's department and the higher echelons of the department 
of Indian affairs that had access to Mr. Starlight's letter.  The 
privacy commissioner determined that it would be virtually 
impossible to determine the actual culprit or culprits in the 
violation of Mr. Starlight's privacy, short of getting honest and 
truthful statements from people who were involved, which I gather 
were not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner made a number of recommendations to the 
department and to the minister for instituting better security 
surrounding correspondence.  The minister and the department made 
public statements that they would take the privacy commissioner's 
advice and tighten up security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime that does not help Mr. Starlight.  It does not 
send the right message to government institutions when they see a 
minister and a minister's office in blatant violation of the law 
with absolutely no penalty to be paid in a milieu—and it has 
been patently obvious for the last few days that this is very 
true—where ministers of the crown routinely refuse to take 
responsibility for their departments and the bungling that goes 
on. 
The minister in question in this case, who is now the minister of 
HRDC, in my estimation is incapable of taking responsibility 
simply because she is not a capable minister.  She is not in 
charge and never has been in charge of any department over which 
she has been given responsibility.  What recourse do Canadian 
citizens have in that kind of milieu where nobody wants to take 
responsibility, in a situation where the privacy commissioner 
says that there were 62 people who had access to that letter and 
nobody has taken responsibility, and the minister responsible for 
the department is not taking responsibility?

penalty attached to violations of these regulations and it has to 
be a penalty commensurate with the violation.  In other words, 
there must be real teeth in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not much wonder that government is not interested—and we 
can see that by the lack of support this motion has received from 
other members of parliament, notably on the Liberal side of the 
House—in amending the Privacy Act to include tough penalties for 
those who would violate the act.  I would suggest that most of 
the time it will be government that is actually in violation of 
its own act, in violation of its own laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the House how Canadians can possibly have faith 
in the Privacy Act and in the work of the privacy commissioner 
and how they can feel their privacy and their right to privacy is 
secure and held sacred by the Government of Canada when the laws 
have absolutely no penalties and no teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the House to make this a votable motion.  I ask 
for unanimous consent that we agree to make this a votable motion

agenda again. Since it was among the commitments made in the 
throne speech, Canada wanted a privacy act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that we were opposed to this legislation not 
because of its purpose per se, which was to give Canadians an 
act that would protect the transmission of personal information, 
but rather because of the fact that, in most cases, particularly 
in the case of Quebec where such legislation already exists, 
several areas were already covered, in fact all areas were 
already covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some areas are covered by federal legislation and others by 
provincial legislation. There will be a difficult adjustment for 
companies whose activities come, for one part, under federal 
jurisdiction and, for another part, under provincial 
legislation. But that is nothing new. We see that in so many 
areas and that will happen now with the protection of private 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a great deal of difficulty accepting the principle that, 
because no other province was taking action, Quebec was pushed 
out of a jurisdiction it was exercising.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could very well have recognized in this 
legislation the precedence of the Quebec consumer protection 
legislation. Especially since the federal government bragged 
that its legislation was very similar to the Quebec legislation, 
with a few adjustments, and that it had borrowed big chunks from 
it. If both legislation are similar, all the more reason to give 
precedence to the provincial legislation. Companies, even those 
under federal jurisdiction, and federal institutions in the 
province could then be told to abide by the provincial consumer 
protection legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A whole bunch of overlapping would have been avoided because 
the current legislation provides for a transition period. For a 
few years, the act will be only partially in force, but in time 
its scope will increase and problems will arise along the way. 
As a matter of fact part of the act is in force now while the 
rest will be later, in three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly opposed it. My colleague from Mercier initially led 
the charge on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. Several groups from 
Quebec came to testify on this bill. I am thinking about—and the 
intergovernmental affairs minister is going to accuse us once 
again of bringing out mothballs groups, but I will list a few 
of those who supported us—the chamber of notaries, the bar, 
people who cannot necessarily be accused of being part of any 
political family, let alone the sovereignist family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conseil du patronat cautioned against it. 
Quite a few groups, including trade unions, the CSN in 
particular, submitted briefs. The Quebec access to information 
commission highlighted all the potential problems and 
difficulties associated with its implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practice, some definitions are different, for example, what 
is a signature. When we talk about e-commerce, some notions which 
were defined in the civil code can now be found in the federal 
act. Their meaning is different because these two approaches—the 
one based on the civil code and the one based on the Criminal 
Code or the federal privacy legislation—are very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not trying to artificially create a problem where there 
is none. 
There are technical problems, and the groups themselves will 
have to live with that: the lawyers of the Bar, the business 
people represented by employers and the workers represented by 
central labour bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, not everyone in this group necessarily has a monopoly 
on the truth.  How did it happen, however, that we found 
ourselves in the situation—in the case of Quebec—where only the 
representatives of the Liberal Party were in favour?  Perhaps 
two or three individuals whose motives and often whose links to 
this government are questionable and who pay lip service to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was therefore very little support for this legislation in 
Quebec.  However, we understand the aim of it: that Canada be 
governed by a law since there was none outside Quebec.  However, 
I am told some provisions existed in Ontario and perhaps in some 
other provinces, which were not as extensive as the consumer 
protection act.  It is understandable for Canada to want to be 
proactive and have a law.  That said, if the other provinces do 
not want to exercise jurisdiction, that is not our problem.  And 
if the federal government thinks that it should exercise it 
instead, it should have entered into an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers of the Government of Quebec have requested 
meetings and, to my knowledge, they never even received an 
acknowledgement of receipt or nothing was done to have highly 
technical and specific discussions to see how to deal with the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a Reform Party member who, no sooner is the debate 
over, already wants to amend the act. To my knowledge—and I may 
be wrong—this legislation was supported by the Reform Party. They 
could have promoted it more when the bill was being reviewed. 
There is, among other things, this idea of compensating those 
who suffer prejudice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would this not—I am not an expert on this issue mind you—open the 
door to compensation whenever there is prejudice? When this 
happens between parties in a civil case, there are recourses for 
individuals. Now, must we systematically set out in the act that 
there will be prejudice and that compensation will be paid to 
those who suffer prejudice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second part of the motion, dealing with applicable 
penalties, this is already covered. Whether we like it or not, 
legislation already exists, and there is a penalty for failing 
to comply with its provisions. 
In fact, there is whole series of offences.

<A HREF="#LINKT108"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this motion mean with regard to penalties? How far are 
they willing to go? What does it mean in practical terms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is relatively precise in that regard. The notion of 
prejudice is new. It can be understood that it is only a matter 
of principle. The notion of sanctions or penalties already 
exists. Why is it not explained more clearly in the motion? It 
becomes difficult to support a motion the second part of which 
is vague, and probably deliberately so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, it is very difficult for us to support a motion 
aimed at amending a piece of legislation that is hard for us to 
live with. 
The fact that this piece of legislation has been adopted does 
not mean that the problems I alluded to earlier will not arise 
with regard to the different definitions in the federal 
legislation. I used signatures as an example earlier, how an 
electronic signature is defined, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there will eventually be some degree of 
harmonization, but in the meantime, it may very well be that 
consumers will not enjoy the same protection as they did before. 
When only one act applied in Quebec, businesses under federal 
jurisdiction—and I am thinking specifically about the 
telecommunications sector—complied with this act. Everybody came 
under the same legislation and it was known. Now there are two 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers will see businesses using the excuse that there is a 
transitional period, that the federal legislation will be fully 
in force in a few years, that there are two definitions, that 
things are complicated, and so on.  And there will be consumers 
who will find it all very confusing and will wonder which of the 
two pieces of legislation applies, and which protects them and 
how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very complex issue in a sector that is already complex 
and is evolving very rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these principles were defended during the committee 
proceedings, but it might have been better to debate them or to 
make amendments back then, rather than support the bill, as the 
Reform Party did when it came time to vote.  To my knowledge, we 
were almost the only ones to oppose the bill.  Today, some 
members are voicing opposition, but they had much less to say 
when it might have done the most good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that it is very hard for us to support 
this motion, which is not votable in any event, but had it been 
votable, it would have been very hard for us to support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to join the debate on Motion No. 19.  I thank the hon. 
member for Skeena for raising the issue and for bringing it 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it has enough merit to be made votable.  I would 
have liked to have seen that.  I am disappointed, as I know he 
must be, that the committee and members of the House chose not to 
allow that, which will terminate the debate after only one hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to listen carefully to understand the motivation.  I 
think I understand what the member for Skeena had in mind when he 
put this motion forward.  I find the motion vague, but I suppose 
that is the nature of motions.  It gives a general direction; not 
a specific task, as would be set out in a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the Privacy Act can be a source of frustration 
for some in that it does not have the teeth, as the member put 
it, to really change patterns of behaviour because there is no 
real discipline involved.  There is no real penalty involved for 
violations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member used the example of a motor vehicle violation. 
People would not be stopped from speeding if there were no 
penalty associated with it.  We will not get voluntary 
compliance, and that must be what the Privacy Act is relying on. 
It is asking people to change their patterns of behaviour, but 
there is no threat of consequence if they do not choose to do so 
and do something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the whole issue of data services these days.  The 
storage of data is becoming very complex.  There are huge 
personal privacy and public interest issues associated with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the worst examples that I can think of, in which the 
member would be interested, concerns the province of Manitoba. 
The previous Tory government in the province of Manitoba 
contracted out the Manitoba health data services to a private 
firm.  It was a local firm, albeit, but everyone's personal 
medical records were in the hands of a private company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was bad enough.  A lot of us did not think that was a good 
idea.  It was on a fee for service basis.  That company then 
further contracted it to Dallas, Texas. 
So now all of my personal medical records, my mother's records 
and everybody else's records in Manitoba are stored in Dallas, 
Texas.  We do not know under what circumstances.  We do not know 
if the people there sell membership lists to pharmaceutical 
companies that may want to mail a letter to a person who has a 
specific medical condition.

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that it is no one's business and there should be a 
tighter grip on very private and very personal medical 
information.  I think it is fundamentally wrong.  This is one 
example of how a person's privacy can be jeopardized by new 
technology and the way the world is moving in those directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disappointed about the incident that gave rise to 
the creation of the motion.  It was quite narrow in scope.  We 
are really talking about one individual who had a problem with 
one letter.  I am sympathetic.  I think it was wrong that the 
letter became public without the person's knowledge or consent. 
However, I also feel that if the letter was full of accusations 
about wrongdoing, people have a right to know who their accusers 
are.  It is a basic tenet of law.  It is a basic tenet of natural 
justice and fairness that we get to know who is making 
accusations about us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am not totally stressed by the idea that somewhere 
along the line the Indian band in question found out who it was 
that was essentially blowing the whistle on some alleged 
wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to another point I would like to make.  This 
incident may be better addressed through legislation trying to 
craft whistle blowing protection rather than amending the Privacy 
Act.  What Bruce Starlight was really doing, I suppose, was 
blowing the whistle on some alleged wrongdoing in the enterprise 
of which he was a part.  He must have been associated with that 
Indian band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to consider the much broader issue of 
whistle blowing when he looks into this further.  This was not a 
workplace situation.  In this case, it was blowing the whistle on 
an organization in which the person was a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a workplace, it could become even more complex.  Many recent 
incidents have surfaced where a worker comes forward, blows the 
whistle on some alleged wrongdoing in his or her workplace and 
ends up getting disciplined for it.  This is getting to be a very 
big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to believe that the public sector is a good 
employer.  I would like to think that it would welcome whistle 
blowing, that it would want to know if there is something going 
amiss in its enterprise.  Instead, the first swift and immediate 
reaction is usually to fire the person.  The employee does not 
have any recourse because it is just cause to fire someone for 
taking any steps that might be to the detriment of the operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another basic tenet of law is that there is an implied loyalty 
that is required between an employer and an employee in that 
situation.  An employee is not allowed to do anything that will 
really damage the reputation of the company or the boss. 
Therefore, when an employee comes forward and makes public facts 
that might shut that operation down or cost it money, or 
essentially blows the whistle on anything that it might be doing, 
he or she is breaching that implied loyalty of employers and 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather have seen the issue of Bruce Starlight addressed 
in the larger context of whistle blowing legislation of some 
kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking forward to the day in the not too distant future 
when that sort of thing is welcomed.  I think 35 out of the 50 
states in the United States have whistle blowing legislation that 
is very strong in their public sector.  Again, they recognize 
that a good employer probably wants to know if someone is 
pilfering money, polluting or any number of things that they 
might be doing that are not quite copacetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested to learn from the member of the Bloc Quebecois 
that the Privacy Act just underwent a comprehensive review.  I 
would have thought that would have been the time where we could 
have made amendments to the Privacy Act to try to add teeth, as 
the member said.  I do not know how that opportunity was missed 
but I did not have any personal dealings with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know most Canadians do want a Privacy Act and most Canadians 
do worry about what happens with their personal and private 
information, whether it is their credit card number or, as in the 
example I gave of the Manitoba health records in the hands of a 
private firm, and we have lost all ability to edit or control how 
that material is going to be used or if it will be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what the hon. member for Skeena tells us, there is no 
penalty if a person does breach the implied trust relationship 
that exists between my information and the person who is holding 
my information. 
I think it is a very legitimate point and makes for an 
interesting debate.  It is frustrating because these debates go 
nowhere when the item is not deemed votable.  It is only an 
academic exercise we are playing here but to raise the issue on 
the national stage is a bit of progress we can measure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the concept and I admire the member for bringing 
the issue forward, I am somewhat frustrated that it is so narrow 
in scope that it is really only addressing one individual who had 
a problem with one letter that went public.  I am not even sure 
that it was so wrong for that letter to be made public because 
somebody who is accused of doing something wrong does have a 
right to know the accuser.  The accuser also has a right to be 
free of discipline or suffer any negative consequences for 
bringing these things to people's attention.  This brings me 
again to the point that I wish this issue was dealt with within 
the context of whistleblowing, not Privacy Act amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK300"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to address the motion presented by the hon. member for Skeena 
regarding the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe that privacy implications in the new age of 
technology are important considerations.  There was a story in 
the media not too long ago about a woman whose tax information 
was publicly released because she had filed a complaint. In a 
subsequent federal court of appeal ruling about her case, the 
court struck down the disclosure rules that said such personal 
information could not be released regardless of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a prudent decision by the court and it demonstrated the 
importance of privacy and protection in this day and age.  In the 
decision there was no compensation provided to the woman whose 
privacy was inappropriately violated.  I believe this is 
appropriate. It is on this point that I think the hon. member's 
motion is flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member calls for legislation that sets out a compensation 
provision for those whose privacy is violated.  I believe that 
such an act would lead to large complications in terms of 
legalities.  This could very easily create a paradise environment 
for lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a greater degree, how does one determine or define injury as 
a result of a breach of privacy?  Does an improper disclosure of 
one's personal information warrant financial compensation?  I do 
not think in the vast majority of cases where disclosure occurs 
that the person requires financial reward because of such breach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do agree with the hon. member that there are weaknesses in the 
Privacy Act.  For instance, I believe we need to pay greater 
attention to the implications of personal and corporate privacy 
in the rapidly advancing information age in which we live. I am 
not sure that the Privacy Act in its current incarnation can 
fully address the need for protection in cyberspace and beyond. 
This is an area on which I believe we must place more emphasis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the member's motion is particularly focused on 
this area.  In a world where information is so readily and 
speedily available, I think it is vital that the Privacy Act be 
able to respond to breaches of privacy in this area much as it 
currently does in terms of government not being able to disclose 
one's tax return and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second part of the motion concerning punishing those 
who breach privacy concerns, I think there may be more weight to 
this section.  I doubt that anyone would disagree that it is 
important to ensure there are proper protections in place to 
discourage and to punish those who wilfully violate the privacy 
of another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again wonder what sort of approach the member would like to 
take on this issue.  How do we define a punishment when it is 
next to impossible to define injury in a case like this?  I would 
think that if sufficient damage was done, the individual would 
have the recourse of a libel suit or another civil pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this level I do not think we necessarily need to bring in 
legislation as the member has suggested.  Instead I believe it 
would be worth looking at more specific and in depth issues of 
privacy from the framework of technology and the exchange of 
information.  This is where people need the most protection at 
this time, where personal information can travel broadly without 
even the knowledge of the person affected.

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point I believe the member has a valid argument that 
perhaps a parliamentary committee should be struck to thoroughly 
investigate ways in which we can strengthen the protection that 
Canadians need in ensuring that their personal information 
remains just that, personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I return to the fundamental flaws in the member's approach 
to seeking greater privacy protection.  It would be quite 
dangerous to firmly set out penalties and rates of compensation 
for the acts referred to in the motion.  It sets up a legal 
framework for convicting offenders after the fact whereas what is 
most needed are preventative measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Privacy Act in its current state addresses most of 
the issues for which it was intended but I can agree with the 
motion that perhaps we could tighten it up to ensure there are no 
gaping loopholes as there were in the tax case referred to 
earlier.  Whereas the most confidential and private of personal 
information is controlled by the government, there need to be 
virtually foolproof mechanisms in place to guarantee that John 
Doe's tax return does not end up in the public domain because he 
chooses to challenge it.  This is a very important responsibility 
of the government and one that must be maintained and met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I agree that some improvements need to be made in the 
Privacy Act and that it should be a concern and perhaps priority 
of the House to visit the privacy issues in greater detail, my 
colleagues and I cannot support Motion No. M-19 because it seeks 
to create a legal reference point that overlooks the larger 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members we cannot reasonably determine what price tag to put 
on somebody's compromise.  That is an area that the courts must 
define.  What we can do is strengthen and tighten the framework 
of privacy protection by responding to the more minute details 
that are perhaps overlooked at the present time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK301"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
we have before us a motion that would lead to the establishment 
of a legislative committee of the House to prepare and bring in a 
bill to remedy what the hon. member refers to as the weaknesses 
of the Privacy Act. The bill would include relief or compensation 
for persons who suffer as a result of the improper disclosure of 
their private information and it would impose penalties for those 
who wilfully violate the provisions of the Privacy Act. Let me 
say at the outset that the Minister of Justice does not support 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two laws that affect the protection of personal 
information held by the federal government.  First, section 8 of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that everyone 
has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or 
seizure.  This section has been interpreted to deal with privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Privacy Act protects personal information collected 
by the federal government.  The Privacy Act was brought into 
force in 1983 with the agreement of all parties in the House. The 
act provides individuals with access to their personal 
information held by the federal government.  It further gives 
individuals some controls over the government's collection and 
use of this personal information.  It also protects the 
individual's privacy by limiting those who may see this personal 
information and for what purpose it might be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privacy Act sets out the principles of fair information 
practices thereby requiring the government to collect only the 
information needed to operate its programs, to collect the 
information directly from the individual concerned whenever 
possible, to tell the individual how long it will be used, to 
keep the information long enough to ensure access by the 
individual, and to take all reasonable steps to ensure the 
accuracy and completeness of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that no federal legislation is in place to 
protect personal information held by the private sector.  In 
response to concerns raised by Canadians, the government 
recognized the pressing need for statutory reform regarding the 
practices of private sector organizations in relation to personal 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1998 the Minister of Industry introduced Bill C-54, 
the personal information protection and electronic documents act, 
to address these concerns.  Bill C-54 was introduced in this 
session as Bill C-6 and was adopted by the House in October last 
year. When part I of Bill C-6 comes into force it will apply to 
organizations in the private sector and will establish their 
obligations for the protection of personal information. The 
government is very proud of Bill C-6 and of the value Bill C-6 
will add to the privacy laws in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government continues to scrutinize closely the 
developments in the area of the privacy law, part of the 
government's ongoing work is to monitor the practices and trends, 
both in the public sector and in the private sector, involving 
the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and to 
consider ways that laws relating to privacy can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion the hon. member for Skeena raises a number of 
interesting points that should be taken into account in the 
government's ongoing review of the Privacy Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, have some reservations when it comes to 
reviewing and amending the present privacy legislation.  We feel 
it would be premature to strike a legislative committee to look 
at a reform of the Privacy Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This said, the government continues to carefully monitor the 
current laws relating to the use of personal information.  Now 
that a framework for the protection of personal information is 
nearing completion with Bill C-6, improvements to federal laws 
can be considered on a more measured scale.  The government will 
ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are heard, assessed 
and weighed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have demonstrated to us that they value the protection 
of their personal information and that they appreciate the 
responsiveness of the government to their concerns.  Government 
will continue to respond to the concerns and needs of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to respond to some of the comments that have been made by 
members of the House.  I appreciate the level of debate that has 
taken place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I believe the member for Winnipeg Centre made the 
suggestion that maybe it was not wrong and he did not have too 
much of a problem with the fact that a member of an aboriginal 
band in Alberta wrote a letter to the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and that letter was leaked back to the 
chief and council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the member and for the benefit of other 
members of the House—and it may not be understood by members—a 
letter to a minister of the crown written by an individual is 
considered to be privileged information, the same as any letter 
received by any one of us from one of our constituents is 
considered to be privileged information.  As members of 
parliament we do not take that information and share it with the 
press or with other individual constituents, unless we have 
expressly received permission to do so by the original author of 
those letters or those communications.  That is considered to be 
privileged information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not up to the member for Winnipeg Centre or anybody else 
to make judgments about whether it was the right thing to do. 
The fact is, that is the law and the law was violated, and it was 
violated by members of the minister's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to the debate I heard talk from other members and 
other parties about Bill C-6 and the government's initiatives 
with respect to the Privacy Act.  I say to hon. members, and the 
parliamentary secretary in particular, that is all fine and well, 
but the parliamentary secretary would know that Bill C-6 is 
designed specifically with the private sector in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 does nothing to address the concerns and the rights of 
individuals with respect to private information that is held by 
government institutions, and in this case by federal government 
institutions.  There is no institution or organization that holds 
more personal private information on Canadian citizens than the 
federal Government of Canada.  Therefore, it is the federal 
Government of Canada that this legislation is targeted toward, or 
ought to be targeted toward, more than any other organization. 
That is not to say that the private sector and the initiatives in 
Bill C-6 are not good initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the concerns that some institutions in the private 
sector have access to tremendous amounts of private information 
and I share the view that those private institutions ought to be 
responsible for the private information they hold and ought to be 
held accountable in law when they willfully break the privacy 
rights of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also respond to the parliamentary secretary, who said 
that it is difficult to ascertain what damages may be awarded 
when violations occur.  Maybe it was the member from the 
Progressive Conservative Party who said that.  I am not sure. 
I certainly would not want to attribute comments to the 
parliamentary secretary if in fact it was somebody else.  However, 
I would say this.  There are many instances in law where it is 
difficult to determine actual damages when there have been wilful 
violations.  I use as an example the laws with respect to 
defamation, slander and libel.  It is often difficult, if not 
impossible, to determine what actual financial harm has been done 
when one individual wilfully defames, slanders or libels another 
citizen.  I do say, though, that as difficult as it might be for 
the courts to make those determinations, they are granted that 
purview and do their best to discharge that duty.  The mere fact 
that there are penalties ascribed in law to people who would 
wilfully slander or libel is a tremendous deterrent and it makes 
us much more responsible as individuals when it comes to 
considering how we are going to conduct ourselves.  That is why 
it is imperative that the Privacy Act be amended, that teeth be 
put into it so that there are real, tough and strict penalties 
that are attached to violations of those laws so that Canadians 
can feel much more secure about private information that is held 
concerning them, in particular private information that is held 
by the Government of Canada, but by other institutions as well.

<P><A NAME="LINK305"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, four months ago I stood in the House asking for a 
commitment to a national child care program and received a 
half-baked answer about how the government supposedly tried and 
was stopped by provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if the government had the will to do so, it 
could implement a national child care program right now. Instead, 
the government has tried to pass the buck of responsibility as it 
has with many other programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the 150,000 spaces for children in child care 
that was promised in 1993?  The government promised $720 million 
for child care in 1993, but it has in fact cut spending.  In too 
many provinces, like my home province of Nova Scotia, the child 
tax benefit is clawed back when families' main source of income 
is social assistance, a perverse attempt at addressing poverty 
which has ensured that the needs of children in poor families 
have not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister and the Liberal government really took the 
needs of children seriously, they would know that the parents of 
these children have clearly stated that a federally funded 
national child care program is what both the children of Canada 
and their parents need to start off on the right path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal double-talk on child care is just one more example of 
how the government has been saying one thing and doing another. 
Over four months ago the government made a speech about how 
children would be a priority in the 2000 budget.  But what has it 
done over the last six years in power?  Broken promise after 
broken promise has meant simply more poverty and more poor 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree on the benefits to children of quality care in and 
outside their homes in their early years.  We all agree that 
children are a priority.  We all know that money exists to make a 
national child care program a reality.  We all know that the only 
reason we do not have such a program is because of the lack of 
will and commitment to Canada's children shown by the Liberal 
government in its race to the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the mother of two children and as a Canadian I think it is 
unacceptable that only 9% of children in need of care have access 
to regulated child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would ask the government when it will finally agree that 
we need a federally funded national child care program and when 
it will commit to a date when it will provide access to quality, 
affordable child care for all of Canada's children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
question of the member which has come back a couple of times 
indicates to me that this member does not really understand the 
federal-provincial arrangements through which this country is 
governed co-operatively by both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that if the government had the will it could 
implement a national child care program right now.  That is 
simply and purely incorrect.  The federal government could not 
implement such a program because caring for children is part of 
the responsibility of the provinces.  We simply could not do it 
without provincial co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also asked what happened to the 150,000 child care spaces 
that were promised in the 1993 red book.  We fulfilled that 
promise when we came forward with an offer to set aside $400 
million and asked the provinces to come forward and use that 
money to build child care spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  You asked the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  Yes, we invited the provinces.  Not one 
province came forward and said “Yes, we want to build this 
program with you”.  After a time, the money was set aside from 
that program because no one stepped up to the plate to use it. 
That is what happened to the 150,000 spaces that were suggested 
in the red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Speech from the Throne in the fall indicated that this 
government has no higher priority as a government than children. 
But that statement does not lead directly to the establishment of 
a national child care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that while parents have the primary responsibility 
for the care of their children, raising the next generation is 
everyone's concern.  We know that early childhood development and 
care is essential to raising healthy children.  That is why early 
childhood development is a key theme in the national children's 
agenda through which—

interrupt the hon. member as the time has run out.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
