</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-27, an act to amend the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada Shipping Act to enable 
Canada to implement the Agreement for the Implementation of the 
Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management 
of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and 
other international fisheries treaties or arrangements, be read 
the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a rather unique moment in Canada's history.  As a follow 
up to the initiative taken by the Prime Minister of Canada 
yesterday in calling up the greatest hockey player ever and 
encouraging him to stay on, I would like to seek unanimous 
consent to put the following motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would move that, in the opinion of the House, Wayne Gretzky 
should not retire but should play one more season in the National 
Hockey League.  However, in the event that he decides to retire, 
then consideration should be given to appointing Wayne Gretzky as 
Canada's ambassador for hockey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, as much as probably all 
of us agree with the sentiments expressed in the motion, we 
cannot agree to have a motion of the House incite someone to 
making career changes or choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Gretzky makes his decision, should we want to 
congratulate him by way of a motion, I am sure all of us would 
want to do that then, but I do not think we can accept the motion 
as presently worded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  As there is no 
consent at this point we will proceed to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to 
rise today in support of Bill C-27, which will enable Canada to 
ratify the United Nations agreement on the conservation and 
management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory 
species, commonly known as the UN Fisheries Agreement, or UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act.  When Bill C-27 is passed and these acts are 
amended, Canada will then be in the position to ratify the United 
Nations agreement and the UNFA will then provide an important 
tool for the protection of straddling stocks and highly migratory 
fish stocks.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the legislation has reached this final stage 
of approval by the House.  It has been a long process but the 
outcome will be well worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we have passed Bill C-27 
and have ratified the UN fish agreement, we will then have 
increased moral authority to encourage other states to ratify 
the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can get on with the job of seeing that this and other 
international agreements to conserve the world's fisheries are 
brought into force and implemented. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to remind the House of some of the 
history which demonstrates the need for international action to 
deal with overfishing of straddling and highly migratory fish 
stocks and which eventually led to the development of UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background we need to go back to 1977 when Canada, as 
did many other nations, established the 200 mile exclusive 
fishing zone.  It is important to note that Canada's continental 
shelf extends beyond the 200 mile limit and thus fish stocks 
straddle the limit.  This geographic situation has been a cause 
for concern for Canada even before the fishing zone line was 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1979 NAFO, or the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, 
was created to take responsibility and to protect fish stocks in 
the northwest Atlantic beyond Canada's 200 mile limit.  This was 
followed by the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, known as UNCLOS, which was open to signature in 
1982 and which came into force in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNCLOS provides coastal states with the exclusive sovereign 
right to explore, exploit, conserve and manage fisheries within 
the 200 nautical miles from their shore.  However, it only 
provides general rules for co-operation and management of the 
straddling and the highly migratory stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the advantages and the advances of NAFO and UNCLOS, 
overfishing by vessels continued outside Canada's 200 mile limit 
in the northwest Atlantic.  This contributed to the decline of 
straddling groundfish stocks of cod, flatfish and turbot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, in response to scientific evidence of a serious decline 
in fish stocks, Canada began a major campaign to end overfishing 
in the northwest Atlantic.  For example, in 1990 Canada hosted a 
conference on high seas fishing in St. John's, Newfoundland.  We 
had experts there from coastal states around the world trying to 
design new principles for high seas fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development, the Earth Summit at Rio, Canada won international 
support for the convening of a conference for the negotiation of 
new arrangements to establish comprehensive rules for the 
conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory 
fish stocks on the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN Fisheries Agreement was concluded in August 1995 and 
Canada was one of the first countries to sign.  To date, 21 
states have ratified the UNFA.  This agreement requires 30 
ratifications to enter into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this time the international community developed other 
instruments to deal with similar problems in the fishery. For 
example, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations, FAO, developed the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible 
Fisheries and the FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with 
International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing 
Vessels on the High Seas, which is fortunately known by the more 
convenient term as the Compliance Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House are well aware of much of this material so 
I will not go into detail.  I will only say that the FAO 
Compliance Agreement and the FAO Code of Conduct are significant 
steps toward greater fisheries conservation, but the United 
Nations Fisheries Agreement that we are discussing today is by 
far the most important tool that we could have.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is UNFA so valuable?  It sets up a new legal framework which 
will provide the effective monitoring, compliance and 
enforcement needed to protect straddling and highly migratory 
fish stocks on the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proper conservation and management of these stocks will make a 
significant contribution to ensure the sustainability of this 
important food source for future generations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will probably be one of the most important international 
issues that faces the world in the 21st century.  If we do not 
take adequate steps to protect stocks of fish in the high seas, 
within 20 or 30 years, indeed, within our children's lifetime and 
perhaps our own we will see more than half the world's surface 
cease to be a source of protein in food for human kind.  Half the 
world's surface will become a desert from the point of view of 
feeding human kind.  That is the issue.  That is why it is so 
important to work in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at some of the main sections of the 
agreement.  First, under general principles, the UNFA provides 
guiding principles for the conservation and management of 
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.  These include the 
precautionary principle whereby states must be more cautious in 
their fisheries, scientific conservation and management decisions 
when information about the fishery is uncertain, unreliable or 
inadequate; compatibility between measures applied inside and 
outside a coastal state's waters to ensure that measures adopted 
by a coastal state in its waters for straddling fish stocks are 
not undermined by measures applicable to the high seas; the use 
of the best scientific evidence available to determine resource 
status; and the minimization of pollution, waste, discards and 
bycatch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to stress is the obligation to 
co-operate.  This is an international area and international 
co-operation is essential.  The United Nations fisheries 
agreement reiterates the law of the sea obligations for parties 
to co-operate in the conservation and management of straddling 
and highly migratory fish stocks either directly or through 
regional fisheries organizations and arrangements.  For Canada, 
the two key organizations are the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization, NAFO, which I mentioned earlier, and the 
international convention for the conservation of Atlantic tuna, 
those highly migratory stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UNFA also sets out general principles and obligations 
regarding the setting up, functioning and strengthening of 
regional fisheries organizations and provides rules concerning 
the participation of states in such organizations.  As we know, 
the problem of non-members bedevils agreements of this type. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNFA provides specific rules with respect to non-members of 
regional fisheries organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, UNFA binds the parties to co-operate in the management 
and conservation of straddling or highly migratory fish stocks, 
whether or not they belong to a given regional fisheries 
organization.  Vessels whose flag states are party to UNFA are 
bound by that organization's conservation and management 
measures even if they are not party to the organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to transparency, UNFA has provisions to oblige 
regional fisheries organizations to be transparent in their 
decision-making and other activities. 
Intergovernmental organizations and NGOs that are concerned with 
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks will now have an 
opportunity for observer participation in meetings of these 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some organizations—ICCAT for example—have already established 
guidelines for their participation.  NAFO and others are 
considering proposals to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation is a very important principle when it comes to 
science and management.  UNFA reiterates the UNCLOS principle 
that states have a duty to co-operate in the conservation and 
management of fishing resources. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, this means that states undertake an obligation to 
co-operate in exchanging and sharing scientific, technical and 
statistical data and information concerning straddling and 
highly migratory fish stocks, and also co-operate in finding the 
right solutions for sustainable management of the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNFA requires flag states to undertake measures to ensure that 
their vessels comply with regional conservation and management 
measures and do not engage in activities that undermine the 
effectiveness of such measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNFA offers a strong compliance and enforcement regime, a regime 
which allows states other than the flag state to take action, 
such as boarding and inspecting a vessel flying the flag of 
another state that is party to UNFA, without prior authorization 
of the flag state, to ensure that vessels are complying with 
conservation and enforcement measures developed by regional 
fisheries organizations.  These provisions are an important step 
towards prevention of overfishing of stocks that straddle 
Canada's 200-mile limit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth point is the dispute settlement procedures.  Finally, 
there are compulsory and binding dispute settlement procedures. 
These procedures are established for disputes which arise out of 
the interpretation or the application of the United Nations 
fisheries agreement or regional fisheries agreements, such as the 
NAPO convention which I mentioned before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNFA refers to the procedures set out in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which will apply to states that 
are party to the United Nations fisheries agreement whether or 
not they are parties to the law of the sea agreement.  This is a 
very useful technique which provides states that are parties to 
the UNFA with an effective way to resolve disputes concerning the 
conservation and management of those straddling and highly 
migratory fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-flag state enforcement regime and the compulsory and 
binding dispute settlement procedure of the UNFA make it the 
strongest existing international regime applicable to the high 
seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a word on the need for this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merits of UNFA are clear.  Now we need to adopt Bill C-27 in 
order for Canada to be able to fully implement the agreement. 
Existing legislation is, for the most part, sufficient to allow 
Canada to implement the 1995 agreement. There are, however, some 
gaps.  Bill C-27 is intended to allow Canada to assert the rights 
meet the obligations set out in the agreement.  By design 
it goes no further than that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked hard.  When I talk of hard work I would like to 
pay special tribute to the hon. member from Malpeque for his 
dedicated work in this House and in committee.  We would not be 
here with the possibility of this bill without his untiring 
dedication.  I believe that this should be recognized by all 
members of the House on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Malpeque and other members of the fisheries 
committee, as well as members of this House from coastal ridings, 
have worked hard to ensure that the bill is fully consistent with 
the agreement.  We will implement this legislation in a manner 
that is fully consistent with our rights and obligations under 
the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>States that accede to the agreement and honour the obligations 
that it sets out have nothing to fear from this legislation.  We 
will fully respect the safeguards that are set out in the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Differences that arise, such as whether the obligations have 
been honoured, will be negotiated between states, resolved within 
the framework established by the regional fisheries organizations 
or, as a last resort, submitted to compulsory and binding dispute 
settlement.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For ourselves and states which accede to and honour the 
obligations set out in the agreement, the confrontations of the 
past will happily be relegated to the pages of history.  In our 
view the agreement, once ratified by ourselves and our fishing 
partners, will make an important contribution to conservation, a 
sustainable fishery and constructive relations between states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the bill is passed and subordinate regulations are made, 
Canada will be in a position to ratify the UNFA, and I stand to 
state on behalf of the Government of Canada that we will ratify 
the UNFA when that stage is achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compliance and enforcement regime is the only part of the 
UNFA that needs to be implemented by the adoption of new 
legislation.  That is why we introduced Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has already begun to implement the agreement.  At home we 
are reviewing our domestic and foreign fishing policies to verify 
that all of them are in compliance with the principles and rules 
of the agreement.  Internationally we are working to implement 
the UNFA principles and rules within the regional fisheries 
organizations to which we belong, such as the International 
Convention on the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna and the Northwest 
Atlantic Fisheries Organization, as well as through our 
participation and negotiations to create new regional fisheries 
organizations, particularly in the western and central Pacific. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the general adoption and implementation of 
these guiding principles and rules by which regional fisheries 
organizations operate will improve the way we manage the world's 
fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we have ratified UNFA, Canada can be a leader in urging 
others to ratify it and to implement its principles, rules and 
values, both within their jurisdiction and within regional 
fisheries organizations throughout the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot solve the problems of the world's fisheries alone, but 
Canada intends to be a leader.  With the UNFA and the other tools 
at our disposal, and with the co-operation of our fishing 
partners, we can bring an end to the destructive and wasteful 
fishing practices of the past, and we must do that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge the House to move quickly to adopt Bill C-27.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, we are seeing an unprecedented situation.  Never 
before in the history of mankind have we seen our fish stocks 
being decimated in such a rapid fashion.  Not only have we seen 
them decimated, indeed they are becoming extinct.  From the east 
coast of Canada to South Africa and to the west coast of Africa 
to southeast Asia we are seeing fish stocks all over the world 
damaged and destroyed by overfishing, habitat destruction and 
pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, as the minister said in his speech, we have in 
front of us an enormous challenge.  How do we provide fish and 
fish species not only for our families to enjoy but for future 
generations?  From a morale perspective, how do we ensure that 
these creatures, which have been on the earth longer than people, 
continue to exist in the future?  Therein lies the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To articulate the problem will take a long time, but we must 
start.  We have seen the raping and pillaging of our fish stocks 
all over the world in an unprecedented fashion.  International 
communities and governments have been unable to put together a 
framework with teeth to address this situation.  That is what 
this bill was supposed to do.  That is what the international 
agreement was for.  Unfortunately, while this bill goes part of 
the way, it does not have teeth to properly address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing fish stocks diminishing and becoming extinct all 
over the world.  This is a serious problem for all of us. 
We are also seeing radionuclide cancer causing agents, 
teratogenic agents, being increased through the food chain.  We 
are finding them not only in small fish but also in larger fish 
and indeed large mammals.  If we look at the beluga whale 
population in the eastern part of Canada, we see an unprecedented 
amount of cancer causing agents within their body masses.  If we 
look to the north and see the aboriginal people who live there 
and consume a large amount of fish in their diet, we see an 
unprecedented amount of these cancer causing teratogenic agents.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not many people are talking about this, as I know the member 
from the other side who is from the north will articulate, but 
the tragic manifestation of that is that we have found in their 
populations an unprecedented number of babies born with birth 
defects, people suffering from cancers at levels that we have not 
seen in other populations, and numbers which are a silent tragedy 
not only within our own country but in other countries that share 
the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this week there were representatives from Russia here, 
many of whom were from parts of northern Russia such as Siberia 
and Irkutsk.  Their aboriginal communities are suffering from 
unprecedented levels of these cancer causing agents.  Their 
people are suffering from these cancers and birth defects.  It is 
a silent tragedy and is a direct result of the pollution that has 
been dumped in the oceans of the world, affecting all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see pillaging by large boats that are going around the world 
laying nets even in spite of international laws.  These groups 
show a wilful disregard for the fish stocks that exist today. 
They will do whatever it takes to pillage and take whatever they 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the challenges of Bill C-27 and one of the challenges of 
the UNCLOS was to put teeth into a document that will be able to 
address these pirates of the high seas.  In no uncertain terms 
they will have penalties applied to them so that they cannot 
continue to engage in the rape of our oceans which affects all of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Destruction of the habitat is also occurring not only within the 
oceans but also on land.  In my province of British Columbia we 
have a hodge-podge situation.  The province is responsible for 
part of the environment and the feds for the other.  There is 
very little co-ordination.  As a result deforestation is taking 
place to the edge of the rivers, which is destroying crucial and 
critical salmon habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our response should be to create a system working with the 
provinces to ensure that it does not happen.  We also have a 
situation on private lands where individuals have the ability to 
engage in, and do engage in, the wilful destruction of habitat on 
those lands, often high up in the river system.  This has a 
profound and damaging effect on the entire river system, 
destroying habitat that is crucial for salmon species in 
particular to be able to breed.  This serious situation has 
occurred for a long time and the minister has been unable or 
unwilling to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector would be very interested in working with the 
government to provide an equitable solution to ensure that the 
habit is protected and that the interest in personal land is 
respected.  They are not mutually exclusive principles.  We can 
have personal ownership and still have the ability to protect the 
land and the resources.  When an individual's actions has a 
profound and damaging effect on the entire ecosystem, it should 
not be allowed but is going on right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the most important things that has led to the 
destruction of the salmon fishery on the west coast.  It is not 
necessarily overfishing, which has had a profound effect, but it 
is the damage of the habit.  The desecration of habitat is the 
single most profound factor in the destruction and decimation of 
our salmon species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is clearly within the purview of the federal government and 
the provincial government.  My colleague, the critic for 
fisheries from Saanich—Gulf Islands, and my other colleague from 
Delta, both of whom have worked very hard to provide constructive 
solutions to the minister, need to be listened to.  Their 
solutions need to be employed.  The minister needs to work with 
his provincial counterparts to make this a reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that can be done.  Let us look at how fishermen 
are suffering.  Right now the government has made promises and 
these promises have been broken.  I will give the House some 
examples of what it has been doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from a constituent which was written to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  It articulates very clearly 
how the transitional job fund that has been put forth by the 
minister and promised by the minister is simply not doing its 
job.  It reads in part as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the announcement made by the minister on June 19, 1998, 
very little has been resolved for displaced fisheries workers. Of 
the $100 million promised for licence buyback measures, only 
$23.4 million is accounted for. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A letter from the minister dated March 9, 1999, sent to me by my 
colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands, states that of the $100 
million for habitat protection laid out and promised by the 
minister only $6.5 million has actually been paid out.  Some 6.5% 
of the total amount of money designated for the critical 
reclamation of habitat has been paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final $200 million as promised aid according to the 
minister's letter is only being paid out at $41.7 million or 
20.8% of the money.  The rest, nearly 80%, has not been paid out. 
This means that since the minister promised the money to be 
forthcoming to fisherman and their communities over nine months 
ago, less than 18% of the promised moneys has been paid out to 
fishermen, their families and their communities.  These people 
are suffering.  They are in his province.  They are in my 
province.  They need help.  They do not want handouts but they 
certainly want to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the projects that are being put forth and funded by the 
transitional job fund are not very useful for ensuring that the 
people working in the fishing community will have another long 
term sustainable job to go to, not a short term make work project 
by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are solutions, some of which I will articulate.  These 
solutions would fulfil what we all want to see.  We want to see 
the rejuvenation of fish and their habitat in a long term 
sustainable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things for which we have been pushing for years is 
fish farming.  Many years ago Canada was a leader in fish 
farming.  What happened was that Chile and Norway usurped us and 
now are world leaders in fish farming.  Norway in particular does 
it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the example of Norway to see what it did 
right.  Within fish farming lie jobs that people currently in the 
fishing communities who are unable to work at their traditional 
roles can go into instead of trying to make fishermen information 
technology specialists and computer specialist with an eight week 
course when they are in their forties and fifties and have over 
20 years of experience fishing.  As they say, it ain't going to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can train them and put them into jobs that may not be exactly 
what they have done before but would certainly be congruent with 
what they have traditionally done.  To train them or to ask them 
to map rivers and streams that have been mapped a dozen times 
before is clearly an expensive make work project.  Why not give 
them the skills to do the work within fish farming, which could 
create a lot of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we have proposed for years a hatchery on the Sooke 
River.  This hatchery in a community with over a 20% unemployment 
rate could create over $90 million in spinoff benefits and 
hundreds of jobs.  In the community of Sooke 200 or 300 jobs 
would have a profound, dramatic and positive impact on people's 
lives.  They would be working in something close to the land. 
Both aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities would be provided 
a mesh or a linkage between them, which would do a lot for 
developing peace and harmony between communities that are 
fighting over a diminishing resource.  We must look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is Iceland which has done a remarkable job of 
saving its fish.  It has a long term sustainable fishing 
industry. 
When Iceland representatives approached Canada some years ago 
they came with open hands and said that they would work with us 
to rebuild our fishery on the east coast.  What did they get? 
Indifference and a cold shoulder from a country that has been a 
leader in the fishing industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a country, particularly our east coast, desperately needed 
help.  We desperately needed a plan to revise, revamp and 
rejuvenate the economy but got absolutely nothing.  Now we see 
the payoff for that neglect.  We see communities on the east 
coast suffering and relying more and more on government handouts 
and less and less on the ability to provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has not only damaging effects on them as individuals but 
profound and damaging effects on their economy and communities. 
The social fabric of the communities on the east coast has been 
torn apart as it is being torn apart on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are solutions.  I am not for a moment advocating what has 
taken place in southeast Asia which has engaged in fish farming 
that has been absolutely destructive to its environment.  We do 
not need to adopt that, but we need to open our eyes and look at 
countries around the world which have done an excellent job of 
saving their fish and providing a long term sustainable fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to Iceland for a second.  It tries to focus on 
getting the maximum value per fish.  As a result it has managed 
to ensure that each fish caught, particularly in a sports fishing 
capacity, generates an awful lot of money.  I believe it is $80 
to $100 per fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the difficult times of today with the difficult decisions 
that have to be made what I will say is politically incorrect but 
in my view needs to be discussed.  Less reliance has to be put on 
purse seiners, on those large fishing vessels that vacuum the 
ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister wants to buy back.  The process he is engaged in, 
the so-called Mifflin plan, will centralize fishing in a very 
small number of hands.  Those hands will be the big boats.  The 
argument they will put forth is that by having fewer boats fewer 
fish will be caught.  That is not true and the reason is that the 
technology of today will merely expand to fit the boats. These 
boats can catch much more than they do. They just need the 
opportunity to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mifflin plan is destroying and taking away the fishery from 
small individual operators and putting it into the hands of large 
fishing boats, many of which are owned by the large fishing 
corporations and packing groups.  Does that do much for 
employment?  No.  Does it do much for increasing value added fish 
products?  No, it does not.  We should be striving for maximum 
value and maximum employment in a sustainable fashion for the 
fishing industry in Canada.  That is not what the government's 
plan is doing and that is not what is happening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be done.  The government has heard from from my 
colleagues from Saanich—Gulf Islands and from Delta—South 
Richmond constructive, effective and pragmatic solutions to deal 
with the problem.  All we have had is basically a blind eye.  I 
will give the minister credit.  He had a lot of courage this year 
in closing down some fisheries and in the process saving some 
species.  For that he ought to be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to protect our fish, which came to light a few years 
ago, enforcement is critical.  DFO enforcement officers are 
beside themselves.  They try to enforce the laws but people 
higher up in DFO have meddled in their affairs and prevented them 
from doing that.  As a result the best enforcement officers, if 
they have been doing their jobs, have in fact been marginalized 
and those who have played the party game in the bureaucracy have 
advanced.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DFO bureaucracy has been pulling the teeth of the 
enforcement officers preventing them from enforcing the law, 
which is a complete outrage.  Strong enforcement of our present 
laws and the respect of the minister, deputy minister and the 
people high up in the echelon are needed so that the enforcement 
officers will be supported and protected in doing their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientists in DFO have to be supported and encouraged 
because whatever plans we have must be based on good science. 
Over the last few years in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
and with this Liberal government politics has overridden good 
science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the cod fishery on the east coast.  A couple 
of years ago cod stocks were shown to be increasing a bit.  What 
did the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans do?  The minister said 
he would open it up for a limited cod fishery in spite of the 
fact that the scientists had said we were having an increase in 
our cod but to do nothing and let it ride a bit so the numbers 
could increase. For purely political reasons prior to the last 
election the then minister opened up the fishery.  He destroyed 
the ability of the cod fishery to sufficiently expand and have a 
long term sustainable fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It speaks of a problem the scientists have been having in DFO 
for a long time. In spite of their hard work and diligence, in 
spite of their tenacity in finding the best solutions possible, 
the mucky-mucks on top and the politicos kept their answers and 
solutions under wrap.  They forced the scientists not to say 
anything and rapped them on the knuckles when they did. That is 
idiotic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those studies are funded by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer has a 
right to know what they are.  As a result I would submit to the 
minister that all scientific studies done by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans be made public.  All interested parties 
could then look at them and know what is going on on the ocean 
floor. Everybody would know the number of fish there, the 
projected fish stocks, what we need to do to save them and what 
we might be able to do in terms of fishing them sustainably. 
These are things we have to determine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of fish that are going to be pulled out have to be 
based on sustainable quotas and the quotas have to be based on 
good hard science.  They cannot be based on politics.  Politics 
has killed our fishery historically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have enormous challenges ahead of us not only within the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans but also in the policies we 
enact domestically and internationally.  The minister's speech 
indicates that he is very interested in this issue.  I know he is 
very interested in stopping the habitat destruction, the 
pollution and the other elements of overfishing that have gone 
into destroying not only our fish stocks but the fish stocks of 
many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polluters in our country and around the world are continuing to 
dump damaging toxic carcinogenic materials into our oceans.  This 
has long term and profound effects not only on fish but also on 
mammals.  The minister must work with the Minister of the 
Environment to implement tough laws, laws which have teeth, to 
penalize those individuals who are wilfully polluting our oceans, 
rivers and streams. At the present time many polluters at best 
get a rap on the knuckles and at worst nothing. Because of short 
staffing in both the Department of the Environment and the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans these things are simply not 
enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-27 and the UN convention on the law of 
the sea, one of our great challenges on both the east and west 
coasts is the foreign fishing vessels which come into our waters, 
pillage our fish and then escape outside the 200 mile zone. 
Unless some rigid specifications are met, our interdiction 
officers cannot apprehend these boats once they get outside the 
200 mile zone.  That should not happen.

no lines indicating “this is ours and that is yours”.  The 
pollution and damage that takes place in the oceans affects all 
of us.  We can no longer turn a blind eye and let it continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I implore the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to 
work with the Minister of the Environment and the provincial 
ministers to develop constructive plans, as he has heard here 
from across party lines, to address pollution, habitat 
destruction and overfishing.  Without those, we will not have a 
fishery in the ocean and species will become extinct.  All 
species will suffer.  Not only will it be the fish in the sea 
that suffer, but we will suffer as well.

community has been devastating, bringing many challenges.  The 
Canadian Hemophilia Society provides support and services to 
Canadians who live with the disease.  The society has responded 
to the increased challenges with programs and services that 
endeavour to meet the needs of all persons living with hemophilia 
and those also infected with hepatitis C and/or HIV-AIDS.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Nisga'a treaty is winding its way through the B.C. 
legislature.  The NDP government is ramming it through using 
something the Liberals are well familiar with:  closure.  The 
federal Liberals have indicated they intend to ram it through 
parliament, likely using closure as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these two governments right or wrong?  I guess that depends 
on your point of view.  If these governments are dictatorships, 
then I guess they can do whatever they want.  However, if they 
are a democracy, they have to listen to the people, a rather 
bothersome concept for both of these parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the people of B.C. saying?  Three regional plebiscites 
on the Nisga'a treaty have all rejected it by over 90%.  The 25 
public meetings I held in my riding indicate the same level of 
rejection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians want aboriginal issues settled, but in a 
manner that works for all.  A treaty that places aboriginal 
assets and powers in the hands of a few does not benefit most 
aboriginal members.  A treaty that provides special benefits to a 
few on the basis of race does not resolve past differences for 
anyone.  If the Liberals want to end western alienation, they had 
better start listening to the people of the west, all of them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the United Nations has designated 1999 as the International Year 
of Older Persons. 
Canada has one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world. 
In 1951 less than 10% of the population was over 65 years of age, 
but 30 years from now, we can expect one in five Canadians to be 
over 65.

help to spouses, children, grandchildren, friends and neighbours. 
An estimated 23% of Canadian seniors contribute some time each 
week to unpaid volunteerism and the value of that volunteerism is 
estimated to be as much as $2.3 billion per year.  Seniors are 
also the largest per capita donors to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few of the reasons why it is appropriate for 
1999 to have been designated the International Year of Older 
Persons.  This is our year and our special opportunity to honour 
and thank our seniors for their special contribution to the lives 
of all Canadians from sea to sea to sea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
whenever a Chinese leader visits Canada there is always the 
public discussion of human rights in China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue and needs to be discussed. However, 
the debate often obscures another reality in China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was brought home to me last week when I visited a small 
rural village in the mountains of Guangdong province in southern 
China. There I met a young woman who told me a story about 
Premier Zhu Rongi, when he first became premier, who, when he saw 
the poverty that so many Chinese live in, said, with tears in his 
eyes, “What kind of premier am I that our people live in such 
poverty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, Premier Zhu is working hard to bring decent health 
care to rural China.  He insists that all children get an 
education and he strives every day to create the conditions that 
will give those children a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a perspective that is not often heard in North America 
and one that we should consider when we rush to condemn.

<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have very serious concerns on the U.S. administration's proposed 
fee for the use of the U.S. customs' automated system.  Canada 
moves by truck.  Close to 80% of merchandise trade with the 
United States is by road.  Members in the Chamber appreciate that 
this fee, being considered to help fund a much needed upgrade of 
automated commercial operations, would increase the cost of 
Canadian exports to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge the need for and efficiency of upgraded automated 
commercial operations.  Indeed, it has become an essential and 
vital component of international trade.  Goods and the 
information associated with them must travel quickly to respond 
to the needs of just in time inventory management systems and the 
pressures of global competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the proposed new levy would be a customs user fee of 
the type that is prohibited by Article 310 of NAFTA and therefore 
inconsistent with U.S. obligations under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Minister of International Trade and the Canadian 
ambassador in Washington for registering our strong opposition 
and urge them to vigorously continue this challenge.  Canadian 
traders deserve nothing less.

as a former health care practitioner and now as a member of 
parliament from Saskatchewan, I am appalled by the undemocratic 
and arrogant action taken by NDP Premier Roy Romanow to end the 
nurses strike in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While refusing to represent the interests of health care 
workers, the Saskatchewan government has rammed through back to 
work legislation in just six hours.  Now the NDP is threatening 
the provinces nurses with fines and jail time if they do not 
comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of Saskatchewan's NDP premier are causing hospital 
closures and forcing patients to seek treatment out of province. 
This is because the NDP will not bargain in good faith with 
nurses and the government refuses to enter binding arbitration. 
Consequently, nurses are being forced to accept unfair wages.  As 
a result, the nursing shortage and poor working conditions will 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully Saskatchewan voters, just like their counterparts did 
in Ontario and as they will soon do in British Columbia, will 
vote to remove yet another out of touch, socialist NDP 
government.

the needs and aspirations of various aboriginal communities,

</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the superficial changes made over the past 30 years, 
there has never been a concrete and effective plan of action to 
reverse this tendency, which leads directly to the integration 
of hundreds of thousands of francophones in Canada.

all the reports indicate that the Canadian forces in the Balkans 
are doing the job they have been asked to do and they are doing 
it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our CF fighters thus far have flown over 100 sorties against the 
Serb forces.  Prior to the war the Department of National Defence 
allotted $103 million for the purchase of precision guided air to 
surface missiles.  One hundred sorties represents a lot of 
ammunition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much new money has the Minister of National Defence budgeted 
to replace the depleting stocks to make sure our pilots can 
continue their NATO commitments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not have the figure with me, but obviously the 
funds necessary to carry out the mission to help the people of 
Kosovo return to their homes will have to be found and allotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member's language means that in spite of the 
negative comments by his finance critic we will have the support 
of the Reform Party to enable our forces to have the funds to do 
the job required. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister knows full well that he has the support of the 
Reform Party when it comes to the issue of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am simply asking this question of the defence minister.  The 
budget for defence is about $9.5 billion.  New money has to be 
found for this war effort.  Where is it coming from and how much 
has been assigned? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the incremental costs 
for the deployment of the 12 CF-18s, the ones that are over there 
now, for six months, is estimated to amount to approximately $10 
million, excluding munitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the fact that it is ongoing, we will have to wait to see 
how long we will be over there before we can give a final 
account. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are asking about the cost of the munitions.  How much money is 
being spent on munitions and how much more has been assigned?  It 
is a very simple question and one that the government should have 
addressed some time ago but refuses to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask the parliamentary secretary:  How much additional 
money, new money, is being addressed to the issue in Kosovo? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is being worked on by the Department of National 
Defence.  At this time we do not know exactly how long the 
mission will continue.  There are issues involving the extent of 
Canada's participation in the air war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the positive comments of my hon. friend and the 
comments that he is making on behalf of his party.  Certainly the 
government will have the funds necessary to carry out the mission 
in question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the international peacekeeping force proposed by Germany 
is getting increasing support from both NATO and non-NATO allies. 
However, there is very little on the public record about the 
view of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister responsible:  Who is going to be in control 
of this force?  Are we going to participate and what other 
countries are going to participate in this proposed peacekeeping 
force? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at this point nobody, including the Germans, have 
made any specific details as to who would be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important objective is to get the agreement of the Milosevic 
government to have an international presence to protect the 
refugees and to make sure that the integrity of any peace 
agreement is honoured.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a proposal that, once that basic level of agreement is 
met, there could be a meeting of the G-8 foreign ministers to 
discuss in more detail the responsibilities, the command and the 
contributions.  However, at this point in time, as I have said in 
the House before, it is basically a principle and a concept.  No 
one has yet put forward the specific details which the hon.

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

solution to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Russians could be a very useful tool in this force.  The 
inclusion of Russia would be more acceptable to the Serbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister agree that Russia is critical to any 
peacekeeping force and what efforts are being made to secure 
Russian involvement in the proposed peacekeeping force? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I reported to the House yesterday, I had a very 
long and extensive discussion with the Russian foreign minister 
yesterday on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the broad outlines of a peace plan.  We also 
talked about the important role that Russia could play in helping 
to bring it about and whether there could be a Russian 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reported to the House, I think the discussion was very 
constructive.  I found the Russian foreign minister to be very 
anxious, as we all are, to find a peaceful resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that we are engaging actively with 
Russia, as are other countries, to make sure they will be able to 
work in co-operation with us in finding a solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is Friday, 
and we have been questioning the government all week to find out 
something of what is going on in the Kosovo conflict, but the 
more we ask, the less we feel we know.  The other side is 
getting us used to half truths, I-don't-knows and undivulged 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the positive state of debates in this House and the 
support the government is getting from the opposition for a 
proper intervention in the Kosovo conflict, could there not be a 
change in attitude on the government side and could it not 
provide a little of the information which we are entitled to and 
which the Americans are getting from their President? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it may be of interest to the hon. member to know 
that yesterday afternoon I spent two and a half hours at the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
giving a full briefing and answering something like 60 or 70 
questions about Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave those answers to the extent of what I knew.  I gave the 
committee the responses that we could provide and I tried to take 
into account all of the recommendations that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent two and a half hours before a committee, combined with a 
briefing last week.  We have agreed to have bi-weekly briefings. 
We are here in question period every day.  We provide any written 
materials required.  I think that we are keeping Canadians and 
the opposition particularly well informed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
should understand that the issue is not about taking part, but 
about supplying answers.  That is what we would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned this morning, for example, that President Clinton was 
asked by the Pentagon to call up 33,000 reservists.  If, in the 
States, they are asking the President to call up 33,000 
reservists, does that mean they are getting ready for an 
invasion in the Kosovo area soon? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is on the move.  Does this have implications for 
Canada?  We would like to know. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States is fully 
responsible for whatever decisions he takes within his own 
country, just as we take our own sovereign decisions in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said in the House, there has been no decision by NATO on 
any activation of ground forces other than for peacekeeping 
purposes.  We have made no decision within this government.  As 
the Prime Minister has said, we will consult with parliament 
before any decision is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are doing that to support whatever activities they 
may be doing.  But I can give the hon. member every single 
assurance that what we have said about the Canadian position 
still stands. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, President Clinton 
has informed Americans on the cost of their involvement in 
Kosovo.  It seems to us that Canadians would be entitled to the 
same information and to know how much this operation is likely 
to cost them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without questioning the necessity of our participation, might we 
know what budget envelope the government has set for its present 
operations in Kosovo?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what I said earlier is still relevant.  It is too soon 
to determine the overall cost of military operations, including 
our support for humanitarian activities.  These figures are being 
developed.  They are being looked at in light of issues such as 
the length of the air operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As further information is developed we will be providing it 
through the Minister of National Defence to the House.  At this 
stage, to have definite information depends on certain 
hypothetical assumptions which have yet to be tested.

<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
yesterday we learned that NATO had requested additional 
participation by Canada.  We also learned that the war could 
last a number of weeks, if not months, more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be appropriate for the government to announce, 
after 23 days, what the extent of our financial involvement in 
the conflict is and what projections have been made, so that our 
commitment for the coming months may be assessed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I have already stated, we are speaking at this time of situations 
that are more or less hypothetical.  Obviously, the necessary 
analyses are in the process of being done at National Defence. 
Once the situation with regard to our involvement in the broadest 
possible intervention is known—and this is still 
hypothetical—the necessary information will be given to the 
Canadian public and to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, a diplomatic 
solution in Kosovo depends on the United Nations.  The Minister 
of Foreign Affairs understands that.  He must also understand 
that the same is true for consideration of the German plan and 
the uniting for peace resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the success of the German plan is not guaranteed, what is 
Canada waiting for to present such a resolution to the security 
council? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said yesterday, it is very important to continue 
with the negotiating process between all players in the Kosovo 
crisis, particularly the UN secretary general, the Russians and 
NATO members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I told the NDP members of the national defence committee at 
the last meeting, it is very important to look at all options. 
But, right now, the best option is to pursue the German 
proposals and to continue to encourage the interest of all 
players in the plan.  This is a national priority. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
should not wait on the sidelines.  We should not just be 
examining all options, we should be advancing all options. 
Canada should be working now to build support at the United 
Nations for UN sponsored solutions to the Kosovo crisis.  While 
co-operating fully with other promising initiatives, why not 
advance the uniting for peace initiative?  Why not ensure that 
every diplomatic avenue is being aggressively pursued? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the meetings held this morning between the Prime 
Minister and the Premier of China, the Prime Minister made a very 
specific point of raising the Kosovo issue and engaging the 
Chinese, who are important members of the security council, to 
gain their support for a resolution.  The agreement was that we 
would work together to see how we could co-operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we differ on the nature of the crisis and the response to 
it, I can report to the House that the Prime Minister's 
discussions with his counterpart from China were quite 
constructive.  He has asked the two foreign ministers to maintain 
the dialogue on how we can work together in a co-operative 
fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday morning, in testimony before the American senate 
committee, Hugh Shelton, chief of defence staff of the U.S. 
army, said that he had informed the American president that air 
strikes would achieve military goals and reduce Milosevic's 
military strength.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He also informed the American president that he doubted that air 
strikes would achieve the political objectives, which include, 
of course, the return and the safety of the Kosovars, in other 
words, humanitarian objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs agree with these statements 
or not, and might it be that NATO is achieving its military 
objectives but failing to achieve its political and humanitarian 
objectives? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must confess I do not know which official he is 
talking about.  If it is an elected official from the congress, 
they can say just about anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that in recent discussions we have had 
with officials at the U.S. administration, they are very 
committed to the maintenance of the air campaign.  They are very 
committed, as is well known, coming out of the NATO ministers 
meeting just last week, to ensuring that we have a consistent 
coherent policy in NATO that supports the campaign, but at the 
same time undertakes a dialogue and negotiations that are being 
followed at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the position of all NATO governments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
the minister's information, Mr. Shelton is General Baril's U.S. 
counterpart.  He does carry some weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This American General Baril even spoke of inconsistencies 
between military and political objectives.  In other words, 
whether there are 400, 700, or even 1,100 planes, as expected, 
or 6, 12, 18 and now about 20 for Canada, events seem to back 
Mr. Shelton up: the air strikes appear to be reducing 
Milosevic's capacity, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister confirm that the success of these political and 
humanitarian objectives therefore depends on sending in ground 
troops? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think it makes sense to assume that whatever is 
said before a committee of the U.S. congress or by somebody in 
the United States to the press involves the decision making 
process in Canada.  We make our own decisions based on our own 
assessment of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly if requests are made for additional planes, they will 
be considered, but at this stage there are no decisions to commit 
additional planes.

system fixed.  The minister has had four years to clean up her 
act and all we see is window dressing. When is the minister going 
to wake up, stop talking and implement concrete measures to fix 
the broken system which has become known as an easy mark to drug 
traffickers and terrorists?

of the Reform Party.  When they speak about immigration policy or 
refugee policy, their first reaction is to speak about criminals 
instead of trying to help people, instead of trying to attract 
more immigrants to this country, instead of trying to protect 
more genuine refugees.  This is the Reform Party's vision but it 
is not the vision of the Liberal government.

continuously for the last six years.  Nurses are on strike in

<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government is very proud that the first thing we did after

the Progressive Conservative Party during nine ruinous years in 
office, was to reinvest in our most important social program, our 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just weeks ago, $11.5 billion was added to transfers to the

be improved, integrated and made as accessible as they must be.

system?

delivering health care services, we also announced in the budget 
$1.4 billion of spending by the federal government in health 
research, establishing the Canadian Institute of Health Research

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the upcoming influx of 220 newly unemployed 
Canadians which will result from the impending closure at Lantic 
Sugar in Saint John, New Brunswick, does the government have a 
plan to assist them in finding new jobs and, if so, what is the 
plan? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> The Lantic Sugar plant is scheduled for 
closure on December 31, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the announcement of this closure, the provincial 
Department of Labour put in place an adjustment committee to 
assist affected workers. Both union and management are 
represented on this committee and the following types of services 
have been provided to workers to date: assistance with the 
writing of resumes; counselling assistance; self assessment, 
labour market information, job interview, role playing and job 
search technique sessions; and assistance on how to contact 
potential employers and followup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives from the local Human Resources Centre of Canada, 
HRCC, have been meeting with company and union officials since 
May 15, 1998 on this issue and a designated HRCC employee has 
been meeting with union officials to answer any questions workers 
have related to Employment Insurance, EI, benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRCC has also offered to hold information sessions for all 
Lantic Sugar employees, in conjunction with union and management, 
to discuss EI and severance packages. The first session was 
scheduled for March 18, 1999 at 9 a.m., with subsequent sessions 
on March 25, 26, 29 and 30. These sessions took place on the 
employer's premises and involved approximately 20 employees per 
session. There were also special arrangements made to assist 
affected workers to apply for EI benefits as the date for the 
layoff approached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the adjustment committee is working with companies 
in the Saint John area that may consider applications from some 
Lantic Sugar employees, which could result in the hiring of some 
of these affected workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRCC staff, in partnership with the adjustment committee, are 
always available to provide information and assistance. These 
employees are encouraged to take advantage of the services 
provided by the adjustment committee and the HRCC.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK169">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, an 
act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act to enable Canada to implement the Agreement for the 
Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to 
the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and other international fisheries 
treaties or arrangements, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, before oral question period, I read the preamble 
of the UN agreement on fisheries. I repeated that it was 
important to talk about that agreement, since Bill C-27 seeks to 
implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to a number of points mentioned in the 
preamble. For example, the preamble refers to “calling for more 
effective enforcement by flag States, port States and coastal 
States of the conservation and management measures adopted for 
such stocks”. The members who are listening to me, and people 
who are watching us on television realize that this paragraph 
ties together three major links, namely the flag state, the port 
state where the landing of fish will occur, and the coastal 
state in whose waters the fish is caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other important points to mention. The countries that 
will ratify this agreement are conscious of the need to avoid 
adverse impacts on the marine environment and minimize the risk 
of irreversible effects of fishing operations. At this point, 
the countries agree that rules of law must be established to 
achieve these goals. 
A little later on, we will see what it means to establish rules 
of law to make sure there are no irreversible effects.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble also recognizes “the need for specific assistance, 
including financial, scientific and technological assistance to 
developing States”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that member states, or those that will sign 
the agreement, agree to help coastal countries or states that 
have large bodies of water, but not necessarily the means to 
manage them. Unfortunately, we do not know how the costs will be 
shared. 
Of course, it is clear from the agreement that the signatories 
are giving themselves two years in which to come up with 
solutions not necessarily apparent at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final, and I think the most important, point in the preamble 
is “convinced that an agreement for the implementation of the 
relevant provisions of the Convention would best serve these 
purposes and contribute to the maintenance of international 
peace and security”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can come up with wonderful ideas, but they must be shared 
by other countries and put down in writing so that everyone 
agrees to observe them.  This is where it gets interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will relate this to Bill C-27, which tries to make UNFA 
subject to Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take article 21, sub-regional and regional cooperation in 
enforcement, paragraphs (5) and (6). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 21(5) of UNFA provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>21. (5) Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are 
clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any 
activity contrary to the conservation and management measures 
referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where 
appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag 
State of the alleged violation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the time frame?  Paragraph (6) of article 21 provides 
that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in 
paragraph (5) within three working days— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if a long weekend is involved, it could be longer.  It could 
even be as long as six days. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in 
procedures established in accordance with  paragraph (2). 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the spirit of the letter in the UN Fisheries Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, what does Bill C-27 do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides the following change to subsection 16.2(3). 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>16.2 (3) In addition to the powers referred to in subsection 
(1), a protection officer may, with the consent of the 
participating state, exercise any powers referred to in section 
16.1.  The officer is deemed to have received the consent of the 
state if the state 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) has not responded within the period prescribed by 
regulation; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) has responded but is not fully investigating the alleged 
contravention. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see no time frame in the bill.  It is set by regulation. 
Therefore, I conclude that the governor in council, cabinet, 
will establish the regulatory measures. 
Will cabinet follow the spirit and the letter, as described in 
the UN Agreement on Fisheries?  That is the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn to the most serious question I have 
about Bill C-27. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it right off.  The Bloc Quebecois supports the UN 
Fisheries Agreement.  It is establishing international law. 
Naturally, it will not be perfect.  However, when we ratify an 
agreement like that we must honour its spirit and its letter, 
and so we will have to respect the time frame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must refer to Canadian legislation, and this is what the bill 
does not say, because this will be done through regulations, 
that the governor in council will decide. However, Bill C-27, the 
bill to implement the agreement does not amend another bill we 
passed earlier—Bill C-29. 
It allows protection officers, with the approval of the 
Solicitor General and the Minister of Fisheries, to seize and 
bring the offending vessel to the nearest port, if this occurs 
in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such seizure is effective and immediate.  The Canadian 
legislation makes no reference to five working days.  That is 
where my concerns lie.  The Minister of Fisheries has just 
repeated the same thing he told FAO countries at their March 11 
meeting, recommending that the United Nations Fisheries 
Agreement be ratified and included in its entirety in national 
legislation world-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to put any words in the minister's mouth that 
are not true, but I would like to point out that this seems to 
be contradictory and could mislead the House. 
They are claiming that the intention of Bill C-27 is to take the 
UNFA word for word into Canadian law.  This would require us to 
do away with Bill C-29 and to specify, through regulation, that 
the time limits will be in keeping with those in UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not fully informed about Bill C-27 at this time, which is a 
serious shortcoming as we are at the stage of recruiting other 
countries to sign this agreement so that it will have the force 
of international law.  I believe that 30 signatories are 
required.  We do not have that number at present.  Canada wants 
to give it a good start by being one of the first signatories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what signal is Canada is sending to the rest of the world 
when it claims to want to recommend signature of the agreement 
in its entirety, while in its own legislation it is not 
respecting the spirit and the letter of the UNFA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, in my opinion, is sufficient grounds for voting against 
Bill C-27, but I would again point out—and this is unfortunate—the 
Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with the spirit and the letter of 
the UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go still further to state that, at report stage—perhaps I 
did not emphasize this enough—we tabled about a dozen motions on 
top of what came from the other members, and if I remember 
correctly, there were some 18 in all.  We worked on the motions 
in four groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois motions in fact attempted to have Bill C-27 
incorporate, to the greatest extent possible, the spirit and the 
letter of the UN Fisheries Agreement.  Through Motion No. 1, I 
tried to include in the bill article 5 of UNFA, since Canada was 
in agreement with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government refuse to Canadianize the general 
management philosophy?  These are very important principles.  It 
is on the strength of these principles that management plans 
will be developed and our fishers told how Canada wants to 
manage in the future.  If they are not given a vision or general 
definition, they are still flying blind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion we presented was designed to ensure that Bill 
C-27 was worded in such a way that Canadian courts could 
interpret it according to the letter and the spirit of UNFA.  I 
repeat, if Canada wishes to sign the agreement, the fishery 
should be structured accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, when 30 countries have signed it, it will have the 
force of international law.  This is one more reason to 
Canadianize it, to bring it into line with the spirit and the 
letter of UNFA.  Once again, the government has refused to agree 
to our motion on interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of motions that I moved, seconded my colleague, 
the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, was designed to offset the 
extraterritorial nature of Bill C-27, according to the spirit and 
the letter of UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do I mean by that?  Some will say that it is a question of 
terminology.  International law use the expression zones 
désignées 
while Canadian law uses the expression zones délimitées.  Why would 
Canada want to have its terminology differ from that used in the 
agreement.  For some countries that want to sign the agreement, 
it is as though Canada were leaving a door open to depart from 
the spirit of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for using the expression designated areas is that 
they have been designated somewhere.  It has already been agreed 
upon and appears in another treaty. 
In the world sub-regional organization, NAFO, everything is 
already designated, defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As set out in Bill C-27, the fact that Canada can delineate 
leaves things open to interpretation.  I do not want to put 
words into the mouth of the Minister of Fisheries, but I do wish 
to indicate my concerns at this stage of the debate.  The 
purpose of implementing this agreement with Bill C-27 is to 
maximize the number of signatory states.  If one is trying to 
attract people, one must inspire confidence, not create 
scepticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third group of motions we brought in at report stage 
concerned parliament's verification rights, and once again this 
was refused.  We were asking that, if there were to be any new 
treaties, schedules to treaties, the House might be consulted 
within four months.  That is not much, four months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, of course, always the government majority that will get 
regulations passed.  This was a way to get MPs involved in 
management of the country's assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this bill and the fisheries agreement and international 
treaties are so important that the government deemed that this 
House has a duty to vote on a bill to allow the UN Fisheries 
Agreement to be Canadianized, to make it part of our own 
Canadian legislation, I feel that, if there are other changes, 
Canadian members of parliament ought to have the right to 
discuss them.  But no, they will have none of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would remind members that, in 
international law, in Canadian law, the Canadian government, the 
governor in council—or cabinet, in other words—may go to the UN on 
its own, sign and ratify the UNFA without consulting this House. 
This is according to Canadian law. I can go along with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I find it unfortunate that they are asking for my 
agreement to Canadianize certain parts of the UNFA while denying 
me the right to discuss amendments in the House, while the 
Canadian government can already do this. I do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this a delaying tactic?  Are they trying to convince us that 
the Canadian government is looking after fisheries, because the 
UNFA is something that is easily passed in the House?  As I say 
and say again, the hitch is that the agreement is not being 
respected. The spirit of the UNFA is not being respected, as is 
the case with Bill C-27. 
How are we going to get out of it?  What is going to happen in 
all that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of what I have just said, on the one hand, Canada 
is saying “Yes, we will pass Bill C-27” in order to please 
countries that may become allies but, on the one hand, it is 
retaining its C-29 pistol, which enables it to intervene, board a 
ship and bring it back to port when it is found to be in the 
wrong.  That is contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Canada really trying to do with all that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent fishers in my riding and I have talked with fishers 
in other provinces, including Newfoundland. 
The people agreed with the spirit of Bill C-29, that is, when 
someone is found to be in error, the ship is boarded and brought 
to port with reasonable force, naturally, because no one wants 
loss of life.  But now it seems to me, as the Reform member for 
Delta—South Richmond mentioned as well, that something happened 
at the UN so that Canada ended up losing the power to legislate 
and sanction a vessel found taken in error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only agreement Canada got, was along these lines “You can 
investigate, ask questions, take the evidence.  However, you 
must, within five working days, ask the participating government 
that owns the boat to take police action, establish sanctions, 
and in this time period, the participating country can itself 
carry out the sentence or, in the worst case scenario, not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada came away with only that, it is perhaps unfortunate, 
but, I repeat, the Bloc supports the UN fisheries agreement, 
because we have to start somewhere.  In order to protect our 
resource and enforce all the fine principles set out in the 
preamble, I think we must join with other participating 
countries and provide a level playing field.  A bit like what we 
are taught in the Bible, we are to turn the other cheek.  This 
is sort of what the fisheries agreement is asking us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say “turn the other cheek”?  Because we must trust the 
other signatory country will also enforce the law on its vessel 
in contravention, and impress on its captain that he is in 
violation, deserves to be sanctioned and has to live with all 
the problems that causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, we must trust the international community, the 
diplomatic channels. We must play the game. If Canada agrees to 
align Canadian law with the spirit and the letter of the 
fisheries agreement, it will be easier to get other countries to 
join. Again, once the agreement has come into force 
internationally—30 states must sign it—even those countries that 
will not have signed it will be forced to comply with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that is achieved, Canada can work with the signatory 
countries to begin to give some teeth to the agreement. Once the 
UNFA has force of law at the international level, consideration 
could even be given—and I call for this today—to establishing a 
special enforcement authority. 
We have peacekeepers; perhaps we could have a fleet, under the 
authority of a UN admiral, in charge of co-ordinating the forces 
of the various coastal states to protect the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve what we want in our waters today, what is 
provided under Bill C-29, we must be prepared to take a small 
step backward. I agree that this is a step backward, but that is 
par for the course, as we say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final comment on this, if I may.  This is where our Canadian 
fishers end up getting hurt, and this is why I am taking a long 
time to explain today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I spoke on this bill, I acted what boarding of a 
fishing vessel might be like.  Take the <I>Estai</I> for example.  In 
that case, the Canadian fisheries officer boarded the ship it 
and brought it into port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see a ship that, in our opinion, is in violation, what 
happens then?  First, the captain of the Canadian patrol frigate 
boards the ship. He conducts an investigation and questions 
those on board. 
His patrol vessel is clearly identified.  The foreign ship's 
crew has nothing to fear from him, since all he can do is talk 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the captain goes on board, and he asks “What is your country 
of origin?  What was your catch today?  May I see your log?” 
Then he asks to see the fishing gear and the hold, to measure 
the fish and see whether fish that are too small are being 
taken, for example.  If they caught turbot the size of my hand, 
for instance, they are in violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-29, what would he do?  He would read the captain of 
the offending foreign vessel his rights, then open up his 
jacket, take out his revolver and hold it at the ready if the 
captain does not want to co-operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps things will be done a bit more peaceably with the UNFA. 
The Canadian protection officer will have a new weapon, instead 
of his revolver.  He would have a new tool in his arsenal  He 
would open up his jacket, but instead of taking out his 
revolver, he would take out his cell phone and call the 
department of Fisheries of the other country, and say “I am 
giving you five days notice.  We have just picked up one of your 
people who is in violation”.  Canadian fishers are going to find 
that hard to take, and hard to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite them to accept it nonetheless.  I am making this 
prediction: if Canada boards a foreign ship twice in a row, I 
believe that all the other signatory countries are going to 
bring pressure to bear, saying “We have no choice.  We wanted to 
do this the honourable way, but some people are not following 
the rules. 
We are going to give the fisheries agreement more teeth by 
giving officers more powers and letting coastal countries 
catching people red handed apply their laws according to the 
their own legal code”.  That I think is what needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is to get people to understand the spirit of the 
agreement, which they do not currently.  As members can see, it 
is a bit contradictory.  It is as if Canada in the scenario I 
have just painted were trying to give its fishery officers two 
tools at the same time. But no provision is made in C-27, which 
serves to implement the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, the only weapon a fishery officer can carry is a 
revolver.  Under the new legislation, he will have to use his 
phone first.  There are no other interpretations. 
In this regard, I think that the members of the House will have 
to be very sensitive to the issue and vote no.  When they come 
to vote on Bill C-27, they will have to make the effort to reread 
the UN Agreement on Fisheries, especially paragraphs 5 and 6 of 
article 21. There is a clear reference to three working days. 
Now, when we look at Canadian law, we see it is immediate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we want, by voting in favour of Bill C-27, to 
implement the UN Agreement on Fisheries, we are shooting 
ourselves in the foot, because our law provides exactly the 
opposite in Bill C-29. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I mentioned earlier that we had concerns, my 
colleague for Beauharnois—Salaberry and I, about the words 
used, for example délimité and désigné.  We prefer the English 
choice of designated.  We should perhaps use the same words in 
applying international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the UN Fisheries Agreement, a Canadian protection officer 
is allowed to board and inspect where “there are clear grounds 
for believing”.  Bill C-27, which is supposed to implement this 
agreement, uses the expression “reasonable grounds”.  Why has 
the terminology been changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that I am making a mountain out of a molehill 
today.  I would point out that the purpose of the bill is to 
implement an international treaty.  All other nations will have 
to live with the same vocabulary.  If we are trying to get them 
to ratify the agreement, why are we changing the vocabulary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already pointed out in my speech that, on three 
occasions, we have stepped back from this agreement, a bit like 
Saint Peter when Jesus was arrested:  “Before the cock crow, 
thou shalt deny me thrice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has not yet been passed, the international treaty has 
not yet been ratified and already, in at least three places in 
the bill to implement it, Canada is going against the spirit and 
the letter of the agreement.  Worse still, it is going back on 
its own word. On the one hand, it is telling all nations of the 
world to incorporate the UN Fisheries Agreement in their 
legislation.  On the other, Canada has stepped back from the 
bill at least three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I will be voting against the bill. 
It is too bad.  I hope that members will understand from what I 
have said that I am in agreement with the UN Fisheries 
Agreement, but I cannot allow the House, and in particular the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the government members, to 
pass this bill because it is contrary to UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to raise a few points.  Time is 
being devoted to a debate of this bill, but I remind the House 
that the government could have gone to the UN and signed and 
ratified this agreement without our approval.  In any event, if 
there are other annexes or treaties to sign, it is henceforth 
denying us the right to amend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked it if, this spring, the government had not 
put us through the problems we experienced in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence last summer.  The government likes to find out what is 
going on elsewhere.  It is fond of international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada belongs to an international subregional organization 
called NAFO. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization has a 
management regime. Every participating country already knows 
what its allocation will be in the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules used to determine the total allowable catches and the 
mathematical formula that will apply to a particular cod, 
halibut or shrimp stock are known in advance. Each participating 
country provides the biological information it has. That 
information is fed into the computer, the total biomass figure 
comes out and, the mathematical formula having been determined 
in advance, there nothing anybody can say about it. Every 
country at the table knows the percentage allocated to it. I 
think it is paradise at sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is part of that management regime, but it does not apply 
within its own waters the methods used by NAFO.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I mention that? I do not want take away from Canada its 
constitutional right to manage fisheries. However, once Quebec 
has achieved sovereignty—or maybe that will never happen even 
though that is not what I wish—I think it should come to an 
agreement with its neighbours, namely New Brunswick, Prince 
Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, since all five of 
them share the Gulf of St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why could we not do what NAFO does, which is to allocate a 
specific share to each jurisdiction and ensure that the method 
used to determine the total allowable catches is transparent so 
as to take the politics out of the issuance of fishing licences? 
This is what every fisher, everyone whose livelihood depends on 
fishing, wishes for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Canadian legislation, the minister has the discretionary 
power to decide who gets what. Of course, I do not mean to say 
that the minister is an ogre. He is doing what he can with what 
he has, but I would like to give him a hand by suggesting that, 
in the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, we model our management 
system on NAFO's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add one last criterion, which could make things easier. 
When we talk about fixing quotas, some people might get scared 
and say “No, we do not want fixed quotas for Quebec. We do not 
want fixed quotas for Newfoundland”. Quota is a scary word. Some 
people will say “That is it for us”. But that is not the point 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to borrow an approach from French law. In 1992, 
French law allowed the European Parliament to set relative 
stabilization criteria between participating Mediterranean 
states. What does that mean? It means that the fishers or the 
participating states know how much fish they can catch. If these 
stabilization criteria are not quotas, what are they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One job at sea creates five jobs on land. The main problem is 
that a live fish is federal and a dead fish is provincial. Could 
the federal and the provincial governments not find a way for 
the provinces to set stabilization criteria that would ensure 
that the five jobs on land do not come and go all the time? That 
would be a step towards harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that we must downsize. There is not one 
province willing to downsize and lay-off everybody working in the 
fisheries without knowing what its relative basis is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the consent of the House, I could speak all afternoon, even 
all weekend long, on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> I see people are agreeing to it. If the House 
so wishes, I will keep on talking about the United Nations 
fisheries agreement. Do I have the consent of the House, Madam 
Speaker? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point I wish 
to inform the House that there is an error in the English text of 
the opposition motion on page 17 of today's order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the NDP caucus, I am honoured to speak on the bill. 
In speaking to the hon. member, the spokesperson for our caucus 
on fisheries and known as a great supporter and defender of the 
fishing industry and the preservation of the fish stock, we would 
like to extend our support, but with some reservations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the committee are very well aware, amendments were 
put forward to address the specific issues.  I will highlight 
once again the main point of concern that we would like to raise 
during debate on Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act.  It is Canada's implementation of the United 
Nations fisheries agreement, a very crucial agreement as it deals 
with the protection of our fish stocks based on sustainability 
and co-operation.  Also the jurisdiction over waters and the 
supply of fish is enhanced.  It ensures that Canadian fish caught 
by Canadian fishermen are processed in Canadian plants. That is a 
major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise a point of contention about a specific and 
crucial point in the bill.  It is also an issue of 
interpretation.  The bill is a new tool for enforcing 
international conservation measures on the high seas.  It will 
allow Canada to operate outside Canadian waters under the 
auspices of the UNFA, the United Nations Fisheries Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly are aware that enforcing illegal or unwarranted 
activities can escalate to international misunderstandings.  In 
dealing with foreign nations let us be very specific and very 
clear in our communications so as not to jeopardize the 
integrity, the powers and the safety of our enforcement officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-27 a ship suspected of illegally fishing on the 
high seas could be boarded and searched if the flag state is 
informed.  The protections officer can then exercise additional 
powers under the UNFA if the flag state has not responded within 
three days or does not investigate the alleged offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three day period is the contention.  It is not defined in 
the bill itself.  Article 21 of the actual United Nations 
fisheries agreement says that the time period will be prescribed 
by regulation.  During report stage debate the government said 
that it would implement a three day period in the UNFA through 
regulations at a future date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague brought forward a motion that would change the 
three day notification period to 48 hours.  Nobody understands 
what three days mean.  They could mean working days.  When our 
hon. colleague brought forth an amendment, 48 hours was a 
specific time period which nobody could dispute internationally. 
It would have permitted Canadian fisheries officers to wait only 
48 hours to act instead of three working days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the amendment was defeated.  We would like to 
bring it to the government's attention.  Before the bill receives 
final royal assent we hope this ratification and clarification 
could take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do three working days mean?  That is our question to the 
government.  There is no definition in any of the agreements or 
the bill of three working days.  Does it mean 72 hours?  Does it 
include weekends and national holidays?  If so, if national 
holidays are recognized in Canada, are they also recognized in 
the vessel's country of origin?  What happens if the boat is 
boarded on Christmas Eve?  When does that three day period 
actually begin?  Is it after Boxing Day or New Years?  It is a 
very contentious issue even under Canadian interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to waste the time of fisheries officers who are 
trying to work out the details on the high seas.  We do not want 
to wait too long before they are allowed further action against a 
vessel that is fishing illegally.  That is why the three working 
day period should be reduced to two days and defined as 48 hours. 
This was a major issue raised in the committee process and 
brought forward in an amendment.  We want to raise it with the 
government today and ask it to take it under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to draw attention to the environmental status of 
our ecosystem.  We talked about declining fish stocks in the 
Canadian fisheries industry and the impact it has on our coastal 
communities and our economy as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally fish stocks are declining as our population and 
demand for fish are increasing.  As one hon. colleague mentioned, 
the silent tragedy of human deterioration as a result of agents 
in our food cycles is also a major concern.  Pollutants that 
affect the ecosystem go into our food cycle including the fish 
throughout the regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the members who spoke to this issue to look at the 
Environmental Protection Act.  One party spoke about the need to 
look at the health deteriorating agents in food cycles.  Another 
party diminished the pollution related powers we wanted to 
protect in terms of fighting polluters, the polluter pays 
principle and the precautionary principle.   All these principles 
were encompassed by CEPA and were debated.  Many members declined 
strengthening the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the issue of climate change which affects the migratory 
patterns of world fish stocks and the depths at which schools of 
fish can be found.  The major issues are ecosystem and 
environmental protection, pollution prevention for our planet and 
climate change.  Let us take these issues to heart and challenge 
members of the House and the provincial legislators to make sure 
we have a viable future for our children and a food supply for 
the world, especially our nation.  Let us protect our Canadian 
waters and our Canadian law enforcement officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hate to see a situation where we were forced to shoot 
across somebody's bow to get somebody's attention in terms of the 
legalities of the jurisdiction over fish off our shores.  Let us 
look at the speedy passage of Bill C-27 as weak as it is.  We 
would like to strengthen it further, and I think there are 
processes that will allow for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it gives me pleasure to rise today on behalf of our Conservative 
caucus to support Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And to congratulate the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  And congratulate the government for 
finally doing something which was so obviously right that it 
should have been done many years ago.  It has taken so long to 
bring the bill before us that both governments, the previous one 
and the current one, deserve some blame for not doing it earlier. 
However, it is a bill we are more than happy to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fisheries critic has spoken to the bill and to its 
amendments on several occasions.  Obviously we are very 
supportive of any act that adds to our conservation and 
management skills to control the fisheries resource as best we 
can.  In this case we are talking about the straddling stocks 
outside and inside the 200 mile limit.  We are talking about cod, 
flounder, turbot, tuna and swordfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to protect all these fish for the livelihood of all 
those who depend on them.  We need to protect the fisheries 
resource because it is a tremendous source of protein for the 
whole world, a world that is often starving and hungry.  If that 
resource is managed properly, if we make sure it is a renewable 
resource that remains renewable, all the world will be well 
served.  Hence we are very supportive of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it has taken way too long to get the bill approved 
by the House of Commons.  We hope Canada becomes a signatory to 
the agreement very quickly.  After many years only 59 countries 
have become signatories to it.  There have only been 17 
ratifications and we need 30 before the agreement has any 
international effect.  We may have missed an opportunity that we 
certainly should not have missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House congratulate the Liberal government 
for doing this, but we were surprised that all the amendments put 
forth by the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, the member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore and myself were 
voted down by the majority of government members.  Some of the 
amendments that were discussed fully in the fisheries committee 
could have made the act an awful lot better and an awful lot 
stronger.  All amendments should not have been voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment I am sure should not have been voted down by 
members opposite is my amendment to section 701(1) which would 
allow for enforcement.  Everybody on this side of the House 
interprets the act as being very weak when it comes to the 
enforcement side.  The principle of the act is good, but it 
cannot be enforced by our fisheries protection officers, the RCMP 
and coast guard officials designated under the act to do 
enforcement.  There was a real opportunity to strengthen the act 
so that it would add to the conservation and protection of our 
fish resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague who spoke before me mentioned the amendment I am 
talking about.  The problem with section 701 is that a foreign 
fishing vessel caught in Canadian waters illegally cannot be 
charged right away.  Permission of the home state has to be 
obtained.  That might be okay when dealing with the signatories 
to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada or the other signatory countries might say that if one of 
our vessels is caught doing something wrong, the enforcement 
officers can lay a charge and let the chips fall where they may. 
However, what happens when the real culprits in international 
overfishing are pirate ships of countries flying flags of 
convenience registered in Panama or Belize or someplace else?  As 
the former speaker just mentioned, what happens if someone is 
caught on a Christmas Eve?  How would fisheries officers get 
permission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should a fisheries officer off the coast of Newfoundland do 
in a situation similar to the <I>Estai</I>?  How could a fishing 
captain who is breaking the law by using a liner inside of his 
regular trawls to can catch small fish and destroy a resource be 
charged?  How would the officer get control of the vessel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in Newfoundland waters the enforcement officer would call the 
federal Minister of Fisheries who would then contact the federal 
Minister for International Affairs who would then try to contact 
somebody in a place like Panama and get permission to lay a 
charge on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and Labrador.  It will 
simply never happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment was pretty straightforward.  All it said was that 
enforcement officers in our fleets would have exactly the same 
set of rules and regulations.  If they found a Canadian vessel 
inside Canadian waters breaking the law, the captain could be 
arrested, the ship seized and taken to port, and the legal 
process would set in.  Why is there a different set of laws in 
the bill, one that applies to foreign vessels inside Canadian 
limits and one that applies to the vessels of Canada and other 
signatories to the agreement inside Canadian waters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real shortfall in the bill.  We proposed an amendment 
which was agreed to by this side of the House.  I believe all 
members on this side supported the amendment and everybody on the 
opposite side voted against it.  On the one hand the government 
deserves credit for finally bringing in the bill.  On the other 
hand it certainly could have made it a lot better and could have 
protected more of the fish stocks off the coast of Newfoundland 
and Labrador or indeed any part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, we will still support the bill because it is 
badly needed.  Anything that conserves and protects our fish 
resources is obviously something we will support.  It is not just 
the fish resources.  I have heard the minister of fisheries say 
sometimes that his first priority is to protect fish, not 
fishermen, fisherwomen, or workers, or other people who depend on 
the fishery.  I take a different approach.  The first 
responsibility of the minister of fisheries is to the people he 
represents.  That means he has to conserve and protect fish 
stocks.  As long as it is done on a scientific basis, we are more 
than happy to support him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland and Labrador a lot of things are happening that 
do not preserve and conserve our fish resources.  Our fishermen, 
fisherwomen, plant workers, truckers, suppliers and other support 
industries have a way of life based upon an inshore fishery in 
Newfoundland.  That inshore fishery is now again at very serious 
risk, which I raised in committee yesterday when the Newfoundland 
delegation was here.  We have done many things to preserve, 
conserve and protect our resource, and we are allowing one part 
of the ecosystem to completely destroy and diminish all other 
efforts we have taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of seals we have a very serious problem.  As I said 
in committee yesterday, sometimes we are destined to repeat 
history because maybe our memories are bad.  We should not be 
destined to repeat events.  In the 1980s when the cod stocks were 
being seriously depleted there was always the argument that we 
did not have enough scientific proof to significantly reduce 
quotas.  Every fisherman in Newfoundland could say it was getting 
harder and harder to make a living, more and more difficult to 
find fish, and when fish were found they were smaller than they 
had ever been before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in government in Newfoundland from 1979 to 1989.  I know 
the premier and the other politicians in Newfoundland fought hard 
to get the federal government to reduce the quotas and to do 
something about management of our fish stocks.  Nobody listened 
to us or in particular to fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in 1998-99 we have another problem where everybody in 
Newfoundland, every politician of every political party, every 
fisherman who lives around the coast of Newfoundland, sees the 
great predation by seals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seals have gone from roughly two million in the mid-1980s to 
close to seven million now.  They eat millions of tonnes of fish 
per year.  In Atlantic cod alone, a stock which the government 
has tried to preserve, $3 billion in TAGS and income support has 
been put in place to try to regenerate roe in Newfoundland.  That 
$3 billion is going to be lost because we have not been willing, 
we have not been brave enough and courageous enough, to take on 
the International Fund for Animal Welfare and other lobbyists who 
have their axe to grind and use anything they can to raise 
significant amounts of money for their organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the news today how the Government of Canada deals 
with environmental problems.  We are afraid for our lives to 
touch the seal issue.  No one wants to touch seals.  No one wants 
to get involved with the seal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada, on a similar environmental issue, we have a 
problem with snow geese.  There are not many people who make a 
living on snow geese.  In Atlantic Canada this year seals ate 
210,000 tonnes of Atlantic cod.  That would employ almost 
everyone who was previously involved in the Atlantic fishery; 
210,000 tonnes of cod and one million tonnes of caplin.  If 
protected, that resource could create a significant amount of 
jobs in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it cannot be dealt with.  The government says that it 
cannot justify an increase in the seal quota, the total allowable 
catch, because it does not have scientific data.  In effect, it 
is a repetition of what happened with the cod stocks in 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are afraid to listen to fishermen.  We are afraid to listen 
to people who can see evidence on the shoreline on any given day 
of seal predation.  Now we are in the situation where the 
Government of Canada says that we cannot cull the herd.  We 
cannot do anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Canadian program aims to cull snow geese by 1.25 
million this year, 1.9 million in 2000 and 2.6 million in 2001. 
We are almost doubling our cull of snow geese because of an 
environmental disaster.  We are doing it, in a way, to protect 
the snow geese.  If we do not, they will simply eat themselves 
out of house and home and nature will find a way to bring the 
numbers down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying to the minister that when it comes to conservation, 
protection and enhancement of our fish stocks, we should do what 
Environment Canada has authorized be done for snow geese.  Many 
more people make a living in Newfoundland based upon the fish 
resources that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I believe that some of our amendments, 
especially on enforcement, should have been approved, but Liberal 
members chose not to accept them.  However, members on this side 
of the House and we in the Conservative caucus will support Bill 
C-27.  If nothing else, it is an improvement to what we now have. 
On behalf of our caucus I give our support to this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the Progressive Conservative member's 
comments. I take it from his conclusion that he would recommend 
that his party vote in favour of Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my speech, I believe the bill is contrary to 
the spirit of the United Nations fishing agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question I would like to put to the hon. member is the 
following. Is he more comfortable with the existing Canadian law 
system, as set in Bill C-29, which makes it possible to seize 
vessels caught in the act and slap penalties on them? 
If this is the case, it means he does not agree with the content 
of the United Nations Fisheries Agreement. The agreement says 
that a country should act in a diplomatic way and give three 
days to fishing boats caught in violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason why I emphasised, in my speech, the need of 
diplomacy. We need to get as many countries as possible on side, 
to get 30 signatories, which is the minimum number required for 
the agreement to become binding internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we reach that level internationally, signatory countries 
can find a way to give teeth to the agreement. For now, we 
cannot choose between them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be sure that the hon. member has understood, and I 
would like him to comment on NAFO's management policy, which 
already establishes percentages applicable to participating 
countries. This could allow a settlement of some disputes 
between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the House that NAFO's rules for establishing total 
allowable catches are transparent and known to all. Everyone 
provides information, while at present in the Canadian system 
officials and biologists at Fisheries and Oceans are the only 
ones who have the information and communicate it to the 
minister. We are forced to live with the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member two questions. 
Does he prefer to live only under Canadian legislation, Bill 
C-29? This would be the result if we vote for Bill C-27. And what 
does he think of allowing Canada to administer things the way 
NAFO does?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have two questions for the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also are not in perfect unity with the government on this 
bill.  All of the amendments made by the member, which were done 
with a lot of concurrence on the fisheries committee, were 
excellent amendments which could have made the bill stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have come to the conclusion in the Conservative 
caucus that it is better to support this bill and have it 
ratified so that it becomes more of an international agreement 
with the other countries which are signatories to it, to at least 
go that far.  I suspect what will happen is that we will be back 
here in a couple of years, which often happens with this 
government, making amendments to Bill C-27 when the government 
finds that the enforcement mechanisms will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members will come to the House one day with a great 
show of pride and patriotism to bring amendments, the amendments 
which the member suggested and the amendments which I suggested, 
and will be back here to make this bill stronger and make it do 
what we want it to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Newfoundland have always been very concerned and alarmed 
that when it comes to NAFO Canada is much too soft.  We accept 
too many violations with respect to some of the things that 
happen on those vessels.  This is just not strong enough to do 
what we want to do in Newfoundland and Labrador, and indeed in 
all of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we would like a much stronger bill, but we have decided to 
support this bill because at least it goes in the right 
direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned in his speech the total allowable catch for 
the seal herd this year.  Over 200,000 animals are to be culled 
from that herd, out of a total population on the east coast of 
about 6.4 million seals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on two things.  First, 
the government and the minister involved have certainly ignored 
the lives and well-being of Atlantic Canadians.  There is no 
question about that.  However, there is also a greater travesty. 
The government has also ignored the conservation measures needed 
to ensure a healthy seal herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a burgeoning seal population which has already 
surpassed— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The comments of the hon. member are not relevant to the 
bill we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, obviously the reason we 
are supporting the bill on this side of the House is because it 
conserves and protects our fish stocks.  The nature and level of 
those fish stocks are obviously very pertinent to this debate and 
therefore the member's question is certainly in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for 
South Shore may continue with his question and comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  I was encompassing the seals in the total 
fish stocks.  I realize the difference between mammals and fish. 
I am not sure thatmembers opposite do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to look at the holistic picture.  The question 
for the hon. member is put quite simply.  We are not only 
ignoring the personal value, the very real value, and the 
hardship it causes Nova Scotians, Labradorians, New Brunswickers, 
Quebecers, Magdalen Islanders and Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians, we are also ignoring the very real responsibility 
that we have for conservation of the seal herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seal herd will continue to overpopulate, to overreach the 
food resource and will suffer some type of a crippling and 
dramatic decline in population, probably long term starvation and 
disease.  What are the hon. member's thoughts on that? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no longer a 
balance in our ecosystem.  Strangely enough, long before we 
joined Canada, long before Canada became Canada, there were seal 
and cod fish all along the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Recorded history tells us that they were there as long ago as 500 
years, but I suspect they were there tens of thousands of years 
before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We finally got the two hundred mile limit in 1997 and Canadian 
control and management.  We have Ph.D.s in biology and in 
ecosystem science.  We have all kinds of educated scientists.  We 
have all kinds of people with masters degrees in business to 
manage the resource.  We have all kinds of guardians and wildlife 
people to look after it.  Why, after barely 25 or 30 years, do we 
have a system that is so totally mismanaged and out of control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem now is that because it is so mismanaged and because 
we have so many seals and so few fish, we are going to lose.  We 
have seen seven years of devastation in Atlantic Canada, 
particularly in Newfoundland.  There has been an out-migration of 
30,000 people in the last three years alone from a lot of towns 
like Trepassey.  It used to have close to 2,000 people and it now 
has close to 800 people.  We are losing our young people.  We are 
losing our brains.  A lot of it is because our fishery resources 
have been totally mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have another problem facing the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the Government of Canada square in the face every day. 
We have six million or seven million seals.  They are eating well 
over one million tonnes of food per year.  As a result, the cod 
stocks are not coming back.  The $3 billion invested by the 
Government of Canada to allow the resource to come back is going 
to be wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are saying is that there has to be a balance.  The 
Government of Canada now has enough scientific data and certainly 
enough evidence from all of our fishers and people living on our 
coast that it is really time to do something with the seal herd. 
Unless it is done, as the member says, the seals will eat 
themselves out of house and home.  There will be a mass 
depopulation of seals by natural reasons.  Everybody will be 
poorly served with respect to cod fish and seals, especially the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly appreciate this debate.  I 
know I have about a minute, so I will not get into a long 
dissertation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting debate and it is a subject that is very 
close to the hearts of all Atlantic Canadians and Quebecers who 
are involved in the very difficult business of the management of 
fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really think this is a political issue and I do not 
think there is much disagreement.  I have to remind my hon. 
friend and colleague from St. John's West that management of fish 
stocks is not an easy issue.  He will recall that a few years 
ago, on the nose and tail of the bank, while many members of the 
Conservative government at that time actually agreed that we 
needed to take some action, the political will was not there to 
do so.  In fact, the minister of the day, Mr. John Crosbie, said 
as much on television when this government did take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, my comment is that the management of fish stocks is 
a very difficult issue.  In the case of seals, I understand what 
the hon. member is saying and I think eventually we are going to 
have to do something to address this issue.  What that something 
is going to be he knows is a very complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the minister 
for his comments.  I know he has been very active in trying to 
manage the very complicated resources in our oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to be careful in this case that the seal issue 
does not become political.  When the present Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans said to the provincial ministers of 
fisheries in Quebec City the other day that the reason he cannot 
increase the seal cull or seal quota this year is because of 
international trade ramifications, we then begin as politicians 
to manage the resource based on public relations and politics. 
That is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agreed fully in the 1980s with the other governments and the 
other ministers.  If we go back to that with seals we are going 
to repeat the problem.  We may repeat history, but we should not 
repeat current events.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II. Conservation and management of straddling fish stocks 
and highly migratory fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 5. General principles 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and 
highly migratory fish stocks, coastal States and States fishing 
on the high seas shall, in giving effect to their duty to 
co-operate in accordance with the Convention: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) adopt measures to ensure long-term sustainability of 
straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and 
promote the objective of their optimum utilization; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific 
evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore 
stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, 
as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, 
including the special requirements of developing States, and 
taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of 
stocks and any generally recommended international minimum 
standards— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement is intended to assess the impacts of fishing, 
other human activities and environmental factors on target 
stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated 
with or dependent upon the target stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 5 (e) reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Adopt, where necessary, conservation and management measures 
for species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with 
or dependent upon the target stocks, with a view to maintaining 
or restoring populations of such species above levels at which 
their reproduction may become seriously threatened; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 5 (f) concerns pollution and reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) minimize pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or 
abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and 
non-fish species, —and impacts on associated or dependent 
species, in particular endangered species, through measures 
including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of 
selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear 
and techniques; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Articles 5 (g) to (l) read as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) protect biodiversity in the marine environment; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess 
fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do 
not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of 
fishery resources; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) take into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence 
fishers; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(j) collect and share, in a timely manner, complete and accurate 
data concerning fishing activities on, inter alia, vessel 
position, catch of target and non-target species and fishing 
effort, as set out in Annex I, as well as information from 
national and international research programmes; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(k) promote and conduct scientific research and develop 
appropriate technologies in support of fishery conservation and 
management; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(l) implement and enforce conservation and management measures 
through effective monitoring, control and surveillance. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next comes application of the precautionary approach. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. States shall apply the precautionary approach widely to 
conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish 
stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in order to protect the 
living marine resources and preserve the marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, 
unreliable or inadequate.  The absence of adequate scientific 
information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or 
failing to take conservation and management measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement also states, at article 6, paragraph 3, which 
deals with implementing the precautionary approach: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. In implementing the precautionary approach, States shall: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and 
management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific 
information available and implementing improved techniques for 
dealing with risk and uncertainty; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) apply the guidelines set out in Annex II and determine, on 
the basis of the best scientific information available, 
stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if 
they are exceeded, of course; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) take into account, inter alia, uncertainties relating to the 
size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock 
condition in relation to such reference points, levels and 
distribution of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing 
activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as 
well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and 
socio-economic conditions; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) develop data collection and research programmes to assess 
the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent 
species and their environment, and adopt plans which are 
necessary to ensure the conservation of such species and to 
protect habitats of special concern. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4. States shall take measures to ensure that, when reference 
points are approached, they will not be exceeded.  In the event 
that they are exceeded, States shall, without delay, take the 
action determined under paragraph 3 (b) to restore the stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. Where the status of target stocks or non-target or associated 
or dependent species is of concern, States shall subject such 
stocks and species to enhanced monitoring in order to review 
their status and the efficacy of conservation and management 
measures.  They shall revise those measures regularly in the 
light of new information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6. For new or exploratory fisheries, States shall adopt as soon 
as possible cautious conservation and management measures, 
including, inter alia, catch limits and effort limits. Such 
measures shall remain in force until there are sufficient data 
to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the 
long-term sustainability of the stocks; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if a natural phenomenon has significant detrimental 
effects on the status of straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks, states must adopt, as soon as possible, 
conservation and management measures so that fishing activities 
do not make these detrimental effects even worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I had to say on this subject.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour for a member of parliament to be given the 
opportunity not only to speak on his or her bill, but to also 
know that a subcommittee of our peers has deemed it worthy by the 
fact that it is votable.  It is for that reason that I am here 
today with those of us who have supported the bill. I am hopeful 
that it will be moving ahead in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize enough how I believe an issue like this 
really transcends the usual partisan barriers that might 
sometimes inhibit bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many people to thank for getting the bill here in terms 
of being able to tell people what it is all about.  I have been 
most impressed with the help of the Minister of Justice, who has 
been extremely sensitive to this issue, and for the support that 
the parliamentary secretary and members on this side have given 
to this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a couple of votable bills before the House of Commons, 
but particularly this one, says a lot about the necessity for 
filling a gap which I believe exists and that I think most 
reasonable people in Canada believe exists in the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have preferred to have entitled this bill, Evading 
Police, for that is the issue:  a wanton, reckless and at times 
tragic act by an individual using a motor vehicle to escape the 
police.  Sadly, the act often leads to the death or injury of 
either the individual committing it, the police officers who are 
trying to fulfill their duty to protect the public, or some 
innocent bystander who just happens to be in the wrong place at 
the wrong time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced this bill sometime back in October on the heels of 
several incidents that took place in my community, the greater 
Toronto area, whereby the police, in simply doing their jobs, 
were often confronted with situations whereby the wanton acts of 
those who would flee placed the safety of the public at greater 
risk, often winding up with injury or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill has been introduced, there have been a number of 
tragedies that have hit closer to home for me. About four weeks 
ago, a very well-known leader in my community of Pickering, 
Father Ilce Miovski, was killed as he was attending to his 
vehicle.  It happened as a result of someone taking the liberty 
of exceeding speeds that would not otherwise be normal.  The 
driver went out of control and hit Father Miovski's car, killing 
a man who was not just a leader in terms of the community, but a 
leader in the Macedonian community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak for all of parliament, as I have before on this very 
subject, in sending out our heartfelt sorrow to that community 
which lost its leader during the Lenten period of the Macedonian 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to speak to another personal situation that occurred 
in Brampton with the death of Sarah Bowman, again due to a 
reckless act of somebody trying to evade a peace officer.  Sarah 
was only 21 years of age.  I know her family is probably 
listening and looking on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that what we have to say here today is not lost on the 
necessity to fill the void that, if nothing else, serves as a 
lesson or a message to those who, for a simple reason such as 
perhaps a suspended licence, would wilfully flee from a police 
officer and endanger the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House could send that kind of message over time with the 
help and the expertise that is available to us both in committee, 
which I hope the bill will eventually reach, and the input from 
thousands of Canadians who have something to say about this, in 
an effort to ensure that many Canadians down the road are not 
victims of our neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced Bill C-440 as a private members' bill on October 7, 
1998.  Simply put, the bill seeks to amend the Criminal Code by 
creating a specific offence with severe penalties for anyone who, 
while using a motor vehicle, fails to stop for the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first view the bill seems to be the product of common sense. 
To some it may even appear odd; that the Criminal Code should 
already had a provision that specifically prohibits this act. 
The truth is it does not.  Currently, section 249 of the Criminal 
Code, the dangerous operation of motor vehicle provisions, are 
used to combat the act of evading police.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Constable Richard Sonnenberg of the Calgary police lay down 
a spike belt to stop a speeding car that would not pull over, was 
that due to some person overreacting?  Was it due to panic or 
from the driver being scared?  Was it a case of dangerous driving 
or was there really more to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people would think that a person driving at speeds of 160 
or 170 kilometres per hour goes beyond dangerous driving.  It was 
clear the individual did not want to stop for the police and was 
prepared to do quite a bit to get away from them.  Surely that 
very act of avoiding the police should be a specific criminal 
offence with a specific penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most engineers would view the act for what it was, a large 
projectile hurtling at excessive speeds and the excess weight of 
some 3,000 pounds moving down a highway.  Most normal people 
would view this projectile as being driven by an individual who 
has no regard whatsoever for human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate, however, is of little consequence to Constable 
Sonnenberg.  He was killed when that car struck him while trying 
to avoid the spike belt.  The consequence of this was that the 
driver of the car was charged with criminal negligence causing 
death and received a sentence of six years in jail.  Simply six 
years.  Was justice served?  Did that individual pay for his 
actions and for the taking of another person's life?  I really do 
not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current Criminal Code the penalties for dangerous driving 
are as follows:  the act itself is punishable by either 
imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or summary 
conviction; if the act causes injury, the penalty is imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding 10 years; and if the act causes death, 
the penalty is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-440, anyone who operates a motor vehicle to evade a 
police officer is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable 
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.  Anyone who 
commits this offence and in the process injures another person is 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. Anyone 
causing the death of another person in committing this act will 
be liable to imprisonment for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these penalties are sufficient and I believe it is 
time the Criminal Code had a specific provision dealing with 
using a motor vehicle to evade police.  I am not alone in that 
belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many in the House know, last week in my province, the 
province of Ontario, the solicitor general issued the much 
awaited guidelines dealing with regulations on police conduct in 
matters of criminal evasion; better known in the public as simple 
evasion of police or police chases. I think that is a bit of a 
stretch.  Yes, it is a chase, but I do not think we can actually 
say the police are chasing people because they find it is 
particularly interesting or because it is something they do in 
their spare time.  They are doing it because they are upholding 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these regulations are important—and I give some credit to 
the solicitor general for them—without a response at the federal 
level with respect to the Criminal Code, we are in effect 
regulating the police while letting those who evade police off 
scot-free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 16, 1998 I wrote to the minister, and the minister 
is extremely interested in the issue.  I know that for those of 
us who have spent a lot of time on this issue there will be some 
point down the road when we will be dealing with it more 
specifically and more appropriately before the committee.  I look 
forward to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have received the support of several 
associations, obviously the Canadian Police Association, victims' 
rights groups and of course the CAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in what has occurred with respect to recent 
editorials in various papers across the country.  We see that 
some are shifting or swinging to the left while others are a 
little bit to the right.  However, it seems there is a consensus 
evolving in all corners of the media and all regions of the 
country that we cannot continue to inhibit our peace officers, 
our thin blue line, from being able to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers know full well who the people are who should be 
apprehended, who are breaking the law, who are fleeing the public 
and who are engaging in reckless and wanton acts, but impunity is 
the current state of the laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I appeared before the subcommittee on Private Members' 
Business, I read some letters that were very cogent to this 
issue. 
The letters were from Syd Bowman, Jenny Bowman and Karen 
Kalverda, the sister of Sarah Bowman.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity with this bill to right a wrong.  If it 
means the saving of one single life, or the deterrent that might 
avoid someone receiving an injury that could maim them for life, 
then we have indeed done well and discharged our duty here in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to have had the opportunity to bring this bill 
forward, but this is not the Dan McTeague bill, it is the House 
of Commons bill.  This is a bill that belongs to all members of 
the House.  If anybody has any idea how I could move this bill 
forward more quickly, I am certainly game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the bill rightly corresponds to a need in the public 
today.  It is a void that exists within our midst and within our 
judicial system.  I do not believe there is a lack of will to 
respond to this.  The responses we are seeing at the federal and 
provincial levels among concerned groups are putting us in a 
situation where I think we are going to see a very quick response 
to the issue.  Hopefully we will have the necessary legislation 
to really send a message out:  “For God's sake, if you are going 
to try to flee a police officer simply because you are worried, 
think about the consequences.  If you are not going to think 
about the consequences to society in general, think then about 
the selfish consequences to yourself”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in a position right now to speak freely about those I 
know who have been injured.  I know there is a time for 
compassion, but there is also a time to ensure that legislation 
we provide to the House, and which hopefully will wind up in the 
other place, will stand the test of time and will not be struck 
down.  While the bill is a very strong starting point, my 
expectation is to encourage the House to try to develop a bill 
that will meet the standard and tests of not just deterrence, but 
also protecting a single life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to the bill that I think members may not 
have considered.  At first glance some people may say this is 
simply retribution.  Throw them in jail and let us not worry 
about why they did it.  However, there is another aspect that may 
be lost but which should be considered by all hon. members in the 
House as we deliberate on this important bill that affects us in 
each of our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in the act of the chase, in the act of evasion, it is 
possible that the peace officer may ascertain the identity of 
those who would flee and therefore commit, under this act, an 
offence punishable by certain indictable terms in prison.  One of 
the things that could come out of that is simply the 
identification of the person who is fleeing and, if necessary, 
not only have to worry about stopping the vehicle, but if it is 
not a very serious offence, wait until the person has run out of 
gas or until the person is somewhere else and then apprehend 
them.  In effect, this would give the police a tool of not 
necessarily having to engage in a risky chase that might 
otherwise endanger other lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Goodness knows, there is not a single peace officer in the 
country who wishes to endanger another life in order to uphold 
the law.  However, split second decisions have to be made by 
these fine people who are doing their jobs day in and day out and 
who basically ensure that we have peace, order and good 
governance and who safeguard our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really my first foray in the House to explain the bill. 
In the very short time since it was introduced, the deliberation 
of the subcommittee and the interest shown by parliament is 
something for which I am deeply honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A huge consensus is developing in the House.  This is not a 
perfect bill but it is a good bill and I believe it will fit the 
task with perhaps some modification and some change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask and urge the House to move as expeditiously and quickly as 
possible to ensure that we do not have another Father Ilce 
Miovski, another death in the community; that we do not have 
another fatality like the young lady, Sarah Bowman; and that we 
do not continue the carnage and place our police officers in the 
unenviable position of being damned if they do and damned if they 
do not.

new and necessary piece of legislation that will restore what is 
fundamentally absent in our Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to thank the hon. member for Leeds—Grenville 
without whom this bill could not have been possible.  I hope we 
will hear from him a little later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said what I had to say.  I wait patiently and attentively 
to hear what my hon. colleagues have to say about it as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for putting this bill forward.  This 
individual has repeatedly put forth private members' bills and 
motions to this House that are constructive, which have advanced 
the debate and are for the benefit of the public at large.  I 
take my hat off to him for once again putting forth a welcome 
bill.  It deals with a very serious situation which he 
articulated so well in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Death is never welcome, but never more so when it happens in a 
senseless form and takes away an innocent person. My colleague 
mentioned it has been a massive problem in his province in 
particular, but also in the rest of the country.  Many people 
have been killed or maimed when somebody fleeing from the police 
has caused a crash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put the cold hard statistics on the table, between 1991 and 
1997, there were 39 people killed, six of whom were innocent 
people, and 198 people were injured.  I can say as an emergency 
room physician that people get injured very badly in high speed 
accidents.  Many of those people to this day still suffer. They 
are scarred by the trauma that has been inflicted upon them 
because of the high speed chases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put some names to the statistics.  In February 1999, 
Sarah Bowman, 20, of Brampton was hit by a man fleeing from 
police on Queen Street and died of massive internal injuries.  On 
November 15, 1998 Mr. John Gibbons, 47, of Oshawa, a father of 
four, died after his car was broadsided by a pick-up truck being 
chased by the police. On June 18, 1993, Patricia Cavanaugh, 23, 
of Markham died when a stolen mini-van being chased ran a light 
and crashed into her car.  It would take me all day to go through 
this list, but I am not going to.  The point has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation needs to be rectified. The current penalties for 
committing such an offence are inadequate.  I have worked in jail 
both as a correctional officer and as a physician.  I can say 
that many of the people who commit traffic offences such as 
fleeing from police and drunk driving scoff at what they have 
done.  There are people with offence lists as long as their arms 
for repeatedly committing offences for drunk driving and other 
traffic offences such as fleeing from police.  They laugh because 
the penalties are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may criticize this bill for dealing with punitive actions. 
Some may argue that punitive actions do not work, but I can say 
that if the penalty fit the crime, those people would not be 
wilfully and negligently jeopardizing the lives of innocent 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There currently are penalties in the Criminal Code.  A person 
who is sentenced to dangerous driving and is convicted is 
punishable by either imprisonment for a period not exceeding five 
years or a summary conviction.  Summary convictions are nothing. 
If a person causes injury, the penalty for imprisonment is for a 
term not exceeding 10 years.  If the act causes death, the 
penalty for imprisonment is a term not exceeding 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly those are significant penalties.  What the public may 
not understand is that when people are sentenced, they do not 
serve the actual time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no truth in sentencing. In point of fact someone who is 
sentenced for committing an act, outside of first degree murder, 
serves only one-sixth of the sentence before they are eligible 
for parole.  What kind of penalty is it for somebody to be 
sentenced to six years for killing someone and serves only one 
year for that offence?  What kind of message does that send?  If 
somebody takes a life, they need to pay with a commensurate 
penalty.  And they need to pay that price in our jails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-440 provides for good penalties.  If someone is not 
injured, the maximum penalty is extended to two years but if 
someone is hurt, it is a maximum of 10 years.  These are 
conservative and should run consecutively, not concurrently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A concurrent sentence is one which runs in conjunction with 
another.  The person receives no extra penalty.  Absolutely none. 
Nothing.  There is no penalty.  Criminals know that. Furthermore 
criminals also recognize that in the commission of multiple 
offences the penalties are plea bargained away. What kind of 
message is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to lock everybody up but there are certain 
offences that show a wilful negligence for the health and welfare 
of the Canadian public.  The minister needs to put herself in the 
shoes of those family members who are bereaved by the loss of a 
loved one.  The minister has to look at this from both sides. 
That is all we ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support comes from many quarters, from the public, from the 
solicitor general of Ontario and from the police. The police are 
asking for help.  It is not their fault.  The police are doing 
their duty yet in the commission of their duty their hands are 
often tied. The justice system is not supporting the police in 
this country today.  It is causing an erosion of the morale of 
our police officers whom we rely upon and trust to keep us safe. 
We have to give them the same consideration they give us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penalties in Bill C-440 are needed.  We would like increased 
penalties for drunk driving.  We also want truth in sentencing. 
If a person is sentenced to two years, they should serve two 
years.  If a person is sentenced to 10 years they should serve 10 
years.  If sentenced to life, the person should not get out after 
15 years but after 25 years. This is why our party has been 
fighting for the removal of the so-called faint hope clause, 
section 745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure that the police have our support. This 
includes financial support.  We have been seeing for a very long 
time that the RCMP and police forces are not getting the support 
to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP training facility has been closed.   How can we close 
down the training facility for the RCMP?  It is ridiculous.  How 
can we have police officers trying to do their jobs if they are 
not given the hours to prosecute the people they are arresting? 
People are being arrested but then they are released. They cannot 
be prosecuted because the police forces do not have the manpower, 
the time nor the resources to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have repeatedly made our legal system so 
complicated. The conviction process and the process of doing 
police work are convoluted, complex and inefficient. It takes a 
police officer many hours to do a job that would have taken much 
less time years ago.  It presently takes two to three times the 
time to formulate and process a conviction. It is estimated that 
it takes six hours of office work for a police officer to process 
a simple drunk driving conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can police officers do their work with the complexity the 
government and other governments have engineered? If the Minister 
of Justice wants to do something along with supporting Bill C-440 
she needs to work with her provincial counterparts to simplify 
the system now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I compliment my colleague, the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for taking a leadership role with this 
bill. 
It is a bill for personal safety.  It is a bill for the public 
good.  It is a bill that hopefully will end the carnage on our 
streets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I begin 
by complimenting the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for 
introducing this piece of legislation.  We too think it will go 
some distance toward reducing the carnage and tragic accidents on 
our highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it was an act of omission rather than commission by the 
hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I too want to remember 
a very significant, well regarded and well liked high school 
principal in Rosetown, Saskatchewan, who was killed.  He and his 
wife were killed in Saskatoon just a few months ago as a result 
of a high speed police chase.  Let us call it for what it was. 
The people of that relatively small prairie community were 
devastated at the loss. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this enactment, every one commits an offence and is liable 
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years who operates 
a motor vehicle while being pursued by a peace officer in order 
to evade the peace officer and fails to stop the vehicle as soon 
as is reasonable in the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one commits an offence referred to above and thereby 
causes bodily harm to a person or the death of a person commits 
an offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding ten years or life, respectively. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 249 of the Criminal Code deals with the dangerous 
operation of motor vehicles and aircraft.  Under the code anyone 
who does use a vehicle, vessel or aircraft in a dangerous manner 
can be guilty of an indictable offence or summary offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's bill that has been introduced by the member 
would add an offence of flight from a police officer when 
operating a motor vehicle, to be charged and to serve up to two 
years imprisonment.  Anyone who causes bodily harm while in 
flight from police, could serve up to 10 years.  Anyone who 
causes death while in flight from police could face life 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-440 also provides for the prohibition of operation of a 
motor vehicle and for a manslaughter charge, if it applied, in 
the cause of death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background to the bill, as has been noted by the two 
previous speakers, is the recent police chases that have resulted 
in injury and death.  By its nature, fleeing from the police in 
this manner is presently dangerous use of a vehicle and Bill 
C-440 singles out that activity for an actual charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice critic for the New Democratic Party, the hon. member 
for Sydney—Victoria, has met with the national police 
association. We know from those conversations that they are very 
committed to Bill C-440. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus, we are very 
supportive of this legislation.  We extend our congratulations to 
the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for bringing this 
bill forward in the way that he has, working with other members 
of the House, including the justice minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak to the important subject 
of Bill C-440, an act to amend the Criminal Code to strengthen 
the laws involving criminal flight from police pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has always supported crime prevention and police 
forces across the country.  We have continually demanded that the 
government correct the problem of the underfunding that has tied 
the hands of our overworked police forces as they try to deal 
with the growing problem of crime in Canada.  Through funding 
cuts to the RCMP, quotas for prisoner release and a weak youth 
criminal justice act, the Liberals have consistently shown they 
are soft on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am especially pleased to see that one of their own 
backbenchers has actually come up with a piece of legislation 
that will address certain aspects of real crime.  Like the 
members who spoke before me, I would like to personally thank the 
hon. member opposite for proposing this legislation and 
supporting it in a non-partisan effort in the hope that we can 
actually accomplish something in parliament and see this 
legislation enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragic events in the Toronto area last month are but a sad 
reminder that the current laws against flight have not been 
strong enough to deter a criminal from fleeing a pursuing police 
officer.  With the death of Father Ilce Miovski aged 50 on March 
21 and the death of Valeri Kovaliv aged 41 on March 27, it is 
evident that the status quo will no longer suffice.  The death of 
Mr. Kovaliv gave him the most unfortunate title of being the 
fifth innocent civilian in the Toronto area this year to be 
killed following a police chase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to enact tough legislation that would deter flight from 
the police by making an example of these criminals who place 
innocent lives at risk.  Whether it be the lives of the police 
officers who are probably driving outdated, unsafe police 
cruisers due to Liberal cutbacks in policing; whether it be the 
lives of innocent bystanders who could be struck and killed in 
the midst of a car chase; or whether it be the lives of fleeing 
criminals, the fact is that our party holds all life sacred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of human life we need to give the justice system the 
powers needed to properly deal with those who try to escape from 
justice.  In doing so we will be able to send the message to 
criminals that this kind of reckless behaviour will no longer be 
tolerated.  It is our opinion that Bill C-440 will accomplish 
this goal.  Under the provisions of the bill suspects who flee 
police without causing injury will receive a two year sentence. 
Injuring someone while fleeing could result in up to 10 years in 
jail.  Killing someone during a police chase could mean life 
imprisonment.  The possibility of taking a life and facing life 
imprisonment due to their flight from a lesser crime will now 
have to be weighed heavily against the noble route of facing the 
music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more minor aspects of the bill would involve those who cause 
police chases now being charged with crimes including highway 
traffic offences which vary by province, dangerous driving or 
criminal negligence causing bodily harm or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many who rightfully have questions as to the 
effectiveness of police chases.  There are those who feel police 
chases only contribute to unnecessary accidents which can lead to 
injury and death of the innocent general population.  These 
people feel that other means such as road blocks, spike belts or 
helicopter surveillance equipment would be a more effective 
method of tracking and eventually apprehending the criminal 
party.  However, we are speaking of police forces that already 
work with limited resources.  Therefore I am not sure these 
expensive proposals would be at all feasible at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are experts in the field of law enforcement who say that 
prohibiting the police from chasing criminals in automobiles will 
actually create more peril with regard to public safety.  Police 
unions and several prominent police officers have vocally 
defended their right to chase fleeing offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario police will face charges if they break the new high 
speed chase laws.  These laws include among other things a mini 
test the officers will be asked to perform in their heads to 
decide whether or not the chase is worth the risk.  They will be 
asked to consider the neighbourhood and then the likelihood of an 
innocent civilian being injured.  They will be told to strongly 
consider those options such as the aforementioned use of spike 
belts to stop fleeing motorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following similar rules led to the tragic death of a police 
officer.  On October 8, 1993, Calgary police constable Richard 
Sonnenberg was told to lay down a spike belt to stop a car that 
had failed to stop for police.  The car was driving at speeds of 
approximately 170 kilometres per hour.  While attempting to 
deploy the belt the constable was killed instantly by the car 
that had veered into the officer to avoid hitting the spike belt.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why many police officers continue to be in favour of 
police chases.  Mr. Norm Gardner, head of the Toronto Police 
Services Board, warned of the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the public sometimes gets sold the wrong bill of goods.  And 
they think that we won't have these things happen if the police 
do not pursue.  And I can guarantee you, there would be a hell of 
a lot more danger and a lot more tragedy without pursuits. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of Constable Sonnenberg was one of these tragedies. 
The criminal who killed Constable Sonnenberg could also have 
easily killed a child or an elderly person.  This person could 
have escaped altogether and gone on to commit other horrible 
crimes that could have been prevented through immediate 
incarceration following a successful police pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that another crime was committed as the man 
who killed Constable Sonnenberg was only sentenced to six years 
for criminal negligence causing death.  Under the provisions of 
Bill C-440 this reckless criminal would have received life 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police pursuit is not the answer to correcting the problem of 
flight and the subsequent police chase.  Nevertheless, it is the 
most effective means of criminal apprehension that we currently 
have.  Because of honest completion it effectively ends a 
criminal's threat to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggest is that if we allow for police pursuit in 
addition to the enforcement of Bill C-440, we will be legislating 
a strong deterrent to the criminal population.  This strong 
deterrent may force second thoughts in the minds of criminals 
involved in the aforementioned crimes.  Such thoughts may have 
prevented these tragedies and the victims who lost their lives 
might still be with us today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to join the chorus of members congratulating the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his work on this issue.  I sense a 
bit of a consensus building here.  I am optimistic that can be 
motivated and activated to get the bill passed as quickly as we 
possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially Bill C-440 would make it a criminal offence to use 
an automobile while being pursued by a peace officer in order to 
evade a peace officer and fail to stop as soon as it is 
reasonable to do so.  A person who does that would face a prison 
term not exceeding two years.  In addition, anyone who uses an 
automobile to evade police in the process and injures another 
person would be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 
10 years.  Anyone causing death would be liable to imprisonment 
for life.  Those are certainly very serious consequences, but 
they are warranted because the act of evading police is a very 
serious action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992 in Ontario alone there have been 30 people killed as 
a result of people using automobiles to evade police pursuit.  In 
the example that has been alluded to of Constable Richard 
Sonnenberg in Alberta, it should be pointed out that the person 
that hit him was fleeing police because his licence was under 
suspension.  It is a situation where in the mindset of people it 
is acceptable to do whatever it takes to evade police independent 
of or not accepting that there are any consequences to that 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions that have to be made in police chases are very 
complex.  They are impacted in a sense because of the very short 
time line in which they have to be made.  I feel we are doing a 
great disservice to the police, the men and women who are 
attempting to preserve and safeguard the public, if we fail to 
clearly acknowledge that the responsibility for these accidents 
and the subsequent deaths and countless injuries belongs to the 
felon who is wilfully evading the law. The focus of Bill C-440 is 
the activity of evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, who put 
it so eloquently, it is “a wanton, reckless and at times tragic 
act by an individual using a motor vehicle to escape from the 
police”.  We are talking about focusing on the act of fleeing 
and making sure that act has consequences which would force 
people to consider them before they engage in that very dangerous 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that any time a driver fails to stop for a 
police officer there is the potential for a dangerous situation 
to unfold.  Individuals who choose to flee from police by means 
resulting in a high speed chase cause inordinate risk to the 
safety of the public and the police, meriting special criminal 
sanction.  That is what Bill C-440 is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police pursuits cannot be completely eliminated.  The hon. 
member talked about the issue surrounding that.  They are no easy 
solutions; they are complex matters.  They cannot be regulated or 
controlled by policing statutes to the point where motorists will 
never be at risk. 
There will always be situations where this type of police 
response will be appropriate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Licensing and other forms of provincial control and regulation 
do not provide a sufficient deterrent.  Current dangerous driving 
provisions of the Criminal Code are inadequate to deal with this 
action.  Criminal records resulting from such conviction do not 
specifically relate to the relevant fact of the nature of the 
offence and the offender's specific intent to flee the police. As 
has been pointed out, criminal sanctions for current offences 
involving police pursuits are also inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many any factors in the decision to begin or continue 
a pursuit which is always made with public safety in mind.  All 
too frequently incidents do occur where police officers and 
members of the public have been seriously harmed or killed 
because someone failed to stop.  Policies and procedures 
governing police chases are the responsibility of individual 
police agencies and provincial governments.  While those policies 
are not under the jurisdiction of the federal government, again 
as has been pointed out, putting this legislation in the Criminal 
Code provides the teeth that provincial governments need to put 
in place their regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about recognizing the rule of law in society.  I 
have lived in countries where this is not the case.  I can assure 
hon. members that respect and trust for the authority of the 
police are critical for a well functioning society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago it was not considered serious to consume alcohol 
and jump into a vehicle and drive home.  I spent the Easter break 
talking to students in various schools.  I can assure the House 
there has been a fundamental value shift in the minds of young 
people in Canada that drinking and driving is no longer seen as 
an acceptable option.  We need a very similar value shift with 
regard to fleeing the police.  We need to instil in the minds of 
Canadians that the act of fleeing the police is a criminal 
offence with criminal consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, too many police officers and civilians have been 
injured or killed because someone chose to flee from the police. 
While there is not a single solution to this problem, making such 
behaviour a criminal offence will deter some and send a strong 
message to others that such dangerous behaviour will not be 
tolerated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today and to take 
this opportunity to speak to Bill C-440, introduced by the hon. 
member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say this bill strikes a chord with me just like it 
does for many Canadians. All opinion polls in Canada show 
clearly the great trust Canadians have for our police forces 
throughout Canada. These polls show a level of trust that is 
perhaps one of the highest in the western world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of fleeing the police is one that our Criminal Code 
does not address sufficiently.  I think my colleague from 
Leeds—Grenville, who just finished speaking, stated it quite 
eloquently when he described how the Criminal Code dealt with 
individuals driving motor vehicles whom the police were 
attempting to intercept; what happened when accidents occurred, 
when injuries were caused and in some cases death; and how the 
Criminal Code was unfortunately lacking in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-440 is an act to amend the Criminal Code with respect to 
using a motor vehicle and failing to stop for a police officer, 
or in legal terms flight, as has already been mentioned by other 
members on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been stated, the act of fleeing often leads to 
death or injury to the individual committing it, to the police 
officers who are trying to fulfil their lawful duty to protect 
the public, or in many cases to innocent bystanders who just 
happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first view the bill may seem to be the product of common 
sense.  It is to me and, as we have heard in the House, to many 
other members. 
To some it may even appear to be odd that our Criminal Code 
should already have a provision to deal precisely with this.  It 
does not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had personal experience, not by having been injured by 
someone fleeing the police and driving a motor vehicle, obviously 
not by having been killed, but in my former life before entering 
politics I was deputy commissioner for police ethics for the 
province of Quebec.  In that role, for over nine years I had to 
deal with a significant number of complaints from families who 
had a family member who was a victim or was killed because of the 
precise event that is described in this legislation and which 
this bill attempts to deal with.  They were very upset that the 
police did not bring stronger criminal charges against the 
individual who was operating the motor vehicle and was attempting 
to flee police who in the performance of their lawful duties were 
attempting to intercept them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As deputy commissioner I had the legal obligation to inform 
those complainants time after time that unfortunately the police 
and the justice department had done exactly what they were 
lawfully authorized to do under the Criminal Code in the manner 
in which they dealt with that suspect who had fled. It was very 
difficult to have to tell a family who had had a family member 
injured or killed that that was the only way in which the justice 
department and the police force could deal with the individual 
who had caused that injury or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not something I enjoyed doing, obviously.  It is one of 
the reasons why I am very happy to support the bill of the member 
for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back specifically to the bill.  It has been 
mentioned in the House that since 1991 at least 39 people have 
been killed under the circumstances that this bill addresses. 
Thirty-nine people are a lot.  Were these cases of dangerous 
driving, or was there more to it?  Most people in Canada think 
that when someone is driving at speeds that pass the legal limit 
in an attempt to flee police officers who are within their legal 
right to intercept them goes beyond what we would consider to be 
dangerous driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear when someone is not interested and is not 
willing to stop when a police officer attempts to intercept them 
and they know it is a police officer.  We are not talking about 
someone who thinks it is an unidentified car that is attempting 
to intercept them.  They have no idea. They may think a car 
jacking is under way and they attempt to save themselves. We are 
not talking about those circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about circumstances where the police are clearly 
identified and the individual operating the motor vehicle knows 
beyond a reasonable doubt that it is a police officer who is 
attempting to intercept them and that individual continues to 
attempt to flee or refuses to stop. Those are the circumstances 
we are talking about. We cannot term that as simply dangerous 
driving.  It goes beyond that. It is wilful disrespect and 
disregard for human life, which is something no Canadian shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk a lot about Canadian values.  One of the highest 
Canadian values is precisely the respect and regard for human 
life.  We can link it with what I said when I talked about the 
fact that poll after poll after poll has shown that Canadians 
enjoy a high trust of our police services.  The very act of 
wilfully fleeing a police officer in the lawful performance of 
his or her duty in attempting to intercept an individual requires 
the strongest response on the part of our government, on the part 
of Canadian society and on the part of our institutions, 
including our justice institutions, through our Criminal Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very difficult to find an ordinary Canadian on the 
street who would say that this bill is not justified and that 
this bill does not really address the issue and who would not 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Canadian 
Police Association for its support for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not aware if the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police 
supports this bill, but I have to say, knowing many police chiefs 
across Canada, I believe I could be safe in saying that there is 
probably support for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am someone who is known both within my riding and beyond its 
boundaries in matters of justice to be a proponent of prevention, 
rehabilitation and in the last resort, retribution.  However, I 
feel that this is a bill which needs to be supported.  This is a 
bill whose time has come and I support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conclude my remarks on this, Madam Speaker, I believe 
you would find consent in the House to have the motion for second 
reading of Bill C-440 deemed adopted, allowing said bill to 
proceed to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
agreement to proceed in such a way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

committee)

Standing Order 24(1).
