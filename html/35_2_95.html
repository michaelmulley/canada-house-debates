<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RESUMPTIONOFDEBATEONADDRESS">RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 5, 1996 consideration of the 
motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his Speech at the opening of the session; and of the 
amendment and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Co-operation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today as Minister for International 
Co-operation and Minister responsible for Francophonie to add my 
voice to the debate on the address in reply to the speech from the 
throne.
<P>
	Needless to say, it is a great day for a member of Parliament 
when he addresses the House of Commons for the first time as a 
minister. I feel especially honoured since it is the first time a 
francophone from outside Quebec has been appointed to the 
position of Minister responsible for Francophonie, and I intend to 
do a good job of representing Canada at the upper levels of the 
international French-speaking community.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to thank the Right Hon. Prime Minister 
for appointing me, for giving the great honour and privilege of 
serving the people of my country.
<P>
	I should emphasize the contribution of the people of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, without whom, of course, I would 
not be here as either a member or a minister. I am very grateful to 
them and I would like to say that I will remain first and foremost 
the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	They sent me to Parliament as their representative and, even 
though I am now a minister, I will continue to represent them 
faithfully at every opportunity.
<P>
	Last week marked the 30th anniversary of my arrival in the 
House of Commons. I have spent 20 years in politics and, as you 
know, I also used to work here as a  public servant. As I said before, 
I first set foot in the House of Commons on October 25, 1966 as a 
waiter, and I was lucky. I now stand before you on this November 
1, 1996 addressing the House as a minister.
<P>
	In the past two years, I had the opportunity and honour to 
perform the duties of chief government whip. Again, I must tell 
you that it was for me an unforgettable experience, and I thank the 
Prime Minister for entrusting me with that task.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for 
Stormont-Dundas, who was appointed chief government whip a 
few days ago, and wish him the best of luck. Needless to say, his 
personal experience in a previous incarnation will probably help 
him do a good job. I mean, of course, his personal experience as a 
hockey coach, not as a referee.
<P>
	I also wish to congratulate the government on its excellent 
agenda as outlined in the throne speech, which can be summed up 
as putting government finances on a healthier footing, reviving 
Canada's economy and creating jobs. Canadian interest rates are 
now at their lowest level in 30 years.
<P>
	Over 600,000 jobs have been created since the last election, and 
Canada will soon be able to function without borrowing money. 
This is a rather spectacular achievement for a country whose public 
finances were in poor shape just a few years ago.
<P>
	I want to take a few moments to tell you about the francophonie. 
Whether at the municipal, provincial or federal level, I always did 
my best to show my commitment to the francophone community. 
In 1983, I was the founding president of the Ontario section of the 
Association internationale des parlementaires de langue française. 
Until my appointment, a few days ago, I was the parliamentary 
secretary general of the AIPLF in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I also had the honour of receiving, on two occasions, the Ordre 
de la Pléiade from this illustrious organization. This says 
something about my will to help preserve and promote French 
language and culture at home and around the world. Representing 
Canada among the francophonie's official circles will give me an 
opportunity to pursue my commitment on the international scene 
and to continue the work of my predecessors.
<P>
	As a Franco-Ontarian, I will stress to the international 
community the contribution made by all francophones in Canada, 
whether they live in Quebec or in Ontario, which is my home 
province and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5994"> 5994 </A></B>
<P>
that of other parliamentarians, including the members for 
Ottawa-Vanier and Stormont-Dundas.
<P>
	I thank and congratulate the hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel for doing so much for the francophone 
community. I hope to rise to the occasion and to continue the work 
he has done since he first arrived in this House.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	A few days ago, during my trip to Vietnam, my first one as 
minister, I had discussions concerning the francophone summit to 
be held in Hanoi next year and to which we will make a major 
contribution. I firmly intend to support a more politically involved 
francophonie.
<P>
	We can do more than to protect language and culture. We can be 
a leader among French-speaking countries and do our share to 
ensure global security.
<P>
	As pointed out in the speech from the throne, and I quote: ``In an 
interdependent world, security means taking an active role on the 
international stage''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why is it that Canada is so involved in international 
co-operation? Since our aid program started from the 1950s 
international co-operation has been a principal vocation for 
Canada. It has emerged from our shared values of justice, equity, 
democracy and freedom. International co-operation is our means of 
working together in practical ways to build a world that is safer, 
more prosperous and more humane.
<P>
	This is a role that has manifested itself throughout the years. I 
remember as a child in school where missionary work was 
emphasized, where children were encouraged to contribute 
portions of their lunch money, instead of buying candy bars and 
soda pop. We were asked to make small contributions to 
missionary work at that time, many of them organized by the 
church of which I am a member. We were encouraged to do that, to 
aid people in Africa and in China and so on. I remember in 
particular the China effort. That is the heritage from which we 
undertake our work in international co-operation.
<P>
	For a middle power such as Canada, development assistance is a 
way of protecting our values as well as contributing to global 
security. It is a way of contributing to the world community, a kind 
of ticket enabling Canada to play its unique role in the major 
international organizations, the United Nations, the 
Commonwealth, la francophonie, the IMF, the World Bank and the 
development banks of Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is a way of 
being a global citizen.
<P>
	International co-operation also helps Canada influence events in 
the world in a positive way. This week, for example, the United 
Nations secretary general named Mr. Raymond Chrétien, Canada's 
ambassador to the U.S., as  his own special envoy to central Africa. 
Mr. Chrétien will work with central African leaders on finding a 
solution to the conflict that now threatens hundreds of thousands of 
people in Zaire and in the great lakes region of Africa.
<P>
	That kind of appointment shows that Canada and Canada's 
representatives have credibility where it counts. I would call that 
the Pearsonian heritage. That credibility comes from having made 
an international contribution through our aid program.
<P>
	Since 1994 Canada has contributed money to organizations such 
as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Red Cross, 
UNICEF and others to help ease the suffering of refugees and 
displaced people, to find homes for orphans following the genocide 
in Rwanda two years ago. Our peacekeeping efforts helped keep the 
airports open in Kigali during the critical period in 1994 which 
enabled relief flights to land, providing food, medicine and so on to 
the starving people and to the wounded. All this work means that 
we are listened to when we raise our voices in the international 
council. Other countries know that we walk our talk in the world.
<P>
	However, aid is not only responding to emergencies such as the 
one in central Africa. Development assistance is also a long term 
investment which has already paid off dramatically. Let me give a 
few examples.
<P>
	In literacy and life expectancy the developing world has 
achieved in 30 years what it took the industrialized world 100 years 
to accomplish. Eighty per cent of the world's children now have 
been vaccinated against the six most infectious diseases and small 
pox has been almost completely eradicated. Since 1960 life 
expectancy in developing countries has risen from 47 to 61 years. 
Two-thirds of the world's people now know how to read, which is 
up from half in 1960. We must keep this long term investment 
precisely because it is delivering results and because human 
development is the best guarantee to global security.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The safety of each and everyone of us is related to several 
national factors such as the economy, the environment, social 
security and political stability. In the long term, however, it is the 
world context that will shape the world in which our children will 
live. This context will be determined, to a large extent, by how we 
will have met the most serious challenge of our time: world 
poverty.
<P>
	I encountered these realities as soon as I took up my new 
position. I saw that even countries with impressive economies like 
China have huge pockets of poverty, in particular in the 
northeastern area of that country, where the Canadian International 
Development Agency has set up its community projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5995"> 5995 </A></B>
<P>
	Poverty reduction is a key element of Canada's development 
co-operation. Furthermore, it is partly as a result of Canada's 
influence that this has become a leading objective in international 
institutions. I intend to address this issue next November 7 with 
representatives of the World Bank when they are here to present 
their report on this serious matter.
<P>
	In order to fight poverty effectively and contribute to sustainable 
development in developing countries, the Canadian International 
Development Agency has established 6 broad program priorities. 
The first priority is to meet basic human needs, and 25 per cent of 
Canadian assistance falls into this category. These basic needs are, 
of course, food, potable water, education and health.
<P>
	According to UNICEF's own evaluation, our contribution of 
approximately $24 million to their programs meant that, in 1995, 
over 3 million children were spared the mental impairment caused 
by a lack of iodine in their diet. UNICEF's executive director 
personally congratulated the Prime Minister of Canada for his 
leadership and that of his government in this area.
<P>
	The second priority is the integration of women. Whether you 
are talking about food production, health or education, all studies 
have shown that when women are helped, the entire family is 
helped. Canada is one of the countries taking part in efforts focused 
on primary education in Africa known as the education for all 
initiative. This initiative is designed to improve the quality of the 
instruction given young girls in 15 African countries.
<P>
	The third priority is human rights, democracy and good 
governance. In a few days I am going to Haiti, where, under this 
heading, we are supporting the efforts of that country's society by 
providing assistance with elections, as well as with police training 
and reform of the legal system, among other things.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the area of the environment, CIDA supports the tree growers 
co-operative project in India. India loses some 15,000 square 
kilometres of forest per year. That is an area of forest about the size 
of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	Since 1993 CIDA has funded local co-operatives to plant trees 
on marginal land and as a result of the tree planting effort Indian 
villagers now have new skills, improved health and greater food 
security.
<P>
	The fifth area is private sector development. An example is the 
six year old Peru-Canada fund which does good development work 
and at the same time has positive economic spinoffs for Canada. It 
is a counterpart fund, which means that CIDA provides funds to 
Peruvian companies to buy the Canadian equipment they need. The 
Peru-Canada fund is a win-win combination. It is important for us 
to note this. It has stimulated economies in hundreds of 
impoverished Peruvian communities and at the same time it 
protects Canadian jobs by financing the export of Canadian goods.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The sixth area of priority is that of infrastructure services. This is 
an important sector because it emphasizes that with 
environmentally sound infrastructure services, emphasis on poorer 
groups and improving the building capacity of other countries we 
can make life better.
<P>
	I want to speak briefly of the relevance of international 
assistance for Canada. International assistance is not simply 
charity. It also has short and long term relevance to the Canadian 
economy. Every dollar invested in the developing world yields over 
$5 of return in the form of Canadian goods and services, jobs, 
contracts and export sales, although that is not the reason for 
giving. Canadians should know that even on that score there is 
enormous benefit for Canada. Over 70 cents of every development 
assistance dollar is disbursed to Canadians and it results in over 
36,000 jobs per year for Canadians. Canadian food aid alone 
contributes 5,700 jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take the next few minutes to tell you about 
CIDA's partners. In order to implement our programs, we turn to 
the expertise, talent, and knowledge of partners known as NGOs, 
non-governmental organizations, which include universities, 
colleges-over a hundred-, co-operatives, associations, and of 
course certain companies. There are over 2,000 working with us in 
one way or another.
<P>
	Partnerships between the government sector and other sectors 
that arise through international development efforts have, in turn, 
led to horizontal partnerships, alliances between organizations and 
agencies that enrich and consolidate the contributions of all 
involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have outlined the development assistance program and what it 
is doing to help build a safer world and how it provides benefits 
both overseas and here in Canada. Now I would like to talk about 
how we as a government are managing the process. It is not enough 
to do good; we must do it well.
<P>
	The Canadian International Development Agency and its 
hundreds of partners, organizations, firms and institutions have 
earned a distinguished reputation for doing good and doing it well. 
To help these partnerships endure and flourish and to help new ones 
take root, CIDA must be able to engage the Canadian suppliers of 
goods and services who offer the best quality and the best price. To 
ensure this happens I intend to do my best to improve the already 
good contracting procedures which have already been opened up by 
my predecessor and others and I will be pushing to modernize the 
process and push it forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5996"> 5996 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, CIDA also needs to find new ways to reach out and 
involve young Canadians in international development. Today's 
young people will lead the world in the next century and it is 
important that they be well prepared and that they be cognizant 
of our role as a nation and our role in international development. 
It will be up to them in the 21st century to carry forward Canada's 
unique role in international co-operation.
<P>
	I want to conclude by reiterating my thanks to the electors of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for the excellent opportunity given 
to me and to the Prime Minister who has assigned me this 
formidable task of Minister of International Co-operation and 
Minister responsible for Francophonie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member spent quite a bit of time patting himself on the back for 
what a wonderful job he has done representing his constituents and 
for the tremendous job the government has done, he claims, on 
reducing the deficit and getting the whole country into such 
splendid order.
<P>
	The fact is that if the Reform Party had not been sitting on this 
side of the House opposite them, we would still be mired in the 
days of Liberal tax and spend. There is absolutely no doubt about 
that. Everybody across the country knows that if it were not for 
Reform having brought the issues of the debt and deficit to the 
notice of the public during the 1993 campaign, the Liberal 
government would not have done a darn thing about it.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I was at a meeting in the Vancouver area and the member from 
Halifax was present. I heard her say to the audience: ``As a tax and 
spend Liberal, I crashed and burned with the way the Minister of 
Finance has handled the finances of the country''. She crashed and 
burned. What a tremendously visual thing that is. Her entire being 
as a Liberal was destroyed by what was being done by the finance 
minister. He would not have done it had it not been for the public 
pressure built by the Reform Party of Canada, the Alberta 
government, following up with the Harris government in Ontario.
<P>
	The Liberals have addressed the deficit to a degree and let us be 
sure, they certainly fiddled the figures a bit by increasing the 
deficit in their first year. Even if we agree they have done 
something, what they have subjected the country to is the torture of 
a thousand small cuts. It has been cut here, cut there, cut here. 
Nobody has had the time to heal and get on with their lives. The 
public resolve has been broken down to fix the problems. The 
Liberals should have done it rapidly and quickly the way it was 
done in New Zealand; amputate entire departments so that we 
could get the budget balanced quickly and get on with our lives. 
This was not done.
<P>
	The Liberals take credit for some of this but in fact while they 
have fiddled and made this torture of a  thousand small cuts, our 
debt has built up almost to the $600 billion level, and that has eaten 
away at our social programs. By the year 2007 they will have cut $7 
billion from health care transfers because they will not get on top of 
the problem fast enough.
<P>
	The Liberal claim that all sorts of jobs have been created is 
baloney to the 1.8 million people across the country who are out of 
work, the 18 per cent to 24 per cent of young people who are out of 
work. I am lucky because in my riding it is only around 4 per cent. I 
am in an area where the youth are well employed.
<P>
	Since the hon. member is so proud of his representation for his 
constituents, could he please give me some examples of how he has 
represented his constituents in his votes? There are plenty of 
examples here of how he has suppressed his colleagues when he 
was the whip and forced them to toe the party line. I am sure his 
constituents would love to hear how he perhaps canvassed their 
views and represented them in this place as opposed to representing 
the party line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a rather interesting set of 
comments. The hon. member criticized the government for not 
cutting enough and for cutting over too many areas, as he put it. In 
his view, if I can summarize it, we should have cut an entire 
department at once. I believe he said that to amputate entire 
departments would have been better.
<P>
	The member is entitled to his views. However, there should be a 
little consistency in the Reform Party. I know that is asking for a lot 
but let me remind everyone of the so-called taxpayers budget. This 
document is entitled: ``The Reform Party's Plan to Balance the 
Federal Budget and Provide Social and Economic Security for the 
21st Century''. It has quotes from the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The document is best remembered as the budget that would not 
add up. The hon. member for Mississauga South, an accountant, 
did some mathematical calculations of this document a year or two 
back. As an accountant he knows how to count. He indicated to us 
that the numbers did not jibe but let us not dwell on that. Let us talk 
about the fact that the Reform Party says that we should have 
amputated an entire department and not cut all over the place. Here 
is what the so-called taxpayers budget in brief said.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	Here are the cuts Reform wanted to make: social security 
spending cut 15 per cent; total cash transfers to the provinces cut 24 
per cent; other transfers cut 6 per cent; equalization cut 35 per cent; 
Canada assistance plan, welfare, cut 35 per cent; health cut 11 per 
cent; post-secondary education cut 9 per cent. I am reading from 
the Reform Party document which states we should not cut all over 
the place.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How about seniors?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5997"> 5997 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I will get to seniors in a minute. My colleague 
asked about seniors. Seniors, excluding CPP, cut 15 per cent. The 
unemployment insurance cut 22 per cent. Aboriginal programs cut 
24 per cent. Other social security spending cut 11 per cent.
<P>
	Let us get into some of the other stuff here. Transfers and 
assistance to businesses cut 76 per cent. International assistance, 
my department presumably, to be cut 27 per cent. Other subsidies 
cut 24 per cent. The CBC to be cut 36 per cent. The Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation to be cut 24 per cent. Other 
crown corporations cut 21 per cent. Defence to be cut 9 per cent. 
All other department spending to be cut by 20 per cent. And the 
member across said we should have amputated in one place and 
spared everything else. The leader of the Reform Party wanted to 
amputate the head.
<P>
	The member in his remarks asked me to prove to him that I have 
represented my constituents well. I do not intend to do that. The 
electors of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell do not need to justify to 
a member of the Reform Party their choice for their member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	I would not have raised this but the member has raised the 
proposition so I will have to answer. In the last election in my 
riding the people blessed me with a support of 80.2 per cent of all 
votes cast. The Reform Party in my riding received 7 per cent of the 
votes cast. The Reform Party and the Conservative Party together 
would still not get the 15 per cent to get the electoral return back. I 
would not have bragged about this but he is the one who brought it 
up in terms of how I represent my electors.
<P>
	My constituents have elected me at the municipal, provincial and 
federal levels continuously for 20 years; three times municipally, 
once provincially and three times at the federal level with the 
results I just enunciated. It is up to them, not the member across the 
way, to decide whether I do an adequate, satisfactory or better job. I 
intend to be accountable to the electors of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and least of all to the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Jonquière.
<P>
	In 1994, the first throne speech by the present government made 
no mention of changing the Canadian federation. The Prime 
Minister had stated that he wanted to put constitutional quarrels on 
ice. Those are his words.
<P>
	It is obvious today that he has changed his mind. In the throne 
speech of February 27, 1996, which we are discussing today, the 
government justifies the proposed actions by referring to the desire 
for change expressed by Quebecers in the referendum, stating that 
``this desire for change is broadly shared across Canada''.
<P>
	Here are a few of the changes announced by the federal Liberals 
in the last throne speech, which they have been attempting to 
implement ever since, without any great success, I might add. First 
of all, the government proposes to limit federal spending power in 
areas that are exclusively provincial. We are in agreement in 
principle, up to that point.
<P>
	The conditions of application are where it starts to get 
complicated. They require new cost shared programs to have the 
consent of the majority of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	First of all, the government is not announcing its withdrawal 
from areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, as Quebec has 
called for. On the contrary, the federal government is imposing its 
right to interfere by setting certain limits, including consent by the 
majority of provinces. It requires the consent of six provinces 
before accepting implementation of any new program.
<P>
	This limitation of spending power is much less than the proposal 
contained in the Charlottetown accord. In it, the federal 
government was required to have the agreement of seven provinces 
representing 50 per cent of the population. In addition, this 
limitation was entrenched in the Constitution.
<P>
	Today, the federal government makes no mention whatsoever of 
putting this into the Constitution. It could be changed at the whim 
of some subsequent federal government, like any mere law. The 
provinces will never accept such an offer.
<P>
	The most flagrant example is that of the daycare centres which 
the Liberals wanted to put into place. Although this program is 
included in the famous red book of the last campaign, the federal 
government has never managed to obtain the consent of the 
majority of the provinces. So, in order to justify the non-fulfilment 
of this campaign promise, the Prime Minister is dumping the blame 
onto the provinces, saying they are the ones turning it down. It is 
their fault because they cannot reach agreement. How did the Prime 
Minister expect to fulfil this campaign promise, knowing full well 
that the provinces would never accept such an offer?
<P>
	The Prime Minister speaks of changing Canadian federation but 
he could not have done a worse job of it. Another change in the 
Canadian federation proposed by the Prime Minister is to entrench 
the concept of distinct society and a veto for all in the Constitution.
<P>
	First of all, the distinct society proposed by the federal 
government was less than Meech and less than Charlottetown. To 
the Government of Quebec, the distinct society concept is obsolete. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5998"> 5998 </A></B>
<P>
Any new negotiations with Canada must, from now on, be from 
people to people, from nation to nation.
<P>
	Furthermore, we will never go along with the compromise 
solution proposed in a bogus bill or some strategy to recognize 
Quebec as no more than the homeland of French language and 
culture. This interpretation means nothing at all. It provides no 
constitutional guarantees and certainly no legal powers. The 
federal Liberals would have been better off proposing nothing at 
all.
<P>
	On top of that, there will now be a regional veto, snuggled 
through the House in Bill C-110. This bill takes us from bad to 
worse. To bring about any constitutional change at all, the federal 
government will no longer need the consent of seven provinces 
representing 50 per cent of the population but all the provinces. 
That is some constitutional change. There will be no more 
constitutional changes. It will be impossible.
<P>
	Because of these recent changes made by the Prime Minister and 
the federal Minister of Intergovernmental affairs, from now on it 
will be impossible for Quebec to make any constitutional 
arrangements without the prior consent of all Canadian provinces.
<P>
	Contrary to Quebec's stated expectations, other Canadians 
consider that if Quebecers remain in Canada, they should be just 
like other Canadians and submit to majority rule, without any 
special rights or status. To a Quebecer, this is unthinkable. All 
efforts of the past 30 years were focused on letting Quebecers make 
their own decisions on a number of important issues within the 
Canadian federation.
<P>
	In the sixties, Liberal Premier Jean Lesage said we should be 
``maître chez nous'', and his successor, Daniel Johnson senior of 
the Union nationale said it was equality or independence. Another 
Liberal Premier, the late Robert Bourassa, spent more than 15 years 
asking for cultural sovereignty and then distinct society.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, all these attempts at constitutional change were to 
fail. English Canada's no became progressively louder. Today, the 
Chrétien government is trying to make us go through this again. He 
keeps saying that everything is fine, everything is all right, but the 
results show the opposite is true. He even says he has done enough, 
and that now the ball is in the other court.
<P>
	In spite of all these failures, undeniably, Quebecers want an 
independent Quebec within a strong Canada. That this phrase has 
became famous is no accident. There is an element of truth in it. 
Even if we have been unable to agree on fundamental political 
issues for the past 30 years, we and Canadians have established 
important economic ties. The jobs of hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians depend on Quebec, and vice versa.
<P>
	In this connection, I would like to discuss a matter that is very 
important to me, and I am sure, could be instrumental in settling all 
constitutional quarrels once and for all. In its plan for sovereignty, 
Quebec is proposing to the rest of Canada a natural and democratic 
change that would lead to a new partnership agreement between 
our two peoples.
<P>
	The plan for Quebec favours economic association with the rest 
of Canada, in order to maintain the unfettered mobility of goods, 
services, capital and individuals. Just think, every 15 minutes we in 
Quebec buy one million dollars' worth of goods manufactured in 
the rest of Canada. That is why it is important for both parties to 
maintain these economic ties.
<P>
	The plan for Quebec also specifies that the Canadian dollar will 
remain Quebec's legal currency. That is the most beneficial 
solution for both Quebec and Canada, especially because of the 
significant volume of trade between the two states.
<P>
	According to the latest estimates, trade between Quebec and 
Canada is worth over $65 billion, including close to $50 billion 
with Ontario alone. This would be a concrete way of ensuring trade 
stability for both Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	Canada's economic space will be maintained, because it is in the 
interest of Quebec and the rest of Canada to maintain it. It could be 
managed by joint organizations, including a council of 
representatives from both parties, who would discuss issues of 
common interest. A joint tribunal would be responsible for settling 
disputes, including trade disputes.
<P>
	There could also be a partnership council made up of Quebec and 
Canadian ministers equally, as well as a parliamentary assembly of 
delegates from both sovereign states. These two institutions would 
allow us to decide to act jointly in other areas and to share our 
resources.
<P>
	The major difference with the current situation is that we would 
always have the choice of acting either independently or jointly 
with Canada, within the partnership, and neither party would be 
able to impose its rules and its views on the other. That is what a 
true partnership means.
<P>
	To achieve this goal, we, of course, need the agreement of the 
rest of Canada. As far as the basic elements of the economic 
association are concerned, the vast majority of English-Canadians 
think an arrangement with Quebec is inevitable. It would be in 
everyone's interest to build an economic and political partnership 
in which there will be minimal friction and maximum co-operation 
to our mutual advantage, an environment in which we can all aspire 
to a better future.
<P>
	That is the kind of arrangement the federal government should 
seriously consider, instead of proposing all sorts of initiatives that 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
are doomed to failure and dragging out the dreadful constitutional 
debate.

Montreal into an economic backwater''.

expect Montreal to realize its economic potential to an extent 
necessary to create the number of jobs that it so badly needs,' the

	It is clear by now that it is the separatists' own drive to take 
Quebec out of Canada that is creating the problem. There is a lack 
of jobs, specifically in Montreal, but I presume throughout Quebec. 
I wonder if the hon. member would be willing to support the 
subamendment of the Reform Party, which we are supposedly 
debating today, which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and, in particular, recognition that it is the separatist movement in Quebec that 
threatens the economy of Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his question. For the last 30 years there have been 
discussions between Quebec and Canada to try to find a decent 
settlement for Quebec. However, every time this has been tried it 
has failed because some parts of Canada refuse to recognize the 
distinct society and the distinct way of the Quebec people.
<P>
	We have to find a solution. What we need now is a new deal 
between Canada and Quebec. That new deal, because it is a 
proposition, could be a sovereignty partnership between the two 
parts of Canada. Canada and Quebec could be allies.
<P>
	When I visit the rest of Canada I always tell them that, yes, I am 
a sovereignist, yes, I think that some day Quebec will be a 
sovereign state. I also tell them that my second best country after 
sovereignty will always be Canada. People like that. People around 
the country are starting to understand.
<P>
	The Liberal member on the other side of the House may not 
agree, but I have met academics around the country and discussed 
this with them. Some of them thought it made sense. People are 
sick and tired of 30 years of nothing going on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To answer the hon. member's question, Montreal has always 
been left out in the cold. Historically, whenever the federal 
government has made economic decisions, it was always to the 
detriment of Montreal. The government wants to make a nice big 
village out of Montreal, but it is gradually taking away the city's 
economic powers and giving them to other regions.
<P>
	I believe the solution for the future is a sovereignty-partnership 
between our two nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on the address in reply to the speech from 
the throne.
<P>
	The speech from the throne was delivered a long time ago. When 
asked to speak on it, I had to read it over again. I did so. I found a 
series of general comments, which sounded like political 
platitudes. I also found that a lot of things which should have been 
said were not mentioned by the Queen's representative, when he 
addressed the two Houses.
<P>
	In order to find a little more substance, I read over again the 
budget speech presented by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	As you know, we are in an era of economics. Everything is in 
relation to the economy. Everything is calculated, whether it is the 
fuel consumption of automobiles, the cost of adopting a child, or 
the price of a child's kiss. This is the age of economics.
<P>
	I read what the Minister of Finance told us in his speech and I 
compared it with the speech from the throne. I noticed that some 
terms kept coming back. The Minister of Finance talked about 
securing the future of Canadians, something also mentioned in the 
speech from the throne. The minister spoke about anxiety, a 
lifestyle that is in jeopardy, a medicare program that is threatened, 
and a pension plan that is in serious danger.
<P>
	He told us about the fear of Quebecers and Canadians regarding 
their jobs and the future of their children. The governor general 
made similar comments in his speech from the throne. The minister 
added that his government wanted to find concrete solutions to 
these issues.
<P>
	I will stop here for now and continue after question period.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. He will have 
seven minutes left after question period. We now move on to 
statements by members.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Chedoke-McMaster Hospitals Foundation in 
Hamilton has expressed dismay that the recent $818,000 severance 
package awarded by the hospitals to a former administrator will 
hurt fund raising.
<P>
	Indeed it might, especially if the public were to realize that 
according to its 1994 annual financial information return, the 
foundation raised $1.03 million in donations at a cost of $783,000 
in fund raising expenses. In other words, out of a little more than $1 
million received from the public, only $247,000 was available as a 
gift to the hospitals.
<P>
	A bit of simple math shows that it could take more than three 
years of fund raising by the foundation and $3.3 million in 
donations to raise enough money to pay off the $800,000 severance 
package.
<P>
	This is scandalous. Hospital beds are disappearing, nursing staff 
has been cut and the sick suffers while hospital directors squander

out of hand and they are deeply affected by violent crimes 
committed on some of their doorsteps. Yet this government does 
little or nothing.
<P>
	On pensions Reform's fresh start platform puts security back 
into old age security. On health care and education Reform's fresh 
start increases funding from Ottawa by $4 billion. On taxes, when 
the books are balanced, Reform's fresh start offers individuals and 
parents of young children tax relief. And Reform's fresh start offers 
victims of crime a victims' bill of rights and all Canadians 
assurance that violent criminals will not be let loose to harm 
someone else.

Eve in Estevan and then had the good sense to move to Humboldt, 
Saskatchewan in January 1958 to raise his family and practise

<P>
	Dr. Rooney's sports involvement in Humboldt started in 1959 
coaching a bantam hockey team. Throughout the sixties, seventies

community sport committees as well as on provincial bodies. In 
1973 and 1974 he served on a five-person special government 
appointed task force on hockey in Saskatchewan.

	Rocky Mountaineer Railtours has proven to be an exceptionally 
positive contributing corporation. It has provided hundreds of jobs 
in the Kamloops area and is presently investing heavily to expand 
its service and create more jobs.
<P>
	A recent decision by VIA to offer unfair competition will 
seriously impact on the Mountaineer. I urge the Minister of 
Transport to come to Kamloops to meet with those affected in order

minute of silence for those who gave up their lives for the freedom, 
democracy and peace we enjoy in this country today. That minute 
of silence is only a reminder to us all of what many young men and 
women gave for us in the two world wars and the Korean war.
<P>
	My father was one of those men. He was a navigator in the 
RCAF and never returned from the second world war. As a result, I 
grew up with only a photograph and the stories and memories 
passed on by my mother to tell me what a wonderful man my father 
was.
<P>

my father. Their sacrifice was so great and so meaningful that we 
must never forget the contributions made during the wars. No 
words can convey that to anyone.

	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
November 1 marks the start of the 1996 national community safety 
and crime prevention campaign. The theme of this year's campaign 
sponsored by the Canada Safety Council is ``Choices'', the choices 
that we as Canadians make to help prevent crime, especially youth 
crime.
<P>
	To make a real dent in youth crime we have to do something 
about the means of its production. That involves the serious social 
problems which often underlie criminal behaviour and how society 
responds to them.
<P>
	Everything we improve today, every community problem that 
we can address before it leads to crime will result in building 
healthier communities later on. Rehabilitation and alternatives to 
imprisonment are most important components of the solution. 
These will help young people to get their lives back on track and 
become productive citizens.
<P>
	That is why crime prevention is so central to this government's 
program for balanced and effective criminal justice reform. To 
succeed in our efforts to prevent crime and find practical solutions, 
we must not only work in tandem with our partners in the criminal 
justice system but broaden our partnerships to include communities 
and neighbourhoods.
<P>
	I applaud the efforts of the Canada Safety Council and invite all 
Canadians to learn more about the choices available for responding 
to youth crime within their own communities.

Through balanced, effective spending cuts, by 1997 we will have 
reduced the deficit by $33 billion, nearly 80 per cent.
<P>
	What does this all mean for hard working Canadians? It means 
lower interest rates. It means they are saving almost $500 annually

$100,000 mortgage. It means the economy is improving and jobs

existence of Quebec's nuclear industry. The  gradual closing of the 
office of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited in Montreal and the 
decision to stop financing the Tokamak project are two decisions 
by the Liberal government which constitute an attack on a major 
industrial sector in the Montreal area.
<P>

did, because there was an office of Atomic Energy of Canada

<P>
	However the federal government can do more than just make 
promises, when it manages to find the $33 million needed to

<P>

as far as research and development is concerned, Tokamak is the 
most important research centre in Quebec. The hon. member is 
actually saying that all other research in sectors such as 
biotechnology,  pharmaceuticals, aeronautics and aerospace are 
less important. And this in spite of the fact that we explained 
recently in the House that the only hi-tech sector where Canada has 
a trade surplus is the aerospace sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we did not say that we were against the $33 million for the 
Triumph project. We did not say that.
<P>
	The minister could look at the blues, in French or in English, and 
he will see I never said that. He just has a one track mind. I said that 
if the government was capable of finding $33 million for British 
Columbia, it should be able to find a mere $7 million for Quebec. I 
am talking about nuclear energy and the most important hi-tech 
project in the nuclear sector in Quebec. That is a fact.
<P>
	I do not understand why the minister does not understand, unless 
he will not understand-that is another problem, and I am not sure 
there is a cure.
<P>
	How can the minister go along with patriating the entire nuclear 
energy sector to Ontario? And subcontractors will follow. These 
are major contracts. How can the government patriate all this to 
Ontario, at a time when economic spinoffs in this sector are starting 
to materialize?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the lack of understanding comes from the other 
side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> No doubt about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> The hon. member should realize that science and 
technology produces benefits for all Canadians by creating the 
research which then creates jobs in commercial applications.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Only recently, we made some very important investments in the 
Montreal area and elsewhere in Quebec. We invested non only in 
Canadair, which is very important, but also in Mitel, in Bromont, 
which is engaged in research or semiconductors. We have invested 
in biotechnology at the biotechnology institute of the National 
Research Ccentre in Montreal, to create a kind of incubator that 
will create jobs in this sector.
<P>
	There is more to it than just saying: All right, you cut here, but if 
you did not find the money there, because we have limited funds, 
so we must establish certain priorities. The priorities in the 
Montreal area are the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology and 
aerospace, and that is the kind of investment we made.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. I imagine it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6005"> 6005 </A></B>
<P>
will greatly reassure the Minister of Industry, since I will be taking 
the liberty of quoting the  Prime Minister of Canada, so I trust both 
of us will understand the same thing.
<P>
	On October 22, in Montreal, in a fine speech filled with good 
intentions, the Prime Minister stated as follows, in connection with 
the high tech industries: ``In the future, the federal government 
must, and will, help these industries to expand in Montreal.'' Yet 
this is far from the situation in reality. Again this week, we learn 
that the federal government is speeding up the closure of CITI, the 
Centre for Information Technologies Innovation, in Laval, and has 
given up on the idea of privatizing it, despite an offer from the 
private sector, which was made in due form.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that closing CITI, which had more than 
135 high tech jobs two years ago and received some $13 million 
annually, is not the way for his government to help high tech 
industries to expand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we made the decision to begin by privatizing CITI some 
years ago, and we negotiated in good faith with MicroCell the 
possible purchase of the centre.
<P>
	We have determined that accepting the proposal they made did 
not represent a good return for us. It must be understood, however, 
as I have just stated, that priorities need to be determined. Where 
does the money come from to help Canadair? Where does the 
money come from to invest in the Institut de biotechnologie?
<P>
	Sometimes choices have to be made. We have taken what I 
consider to be wise decisions. If a good proposal for the 
privatization of CITI could not be found, perhaps that was the best 
choice.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the minister is very skilled at dragging out red 
herrings by reminding us that the $85 million interest-free loan to 
Canadair is not just some trifle.
<P>
	Of the 143 federal research centres in Canada, 23 were located in 
Quebec. Is he going to realize, finally, that the Liberal government 
is the one undermining the economy of Montreal, and that CITI, 
Tokamak and the high tech sectors of Atomic Energy of Canada 
being moved-in case these have slipped his mind-are blatant 
examples of their bad faith?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, what astounds me is that, every time the Bloc asks science 
and technology related questions, they pass themselves off as 
victims.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The figures, in actual fact, are as follows. They indicate clearly, 
if the National Capital Region is excluded, as Quebec does for its 
own figures, that Quebec receives over 27 per cent of science and 
technology spending. Still more important, moreover, is the 
efficiency of our spending, since the objective is to create jobs and 
not just to be theoretically in favour of science. If the objective is to 
create jobs, we find that 41 per cent of R &amp; D tax credits are 
claimed by Quebec businesses.
<P>
	This tells me that our investments in the sectors I have noted: 
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, aerospace, are more effective in 
Quebec, because they have created businesses capable of claiming 
tax credits. This is a strong sector in Quebec. They need to see 
themselves as winners, not losers.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the people 
of Canada turfed the previous Conservative government in 1993 
they did so because they wanted to trust their government again. 
Some voted Liberal because of the red book promises which 
headlined: ``Honesty and integrity in our political institutions must 
be restored''. It seems that the implementation of the red book 
promises has been directed more to improving damage control 
procedures than to actually insisting on integrity among ministers.
<P>
	Because of his close association with the Prime Minister, even 
the ethics counsellor is viewed as part of the damage control team.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister set the ethics counsellor free so that he 
can do the job Canadians expect him to do for them instead of 
merely being another mouthpiece of the Prime Minister and his 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the ethics counsellor is doing the job expected of him by 
Canadians. This is clear by the rulings he has issued and the overall 
manner in which he is carrying out his work.
<P>
	At the same time, the Prime Minister has made it clear that he is 
the one who has to take ultimate responsibility for his ministers and 
he is also doing that. This is a further sign of the high priority he 
puts on ethics and integrity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in all of my years 
of teaching I did not allow my students to mark their own exams. 
This government has marked itself and claims that the appointment 
of the independent ethics counsellor has been achieved, and yet we 
observe that the ethics counsellor receives his instructions from the 
Prime Minister and answers to the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	What is the Liberal working definition of the word independent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is very clear from the way the ethics counsellor does his work 
that he is operating independently, using his own good judgment.
<P>
	The comment of the Reform spokesman is an unfair and 
unjustified reflection on the good work done by the ethics 
counsellor.
<P>
	That is why when the Canadian people mark the Reform Party in 
the next election it will be marked as a complete failure and the 
hon. member will be back attempting to teach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make it very clear that we are not here attacking either the person 
or the work of the ethics counsellor. We are challenging the 
conditions under which he must try to do his work.
<P>
	No one knows this government's standards of ethical conduct. 
The ministers should know them, but it seems they do not. 
Canadians in general and even ordinary MPs in the House do not 
know them because they are kept a secret. The standards which are 
upheld change from day to day. It is like taking a measurement with 
a rubber ruler.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister please explain why he is afraid of 
divulging the standards that he expects from his ministers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister has made it very clear that because of his views 
on integrity and the high priority he places on it that he feels that no 
one can take a higher degree of responsibility than he. He has 
conveyed his rules and standards to his ministers. He is ready as 
Prime Minister to be accountable to the Canadian people. I would 
think that when it comes to using a rubber ruler, if the hon. member 
continues with these questions the Canadian people will take him 
to the office and use a rubber ruler on him in the next election.

Canadian aid workers, including five Quebecers, were to be

<P>
	Number two, the guidelines for the ethics counsellor to 
administer must be made public so they have credibility.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is why are they not made 
public so that they can stand the test of the public and determine 
whether cabinet ministers are ethical in their actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister treats these guidelines as confidential advice 
from him to his ministers.
<P>
	The important thing is that the Prime Minister considers himself 
ultimately accountable to Parliament and to the Canadian people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6007"> 6007 </A></B>
<P>
for the conduct of his ministers. If we are concerned about

parliamentary procedure, namely the accountability of the Prime 
Minister to Parliament and through Parliament ultimately to the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of 
the minister's answer, can the minister explain, in terms of the 
ethics guidelines that allow a minister of the crown to make a 
deposit on a fur coat and go on to charge thousands of dollars of 
expenses on a government credit card, how that is ethical? It is not 
based on whether there is reimbursement or not. Could the minister 
explain that kind of unethical conduct in a cabinet of this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the </B><B>House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I refer my hon. friend to the findings of the ethics counsellor on this 
matter. He confirmed his earlier ruling through a further review of 
the matter.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of National Defence. The President of the 
Treasury Board has decided to turn a blind eye to the benefits 
granted General Boyle. However, specific sections of the Privacy 
Act clearly provide that the benefits paid to General Boyle on a 
discretionary basis must be made public and the public interest 
requires the minister to mention any other benefit granted.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	In 1994, the information commissioner said, regarding a similar 
case involving the golden handshake paid to the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada, that the rule was simple: whenever anyone gets a 
gift paid by taxpayers, the public has the right to know about it. 
Given that the Bank of Canada had to disclose the benefits paid to 
its governor, why is the minister still trying to circumvent all the 
rules and hide this information from the public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we 
also have lawyers who give us the best possible interpretation of 
the act. The interpretation is that General Boyle is entitled to the 
same benefits, the same pension and the same protection of 
personal information as other officers, public servants and people 
covered by the act.
<P>
	In this case, the entitlements and amounts to which a person is 
eligible are considered to be personal information whose disclosure 
is prohibited under the Privacy Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, back in 
1994, no government minister talked about a gift. It is the 
information commissioner who told us that and we agree: it was a 
gift to the governor. Unless I am mistaken, the government, 
regardless of the act, the precedents, the public opinion and the 
interest of Canadians, is interested only in hiding at any cost the 
amount of the golden handshake that taxpayers had to pay, 
following General Boyle's gaffes.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Defence realize that, by continuing against 
all logic to hide this information from the public, just after taking 
over his new responsibilities, he is perpetuating the lack of 
transparency displayed by his predecessor and condoning the 
secrecy that is poisoning the armed forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
terms and conditions relating to the departure of governor in 
council appointees are a Treasury Board responsibility, which is 
why I am answering these questions. Obviously, if the hon. 
member does not agree with the interpretation given by our legal 
officers, he can go to the information commissioner.
<P>
	As for us, we feel that General Boyle faithfully served his 
country and that he is entitled to the same protection as any other 
Canadian, under the Privacy Act.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> reports that this bureau would require only about 20 hours' 
work per week to deal with all of Canada, in other words, half the 
workload of a single civil servant. How can the federal government 
justify this additional intrusion in an area which in any case is the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces? Does the government want 
to give the impression that it protects its citizens, although it is 
obvious that this bureau will be useless?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows perfectly well that both, and in many cases 
all three levels of government will have to work together. But he is 
also aware that a committee of this House has the right to draft a 
report, to conduct investigations and to examine what it believes is 
important, and it is the government's responsibility to respond to 
the committee. We intend to do so at the appropriate time.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the most recent broken red book promises are in the area of 
research and development and jobs, particularly projects at Chalk 
River, Ontario and Pinawa,  Manitoba. The internationally 
recognized cyclotron facility at Chalk River, TASCC, could be 
closed due to a lack of funds and the future of the Whiteshell

force recommendation to privatize the facility.

<P>
	Is the natural resources minister going to do anything to ensure 
these research initiatives and jobs remain in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised this question last week. An 
adequate answer was given by the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	I appreciate the respect the hon. member has in the House but he 
knows we are still talking about that. He knows we have had to cut 
back. Reform Party members talk about smaller government. I 
wonder what they would do if they were in our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a specific suggestion for what we would do if we were in the 
Liberal's position.
<P>
	The U.S. Brookhaven Institute is in a position to pick up jobs 
that Spar Aerospace would otherwise give to the cyclotron in Chalk 
River. The same situation exists for Whiteshell where our scientists 
are leaving for the United States due to inaction on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	I have this specific suggestion for the minister. Would the 
minister use $3 million of the $40 million in refund that is coming 
from the European Space Agency to keep the Chalk River facility 
open and start the process of privatizing Whiteshell as was called 
for in the task force report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if we were to follow the budget of the Reform Party, 
which is not a platform but a springboard into the swimming pool 
of disaster, there would not be any atomic energy in Canada or the 
world.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister recently appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Finance to present his 1996 fiscal and economic update. Now 
that the minister is working on the 1997 budget, can he tell the 
House how Canadians can get involved and have their views 
represented in the content of the next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member's question is very timely as we are now going into the 
prebudget mode.
<P>
	As she knows, the prime focus for national consultation will be 
the House of Commons finance committee which has already had 
five weeks of hearings here in Ottawa and next week is to embark 
on the national consultation. The committee will be going from 
coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	At the same time, there are other vehicles. We have invited 
Canadians to write to us directly. I will be meeting with individual 
groups. Because I am aware of the hon. member's interest, I would 
like to highlight the ability of individual members of Parliament to 
hold forums in their ridings. In past years those forums have 
proved to be of enormous benefit.
<P>
	The main focus, which I am sure the hon. member is driving at, 
is that we have made the budget process open and transparent. That 
is one of the reasons we have been so successful in our budgets.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Since his appointment, the new defence minister has kept rather 
mum about his intentions regarding plans for major purchases of 
military equipment. As we know, his predecessor had not ruled out 
buying new submarines and wanted to equip the next class of 
shipborne helicopters for anti-submarine warfare.
<P>
	When is the minister going to make public his intentions 
regarding plans for major purchases of military equipment, and 
will he once and for all drop the idea of spending several hundreds 
of millions of dollars on submarines of dubious usefulness?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Canada's role 
with regard to defence, not only its own, but in terms of its well 
known responsibilities towards its allies, requires that we proceed 
with extreme caution when deciding to purchase military 
equipment.
<P>
	We are not ruling out anything, but I can assure my colleague 
that we do not intend to spend billions or hundreds of millions of 
dollars without taking into account all criteria that have a bearing 
on such a decision. I hope to come to a decision on the purchase of 
some of the elements the member mentioned in a not too distant 
future.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister commit to having a debate in the House of Commons on

purchases be publicly discussed, in view of our financial priorities

wonderful things about Parliament is that all decisions made have 
to be accounted for to all of our peers.
<P>
	The policies of the Government of Canada with respect to 
national defence, I think, have been articulated. They have been the 
result of unprecedented consultations. We have had the white paper 
and the joint parliamentary reports. We have had debates on our 
participation in various military activities around the world.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada Post mandate review recommends that Canada Post be 
made subject to the Freedom of Information Act and to annual 
audits by the auditor general. To date the minister responsible has 
ignored these recommendations.
<P>
	Canadians have a stake in how their crown corporations are run. 
They have a right to know what is going on and the Radwanski 
report makes it clear that Canadians have legitimate concerns 
regarding Canada Post.
<P>
	My question is for the minister responsible for Canada Post. The 
Liberal government promised Canadians more open and 
transparent government. Will the minister deliver on that promise 
and make Canada Post open and transparent by making it subject to 
the Freedom of Information Act and to the scrutiny of the auditor 
general?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada Post is a very 
valuable corporation. It belongs to the people of Canada, but it also 
has a commercial mandate and, as such, one must respect 
commercial confidences.
<P>
	That being said, I have asked Canada Post to look at establishing 
a plan to ensure that it operates with the most openness and 
transparency possible.

<P>
	This week CBC Radio is celebrating 60 years of service. 
Especially in remote areas, it is a vital link that holds our country 
together. For example, CBQ in Thunder Bay serves half the 
province of Ontario.
<P>
	Despite all the rosy promises in the red book about stable 
multi-year financing for the CBC, when will the government 
deliver on one of its most important commitments to the Canadian 
people? What is the future of the CBC and stations like CBQ with 
the Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
has consistently spoken about the government's commitment to the 
CBC.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the government continues to fund the CBC 
to the tune of almost $1 billion. There is $200 million which is 
going into a production fund and $100 million of that will be used 
by the CBC for specific programming which will enable local 
communities to produce Canadian programming, especially in 
British Columbia.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the industry minister.
<P>
	With one breath the government and the minister say they are 
committed to removing barriers to interprovincial trade. With the 
next breath the finance minister announces his GST harmonization 
plan, which in the words of the Retail Council of Canada ``divides 
the Canadian economy into two separate entities''.
<P>
	If the industry minister is committed to removing interprovincial 
trade barriers, as he says he is, why is he supporting the finance 
minister's harmonization plan which is, in itself, a barrier which 
will hurt Atlantic Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I support, without reservation, everything the 
finance minister does. I want him to know that.
<P>
	I would also say that the issue of interprovincial trade barriers is 
a very important one. In fact what has been accomplished in 
Atlantic Canada is a demonstration of what could happen with the 
kind of co-operation we are trying to achieve. Instead of it being a 
barrier to interprovincial commerce, that there are rates that differ 
across these provincial barriers, what we have got there is the 
opportunity with a harmonized system to give consumers exactly 
what they want, which is the ability to go to the cash register and 
know that they are paying the price that they saw ticketed on the 
counter.

<P>
	What we face in interprovincial trade barriers, as the hon. 
member knows, is very often the result of provincial governments 
exercising their constitutionally valid powers to favour businesses 
or citizens within their own jurisdiction without having a broader 
view of what could be done if they were to take down the barriers.
<P>
	I hope he will join with us in supporting our efforts to encourage 
the provincial governments to operate on a consensus basis once 
and for all to create a truly harmonized federal national market in 
Canada.

simply that the Canadian public in the next election was going to do 
it in a figurative and symbolic way. If this offends my hon. friend, I

still has eight minutes left to deliver his speech.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I was 
interrupted by the question period, I was making a parallel between 
the throne speech and the budget speech. I was outlining some 
elements of rhetoric, still believing that the budget speech is 
intended to update, clarify and give shape to the throne speech. I 
will then continue, in my presentation, to refer to the budget 
speech.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance claims in his speech to ensure our 
financial future. He says that to us with a straight face. Given our 
current situation and also the fact that we are in a world where the 
economy is open, where major changes are occurring rapidly, I 
think it may be somewhat pretentious for the finance minister to 
say that he will ensure our financial future. Perhaps we would have 
preferred to hear him say that he would do his best to ensure that 
Canadians can benefit from the development of the world 
economy, without giving too many assurances that he cannot pay, 
as I believe to be the case.
<P>
	I noted in the budget speech and also a little in the throne speech 
that many things are muddled up. The finance minister is playing 
over several years, 1994-95, 1995-96, and goes back to 1993-94 for 
some statistics. He even goes up to 1999. For all the issues relating 
to the deficit, the figure goes from 3 to 2 per cent, but it is 2 per 
cent in 1999. We see that the finance minister muddles many things 
up.
<P>
	He muddles up concepts of financial needs, he adds numbers and 
talks about the GDP, the past one and the future one. After reading 
all of this, we get the impression that the minister knows what he is 
talking about and that we have no other choice but to trust him, 
because it is sometimes hard to check the debt levels and the 
financial requirements that he mentions for 1999. What can we do 
but trust him.
<P>
	I think the Minister of Finance is not really sure that everyone 
trusts him, which is why he has laid down some principles. The 
throne speech, for example, contains a number of principles, which 
the previous speaker, the hon. member for Shefford, listed. First, 
the Minister of Finance said his mea culpa. He stated that 
governments are responsible for the deficit. This is very interesting 
coming from a Liberal minister whose party has been in office for 
36 or 38 years over the past 50 years. He was probably talking 
about the Conservatives, and forgot about the Trudeau years.
<P>
	The minister also talked about jobs and growth, just like the 
governor general. This is all fine, except that the average citizens 
and the economists have now realized that job creation does not 
necessarily keep pace with growth, and this is a very serious 
problem. I am not blaming the Minister of Finance for not having 
the solution to this problem. If he had the solution, Ministers of 
Finance from around the world would be in meetings in Ottawa, 
right here, right now.
<P>
	The minister talked about a frugal, trimmed down government. 
It is all well and good to say that the government is too big and 
involved in too many things. Maybe what we should say is that the 
government has been mismanaging some of these areas. However, 
the fact that the government is withdrawing from some areas might 
cause problems in the years to come.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance even implied that some government 
operations may not be efficient. I think everybody knows that some 
government operations probably need to be reviewed. Like in any 
other area, when we keep doing the same thing, even though it is a 
good thing, we become inefficient because their is no innovation. It 
is high time the minister decided to innovate in the area of finance, 
as the governor general asked us to be more innovative and creative 
in the throne speech.
<P>
	In terms of principles, the finance minister talked about justice 
and compassion, as did the governor general. It is with a tear in his 
eye and his heart on his sleeve that the minister then proceeded to 
make his budget speech.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	But I noticed that he did not talk about money right away. He 
lingered on the perspectives. He used a new trick, which I have 
seen different finance ministers use in several provinces. They go 
as far ahead as 1997, 1998, 1999. They confuse people. We think 
we no longer have debts, but they are talking about 1999 or 2000 or 
2002.
<P>
	In a way, these budgets become what I would call crystal ball 
budgets prepared by people who try to predict the future, but when 
we read newspapers from previous years, we can see that most 
finance ministers, as well as economists from the major banks and 
from the academic world, were wrong in their predictions. Some 
have received the Nobel prize in economics, but we notice that it is 
often given to people who have worked in the field for a very long 
time. That minimizes the risk of error.
<P>
	The finance minister mentioned two urgent needs. I am talking 
about the throne speech and I keep referring to the finance minister 
because I was under the impression that the throne speech was 
supposed to state certain principles, to tell us where we are headed 
as a country, and that, since we are in the economic age, the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6015"> 6015 </A></B>
<P>
finance minister was supposed to provide us with the solutions, to 
translate into reality the general directions outlined by the governor 
general.
<P>
	We heard about the need to increase revenues and to cut 
expenditures. Of course, the official opposition agrees with these 
objectives. Regarding the need to increase revenues, we might 
perhaps have expected the minister to announce a reform of our tax 
system, but he talked about tax equity instead. Then he went on to 
talk about the banks, about the progressive tax, and said a few 
words about tax loopholes. He talked about family trusts, but that 
was before we learned that $2 billion was taken out of Canada 
before Christmas without any taxes being paid on it.
<P>
	The minister did not talk about keeping the surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund, which has become the employment 
insurance fund. Of course he knew that a reform was forthcoming, 
that the fund was growing and that he needed that money. But he 
never told us how he would increase the revenues without raising 
taxes. I think that, today, a minister of finance who would propose 
raising taxes directly, rather than indirectly, by asking taxpayers to 
make a certain contribution would be severely criticized rather than 
congratulated.
<P>
	As for expenditure reduction, cuts are never mentioned and the 
role of the government is never openly questioned, although its role 
is under review and things are changing. Basically, a throne speech 
or a speech by the finance minister are always optimistic and little 
concerned with issues.
<P>
	Last weekend, I heard a reporter put this question to the 
President of the Treasury Board: ``Sir, are there problems in 
Canada?'' The minister was flabbergasted. In Canada as a whole, in 
Quebec or in my own area of Chicoutimi-Jonquière, there is still a 
huge unemployment problem.
<P>
	Unemployment rates are 9.9 per cent in Canada, 12.6 per cent in 
Quebec, and a staggering 14.6 per cent in Chicoutimi-Jonquière. 
Thus I would say that the throne speech as the budget speech are 
only rhetoric, claptrap and fine words that lead to naught. It has 
been six months since they were delivered,-the figures I have 
mentioned were for September 1996-and Canadians are still 
unemployed. Both these speeches propose no solution to put 
Canadians and Quebecers back to work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member, following his 
comments today, the same question that I asked prior to question 
period of one of his colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	During the so-called economic summit Premier Bouchard 
recently held on the economy of Quebec it was  revealed in the 
local media that experts hired by Premier Bouchard to research the 
issues surrounding the economy, the job rate, the brain drain and 
other problems afflicting Quebec currently reportedly advised him 
the problem is with the separatists and the uncertainty created by 
the separatist movement.
<P>
	In light of this I asked his colleague if he would be prepared to 
support the Reform subamendment that says this is the problem 
with jobs and the economy in Montreal. It is created and caused by 
the separatist movement and the uncertainty that flows from that 
and not by any other things in the economy. Would the hon. 
member support the subamendment put forward by the Reform 
Party?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question, because it gives me an opportunity to answer those who 
blame Quebec's economic problems on the fact that the national 
debate remains unresolved.
<P>
	I should point out that the issue of Quebec sovereignty has been 
around for many years, if not decades. If we look at the economic 
fluctuations, we can see that these cycles do not always follow 
Quebecers' fluctuating interest in giving themselves a country.
<P>
	In the 1980 referendum, Quebec sovereignists were clearly 
defeated with 60 per cent of the people voting no and 40 per cent 
yes. People looked at this 20 per cent gap and thought the battle 
was over. They thought the sovereignist movement would not 
recover.
<P>
	The sovereignist movement did have trouble throughout the 
1980s until the Meech Lake accord was rejected in 1990 after many 
people in Quebec-I was not among them-tried once again to 
negotiate a new alliance with Canada.
<P>
	If Quebec's economic problems are indeed linked to political 
uncertainty, how come there was no economic boom in Quebec in 
the 1980s? We did not have a boom in Quebec. What we had, 
beginning in 1981-82 was a major economic crisis. That was 
followed by the election of a Liberal government, headed by Mr. 
Bourassa, which should have led to great things, because what we 
were essentially saying to financial markets was: ``Quebecers said 
No in 1980, they elected a government that was clearly federalist''. 
There should have been an investment boom in Quebec. But there 
was not.
<P>
	This means that Quebec's problems are not directly related to the 
political environment. Perhaps there is a link, but perhaps there is 
not. It depends. Economists will tell us one thing, others will tell us 
something else, and in the field of economy, even if it is a science 
taught in our universities, the accuracy of forecasts and the various 
theories still often leaves a lot to be desired.
<P>
	I do not think that a close examination of Quebec's economy and 
politics over the last 15 years justifies  saying that Quebec's current 
disastrous economic situation is, in some ways, related to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6016"> 6016 </A></B>
<P>
political climate, which is in terrible shape according to my 
colleague from the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for St. Catharines. I will 
use the next ten minutes to meet two objectives. I will prove that 
Canada is on the right track and then I will go on to illustrate that 
there are ten reasons to believe in a brighter future in Canada.
<P>
	October 25 marked three years since our Liberal government 
took office. A tremendous amount of change has taken place since 
then. Over 650,000 new jobs have been created. The deficit has 
decreased. The crime rate has dropped. People are paying less for 
their mortgages. Small businesses are exploring more and more 
emerging global markets. The United Nations pegged Canada as 
the best country in which to live. Those are a few of the reasons I 
believe Canada is on the right track.
<P>
	Our fiscal house is indeed in order. By 1998-99 the deficit will 
have been cut to $9 billion. That is a reduction of $33 billion or 80 
per cent in five years. A recent OECD report stated that Canada 
will rank first among G-7 countries in employment growth both in 
the years 1996 and 1997.
<P>
	What are these ten reasons to believe in a brighter future? First, 
the unemployment rate has gone down from 11.1 per cent in 
October 1993 to approximately 9.9 per cent in October 1996. This 
figure is still a bit high, but when we consider that we are going 
through global restructuring here at home and abroad it is very 
positive.
<P>
	That we have been able to exceed our deficit reduction target is 
also quite impressive. I stated the statistics earlier, but I also want 
to make sure Canadians understand that the deficit has been 
reduced through spending cuts, not tax increases. By 1998-99 
program spending will be at its lowest level since 1949-50.
<P>
	Canada, as I said earlier, is expected to rank first in economic 
growth among G-7 countries. In part that is because of our deficit 
reduction action. There is no question that has increased investor 
confidence in our country and improved the overall economic 
environment.
<P>
	Over the past three years Canada's inflation rate has been the 
second lowest among G-7 countries and among the lowest in the 
industrialized world.
<P>
	Short term interest rates have declined 4.5 per cent since early 
1995. That means that someone renewing a $100,000 mortgage for 
one year will save over $3,000 annually.
<P>
	Also we are blessed to have youth who are the most educated and 
technologically advanced generation in our country's history. With 
a strong entrepreneurial spirit  and a very positive eye on 
technology, Canada's young people are ready to face the challenges 
of the new economy. We are doing our share to ensure they can 
compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
	Since April 1994 over 760,000 young people have taken 
advantage of federal government programs and services. Locally, 
in my riding, over 13,000 young people have accessed federal 
programming.
<P>
	There have been recent amendments to Canada student loans. 
The government has realized that the provinces, universities and 
community colleges have increased tuition.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	We feel it is our responsibility to respond to those changes. It is 
for this reason that we have increased Canada student loans 
allocation by $2.5 billion over the next five years. That accounts 
for approximately a 57 per cent increase at a time when the 
government is, like many governments throughout the world, 
dealing with the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	We have also increased government funding associated with 
youth employment services by $315 million. That means that we 
are clearly not only stating in our speeches that young people are a 
priority but we are acting on it.
<P>
	Another issue related to building the type of economic 
infrastructure required to remain globally competitive is 
technology and how this government is helping in this 
technological revolution.
<P>
	Through technology partnerships Canada, the federal 
government is providing approximately $250 million to lever 
additional investment from the private sector and strategic 
technology sectors.
<P>
	Strategis, Industry Canada's web site and one of the largest 
Internet sites in the world, is a business oriented data base of 
connections and opportunities.
<P>
	We have also increased support to the Business Development 
Bank. That will result in an additional $350 million in bank loans to 
growing knowledge based, export oriented businesses.
<P>
	We have also modernized Canada's social security net. I have 
personally been involved in this. The new employment insurance 
system will provide results that will help people get back to work. 
We have measures such as the wage subsidies, income 
supplements, self-employment assistance, skill and loans grants 
that will help unemployed Canadians re-enter the workforce, not to 
mention the new seniors' benefit. It will fully protect low and 
modest income Canadians.
<P>
	Those receiving the guaranteed income supplement will get 
$120 more per year. Seventy-five per cent of single seniors and 
couples will receive the same or higher benefits. Nine out of ten 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6017"> 6017 </A></B>
<P>
seniors, women, will receive increased benefits under the new 
system.
<P>
	Going back to the issue of economics and global trade, the 
international trade strategy of this government is opening doors to 
greater opportunities. Team Canada trade missions to China, India, 
Pakistan, Malaysia and Latin American have brought home 
approximately $20 billion of new business deals for Canada's 
firms. When we think about it, every $1 billion of new exports 
protects or provides approximately 11,000 jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	The Canada infrastructure program is a $6 billion cost shared 
program between the municipalities, the provinces and the federal 
government. This initiative has been quite successful because it 
deals with local priorities. It really speaks to the issue of when we 
pool resources as a government we can achieve great things locally.
<P>
	Over 80,000 to 100,000 jobs have been created as a result of this 
program. We have not forgotten that there is something in this 
country that we all cherish as Canadians, that in many ways is 
identified quite clearly with our country. It is the issue of health 
care.
<P>
	There is no question, based on the budgetary measures we have 
taken as a federal government, based on the excellent work done by 
the Minister of Health, that we are and we will continue to uphold 
the Canada Health Act ensuring that the system remains accessible, 
comprehensive, portable, universal and publicly administered.
<P>
	I think I have clearly outlined to the viewers and members on 
both sides of this House that Canada is on the right track. I have 
clearly outlined 10 reasons why Canadians ought to believe in a 
brighter future not only for themselves but for future generations. 
We are certainly better off than we were four or five years ago. Our 
country is more optimistic about the future. Consumer and business 
confidence is up. The future looks bright.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I leave Canadians with one fundamental question. Is there any 
other country they would like to live in?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to be able to speak to the House today. I thank the member for 
York North for his excellent review of this government's three 
years in office. He clearly enunciated the youth and infrastructure 
programs which he has been greatly involved in. I welcome back 
the member for Jonquière. It is good to see his smiling face in the 
House and I am sure we can work together on many items.
<P>
	I will talk about science and technology. A commitment was 
made in the throne speech to create enduring jobs for Canadians in 
the economy of the 21st century where investment in knowledge 
and technology is very essential. The government will establish 
guiding principles to improve the effectiveness and focus of the 
federal science and technology effort.
<P>
	In particular, the throne speech spelled out that the government 
will make specific proposals to support technological development 
in the aerospace industry, in environmental technologies and in 
critical enabling technologies such as biotechnology. Further 
measures will be taken to promote technology diffusion, including 
the launch of the Canadian technology network.
<P>
	The government has promised to support technology innovation 
by providing a predictable policy and regulatory framework for the 
information highway. The government has promised to continue 
expansion of SchoolNet access and community access programs. 
Thus Canadians, particularly those in rural communities, will be 
able to use technology to increase their knowledge, their access to 
each other and to the rest of the world.
<P>
	On March 11 the Minister of Industry and the Secretary of State 
for Science, Research and Development released the new 
technology proposal. The new technology strategy echoes a 
number of elements in the red book, for example, the importance of 
partnerships and the role of science and technology in increasing 
productivity, growth and the standard of living.
<P>
	The strategy adds a new element to the Liberal government's 
commitments, the importance of getting our house in order and 
better managing the federal government's science and technology 
activities. To that end an advisory council has been appointed for 
science and technology as promised. It will report directly to 
cabinet and the Prime Minister. This became effective on July 5.
<P>
	We have delivered on the promise to define the core of the 
federal government's science and technology activities. The 
required federal departments must publish annual outlook 
documents on science and technology for scrutiny and review by 
Parliament. We will implement new human resources policies so 
that science and technology professionals can be more effective in 
managing and delivering on the federal commitment to science and 
technology in the workplace. We have directed the federal 
departments of science and technology to co-ordinate with their 
provincial and territorial counterparts so we can work together on 
all these items.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to meet with some some of the appointees 
to the advisory council that will report to the Prime Minister and to 
cabinet. It was great to see that we had people from across the 
country: André Caillé, president and chief executive officer of 
Hydro Quebec; Pierre Fortier, chairman of the board and senior 
partner of Innovitech Incorporated; Martha Piper, vice-president, 
research and external affairs, the University of Alberta; Michael 
Smith, Peter Wall distinguished professor of biotechnology, the 
University of British Columbia; Jacquelyn Thayer Scott, president 
and vice-chancellor of the University College of Cape Breton. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6018"> 6018 </A></B>
<P>
Those are only a  few of the 12 great advisers we have. They are 
excellent advisers from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I take the comments of the auditor general very much to heart, to 
understand that the auditor general is always looking for areas to 
advise the government of where improvements can be made, and 
continued improvement in this day and age is really what counts to 
reach higher levels.
<P>
	A recent letter to the industry committee, to which all of the 
parties of this House belong, stated: ``There is a tremendous 
challenge ahead. We believe that four ingredients are now essential 
to the successful implementation of the strategy and the 
framework: persistent leadership at all levels of government, from 
ministers to scientists; results oriented, time framed 
implementation plans; a clear accounting for results; and 
parliamentary oversight on progress in implementing the strategy 
and the framework''. This is exactly what this government has put 
into place.
<P>
	In the industry committee where all parties are involved we are 
looking at the critical industries and technologies that will create 
opportunities for the Canadian economy in the next century. We 
must look ahead five, ten, fifteen years, dream of what it is going to 
be like in 2010, 2020 and then try to make that a reality of the 
future.
<P>
	What is the role of government in promoting emerging 
technologies? Where do we fit as a government? Where do we not 
fit as a government? What are the things we should do and should 
not do? What impediments stand the in way of emerging 
technologies? Which government programs create the greatest 
barriers to economic growth? What can the government do to 
lessen the burden on innovative firms? What steps should be taken 
to promote a climate that encourages science, technology and 
entrepreneurship? How well are Canadian institutions meeting the 
skills and needs of high technology industries?
<P>
	Today there are many job openings in the high tech field, 
thousands of openings that cannot be filled by Canadians because 
we are lagging behind the training and the requirements for the 
industries that are developing very quickly where they need 
scientists. How can Parliament ensure that the government follows 
the result oriented science and technology strategy? How can 
Parliament organize itself to ensure full governmental 
accountability for science and technology? What sort of data 
should be collected to monitor progress of science and technology? 
As I mentioned earlier, science and technology is something we 
must think of in terms of the future, five, ten, fifteen, twenty years. 
It is not something we can start and stop. It is something we must 
continually plan.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to travel this country to be involved in 
some seven of nine workshops on this subject, recently touring the 
NRC and CML Technologies, Jetform and Vitana, which very
<P>
kindly showed us their facilities this past week. It was also 
interesting to visit and discuss the roles that each plays in research 
and development and to see leading edge technologies in action, 
leading edge technologies just ready to be put into the business 
sector.
<P>
	CML Technologies explained how air traffic control products 
could be developed and sold in the highly competitive North 
American market and win large contracts such as the one it wants 
in metropolitan Chicago where it has beat out Motorola, which is 
almost like David beating Goliath.
<P>
	Jetform told us about how it has become the world leader in 
office forms, the software required, with an impressive 78 per cent 
annual growth and with first quarter world sales of over $15 
million.
<P>
	Vitana demonstrated its Shapegrabber, 3-D imaging package 
based on NRC technology, which has been adapted for its clients in 
forestry, mining, tire production and industrial assembly. We have 
many great firms that we are working with to discuss how science 
and technology should be rolled out in the future.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention a Canadian controlled 
company, Newbridge, which works with many affiliates. It has 
come to our committee and many committees to talk about how 
Canadians can make things happen in science and technology.
<P>
	Yes, there have been recommendations and that is what we are 
looking for. We are looking for better means to make things 
happen. We want a competitive and stable environment for R and 
D. We want to improve access to markets and capital. We want a 
financial risk sharing of R and D and rapid deployment.
<P>
	May I conclude by saying that what was said in the throne speech 
is being delivered every week and every month by this government 
to make things happen in a just and timely way just like we 
promised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since February, this session of Parliament has delivered 
exactly what the throne speech promised in the fields of economics 
and finance, nothing. Policy is on auto pilot with the Prime 
Minister regularly issuing reassuring messages that he is in control 
and that no corrections are needed.
<P>
	The country's biggest problem, the deficit, has been dealt with 
by benign neglect. Sure, the numbers have improved but mainly 
through downloading $6 billion on to the provinces a year earlier. 
There has also been an economic recovery in the United States 
which spilled over into Canada through increased demand for 
exports.  As a result, spending on unemployment insurance benefits 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6019"> 6019 </A></B>
<P>
has dropped by $5 billion. There is not much credit to the 
government here.
<P>
	With tax rates set at very high levels, the export stimulated 
growth has resulted in higher revenues of $25 billion which exactly 
matches the reduction in the bottom line of the deficit. The much 
advertised spending cuts on the outer rim of bureaucracy have been 
very minor. More are slated to come but not for another year. In 
other words, the much vaunted deficit reduction has been achieved 
by taking more money away from Canadians through higher tax 
revenue.
<P>
	Canadians who want a smaller government in Ottawa and less 
bureaucracy wrapping them in red tape even when it is not 
Christmas, will not be pleased by the reduction of less than $1 
billion a year when that total government spending is $150 billion, 
$50 billion on interest alone.
<P>
	Now the Prime Minister has announced that there will be no 
more cuts to government spending. The Ottawa leviathan will stay 
the same size for at least the next two years, by the end of which we 
can expect higher tax revenue of about $7 billion a year to have 
eliminated the deficit.
<P>
	Hurray, then the Liberals will be free to get back to what they are 
best at: feeding the Ottawa monster. The Prime Minister already 
has promised to use the higher tax revenue for more spending at the 
rate of $7 billion a year. The Deputy Prime Minister is licking her 
chops as she anticipates and already promises money to some of 
the unlimited number of good causes that she attracts in whatever 
portfolio she is in.
<P>
	Of course, Canadians know the flip side of this kind of policy. 
They feel it in their pocketbooks. Their family income has dropped 
by $3,000 a year after taxes, primarily because of increased tax 
revenue since this government came into power.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Then of course there is the biggest red book promise of jobs, 
jobs, jobs. How many jobs have been created? Just enough to 
employ the growth in workers, those coming out of high school and 
those who have immigrated to Canada. The fact is that nearly 1.5 
million Canadians are still looking for work. Many more have 
indicated they are so discouraged that they have stopped looking 
and many more millions are working only part time.
<P>
	Let us look at the government's commitments for the future. 
Over two years, $7 billion more in revenue for each year will go to 
the elimination of the deficit. Thereafter, increases in revenue are 
promised to be used for increased spending. That means if the 
government gets elected again, the pattern they have been on will 
produce another $3,000 reduction in family income because that is 
exactly what happened in the preceding  four years. All the revenue 
increases from these rates of taxation has gone into feeding the 
monster government here in Ottawa.
<P>
	It is not very encouraging for the people of Canada. I 
recommend that they look at an alternative which is laid out clearly 
in the document called Fresh Start for Reform. Under this program 
the leviathan will be tamed. We will cut another approximately $10 
billion out of government spending, not from transfers to 
provinces. In fact, we will restore some of these transfers that were 
cut earlier. It will not come out of transfers to people nor out of 
transfers to the provinces for social programs.
<P>
	It will come out of programs that should be cut, ones we hear 
about in the finance committee and from people to whom we talk. 
Let me list a few. There is overlap in the delivery of services 
between the federal and provincial governments. There are huge 
bureaucracies such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the 
Department of the Environment, the Department of Industry, the 
Department of Labour. There is a whole list of departments where 
the provinces have been saying: ``You are making life too tough for 
us''. Business is asking: ``Why do we have to fill in the same 
information that we have just delivered to the provincial 
governments? Why do we also have to give it to the federal 
government?''
<P>
	On my shelf I have the Nielsen task force report. Mr. Speaker, 
you were here when this was produced. It has gathered dust. It 
indicates that billions can be saved through the elimination of 
overlap and duplication. That was 15 years ago. This government 
has not taken the hint. Not only would it reduce the leviathan, but it 
would also save money and make it better and easier for business to 
succeed.
<P>
	Other expenditure cuts involve special interest group funding. A 
report was released recently which indicated that Canadians 
through an objective survey have indicated that multiculturalism is 
not working. Why do we insist on feeding that monstrous 
bureaucracy and all those activities? Reform is not against 
multicultural activities. We are against having them financed by 
the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Reform has proposed a large number of other cuts. For example, 
the elimination of the industrial subsidies that are now being given 
to business. Last week in the finance committee business 
representatives said: ``Please government, get rid of all of the 
subsidies to business and lower the taxes''. That is exactly what 
Reform is proposing to do.
<P>
	What would Reform do with the surplus that would be growing 
and continue to grow? We would target tax cuts primarily at the 
reduction of barriers to the efficient operation of labour markets. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6020"> 6020 </A></B>
<P>
Whole books are written  about this and why our unemployment 
rate is so high. New thinking is required in that field.
<P>
	Reform would deliberately bias the fiscal structure in support of 
the maintenance, growth and strength of families rather than the 
current system which deliberately favours the splitting up of 
families so people can go to work and send their children to child 
care. People who stay at home, fathers and mothers, deserve that 
same support. Reform would have broad based cuts that would 
remove several hundred thousand poor people completely from all 
tax rolls.
<P>
	Canadians now have a clear alternative. On the one side, a 
promise of a government that will keep the size of Ottawa and the 
bureaucracy where it is right now; use increased tax revenue to 
eliminate the deficit and then go on its merry old way, spending the 
increases in tax revenue that comes thereafter. Reform offers an 
alternative. It offers the elimination of the deficit through growth, 
some more reduction in the size of government and revenue 
increases thereafter used to give money back where it came from, 
the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to my hon. colleague's comments. 
Could he elaborate more on the Reform subamendment and how it 
deals with the question: What is the real situation as it pertains to 
the economic outlook for Montreal and Quebec?
<P>
	I have endeavoured twice today to ask that question of two hon. 
members from the Bloc Quebecois. Both have declined to properly 
address the question that separatism is the real culprit when it 
comes to the uncertainty that it creates for the economic climate of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, last Friday I spent two hours with a 
group of highly concerned citizens who met at the McGill faculty 
club. They were discussing possible steps that might be taken to 
create a renaissance in the city of Montreal.
<P>
	These were people who have spent all their professional and 
business working lives in Quebec and Montreal. They have seen 
this wonderful Canadian city go from one of the most prominent, 
rapidly growing, charming and great cities of North America into a 
tailspin that makes them extremely sad. They all acknowledge the 
root cause. What they were trying to do was to say: What can we do 
to reassure the world to come back to Montreal even though this 
threat exists?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, I did not have much good advice for them. I 
talked about my experiences with countries that have pulled 
themselves up by their bootstraps, such as Singapore, Hong Kong 
and other of the Asian tigers. They rejected the view that the 
separatist government, if it comes into power, would model itself 
after those countries because of its great commitment to social 
democratic values meddling in the economy. That is not  reassuring 
for any of the potential businesses that might consider moving to 
Montreal.
<P>
	The insight I gained is that it is not just the idea there might be 
separation with all of the uncertainties surrounding it. There is also 
the added problem that all of the pronouncements we have heard 
until quite recently from Mr. Bouchard are that we will continue to 
have huge government spending on all kinds of worthy projects 
which are preventing the growth of the economy and the restoration 
of confidence.
<P>
	I do not know the answers. I would say to my colleague there is 
no doubt that the threat of separation, plus the prospect of what 
might happen after separation by a very left wing government, 
carries the primary responsibility for the sad decline of the city of 
Montreal from one of the great cities in North America to a city 
with a sick economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I gave my 
first speech in the House on January 20, 1994 during the debate on 
the speech from the throne. I am disappointed that after two and a 
half years and two throne speeches little has changed.
<P>
	Back then I expressed the views I had heard from people in the 
Wetaskiwin riding during a year of campaigning. They were 
concerned about the economic future of Canada. They were 
worried about the kind of Canada their children and their 
grandchildren would inherit. Over the Thanksgiving break I heard 
the same concerns repeated time and again by my constituents.
<P>
	Before tackling the 1996 throne speech however, I would like to 
take a few moments to look back over the last two and a half years 
at the expectations and the realities of the 1994 throne speech.
<P>
	The first throne speech promised that MPs pensions would be 
reformed but hopes for meaningful change were dashed when the 
Liberal caucus troughers would only accept minor alterations to 
their gold plated MP pension plans. The Reform Party MPs who 
anticipated fair retirement packages had their hopes dashed as well, 
so we opted out.
<P>
	The ongoing unity debate and the continued growth of the 
national debt over the last two and a half years exposed this 
government as inefficient and ineffective.
<P>
	The litany of broken election promises and forgotten 
pronouncements of two throne speeches are signalling an end to 
this government's honeymoon.
<P>
	The 1996 throne speech commits the government to ``promote a 
proper climate for economic growth and jobs''. The government 
promises to do this by modernizing part I of the Canada Labour 
Code dealing with labour relations, an area not substantially 
changed in the last 20 years.
<P>
	The workplace of the 1990s is very different from that of the 
1970s. Restructuring and downsizing are the new  realities. The 
government, instead of responding to the new challenges in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6021"> 6021 </A></B>
<P>
positive and progressive manner, reverted to that old Liberal 
standby, a half million dollar study.
<P>
	Studies do not put gas in the tank or pay the mortgage. 
Employers can no longer guarantee lifelong jobs to employees. 
Workers want the government to provide an environment where 
labour and management can focus their attention on the task at 
hand without the threat of a strike or lockout.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Last year when the Minister of Labour appointed a task force to 
review part I of the labour code, I hoped that the recommendations 
would include a mechanism for solving disputes. In the last 20 
years Parliament has legislated an end to 19 work stoppages, 
including three in the last two years in the transportation and grain 
handling sectors. The combined costs of the west coast ports 
dispute and the railway strike/lock-out are estimated to be in the $4 
billion range. Yet the task force failed to seize the opportunity and 
recommend measures that would ensure Canadian products reach 
their markets.
<P>
	I recommended final offer selection arbitration to the task force 
as a mechanism to effectively and permanently resolve labour 
disputes that fall under federal jurisdiction. The industrial inquiry 
commission into west coast ports supported my position. Final 
offer selection arbitration gives labour and management the tools 
to resolve their differences. It does not favour one side over the 
other and it eliminates government interference in the negotiations. 
It puts the onus on both sides to reach an agreement and can be used 
equally by labour and management.
<P>
	If the government is serious about improving industrial 
relations, minimizing conflict and bringing greater stability to 
federally regulated sectors, labour and management must be 
provided with a permanent, just, and effective dispute settlement 
mechanism. Now that the minister has had an opportunity to reflect 
on the report and compare it to the recommendations from the 
industrial inquiry on west coast ports, I expect that he will 
recognize the benefits of final offer arbitration and will make it a 
focal a point in the code.
<P>
	Canadians have always been a step ahead of the old line 
governments. On October 25, 1993 voters showed that they wanted 
change. They tossed out the Tories believing that the Liberals had 
the people and the plan for the 1990s. What did they get? They got 
more of the same.
<P>
	My colleague the member for Beaver River put it quite 
succinctly when she said that the Liberals find it very difficult to 
take a firm stand on anything except of course fences. After putting 
up with three years of fence sitting, Canadians are demanding 
decisive leadership.
<P>
	My constituents told me that they want immediate action on the 
economy. They want tax relief now so that job creation can occur.
<P>
	What have three years of Liberal rule brought Canadians? Since 
coming to power the Liberals have raised taxes 31 times. As a 
result of these tax increases the government will collect $25 billion 
in extra revenue by 1997. We know now what their debt reduction 
strategy is.
<P>
	Even when the government reaches its target or if it reaches the 
target of 2 per cent of GDP or $17 billion, $70 million a day, $70 
billion annually will have been added to our debt. If the debt 
increases at the rate that it has been, it will be $615 billion by 
1997-98, an increase of $107 billion since the Liberals took office 
in 1993.
<P>
	As long as the government continues to spend more than it 
collects in revenues it has to keep borrowing to meet its 
commitments. The interest on that borrowed money will be a 
whopping $50 billion this year alone. When that $50 billion is 
added to the $600 billion that we owe already, it is a double 
whammy for Canadians. That is $48 billion or $50 billion that will 
not be available for health care and social programs.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has to balance the budget by 1997-98. I 
suspect that he would like to balance the budget but I believe that 
his task is made even more difficult because of his prime 
ministerial aspirations. Unfortunately for him, his current boss 
does not realize the seriousness of the problem.
<P>
	The Prime Minister acknowledges that ``of course we have a 
debt but we can pay off our interest; we have no problem at all''. 
Canadians know, even if the Prime Minister and his cabinet do not, 
that if you borrow money to pay the interest on loans and credit 
cards, you put yourself deeper and deeper into debt. Somehow the 
Prime Minister has missed this very basic reality of finance.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Only when there is an end to deficit financing will Canadians 
find the hope alluded to in the throne speech. When deficit 
financing ends, the Minister of Finance will be able to follow 
Reform's fresh start lead and ensure that future budget surpluses 
will be used to reduce taxes and to lower the debt.
<P>
	Had the Liberals adopted the common sense suggestions made in 
Reform's taxpayers budget released last year, Canadians would be 
on the way to budget surplus, investor confidence, job growth and 
social program securities this year. Instead, the Liberals are 
extending the pain with no prospect of gain, to the point that their 
fiscal policy is not just being called unsustainable any more but 
immoral.
<P>
	Canadians are willing to take the bitter medicine now if there is 
tax relief in sight. An aggressive attack on the deficit and a 
commitment to eliminating it by the year  1997-98 will be accepted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6022"> 6022 </A></B>
<P>
by taxpayers who do not want to leave a legacy of debt and deficit 
to their children. We simply cannot continue to borrow against our 
children's futures.
<P>
	Studies show that if the Liberal trend of taxation is allowed to 
continue, children born today will pay 32 per cent of their life 
income in taxes. Future generations will be even worse off. They 
will have to pay an estimated 65 per cent of their earnings in taxes, 
thanks to the inability of today's government to come to grips with 
the debt and deficit.
<P>
	After years of inept governments, Canadians are ready to take 
their future into their own hands. They recognize that the Canada 
pension plan and OAS programs cannot be counted on to finance 
their golden years. Canadians want control over their retirement 
savings to ensure that those golden years are not tarnished. 
Canadians do not want the government to impose higher taxes to 
prop up programs when their future viability is questionable. 
Canadians can look after themselves but only if the government 
curbs its appetite for taxes.
<P>
	When the government embarks on a plan to make the Canada 
pension plan sustainable for future generations as proposed in the 
throne speech, it must completely revamp the program and not 
simply increase the premiums and raise the age of eligibility.
<P>
	There are solutions to the problems we face. We need new ideas 
and a government that is not afraid to change. 1970s solutions are 
not applicable in the 1990s.
<P>
	On October 17 the Reform Party took another unprecedented 
step and released a fresh start election campaign. Our plan will 
reduce the size of government. It will provide tax relief. It will 
make families a Canadian priority. It will make our streets safer 
and it will repair our social safety net.
<P>
	I have appreciated the opportunity to speak on the throne speech 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to participate in the throne speech debate today.
<P>
	The throne speech develops themes and initiatives that will 
guide the government in its actions for the coming period. In 
reviewing the throne speech, it reflects some of the values that we 
have in Canada.
<P>
	Canada for the third year in a row has been recognized by the 
United Nations as being the best country in the world in which to 
live. This is a great honour. It also is reflective of the underlying 
values and supports Canada provides to all Canadians. It is a value 
system that distinguishes Canadians.
<P>
	Recently the CBC had a special in which it interviewed 
Canadians across the country and tried to define what it is to be 
Canadian. It found that it was very difficult to find a simple 
definition of Canadian. In reflecting on  that, it appears to me that 
what really defines Canada is that it is indefinable. We are a very 
diverse society. From coast to coast to coast we are very diverse in 
our cultural backgrounds, in our basic systems of operation.
<P>
	One only has to look at Quebec itself. Quebec is a delightful 
province with a tremendous history and culture. It is a province 
which has been the subject matter of much debate over the years, 
yet most Canadians who have visited Quebec know what a lovely 
province it is, just as every other province in the country is.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	It is clear when one goes to Quebec that it is the guardian of the 
French language, culture and laws. It has a distinctiveness. In fact, 
it is something to be cherished and protected by Canada. In my own 
mind, Canadians own a little piece of every part of this country. 
You, Mr. Speaker, own a little part of B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, all of the provinces from sea to sea to sea. As the 
taxpayers of the country, we invest in Canada. Through our various 
levels of government, we make sure that the value system that we 
have developed over the years is available to all Canadians.
<P>
	What a wonderful country we have that we can travel from 
province to province to enjoy the diversity that every province has 
to offer. If I have a need I can receive health care in any province in 
Canada, not because I have money but because I have that health 
care need.
<P>
	I could move to another province and have the same rights, 
privileges and freedoms as anyone who was born and raised there. 
That is the diversity of Canada and what makes it the best country 
in the world in which to live.
<P>
	I want to concentrate a little bit on the theme of credibility and 
integrity in government. Since becoming a member of Parliament 
in 1993, I have become more exposed than I ever was before to the 
public reaction to people who are in political life. There is no 
question that over the last 25 years there has been this attitude 
toward people in politics which is really, quite frankly, 
discomforting.
<P>
	The day before I was elected I was a community member with a 
family. I was involved very actively in the community. The day 
after the election I did not change. In fact I think I was elected, like 
most members here, because I had demonstrated a knowledge and 
sensitivity to my community and the ability to do a very important 
job on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of Canadians.
<P>
	When I came here and started a constituency office it was very 
interesting to find that people would all of a sudden start calling as 
if the election was still going on and start being critical and treating 
me as if all of a sudden I was one of them.
<P>
	I understand the partisan emotions that people have but once the 
election is over I wish that those who want  to continue to fight 
election campaigns after an election would take into account the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6023"> 6023 </A></B>
<P>
fact that all hon. members of Parliament have a responsibility first 
to their constituents.
<P>
	In my constituency office I am blessed to have excellent staff. 
There are Irene, Joan and Lyanne. When I am not able to be in the 
office they are there working on my behalf to make sure that my 
constituents get the service they need when they need it. If they 
have to speak to me I know my staff will make sure I find out at the 
earliest convenience so that I can personally address the needs of 
my constituents.
<P>
	We have an excellent opportunity to provide service. I know all 
members work very hard to keep that service level within the 
constituency offices so that Canadians are properly served and 
informed about the government's programs and services and also to 
get the assistance that they need when they are not sure or have 
some questions or doubt about the applicability of certain things 
within their jurisdictions or within the jurisdictions of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	We have another office in Ottawa with other staff. I have Nancy, 
and today Trudi is taking care of my office. We have people who 
are always contacting members of Parliament who really need to 
let them know what the issues are as they see them and try to 
determine whether or not those members of Parliament can give 
them some perspective of where we are coming from and how we 
can work together to see how we can make legislation work better 
within Canada.
<P>
	Many of these people are lobbyists on behalf of specific 
industries or business groups or social or political causes. Members 
of Parliament have a tremendous challenge to sort out special 
interest groups that deal in their own interests rather than in the 
interests of the broad base of Canadians which we as members of 
Parliament represent.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Each member of Parliament belongs to a political party. Each 
party has a caucus structure which allows members to convey the 
input of constituents. Members receive input from constituents 
from meetings, from phone calls or letters or from general 
encounters. As we work throughout our constituencies and attend 
many events, people talk to us. They tell us what is on their minds, 
when they like something or when they do not like something. That 
is what the job is all about.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I can bring that information back to 
Ottawa. I can go to my regional caucus and let my caucus 
colleagues know what people are saying. I can ask them about their 
people to see if we have consensus. We often find there is 
consensus within our own regional areas. There are similar 
problems. Our ridings are very close. We have this opportunity 
through  the communications mechanism of the caucus to let that 
message trickle up to the next level.
<P>
	The regional information goes to a provincial caucus. The chair 
of our regional caucus makes a report at the provincial caucus of 
the areas in which the members had consensus. On top of that, all 
members of that caucus-in my case the Ontario caucus-have the 
opportunity to further emphasize the issues that are most important 
to their constituents. I work hard at it.
<P>
	After that level we look for consensus again. It goes to the 
national caucus level where all the members of Parliament of a 
particular party get together and find out how all the regions of the 
country feel about the challenges that face them. We want to find 
some balance, some priorization of the issues that face Canadians 
at large.
<P>
	Every member of Parliament in my caucus has an opportunity to 
stand up in his or her place before the Prime Minister, before all the 
cabinet ministers, before all of their colleagues to say ``in my 
riding this issue is important and this is why''.
<P>
	The point is Canadians should know that members of 
Parliament, even those not in the cabinet who do not have high 
profile positions, have an extremely important job to do and a very 
good opportunity to raise issues in their caucuses right up to the 
level of the leader of their party or the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Further, legislative policy development is a very important 
aspect of a member of Parliament's job. We do this work within the 
theme of trying to enhance the credibility and the integrity of the 
profession of being an hon. member of Parliament.
<P>
	Members of Parliament have many issues that are of particular 
importance to them. Through the mechanisms of this place we have 
an opportunity to raise petitions on behalf of our constituents, to 
make statements in this place on behalf of issues or on behalf of 
constituents who let us know what really concerns them.
<P>
	We also have an opportunity to present motions in this place and 
propose changes to government legislation. I had one. We had a 
resolution on Bill C-41 which allowed me to raise a motion to 
change the law so that abusers of spouses or children will get stiffer 
penalties under the laws of Canada. That passed in this place, and I 
am very proud that I had an opportunity to participate in the 
development of a piece of legislation of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	That did not come out of the air. Nobody told me to do it. It came 
because I was involved in my community before I was elected. I 
was involved with Interim Place, our shelter for battered women. I 
knew what a terrible problem this was to our society. The problem 
has always been there. I saw this opportunity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6024"> 6024 </A></B>
<P>
	I know all members of Parliament from their own backgrounds 
and experiences have the opportunity to bring up their life 
experiences so they can help to shape and craft legislation in the 
best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	I have spent a lot of time talking about family issues. I think for 
the last three years I have been giving the same petition ``that 
managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value 
to our society''. And it goes on to say that we need some tax reform 
because families are very important.
<P>
	I have given many speeches in this place in which I have used 
lines such as: If the family was strong, the deficit would be gone. I 
have used other lines like: Strong families make a strong country. 
We have to invest in our children and invest in our families. These 
themes are coming through, I know they are.
<P>
	Even though my bill on splitting income between spouses did not 
get the confidence of the House, I know that when we introduce 
new legislation on employment insurance there will be wage 
subsidies for parents who have parental leave so they can come 
back into the workforce when they have taken care of their 
responsibility of caring for their children.
<P>
	I also know that the legislation includes training allowances so 
that those people who have taken the time to provide direct parental 
care will have the opportunity to get their skills back into shape and 
can properly take their role in society, working and being as good 
as they can be in the employment sector.
<P>
	I also spent some time working on the underground economy. I 
spent six months studying it in Canada and the U.S. I put forward a 
private member's motion in this place which prescribed a program 
to address the underground economy. All members of the House 
who spoke supported the motion. In fact, it passed and was then 
taken by the then Minister of National Revenue and with 
departmental officials, a seven point program was developed to 
address the issues related to the underground economy.
<P>
	Last June the new Minister of National Revenue rose in this 
place and thanked me, saying that as a result of that seven point 
program that she could announce that they had assessed over $1 
billion of additional taxes which were unbudgeted because of 
problems in the underground economy. That is the kind of thing 
that happens in this place which make me excited about this job, 
because I know there are opportunities to make good things happen 
if you can only continue to earn respect within your own caucus 
and in the House to garner support for issues that you feel are very 
important.
<P>
	Members in this place will also know that I have spent a lot of 
time on the responsible use of alcohol. They know that I got 
unanimous consent of all parties on  December 7, 1995, supporting 
health warning labels on the containers of alcoholic beverages. 
That has been stuck in committee. I am afraid that it may stay there 
and when the next election comes it will still be there and will die. I 
did not give up. I continue to work on it and it is continually being 
studied as part of the review of Canada's national drug strategy.
<P>
	As a result of my research I did into the problems associated 
with alcohol misuse, I started to put together a program which is 
now called ``Drink Smart Canada''. Drink Smart Canada today is a 
national public awareness campaign on the responsible use of 
alcohol. There are over 8,000 posters circulating across Canada, 
over 120 municipalities have passed resolutions in their chambers 
endorsing Drink Smart. The Canadian Police Association and the 
Association of Canadian Chiefs of Police are the honorary patrons. 
We have a toll free number and we receive several calls every day 
from people who want more information and who want to 
participate.
<P>
	On November 7 there will be a special forum of national groups 
and organizations that are going to come together to help to kick off 
the remaining strategy of the Drink Smart Canada campaign.
<P>
	I did not have to do these things, but I sensed from the support I 
received from all parties in the House on the health warning labels 
on the containers of alcoholic beverages that members in this place 
wanted to make sure that the issues associated with alcohol did not 
die. The members here are wondering what are those issues. Those 
issues are: 50 per cent of family violence; 65 per cent of child 
abuse; 1 in 6 family breakdowns; 45 per cent of automobile 
collisions; 30 per cent of suicides; 45 per cent of fires; 50 per cent 
of hospital emergencies. These are all directly or indirectly due to 
alcohol misuse. It costs Canadians $15 billion a year and 19,000 
people die each year as a result of the irresponsible use of alcohol. 
This is an important issue and I am prepared to fight for it, to work 
hard and to make sure that the issues are before Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I have talked a lot about fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol 
syndrome is the problems associated with alcohol consumption 
during pregnancy. Five per cent of birth defects are caused by 
alcohol consumption during pregnancy. It costs Canadians $2.7 
billion a year to deal with the problems associated with FAS, 
additional health care costs, social program costs, criminal justice 
costs and lost productivity in our society; due to a child who is yet 
to be born. It is a 100 per cent preventable tragedy.
<P>
	In 1992 the Standing Committee on Health prepared a report on 
FAS, the 100 per cent preventable tragedy. The report 
recommended health warning labels on the containers of alcoholic 
beverages so that we could alert Canadians of the risks associated 
with consuming alcohol during pregnancy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6025"> 6025 </A></B>
<P>
	From those examples Canadians probably have a reasonable 
idea that members of Parliament, even those not in cabinet, have 
an important role to play in this place. We have an important role 
to support the themes articulated in the throne speech, to improve 
the integrity and the credibility of people who change their lives 
to come to this place to represent constituents and represent all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Politics is really a team sport. There are several teams but by and 
large I know members of Parliament in this place in their hearts 
come here to do a good job for their constituents, and to do what 
they can to shape and to craft important legislation that will make 
sure that Canada continues to be the best country in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order. I am almost certain that I rose to my feet a split 
second before my hon. colleague from North Vancouver.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. We have 10 
minutes and each member can have five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was 
such an enthralling speech I could have sworn I saw you dozing off 
for a moment there.
<P>
	I would like to question the member on two particular issues. He 
rambled on at great length about the wonderful health care system 
we have and how universal it is.
<P>
	The first question deals with the province of Quebec, which 
refuses to properly reimburse other provinces for the health care 
given to its citizens when they use the health services of other 
provinces. The present health minister, when he was in opposition, 
regularly complained about that in this House and said the Liberal 
government would do something about it. Then on the TV program 
``Ottawa Inside Out'' just a few months ago he suddenly says it is 
not at the top of the priority list anymore. Yet he was more than 
happy to punish Alberta and B.C. for trying to find alternative ways 
to fund their health care systems. Why is the Minister of Health 
now ignoring the serious violation of the Canada Health Act by 
Quebec?
<P>
	The second question deals with waiting lists. Can he please 
explain why the Liberal government has given the entrepreneur of 
the year award to a company in Winnipeg that provides waiting list 
insurance for Canadians so that they can go to the United States for 
medical services when they have to wait too long in Canada?
<P>
	Finally, what does he have to say to one of my constituents, Mrs. 
Gawenda, who waited nine months for an operation in Vancouver 
that should have been done within weeks? She ended up going to 
Seattle and paying $15,000 of her own money to have it done. The 
doctors down there said what sort of a country would have  allowed 
a person to go nine months waiting for an operation that should 
have been done in three weeks.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the premise of the member's 
question has to do with the issues surrounding what happened in 
Alberta and B.C. What happened there was they were operating a 
two tier health care system-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Quebec is the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> I will address Quebec in a moment, if the member 
would give me an opportunity to respond. It took several months. 
The health minister of the day gave several months for Alberta to 
change the situation so that Canadians could get health care not 
because they had money but because they were sick.
<P>
	With regard to the Quebec situation, the rules guiding the 
provinces from the federal level are contained in the Canada Health 
Act. The five principles of the Canada Health Act are portability, 
accessibility, universality, comprehensiveness and publicly funded. 
The government, through the Canada health and social transfer, 
transfers the moneys. If there are problems there the rules are in 
place to deal with them and the provinces will surely have to 
comply with the spirit and in fact the law of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	With regard to waiting lists, that is a provincial jurisdiction. I do, 
however, understand that people have to wait. I spent nine years on 
the board of the Mississauga hospital and five years as treasurer. I 
know that the tremendous shift to an ambulatory philosophy 
toward providing health care has made sure that hospitals even 
when they downsize actually are serving more patients than they 
used to more efficiently. They are more cost effective.
<P>
	There are certain things they cannot do on demand. Any business 
has to respond to fiscal realities. I do not think that in this case the 
member has convinced me that his constituent is not getting 
appropriate health care.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask the hon. member a 
question following, as my colleague says, his riveting presentation. 
We can certainly tell there is an election coming when politicians 
become so full of themselves.
<P>
	Earlier the hon. Minister for International Cooperation and 
Minister responsible for Francophonie made a presentation in this 
House. He talked about what he viewed as the Reform Party 
inconsistency in our policies.
<P>
	I point out from <I>Hansard</I> page 5561, October 22, 1996 that in 
response to a question about the announcement of a grant of $11 
million to Viet Nam and the concern expressed by an hon. member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6026"> 6026 </A></B>
<P>
during that question about human rights abuses in Viet Nam, the 
hon. minister replied that the Canadian government should not use  
economic pressure to resolve a situation concerning human rights. 
That is what he said basically, that he did not believe that.
<P>
	Later on the same day the same minister in response to a 
question about the situation in Afghanistan and the concern 
expressed there for human rights replied: ``The Canadian 
government is extremely concerned about human rights not being 
respected, in particular women's rights, in Afghanistan. That is 
why we have suspended all Canadians funds for local initiatives 
until further notice''.
<P>
	We talk about inconsistencies. Unfortunately there was not time 
for me to put this question directly to him, but I will put it to his 
hon. colleague because he does represent the Liberal government. 
This minister is saying in connection with Viet Nam that no, we 
cannot tie human rights to economic aid and yet with Afghanistan 
we do prevent economic aid because of human rights abuses.
<P>
	I am wondering, as are the people of Canada, which is it?
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that I clarify one 
thing for members of the House and for Canadians.
<P>
	As a backbench member of Parliament I do not speak on behalf 
of the minister and I do not speak on behalf of the Liberal Party. I 
am part of a team, but I have no authority and no way to represent 
the position of the government.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, I am familiar with the issues which the 
member has raised and I will give him my personal input, which is 
what my job is.
<P>
	The member will well know that human rights issues are very 
important to Canada. The social values that we have in this country 
have meant that every time international situations arise Canadians 
look to Canada to provide leadership where possible. The member 
must surely know that with a population of just about 30 million 
people it is very difficult to go to China and say ``I am the Prime 
Minister of Canada. I represent 30 million people and you should 
stop doing what you are doing''. The premier of China would say 
``I am the premier of China and I represent one billion people''.
<P>
	Canada has a role to play in terms of its model. We supported our 
UN allies with the embargoes on South Africa. We supported our 
allies in the Afghanistan situation. However, we are not singing 
from a linear song sheet.
<P>
	For example, let us look at the Cuba situation. Canada does not 
support the U.S. position on Cuba. Canada's position appears to be, 
very clearly, that the best way to change human rights abuses in 
Cuba is for Canadians to be there, to be doing business there and to 
have some  input and show Cubans how we can work together to 
make the world a safer place.
<P>
	The point is do not look for a simple solution to the complex 
problems of the world. Every situation has different circumstances. 
Canada will play its role as it always has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after listening to 
the member's intervention I am reminded of the immortal words of 
Forest Gump: ``Blah, blah, blah, blah''. That is all I have to say 
about that.
<P>
	Throne speeches are an opportunity for the government to chart a 
course and lay out its plans for the country, for the people and for 
the government for the ensuing months.
<P>
	Different kinds of thrones often produce different results. I am 
afraid that the Canadian people have received a vastly inferior 
product with this throne speech.
<P>
	Let us examine the facts. The government talked about all the 
wonderful things it was going to do for Canada. It talked about all 
the wonderful things it was going to do for the coastal communities 
of Canada, for example. The reality is vastly different.
<P>
	The government has made vicious cuts to essential services such 
as the coast guard, search and rescue, fish hatcheries and light 
stations, to name a few, in the pursuit of saving a small amount of 
money in comparison to total government spending.
<P>
	In the case of fish hatcheries we are talking about $3 million to 
$4 million a year. In the case of light stations we are talking about 
$3 million a year. In the case of the coast guard we are talking 
about $7 million a year. That is the coast guard; not for aids to 
navigation, but search and rescue. Those are coast guard services 
that actually are there to prevent the loss of Canadian human life, 
mariners and fishermen on the high seas.
<P>
	We are told that these services have to be cut. We cannot afford 
them any more. The government just does not have the money.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	We agree that this country has a serious deficit and debt problem. 
However, we say that the places where the government ought to cut 
last is where the government is actually delivering a service in the 
field to Canadians.
<P>
	I have told people in my riding that if they want to find out where 
the DFO office is in Ottawa, they should fly to Ottawa, take a cab, 
drive around the downtown core and when they find the nicest, 
biggest, shiniest ivory tower, get out of the cab and walk over to the 
front door. I guarantee they have just found the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6027"> 6027 </A></B>
<P>
	The building is full from the top to the bottom with bureaucrats. 
A whole floor is dedicated to communications. What is meant by 
communications?  They are talking about spin doctors. The whole 
floor is designed to sell the minister's decisions to the Canadian 
people. That is what the government considers to be an essential 
service. It is not the coast guard boats that are out there to save and 
preserve Canadian lives during problems, storms and so on. No, 
that is not an essential service.
<P>
	The government uses the throne speech in a despicable way. It 
tries to convince Canadians that it is actually concerned about their 
welfare. In reality it is more concerned about its own welfare and 
places that as a much higher priority than any of the other priorities 
it has.
<P>
	Let us examine for a minute the fact that after all these cuts the 
Government of Canada turns around and gives an $87 million no 
interest loan to its corporate buddies over at Bombardier. If the 
people at Bombardier wanted my money as a taxpayer, could they 
not ask me for it? Could they not knock on my door and say: ``We 
would like to have some money. We need to do some R and D. You 
are a Canadian citizen and we think you should contribute to this 
cause''. They could but they do not. Do you know why they do not? 
Because I would tell them to go play in the traffic. I would tell them 
they do not need my money because they have $6 billion in assets. 
They are making millions of dollars in profits and there are 
Canadians who do need my money. I would tell them to get lost.
<P>
	However, Bombardier does not have to come to me or to the 
taxpayers of Canada to get permission to steal my money. No, it 
comes to the government and gets permission to coerce money out 
of me and all of the other taxpayers across this country to support 
its corporate objectives.
<P>
	When I was first elected and came here I was absolutely 
dumbfounded one day when I opened the <I>Financial Post</I> and read 
that the government had made a $60 million U.S. loan for the 
construction of an aluminum smelter in South Africa. Think about 
this for a minute. Canada is one of the leading producers of 
aluminum in the world. There are 10 smelters in Quebec. There is 
one world class smelter in my riding in Kitimat, British Columbia. 
Not only the company, but the people who work in those companies 
are all contributing to the tax base here. The government does not 
ask them: ``Do you think we should send $60 million to South 
Africa to build an aluminum smelter down there?'' No, it does not 
ask anyone; it just says it is doing it.
<P>
	And what is SNC-Lavalin? Just another corporate buddy of the 
Liberal government. It is another corporation which happens to 
make hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
	When we look at the record of this government and consider its 
approach to issues, it does not take very long to come to the 
conclusion that the Liberal government will put the priorities and 
the interests of Canadians  behind its own political interests every 
time out of the starting gate. Frankly, it is starting to really annoy 
me and a lot of other Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberal red book is a Liberal dead book. The speech from 
the throne is nothing more than a pompous, self-inflated statement 
designed to mislead Canadians and has no real intent to serve their 
interests.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to finally address the throne speech. Only in the Canadian 
system could we be addressing a speech where all the goals and 
finances were established six months ago. In fact, half the 
programs have already been spent.
<P>
	I will address my area as critic which is public works which 
deals with a number of areas within government and with 
government contracts.
<P>
	One of the first areas we dealt with in the government operations 
committee was the Senate. The finances of the Senate can come 
before our committee. I moved a resolution to have one of the 
Senate financial people come before our committee to explain how 
the Senate was going to spend its $40 million allocation plus 
another $11 million in expenses. It went through this House. It was 
the first time in Canadian history I might add that the Senate was 
asked to come before a committee to account for its expenses. 
Guess what? The people from the Senate did not show up. They felt 
that they did not have to. This brings us to the crux of the Canadian 
system.
<P>
	Here we have a group of senators-I will call them a double U 
Senate, unelected and unaccountable-refusing to come before this 
House to justify their expenses. That is absolutely wrong. This is 
why we need a triple E Senate, elected, effective and equal. A lot of 
the legislation that went through this House-the GST is a good 
example, and gun control-would not have gone through if there 
had been an elected Senate, an effective Senate.
<P>
	It happens in the United States and the Australian governments. 
They have Senates that work. Unfortunately we do not. It is 
fundamental to our system that this government right across the 
board voted to give the Senate its allocation of $40 million plus $11 
million in expenses without questioning where it was going to 
spend that money.
<P>
	Another area within public works is contracts. My colleague 
from Skeena commented on Bombardier. Why in heaven should 
Bombardier receive millions of dollars? It is one of the most 
profitable corporations in Canada yet it went to the Liberal 
government and got that money. Why? Because it donated 
$174,000 over the past three years to the Liberal Party.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6028"> 6028 </A></B>
<P>
	Another one is the mine sweeper contract that went finally to 
SNC-Lavalin. This is a $35 million contract. Halifax Shipyards 
submitted the lowest bid and the best technical bid. It was the 
outfit that was recommended by the Department of National 
Defence but did Halifax Shipyards get that contract? No. It went 
to SNC-Lavalin in Quebec which is a very large Liberal supporter.
<P>
	Is this the kind of government Canadians want? Canadians want 
a straight up, level playing field so that when contracts are given 
out, they are given out to the best possible competitor. That does 
not happen. I have seen contracts that have been rewritten. A 
contract on the east coast is written one way and when the contract 
goes to a west coast firm, the contract is rewritten so that the west 
coast firm cannot compete. That is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	There has to be a level playing field in all contracts. That simply 
is not happening right now. The government is playing favourites 
like Bombardier, like SNC-Lavalin. This is clearly the old style 
politics. This is the Mulroney style politics. We know what 
happened to the Mulroney gang. The same thing is going to happen 
to this gang because Canadians simply will not put up with it.
<P>
	We are in a debt and deficit hole. We need to spend our money 
wisely. We Canadians do not really like paying our taxes, but if we 
paid our taxes knowing full well that they were going to go to the 
right cause with efficiency, with economy, Canadians would be 
quite happy to come forward with their taxes. Right now they have 
absolutely no confidence in this government when it comes to 
spending their money. This will change come the next election.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Another area within public works is Canada Post. What has 
happened to our postal system? Over the past 10 or 12 years we 
cannot get a letter across a city in the same day or between cities in 
two days and anywhere in the country in three days. That is what 
the Radwanski report is saying. This should be the goal of Canada 
Post. Get of the courier business. Get out of Purolator Courier and 
get out of the ad mail business.
<P>
	I will describe exactly what has happened in Canada Post. 
Canada Post owns half of Purolator. It is the biggest player in the 
courier business. By allowing Canada Post to falter, not to be able 
to get a letter across town for 45 cents, we then have to go to 
Purolator and pay $9 to get it across town. This is really good 
business, is it not? But they are playing with Canadian tax dollars. 
Canada Post absolutely refuses to show the cross-subsidization that 
is happening, where the 45-cent stamp is going. It undercuts ad 
mail. It undercuts it so that it is then the best player in town. It 
undercuts Purolator so that the other players, the private sector, are 
at a disadvantage.
<P>
	Canada Post has to get out of that altogether and get back to its 
real mandate of efficient and economical  delivery of mail. That is 
what the Reform Party believes. Canada Post should have the 
mandate to get back to the basics. If it cannot do that after being 
given a perfect chance, then the Reform Party will consider 
privatizing it. If that is the only way we can get mail delivered in 
this country, then we will do it.
<P>
	The United States and Australia have similar distances, similar 
problems within their postal systems yet they can do it. Why can 
Canada Post not do it? Canada Post cannot do it because it is 
embroiled in trying to get into the public sector, which is absolutely 
wrong.
<P>
	Canada Post has forgotten its absolute beginning mandate and 
this is where the Radwanski report is absolutely bang on. Allow 
Canada Post to be opened to access to information. Allow the 
auditor general into Canada Post to deal with it. Right now we 
cannot get any information from Canada Post on its finances or on 
what is going on. This is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	In summary in the contract area and in the big corporate areas 
such as Canada Post and CMHC, the government has a dismal 
record. We must get government out of the faces of Canadians, get 
back to the basics and have contracts awarded on a real, effective, 
level playing field. In that way Canadians will be getting the best 
bang for their buck.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to comment on the speeches from the previous two speakers 
who shared their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order. I stood for questions and comments. Is that not permitted 
now?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes, it is questions and comments. This 
Speaker always recognizes a member from a party other than the 
one which gave an intervention.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
particularly like to compliment the first speaker of the two. He 
made it very clear to us and described in detail the needs of some of 
his constituents in the coastal communities of British Columbia.
<P>
	As a member who comes from Ontario who has had brief visits 
to British Columbia it is good for me to hear a member from that 
part of the world describe these things in great detail. In so doing he 
is educating all of us in our responsibilities. The member had the 
wisdom to put price tags on some of the things his people at home 
needed. I found that description an honest presentation of the needs 
of the people of British Columbia. It was in stark contrast to the 
criticism that followed on the government's movements with 
Bombardier and the criticism of SNC Lavalin.
<P>
	The member and the speaker previous to him implied that the 
government's dealings with Bombardier and SNC Lavalin were 
related only to politics. They failed to  recognize that those two 
corporations are tremendous Canadian companies. As the Minister 
of Industry said the other day, the Government of Canada is 
backing a winner in the world of aerospace when it backs 
Bombardier and all governments around the world lucky enough to 
have aerospace industries provide subsidies to them.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6029"> 6029 </A></B>
<P>
	In SNC Lavalin we have one of the greatest engineering 
companies in the world. It is highly regarded by its colleagues in 
the private sector because it is leading the charge of the Canadian 
private sector into the markets of China which is where some of our 
subsequent wealth in future years will come from. Therefore we 
should be encouraging that company, not berating it in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Both previous speakers accused the governing party of old style 
politics. I suggest they have given a demonstration of old style 
politics. They have come to Ottawa to say this is what I need to take 
back home and do not give anything to anybody else who is not 
from my community or my province or my region. That is the kind 
of regionalism that is divisive.
<P>
	It is perfectly legitimate to express the needs of your 
communities. That is what I want to hear. But I do not want to hear 
criticisms of other communities, other corporations, other 
provinces that are doing the same thing in order to build the 
federation as a whole. That is old style politics, coming to Ottawa 
and asking what can I grab, what can I take home?
<P>
	My questions to those speakers are: What are they bringing to 
the federation? Which shared Canadian values are-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired because 
only five minutes are allowed. Only the member for 
Comox-Alberni may reply since there has already been a question 
period for the member for Skeena.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member said that we only come 
to this area to grab something for our own province. I would point 
out that three provinces are have provinces. One of them is British 
Columbia. We are very much at the bottom of the stick when it 
comes to receiving from the other end.
<P>
	All we are asking for is a level playing field with equal give and 
take. British Columbians are tired of give, give, give. As my 
colleague for Skeena said, in the coastal communities it has been 
lighthouses, coast guard, fisheries. It is an on and on list of 
abandoning British Columbian coastal communities. This is not the 
<P>
way a government should be operating, particularly toward a 
province like British Columbia that contributes more in transfer 
payments than it gets.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no further speakers and it 
being approximately 2 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and put forthwith every  question necessary to dispose 
of the subamendment and the amendment now before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the 
amendment?<B></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to order adopted, the division 
stands deferred until Tuesday, November 5, 1996, at 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday at11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.04 p.m.)<B></B>
