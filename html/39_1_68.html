    </p><a name="Para214239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the report seeks to make permanent the Standing Orders of this House that were in effect on October 5, 2006, which include a series of provisional Standing Orders that were adopted in the last Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs is permanently mandated with the review of Standing Orders, procedure and practice in the House of Commons and in its committees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Orders are defined by Marleau and Montpetit's <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> as:</div>

      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The permanent written rules under which the House regulates its proceedings are known as the Standing Orders.</small></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para214243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can certainly understand how most Canadians may find this topic boring and even foreign. I know you do not, Mr. Speaker, as you are a student of these Standing Orders. However, for a parliamentary system it is of the utmost importance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to John George Bourinot, Clerk of the House of Commons from 1890 to 1902, the rules that regulate our proceedings are essential for reasons that include the protection of the minority, the restraint of improvidence and tyranny of the majority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules must allow the opposition in the House of Commons to hold the government to account and to answer for its actions. However, at the same time, these rules must not prevent the government from being able to govern. It is this balance that parliamentary procedure intends to ensure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these permanent written rules, the House of Commons can adopt rules for a limited period of time. They are known as provisional Standing Orders. Provisional Standing Orders are adopted for a specific amount of time and are adopted on an experimental basis. They can be dropped, amended or made permanent if the House so wishes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for that purpose that I move my motion today. I want the House to express itself on whether or not the provisional Standing Orders adopted in the last Parliament should be made permanent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 18, 2005, the House adopted by unanimous consent a series of provisional Standing Orders that would expire 60 days into the 39th Parliament, which is our current Parliament. Before the 60 days, the House agreed to extend these provisional Standing Orders until November 21, 2006. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisional Standing Orders that are set to expire in a few weeks affect approximately 11 permanent Standing Orders. For example, under the provisional Standing Orders, all opposition motions on supply days are now votable. All speeches, including speeches by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Leader of the Opposition are now subject to a question and comment period. All parties can now be represented on the liaison committee. Committee reports have a greater chance of being voted on in this House. The government benefits greatly by the fact that there is now a 48 hour period of notice required for all opposition day motions. This replaces the previous 24 hour notice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a few minutes to review in greater detail some of the rule changes and, in my view, the positive effect these provisional Standing Orders have had on how we conduct business in this place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to quote the Hon. George Drew, leader of the opposition on June 4, 1956. In an edition of <i>Hansard</i> he said, “The word 'Commons' means the people. This is the House of the people”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew's statement is as accurate now as it was then.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the primary functions of this chamber is to allow people to debate. Opinions must be allowed to be expressed, questions must be permitted to be asked and decisions must be made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the rules affected by these provisional Standing Orders is that now all speeches in the House are subject to a question and comment period. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that even speeches by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Leader of the Opposition are now subject to a question and comment period.

    </p><a name="Para214257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would anyone not agree to allow members of this chamber to ask questions of the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. Must we shield the Prime Minister from taking questions from the members in the House of Commons? I think most would agree that all speeches should be subject to questioning. After all, is that not the true nature of debate?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another rule that I believe was positively affected by the provisional Standing Orders is that all opposition motions debated on allotted days are now votable. On the issue of allotted days, I would like to quote Marleau and Montpetit's <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> at page 722 where it states:</div>
    </p><a name="Para214259"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The setting aside of a specified number of sitting days on which the opposition chooses the subject of debate derives from the tradition which holds that Parliament does not grant Supply until the opposition has had an opportunity to demonstrate why it should be refused.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para214260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 724 it goes on to say:</div>
    </p><a name="Para214261"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Members in opposition to the government may propose motions for debate on any matter falling within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, as well as on committee reports concerning Estimates.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para214262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition parties put a lot of work into preparing their motions for debate on allotted days. In fact, these days are another tool that allows opposition parties as a whole to hold the government to account. Supply days allow the topic of discussion to be decided on by a party that is not the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is thanks to the provisional Standing Orders that now all opposition motions on allotted days come to a vote. Reverting to the old Standing Orders would prevent opposition parties from having some of their motions come to a vote in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the issue of committee reports. Most members of the House sit on standing committees and this is where a lot of the heavy lifting happens in the business of the House of Commons. Committees make their views, opinions and recommendations known to the House by way of reports. In fact, standing committees are permanently mandated with the power to report their findings to the House. It is essential to their role as microcosms and extensions of the House that they be allowed to do this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all members would agree that standing committees work hard in preparing their reports on a variety of issues for presentation to the House. In the past, when a member would ask the House to concur in a given report, the government of the day would move a dilatory motion or debate on the report until an intervening item, such as question period or private members' business, would have the debate in the concurrence motion interrupted. It would then be up to the government to decide if debate would resume or not on the motion to concur in the committee report. The provisional Standing Orders adopted in the last Parliament increased the chances that committee reports will be voted on without any intervening items shelving them, as these debates are limited to three hours.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the value of a committee's work is increased as it has the ability to continue meaningfully in the proceedings of the House. Its work is not ignored and committee members can bring important items to the attention of the entire House of Commons for debate and for a vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These small but important changes adopted on a provisional basis were recommended by the Conservatives in the last Parliament. The member, who is currently the chief government whip, and his party, then in opposition, championed these small changes to our rules. It was the Conservatives along with the Bloc and the NDP that proposed these provisional Standing Orders to the then governing Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives believed that these rules would add to the fairness and the balance of our proceedings. They believed that because all opposition days would be votable and the committee reports would not so easily be ignored, individual member's work would be valued. We agreed with the then Conservative opposition when we were in government. In fact, on February 18, 2005, the government of the day asked the House to concur in the provisional Standing Orders as proposed by the Conservatives. By unanimous consent, they were adopted on a provisional basis.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015">(1015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that on September 20, 2006 the House agreed to have the provisional Standing Orders remain in effect until November 21, 2006. Of course, after November 21, the old Standing Orders would come back into effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Orders, that would not include the provisional Standing Orders proposed by the Conservatives when they were in opposition, would in effect be over with unless something was done in the intervening time. That something is what my motion accomplishes today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will express itself on whether or not the provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent, the same ones championed by the Conservatives. Some will argue that we should not adopt these provisional rules now as Standing Orders because they may need to be reviewed or amended. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that other Standing Orders may need to be reviewed, however nothing prevents the House from adopting the rules that have been in effect since February of 2005. Did we say back then that the current provisional rules could not be adopted because other Standing Orders may need to be reviewed? Of course not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> reminds us that there have been countless reviews of Standing Orders. In fact, the first amendments to our written rules occurred only four months after the adoption of the very first Standing Orders after Confederation. I am sure our practice, procedure and privileges will always be subject to review and scrutiny, as well they should. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, it is not my intention to hold up the business of the House with my motion today, however I do believe the House should permanently adopt the provisional rules as proposed by the Conservatives when they were in opposition, the same rules we have been following since February 2005, and that they be put into effect unanimously.</div>

The comments might leave the incorrect impression in the minds of some members, or perhaps in the minds of the public, that these provisional Standing Orders, which were proposed by the Conservative Party when we were in opposition, are now opposed by the Conservative Party now that we find ourselves in government. It might leave the false impression that we favoured rules that led to openness and free debate when we were in opposition, but now that we are in government, we seek to shut these things down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, that is the opposite of the truth. We favoured these things when we were in opposition. We favour such amendments right now. We favour working consensually to achieve a means of moving forward on improving the quality of debate in this House</div>
    </p><a name="Para214277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for this reason that we opposed the manner in which these particular Standing Orders were brought in, through a motion with no notice, to the procedure and House affairs committee, thereby violating the collegial spirit that had led to the prior process adopted by unanimous consent in a meeting of the House leaders and the whips of all parties only a few days before this motion was brought to the procedure and House affairs committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That had led to the choosing of a date, slightly delayed, so that there would be time for the provisional Standing Orders to be reviewed consensually. It would allow us to look for improvements to them, on the theory that the first draft designed a while ago ought to be improved where possible in order to ensure that it could function better. That was superceded by this decision to push forward unilaterally and without notice, in violation of a resolution that had been achieved unanimously and adopted unanimously by this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the member. Why did the opposition whip introduce a motion that superceded a unanimous decision of the House following a consensual agreement that took place in private, behind closed doors, that allowed for the smooth operation of the House and the improvement of these procedural rules? What was the reason for unilaterally violating that?</div>

    </p><a name="Para214288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been debated in the procedure and House affairs committee at some length over the past few weeks. I must start out by saying, as I did in my remarks when the chief whip of the official opposition brought forward this motion, that I am actually quite disappointed, disturbed, and a little annoyed by the tactics employed by the official opposition in this regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague just referred to the process in his intervention and question to the official opposition whip. As he laid out, and as I will reiterate, it is not that we are opposed to any or perhaps all of these provisional Standing Orders. The chief opposition whip laid out in some detail the process that led to part of the Standing Orders that the House operates under and I concur with the detail she provided. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisional Standing Orders came about through negotiations in the last minority Parliament, the 38th Parliament, in which the Liberal Party was government and the Conservative Party filled the role of the official opposition. They came about through negotiations initially between the opposition parties and subsequently with the government. They were adopted unanimously on February 18, 2005, as the opposition whip indicated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had an expiry date because they were provisional and the tradition of the House is that when we adopt things like this we try them out for a while, take them for a test drive as it were. She is quite right that written into the use of these provisional Standing Orders was an expiry date of 60 days into the following Parliament, which is the current 39th Parliament. They were due to expire somewhere around October 10, 2006, which was a week or so ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I find so disturbing and annoying. As I said at committee, the House must operate on a basis of mutual respect and trust. We must have that especially between the four House leaders of the four parties and the four whips, I would argue. I have had the very distinct privilege and pleasure to serve four times as a whip and once as a House leader, so I think I speak with some authority and experience in the role of a caucus officer. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hold very strongly to the tenet that one's word is one's bond. That is the way I was raised in northeastern British Columbia, Fort St. John in my riding. That is how I was raised on the farm. That is what my parents taught me. I have tried to bring that to the House of Commons in everything that I do. One's word is one's bond. We simply must as House leaders, whips and I would argue deputies as well, have the responsibility on behalf of Canadians to keep this place functioning. We must have that mutual respect and trust between all House officers of the four respective parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What unfortunately has happened in this particular process is that this trust has been broken, hopefully not irretrievably but it has been broken. Allow me to explain. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was getting closer to the expiry date of these provisional Standing Orders, the opposition brought it to our attention at the weekly House leaders and whips meeting. There is a weekly meeting, as you would know, Mr. Speaker, and I see you are nodding, as you served as the House leader for quite some time for the New Democratic Party. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that you are very familiar with the process where the four House leaders, four whips and their senior staff meet once a week to decide on the agenda and how to conduct business in the chamber. We meet behind closed doors because we have to take the partisanship out of it and we have to work as cooperatively as possible in the best interests of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025">(1025)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened? On the meeting that was held on September 19 we talked about this. I think it was the government House leader who brought it to the attention of all parties at that meeting, because it had been raised earlier by the opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 19 we came to an agreement. How do we know and how is it proven that we came to an agreement? Because the very next day, with unanimous consent and support, the government House leader brought forward a motion in this place to extend those provisional Standing Orders to November 21 to give us time to work through it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement was that the senior staff of the House leaders would get together. We anticipated that during the Thanksgiving week break from parliamentary duties they would get together and discuss how we could move this forward, and any possible amendments, because there was some consideration for amendments that we have raised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clerk of the House of Commons herself had some suggestions for wording, not to change the intent, and I want to be very clear about this. It was not to change the intent of the provisional Standing Orders, but to perhaps make them work more effectively for all parliamentarians and for the institution itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to consult with the Clerk. We wanted to have our senior staff meet and work through these provisional Standing Orders, certainly well before the extension of the deadline to November 21, and come back to the House with these provisional Standing Orders, amended in a way that we all agree to, just as we did on February 18, 2005, and by unanimous support, with no debate, to just pass these and make the necessary changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I am so upset, as I have said, is because this House, to be functional and to operate in an effective manner, must be based on mutual respect despite our political differences and our partisan differences from time to time. Mr. Speaker, you know it, I know it, and anyone who has worked here knows it. The reality is that now this trust has been broken, because we had an agreement, and the official opposition, I would submit, for partisan reasons broke its word. That is the reality. The chief opposition whip knows it. There is no logical reason.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague asked her the question. When the deadline has been extended through unanimous support, unanimous agreement, why is there this rush all of a sudden? She knows, as I know, that this is all about payback because procedurally we used to use a few processes in the House to try to push our agenda forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have served almost my entire career in opposition. I know that procedurally, when one is in opposition, one uses any Standing Orders and processes that one can to try to promote one's agenda and stymie the government. We understand that, but not at the price of breaking one's word. That is the point. The point is not the provisional Standing Orders themselves although, as I have laid out, there are some minor changes that we would like to see. What the reality is, and the more important issue, is the breaking of one's word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that at the next House leaders' meeting, which is this afternoon--it is held every Tuesday afternoon--what is the point in trying to reach agreement on how the agenda is going to move forward if the next day or the next week we find those agreements broken? The House cannot operate this way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Mr. Speaker, because I have the utmost respect for you and the Chair in all the roles that you have played. You are the dean of the House. You have been here longer than any other sitting member of Parliament. I know that you know this better than I, this need for this trust and respect so that when people commit to something, they are committed to it. That is the issue that has to be dealt with today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that I have about one minute left. Time goes so fast when one gets emotional about these types of issues.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, let me say that in all of my 13 years in this House I have always tried to conduct myself that way. I have learned from some of the veterans, people like you, and people like past Liberal House leader Don Boudria, who conducted themselves in that manner, and that is the way I have tried to conduct myself. </div>

I have to say, off the top, that I believe my hon. colleague is an honourable man. I think that is why we refer to each other as honourable members. I believe that all members of this House are honourable members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said in earlier comments that we speak on a daily basis about a myriad of things, such as how many speakers we are going to have. This place operates on the fact that whips talk on behalf of their parties to their counterparts. I find it of more than passing interest that when this motion was tabled in the procedure and House affairs committee, there was after that an intervening break week and I actually placed a call to my hon. colleagues suggesting that perhaps we needed to get this dialogue started.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to underscore that we do speak several times on a daily basis and we are all busy people. This topic, in any kind of detail, had not come up. I understand that the third opposition party actually made an overture to the government asking when we were going to talk about these, recognizing that there is a time imperative, that there were two break weeks, and, I would point out, that these provisional Standing Orders expire the Tuesday after the November break week when we are all in our constituencies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no return phone call, which I found a little puzzling. There also was an opportunity at a House leaders' meeting, as my hon. colleague has stated, which happen on a weekly basis. This issue was not raised by the government, so after that our House leader actually raised it with the government House leader, saying that perhaps this was something that we needed to have a conversation about. It actually did not come into effect until some of my staff contacted some of the government staff. They indeed did have a one hour meeting before the Thursday procedure and House affairs meeting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it interesting that the chief government whip has put forward this amendment when we had talked about, in committee, how this may be something we could reach consensus on. There were other opinions. One of them expressed by one of my fellow opposition colleagues was the fact that when the government was then in opposition it used the five day rule quite effectively to bring in committees when we were dealing with things that were of a somewhat controversial nature. The public accounts committee met on very short order, I think, as did the foreign affairs committee. It is a tool that has been of use to the government when it was in opposition, so it needs to have some kind of discussion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I find it significant that these things all came out after we requested to have a meeting, when clearly this motion was before the procedure and House affairs committee, which we did not force having a discussion on. It was made very clear to us by the government members that they were planning to filibuster this. As a matter of fact, I appreciate the candour of one of my colleagues opposite in letting us know. So they had notice of motion, which is not required for procedure and House affairs, that there was a time imperative and it is interesting that there was no action--</div>

She tried to defend this action undertaken by the opposition by stating that during the break week she made a telephone call to try to reach me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I have had the great pleasure of being elected to represent the people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78995,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78995&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prince George—Peace River</A> on five separate occasions now. My riding is huge. It encompasses over a quarter of a million square kilometres up in northeastern British Columbia. It runs from the central part of the province all the way to the Yukon. I can tell members that because of my role as whip, and my constituents understand this, when I have a break week I am on the dead run from one end of the riding to the other. I try to get to as many events as I can because of the distance my riding is from Ottawa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that she tried to reach me. During that week, I was unreachable by cellphone in many cases. The Rocky Mountains cut my riding in half. There are more regions of my riding that do not have cellphone coverage than regions that do. I was in I think five different cities and towns on five different days. I guess that is, by way of an excuse, my reason for not returning her call, but the pertinent point here is that she had already moved her motion prior to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Thursday prior to the break week, she moved her motion to shove this thing through without even consulting with the government, after having agreed to the process of extending it to November 21. That is the point. Yes, we did debate it at some length, and the motion was held over during the break week, but she moved the motion on Thursday, October 5. She still has not offered any credible reason for doing that when all four political parties had agreed to a process of dealing with it. That was our understanding. A senior staffer for the New Democratic Party contacted our senior House leader's staff to try to set up a meeting for the break week, asking when they were going to get together to discuss this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not like there was no communication. At any point in time prior to her moving this motion to ram ahead with these provisional Standing Orders, she could have called. She could have called before the House even rose for the break week before she moved her motion. This was the point that I and many colleagues made at that meeting of the procedure and House affairs committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went on to say in her intervention just now that perhaps we could have reached consensus. We did reach consensus. That is the whole point. We had reached consensus at the House leaders' meeting on how to deal with this issue. It was only the subsequent action of the official opposition on reneging on its word, going back on its word and breaking the trust that has to exist between House leaders and whips, that brought us to this position today.</div>

I would like to ask the member a question. I think he has to help the House understand the fundamental question. There are provisional orders and the question is whether or not they become permanent. If they do not, if there is no appetite for these provisional orders to become a permanent part of our Standing Orders, then we will have some consequences. It means that certain things we have been utilizing for some time now will be pulled off. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get an idea from the government whip as to whether or not there is a plan to make the necessary proposals to reinstitute or to make recommendations for changes to the Standing Orders that would take into account some of those provisional orders, but I am more interested in which of these provisional orders the government would not be supportive of instating into the Standing Orders permanently.</div>

Even in the Standing Orders there is a requirement that the Standing Orders be reviewed from time to time. Along with the other three parties, I think we are all supportive of that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my amendment deals with one thing on which I thought we had agreement. I raised this at the procedure and House affairs committee when, according to the chief opposition whip, we were filibustering. It is arguable whether or not we were filibustering, and some people might consider that, but we were making a lot of points. One of the points I made, in response to my hon. colleague, was that Standing Order 106(4) be amended, which is the purpose of the amendment that I just introduced into the House of Commons and which we are presently debating. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the five day requirement, five days being the time that a chairman of a standing committee of the House of Commons be requested by a certain number of the members to hold a special meeting, be changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, especially during the break times, the three months of summer recess and the six week winter recess, that if that were to fall over a holiday period, such as Christmas or July 1, three days are holidays and we would end up with only two days to get people together, agree on a date for the meeting and call the meeting. We believe it would be a minor change to extend that time to 10 calendar days from the existing 5 days. It would be a sensible solution to that problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We presented that and I believed that all the opposition parties agreed with it. Since it does not substantively change the intent of the provisional Standing Order, I thought we could move ahead with that type of change. The other four political parties may have amendments that we have not even had a chance to discuss yet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also pointed out that the clerk had indicated to me that she wanted to make some minor changes to the wording just to make the Standing Orders more effective and work better for all of Parliament.</div>

The idea is to make a major change to our Standing Orders official. This change has been tried over the past year or more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we get to the bottom of things, hon. members need to understand that the sole purpose of the amendment that was just introduced is to delay acceptance of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. That is its sole purpose: to make sure these amendments to the Standing Orders are not accepted within the timeframe allotted by the House, thereby giving the government the wiggle room it needs to postpone consideration of this issue by the House of Commons indefinitely. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of those who are watching, all the amendments before us here were introduced by the Conservative Party, by Conservative members—with rallying speeches and talk of consensuses and discussions among the parties—when the Conservatives formed the official opposition. I would not want the people who are watching to think that the Liberal opposition, the Bloc Québécois and the NDP are trying to pull a fast one on the government. One gets that impression, listening to the government whip, but it is absolutely not true.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a memo dated September 7, 2004, in which the then opposition leader, now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, asked the leaders of the Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic Party to proceed immediately with the amendments to the Standing Orders that have been introduced. Everyone who is watching needs to understand that all the amendments before us today originated in the office of the Conservative leader a year and a half ago, when he was the leader of the official opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not trying to turn everything upside down or put the government in a difficult position. We are trying to make permanent something that all the parties had agreed to try temporarily, at the suggestion of the then leader of the official opposition, who is now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. We want to implement something that was introduced by the Prime Minister.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stop this hypocritical chatter suggesting that we are trying to quibble, to engineer a conflict. This is something that was done with the consent of everyone and that, I repeat, originated from the office of the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> when he was the Leader of the Opposition. Moreover, he worked on this with the same advisors he has now. I have the advantage of being an old parliamentary leader; I have been here for a while and I have seen them at work. These same advisors are still around today. They are the ones who drafted the changes to the Standing Orders, and pleaded for the Bloc Québécois and the NDP to support them. They are also the ones who pleaded for the Liberal government at the time to approve these regulatory changes.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are hearing that it is terrible, outrageous, that the spirit of cooperation is gone and that our workings had always been perfectly harmonious. I was about to use bad language. There is a limit to spewing nonsense. These provisional Standing Orders make the life of the official opposition easier. Indeed, this change to the Standing Orders allows the official opposition to better play its role. Take for example this debate we are having today at the instigation of this Parliament's official opposition; it could not have been held had the rules not been changed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the people watching us to suggest what they would call a group of politicians who say one thing while in opposition and the opposite once in government. That is what we have here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very people who proposed these changes to the Standing Orders and convinced everyone to approve them are now reticent to say too loudly, for fear of ridicule, that they oppose the Standing Orders. Still, they keep looking for ways to prevent these Standing Orders from being permanently, officially adopted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they think we cannot see right through them? I was not born yesterday. I am most senior parliamentary leader in this House. It is clear to me what they want to do: they want to buy time so that these provisional orders will fade away come mid-November. Then we would no longer be able to debate them here in this House or to consider this report, because it is in the new Standing Orders. After mid-November, we will no longer be able to discuss this issue. Under the old Standing Orders, only the government can put the debate back on the agenda, if and when it chooses to do so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt the government has any intention of bringing back the debate. It no longer wants to hear about changes to the Standing Orders even though it proposed them when it was the official opposition. This behaviour is unacceptable. There will be collaboration in this House once we start talking to one another. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a parliamentary leader for 13 years. Never have I had such little discussion with my counterpart opposite and my colleagues in opposition about parliamentary strategy. These people talk about dialogue. They do not want anyone to talk about the strategy they themselves came up with when they were in opposition. I would like to tell the Liberal opposition, which was in power at the time, that it could have put up more of a fight against the application of this Standing Order. The government House leader at the time, Tony Valeri, was aware that we could force their hand, in a way. So he invited us to discuss a number of things, and we discussed them. This Standing Order was the result of that discussion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big improvement that, among other things, makes it possible for our friends in the NDP to have an additional opposition day and enables Parliament to vote on all opposition days. All parliamentarians, all citizens with elected representatives in the House of Commons, want motions introduced in the House to be voted on, passed, or taken into consideration by all members of the House. That is a big improvement for democracy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In return, members of the opposition agreed to make known in advance the subjects that would be debated here in the House of Commons. Why would we not accept such a change? They want to muzzle the NDP and remove one of their two opposition days; they want to remove the right of the official opposition or the Bloc Québécois to bring motions to a vote. That won’t hold water. That is the reason why when we are in opposition, we are better parliamentarians. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, these amendments, which are all excellent and essential to the good operation of Parliament, were introduced by a Conservative government in opposition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that we will be obliged to ask them to return to the opposition to regain those qualities that they had only a few months ago. That is the reality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would simply like to say that my colleague, the whip, makes me blush with shame, by proposing a motion such as this one, five days instead of ten. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know what we told them? We will tell you: yes, there are some details that we are ready to discuss. There are some small points that we could examine if you like, now that you want to talk. There are some little things that we can do. We are prepared to examine the amendment to five days from ten. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us adopt the new Standing Orders as a whole, because they are a great deal broader than this little motion, than this small change that is proposed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a pretext. It smells like a pretext. Let us adopt the new Standing Orders. Everybody likes them, except the Conservatives who produced them. Nevertheless, they will have to live with them. Sorry but when you are virtuous in opposition, you can also be virtuous when you are in government. I apologize to the Conservatives. They will have to live with their Standing Orders, and we will make them swallow it because we are all agreed that this is a good standing order; it is a one from which no one gains any special advantage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believed that the Leader of the Opposition at that time, who is now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">prime minister</A>, had produced a good text, which we supported for that reason, and which the Liberals and the NDP agreed was a good text, and because Canadians are better served by a good text. When we have one, we adopt it; and we are going to adopt it. That is what we want to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are changes to be made, from five days to ten, or commas, or minutes to move, we will be as open as the Liberal government was at the time to accept this text. We will have the necessary openness and we will ensure that the citizens are better served than ever. We will not allow the government to prevent us from adopting what we consider to be a good text. We will vote against the motion, against the amendment that says this will be sent to committee. The government wants to buy some time. We will not allow it to buy time at our expense—and especially not at the expense of the Standing Orders. And I asked citizens, throwing it back in their face: what do you think of a group of parliamentarians who behave one way when they are in opposition and another way when they are in power?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was funny at the time to the Leader of the Opposition, the now <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, and his group of advisors, and the whip who was leader, and the leader who was whip. It was the same clique. They thought it was funny to impose this on the Liberal minority government. They found it funny and they liked it. They were pleased and happy that the Bloc and the NDP were in favour of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are the ones who find it funny to throw back in their faces the Standing Orders they came up with at the time and on which we collaborated. I am sorry, but this allowed the opposition to do its work better and I hope it does not bother the government to think that if we did our work better as the opposition, this might prevent it from making the gaffes that would send it straight to the opposition benches at the next election. The Conservatives should consider themselves lucky: things are working, the House is doing well, the Standing Orders are a good text and there is unanimity among the other parties to keep what they came up with in the first place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call this great unanimity. They should vote with us instead of using stalling tactics to put off this motion long enough so we can no longer pass it or have the chance to force them to accept it.</div>

I guess I will begin at the beginning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the House leader for the Bloc Québecois, says that the amendment I have presented is dilatory. He says that I am embarrassing myself with it. It is quite the contrary. I would suggest that it is the opposition members that are embarrassing themselves on this issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said at one point we were all in agreement as to these provisional Standing Orders. Yes, we were all in agreement. We were also all in agreement on how to proceed, and that is the point. The point is not whether we agree with the provisional Standing Orders as they are. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to have a tremendous respect for the Bloc Québécois in how it dealt with the day to day operations of the House. When the House leader for the Bloc Québécois states that we all are in agreement with the provisional Standing Orders, yes, I agree, but were we not also all in agreement on how to proceed? </div>
    </p><a name="Para214365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were not all in agreement on how to proceed, then why in heaven's name did the Bloc Québecois give its consent on September 20 when my colleague, the hon. government House leader, presented the motion to extend these provisional Standing Orders to November 21? </div>
    </p><a name="Para214366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bloc Québécois was not in agreement, I do not believe for a minute it would have allowed us to present that order. My colleague, the government House leader, would never have presented an order unless it was unanimously supported, which it was because that is how we operate in this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the weekly House leaders meeting, as I said in my earlier remarks, we decide on a process. He asks, why let the government stand in our way? It is not standing in the way. These provisional Standing Orders are in effect today and right up until November 21. The government is not trying to prevent their adoption. It is trying to improve them as per the agreement that the Bloc Québécois member agreed to at the September 19 House leaders meeting, as did all the members present.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask him this question. If we did not have an agreement on September 19 that was exemplified and evidenced by the motion that was brought to the House the very next day to extend these provisional Standing Orders to November 21, then why would the House leader of the Bloc Québécois have agreed to that process?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, we agreed to an extension of these Standing Orders to November 21. I agree with that. However, the only new element that the government has brought to this file since this morning is an amendment proposing to replace the words “five days” by “ten days”, when a committee is convened by the majority of members. This is the government's only contribution. I therefore have a question for the government and I expect an answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly does it not agree with?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it no longer agree with the fact that the Prime Minister or the leader of the official opposition can be questioned after a speech? That is one of the provisions of these Standing Orders. Does it no longer agree with the fact that members may share their time? This is another result of these Standing Orders. Does it no longer agree with the fact that motions to adopt committee reports can be considered here and resolved once and for all, rather than being left in the hands of the government? That is one of the provisions of these Standing Orders. Does it no longer agree with the fact that five hours of debate, instead of three, are required for referral to committee before the second reading of a bill? That is one of the provisions of these Standing Orders. Does it no longer agree with the fact that the NDP has an additional opposition day and that all opposition motions on such days are votable? That is one of the provisions of these Standing Orders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Standing Orders can only be beneficial. The only thing the government has come up with to persuade us that we should not adopt them quickly today is that the timeframe for convening a committee should be extended from five days to ten days, when a majority of members call for it. Well, this seems fishy to me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What provisions does the government not agree with? I would like it to rise and tell us, to present amendments, indicating what sections it does not like. Yet, the people listening to us feel that everything is excellent. Facts are facts, and these are the facts. </div>

    </p><a name="Para214376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is indicative that there has been a breakdown in the collegiality of the mutual respect and collaboration. That is unfortunate. We have ways to deal with these matters. We had a special legislative committee established to deal with changes to the Standing Orders. We had the work, I think the member would remember, with regard to the modernization of Parliament that led to many changes in the Standing Orders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have functions here, but it concerns me that the issue has become an issue of trust and cooperation, and we need to address it. We need to come up with a resolution of this and deal with it outside of the chamber because the chamber has the business of the nation with which to deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member if he has some thoughts on it simply being not a matter of voting against the amendment. I think we also have to use the tools available to us to determine whether or not there is a way in which we can have a mutually agreeable strategy, to have a further consideration of the status of the provisional Standing Orders, and to have some consensus on whether or not there are items there that can no longer enjoy the consensus support of the House. If there are other items to be done, they have to be dealt with. What is the mechanism? What is the timeframe and how are we going to do this so that we can re-establish mutual respect and collaboration?</div>

It is very kind of the member to try to bring his own contribution to the debate. However, I will point out to him that it is not my responsibility to raise points on which there is no longer consensus. In my view, and in the view of most of the people I have consulted, there is still consensus regarding the reform: we all want it to be applied. There is therefore no problem. That is the answer: there is consensus on all points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government whip is therefore the only person who does not support this. I understand why this may be, since there are some things he may not be happy about. But why, in his amendment, is the only change he is proposing for the committee that notice go from five to 10 days, knowing that a majority of committee members want to meet?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a detail. We can agree on that with no problem. But still, if there is no consensus on such a number of things, it is not my job to say so. In my opinion, there is consensus on everything and I support all aspects of it. The NDP and the Liberals also support all aspects of it. Only the Conservatives do not agree on all aspects. It is therefore up to them to tell us so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, let them not tell us that this is a matter of going from five to 10 days and that this question absolutely has to be examined. This thing is a dog’s breakfast. They are looking for reasons to try to delay adoption of the Standing Orders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Standing Orders were instituted by the Conservatives and represent one of the most worthwhile things they did when they were in opposition. We like these Standing Orders and we will be keeping them, at least as far as I am concerned. If there are other things that the Conservatives do not like, let them say so. Myself, I do not see any at the moment.</div>

It is about the operations of the House and how we move our democracy forward and has become a very emotional issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to look at the amendment to the Standing Orders and the provisional Standing Orders that were referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. A Liberal motion proposes that the Standing Orders and the provisional Standing Orders be made permanent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were discussions in committee. The Conservative Party made some suggestions. The Clerk even suggested that some wording could be changed because of technical problems and things of that kind. Then there was the Standing Order concerning the five-day rather than ten-day time frame for convening committee meetings. But it was very clear. As a committee member, I would have agreed to extend the time frame to ten days. I can say publicly that I was prepared to make this compromise. However, we would have had to be able to meet again in committee in a week in order to proceed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee is its own master. It voted for this to be submitted to the House of Commons. The various parties clearly do not agree with the government. I want to join the leader of the Bloc Québécois in maintaining that the parties currently all agree on keeping the time frame at five days. The NDP is also in favour of a five-day time frame. We do not have any problems with that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us assume that the committee really is its own master. I believe that all the committee members are reasonable people. If some day a special meeting of the committee is called when we are not here in the House of Commons—in July for example—I am sure that the members are reasonable enough to know whether they will be able to be there or not, whether they will be able to have witnesses on time or not. I really do not see where there could be a problem. We have been operating under these Standing Orders for a few years now—under the previous minority government as well—and have not had any problems that we could not live with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to agree on the five-day time frame. It is also important for committee members to be able to call a special meeting of any committee of the House of Commons because some things cannot wait ten days. Actually, it was the Conservatives when they were in opposition who convinced us of this and persuaded us that this Standing Order would be good. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if the Standing Committee on National Defence decided to call a meeting very quickly because of an emergency of some kind, we would certainly not want to wait ten days while our country was at war and certain decisions had to be made in committee. There are all kinds of committees that can have emergencies and have to be able to meet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who do not know and for those who are listening, how often has a committee decided to call witnesses on a Tuesday to appear on the Thursday, thus giving only two days' notice? How many times has it been said on Wednesday that they would like such and such a witness the next morning and every effort is made to have the witness appear before the parliamentary committee?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there is no problem. Then why propose an amendment here, today, when in committee we very clearly stated that we would adopt permanently the amendment to the Standing Orders and, if there were any problems, we could go back to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, propose a motion and resubmit a recommendation to Parliament? If there were any technical problems we would solve them if necessary. However, we must ensure that these Standing Orders are adopted immediately. They must not be set aside or lost in the fuss such that we suddenly find ourselves without our Standing Orders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority in Parliament should be able to decide. It decided by introducing the motion in the House of Commons. It is clear that we must move forward. For that reason, personally and as NDP whip on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, I can say that the NDP is against the amendment. We want the motion to go ahead in order to make the Standing Orders permanent. Then, if changes are required, we will make them after. That can be done in the near future and quickly.</div>

The issue is that members of the official opposition broke their word. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a House leaders meeting on September 19, everyone agreed that the current provisional Standing Orders should remain in effect until November 21. Until that time, senior staffers from all parties would get together and examine the provisional Standing Orders to see whether any amendments should be made. They would report back to the procedure and House affairs committee and then the committee would determine whether to make the provisional Standing Orders permanent or permanent with amendments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day, on September 20, to indicate that the agreement was made, our House leader introduced a motion seeking unanimous consent, which was granted, to extend the provisional Standing Orders until November 21. The truth is indisputable that an agreement was made and accepted by each House leader. However, on October 5, the chief opposition whip brought a motion without consultation to the committee asking that the Standing Orders be made permanent now, not wait until November 21 and not wait until all senior staff had a chance to look at the Standing Orders. </div>

    </p><a name="Para214407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That happened in September. We are almost at the end of October and no one has yet called a meeting with the staff of each party to try to come to an agreement. Time goes by. We are now at the end of October and almost at the beginning of November. When is the staff going to talk? When will they put those people together? It was the job of the government to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all of that aside, it does not stop now because the representative of the government just said there was nothing wrong with the rules themselves, that the only problem was with the break of the intention. We are in the right place to fix it, which is here in this House of Commons. Let us vote on it, make it a permanent rule and then we can go back to the procedure and House affairs committee, sit down and look at what can or cannot be changed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that is the way to do it because people do not believe that they were not honest. It is a matter of how it is interpreted. If we look in law, for example, we all have different ways of interpreting a contract or a bill but that is the way it goes and this is the way to fix it.</div>

That is the one I am worried about. If there are technical problems with the provision, we should talk about that amendment, not about the five days and ten days because we do not see a problem with the five days. The majority of members in the opposition do not see a problem with the five days. We are more worried about the technical one and that is not what the government brought forward. If we have technical problems with the provisions, that is what we should be talking about. If the motion goes through, I hope we can go back to the procedure and House affairs committee right away to look at those technical problems and fix them as soon as possible.</div>

    </p><a name="Para214414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the parliamentary secretary say to my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78825,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78825&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Acadie—Bathurst</A> that the issue is not the provisional Standing Orders, that the issue is that the official opposition broke its word. I really want to put this to rest. That is clearly not the issue today. The issue is whether or not the provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent and whether or not they should go forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back into the history of the subject, we should be very clear that when these items were discussed in the House leaders meetings there was agreement that there would be discussion. That discussion did not take place, but there is nothing to preclude it from coming up at the procedure and House affairs committee, which is an entirely appropriate committee for that kind of discussion to take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it curious that the government would now say that this is about breaking faith or breaking an agreement. Clearly that discussion was had in the committee. That is why we are here now with this report today. I would just leave that aside, because I think it is a secondary matter. The issue is whether or not the provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the NDP's point of view we are in agreement that they should be made permanent. They were first brought forward in the last minority Parliament. Ironically it was discussions among the three opposition parties at that time, including the party that is now the government but was then the official opposition, the Conservative Party, which looked at the Standing Orders and brought forward these provisional changes in the last minority Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was that done? The changes were brought forward on the basis that there was agreement among those three parties at the time to actually make this place more democratic. Mr. Speaker, as you well know, being the dean of the House, you have seen the erosion over the decades of democratic practice in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was actually an attempt by the three opposition parties in the last minority Parliament to look at the Standing Orders to figure out where there was some agreement on what could be done to make some of the procedures and the practices that we live by more democratic and more open. They were important changes. In fact, they were adopted by the last Parliament, but they were not permanently set; they were set as a provisional order.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether or not the changes themselves should become permanent, I think they are good changes. Over the last couple of years we have had a great deal of experience with the provisional Standing Orders. We know how they work. I think there is a very strong consensus, at least among three parties, that they should remain. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the provisional Standing Orders is that all opposition days should be votable. This is something that is very important to the NDP. In the permanent Standing Orders not all of the opposition days, or supply days, were votable. It seemed to us to be very forward looking to make supply days, opposition days, votable. We have now done that. It is considered to be acceptable and I hope that it is not under dispute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the setting of the supply days in a regular cycle to ensure for example that our party gets three opposition days. This is something that did not happen before as a smaller party. It is a very important change. It gives a more level playing field to the NDP to ensure there is an additional opposition day. Previously for us this was always very much in question; sometimes we would get it and sometimes we would not. These changes ensure that we get that third opposition day.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item is the debate and vote on motions to concur in committee reports. This is very important. This item is likely one which the government now wishes it had not agreed to. It is very interesting how positions can change when in opposition or in government, but at that time, the opposition, the Conservative Party, was very eager to get this change through. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a great deal of experience with it. The idea that a committee can bring forward a report, just as we are doing today, and have a debate on it in the House and then a vote really gives voice to the work that members undertake in committees. Members on all sides have experienced a lot of frustration in that the work that is done in committee, which is often very solid and good work, does not get any expression in terms of being adopted or brought forward in the House. That provisional Standing Order allows for that to happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many reports have been brought forward and have had a full debate in the House, and then we have actually voted on them. It has provided very good continuity between the work in the committee and what comes into the House. It provides members with a sense of encouragement that the work they undertake in committee can actually be brought forward to the House and voted upon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that way the provisional Standing Orders are quite substantive. In my opinion the provisional Standing Orders improve the practice and the democracy in the procedure that we use in the House of Commons. Do we need to go further? Absolutely. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the NDP held a press conference. We put forward a motion in the procedure and House affairs committee to urge the committee to consider a report from 1992, 15 years ago. I am sure members will remember that report. It was a report of the special advisory committee to the Speaker. It put forward a number of very sensible, intelligent recommendations about improving decorum in the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have certainly seen the situation in the last week, but even since the beginning of this Parliament, there has been a sense of chaos. There has been a lack of respect for each other, a level of debate that has gotten down to name calling. Sexist and racist remarks have been made in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP was very interested to take that report off the shelf, so to speak, to dust it off and bring it forward. That report from 15 years ago when John Fraser was the Speaker was never acted upon and it is time to bring it forward again. In the meantime, I think we can do our business by making sure that the provisional Standing Orders become permanent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot more work needs to be done in terms of the Standing Orders, the procedures that we follow, as well as improving the decorum in the House. We are very interested in seeing another debate take place at the procedure and House affairs committee on this issue of the June 22, 1992 report to the Speaker from the special advisory committee. We hope it will generate further discussion about what we need to do as parliamentarians, what responsibility we need to take individually, within our caucus, as parties and as the government to ensure that this place reflects a much higher standard about how we do our business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to bring that issue up because it puts this debate in a broader context. I know that people who watch question period, who watch the debates in the House of Commons, or who visit the House and sit in the gallery are sometimes aghast at what takes place here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more that we can take these issues on, not in a way that is sort of dealing with celebrity politics, which is what we have seen in the last few days, but to deal with this in a serious, substantive way that focuses on the changes that need to be made, so that we can show the public that this Parliament is respectful, that it is about serious debate and that we actually confer, I hope, on the Speaker a greater discretion and mandate from the parties to actually keep order in this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that is something that this Speaker would agree with. I think a lot of people think it is long overdue. We will get to that. We have just introduced that at committee today. In the meantime, I think we can do our business by making sure that these provisional standing orders do become permanent. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment has been put forward by the government which basically seeks to undo all of that by sending the report back to the committee. We will not be voting for the amendment because we think that the provisional Standing Orders should become permanent. I would say to the government that if there are some technical issues that need to be further considered, we are certainly open to doing that at committee. There is nothing to prevent the government or any other member of the committee from raising consequential issues and further debate around the provisional Standing Orders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not prepared today to see this go down and be lost. We have an opportunity now to make them permanent. If we need to do more review in terms of technical issues, that is fine, no problem, but on the principle of what these provisional Standing Orders represent, we are behind them. We support them here today and hope that members of the House will support them as well.</div>

She said that the issue really is not whether word was broken, that the issue is whether these provisional Standing Orders should be put into place now, should be made permanent. I would respectfully disagree with my hon. colleague. It is about the issue of trust was broken, that an agreement was broken. That is so fundamental to the operation of this place that I cannot stress strongly enough that that is the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak in a few moments when I make my presentation about the provisional Standing Orders. Quite frankly, it does not really matter to me whether the current provisional Standard Orders were made permanent without amendment or if there were some technical amendments. That is not the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is an agreement that was made by all four House leaders was broken. There is indisputable proof that it was broken. That is my point. I will go into far greater detail in a few moments, but my simple question for my hon. colleague is, does she not agree that there was an agreement made on September 19 at the House leaders meeting to keep the provisional Standing Orders in effect until November 21 and that during that 60 day period between September 19 and November 21, staff members from all of the parties would get together to see whether amendments should be made?</div>

The issue here is whether or not the provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly there was discussion at the House leaders meeting about how to proceed on this matter. Certainly there was an understanding that we needed to have an extension, otherwise they would have run out much more rapidly. I do not remember the date, but the member says November 21. There is nothing to preclude discussions by staff, if that had happened, but it did not happen, or a committee legitimately taking up its business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not really about agreements being broken. it is about the House doing its business. It was entirely appropriate that the procedure and House affairs committee should take this up if it so wanted, and that is what it is there to do, and bring it back to the House. That is exactly what happened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the hon. member that we should focus on the real debate here in terms of the Standing Orders. If there are changes that the member wants to see, maybe we will hear that in his presentation in a little while, and it can go back to the committee for that kind of consideration. Clearly the issue here today is to vote on whether or not these provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent. We think they should be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on here is quite a big brouhaha that the government would like to make. Does the government think that other parties do not talk to each other? All kinds of discussions take place, at committee, at House leaders meetings. That is the nature of this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is being dealt with in an open and transparent way at the committee and back here in the House. I fail to see what the complaint is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would say let us focus on the debate here, which is saying to Canadians that we need to improve the way we do our business. We need to improve the way we conduct ourselves as members of Parliament. We still have a long way to go on that and that is what we would like to focus on.</div>

There might have been a couple of meetings when this was brought up. That would be the nature of those meetings. Because they are generally closed meetings, I will not go into detail. However, in a new Parliament we have discussions about provisional Standing Orders and the fact that they will expire unless some further action is taken. There were certainly discussions about extending them so we could decide what to do. Those discussions have now taken place through the procedure and House affairs committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not think there has been any violation of any agreements. This has been done in a transparent and open way. We are now debating the provisional Standing Orders, and that is how it should be. I am scratching my head a bit about what the problem is. We are doing what we should be doing, which is dealing with this business, having this debate and making a decision as to whether these provisional Standing Orders are going to go ahead and become permanent or not . The debate and the vote will decide that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para214452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, beyond the issue that we will be discussing for the next few minutes, there is something all Canadians should recognize as well. Despite what my hon. colleague from the official opposition, the opposition chief whip, has stated, the intent of this motion is not to discuss whether provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent. It is not even about whether an agreement was broken. The purpose of the motion today is the official opposition, and I suspect in concurrence with other opposition parties, clearly wants to hijack the workings of Parliament. The members of the opposition are using procedural tactics, which are available to them, to delay proper implementation of government legislation. They are using delaying tactics, in other words, to disallow full discourse and debate on government legislation, which we introduced into this place. They are doing that for their own political partisan reasons and, frankly, that is not only objectionable, it circumvents and undermines the purpose of this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague, the chief opposition whip, said in her opening remarks, when she introduced the concurrence motion, that the provisional Standing Orders served a number of purposes. One is to allow opposition parties the ability to introduce motions, to speak and to question government members. However, she also said something extremely important. The provisional Standing Orders or the Standing Orders should allow the government to conduct its business. In other words, it should allow the government to govern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with that. The Standing Orders should allow governments to govern. On one hand, the chief opposition whip agrees with that statement. Yet on the other hand, and proof is in today's concurrence motion, which is the fourth of fifth concurrence motion we have had in the last two weeks, she is delaying the ability of the government to govern. That is the first point and I want to get it on the record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is highly objectionable. I think most Canadians would agree with me that the purpose of Parliament is to pass legislation or to at least have healthy debate on the it. Yet by the very action of the opposition members, that debate is not taking place. They are finding ways, through procedural tactics, to shelve any meaningful debate on legislation that the government plans to bring forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aside, that is their right. Under the Standing Orders, they can introduce concurrence motions. They have done so. We are now debating the motion for three hours instead of debating government legislation, but so be it. I will accept that because it is something that is available to all opposition members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to turn my attention to the motion at hand. I again want to emphasize that the real issue in the debate on Standing Orders, whether the provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent, is not the issue. The issue is there was an agreement in place that was broken. I believe strongly that agreements and words are extremely important in this place. We could not operate in this place if we had a culture in which a word that was given could be broken at a whim.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you, Mr. Speaker, being the senior statesman in this place, would understand. Over the last few decades you have worked in this place and represented Canadians here. I suggest to you that you feel quite strongly that when one gives his or her word to a colleague, that word should be respected, that word should be honoured and to break that word is extremely serious. This is the issue with which we are dealing.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145">(1145)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it has been talked about before, let me give the scenario that occurred, chronologically. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 19 of this year, the meeting of the House leaders took place, at which time the government House leader talked about extending the provisional Standing Orders for approximately 60 days, until November 21. The reason the government House leader introduced this was because the previous agreement was that the provisional Standing Orders would stay in place only until October 10. If they were not put into place in a permanent fashion at that time, we would revert back to the old Standing Orders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government House leader then said that we should have some all party discussion on whether these provisional Standing Orders should be made permanent or whether they should perhaps be amended somewhat. He proposed to extend the provisional Standing Orders until November 21, an additional 60 days. He suggested that during that 60 day extension, the staff of all four parties get together and discuss whether there should be amendments or whether we were happy with the provisional Standing Orders as written. Then we could adopt them into a permanent state, with or without amendments, by the November 21. All House leaders said that was reasonable and they agreed to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day, on September 20, the government House leader, in this place, introduced the motion asking for unanimous consent to extend the provisional Standing Orders until November 21, as agreed upon in the previous day's House leaders' meeting. It was unanimously agreed upon. That is why I say there is indisputable proof that there was an agreement made at the House leaders' meeting of September 19.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have great respect for all of my colleagues in positions such as whips or House leaders, or caucus officer positions. Not only do I have respect for them, I absolutely know they are intelligent people who would not allow a motion to pass unanimously unless there had been an agreement. In other words, if we, as the government, tried to pull a fast one and we asked for unanimous consent for a motion and we tried to slide something through, if there had not been an agreement the previous day at the House leaders' meeting, my colleagues on the opposition benches would not have given unanimous consent. However, they did not do that. Everyone agreed to pass the motion unanimously, which again verifies my contention that there was an agreement in place. That is indisputable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now having proved that there was an agreement in place, what happened? Rather than waiting until November 21, rather than waiting for all staff members from all opposition parties and the government to get together to examine these provisional Standing Orders to determine whether there should be amendments made and rather than honouring the agreement, on October 5 of this year, at the procedures and House affairs committee, the chief opposition whip introduced a motion, without prior consultation, stating that she wished to make the provisional Standing Orders permanent immediately. That was in violation of the agreement, which stated they should remain in effect until November 21. This is the issue that I am debating. An agreement was broken. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the opposition whip introduced this motion was payback. Opposition members were upset at us because we used a provisional tactic several days beforehand, Standing Order 56.1, and we caught the opposition by surprise. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150">(1150)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances were this. Bill C-24 was being debated in this place. It was the softwood lumber debate, legislation which we had introduced and we wanted to get passed as quickly as possible. Our colleagues from the NDP, during debate, kept raising amendments and subamendments, and then putting up speakers to deal with those amendments and subamendments. That is perfectly acceptable under the Standing Orders of this place. NDP members were, in other words, using procedural tactics to delay implementation of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>. They did not agree with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>, so they were using procedural tactics to delay the implementation of it as long as they possibly could.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives disagreed. We felt this bill was an extremely important piece of legislation that would benefit the softwood lumber industry and finally put an end to years and years of litigation and dispute between Canada and the U.S. We wanted to fast track the bill. We wanted to stop with these sorts of procedural delays, get the debate completed, get the bill to committee, and ultimately vote on it in this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we do? We employed a procedural tactic of our own. It is called Standing Order 56.1(3). For those in the gallery and the Canadian viewing public, it is what I would suggest is a fairly arcane procedural Standing Order, which says that there needs to be 25 members of the opposition in this place to defeat a motion that we were about to bring forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, knowing that the opposition tends not to show up to work very often, the Conservatives introduced a motion which would, to cut to the chase, effectively limit the amount of debate that the NDP would be able to use. In other words, it would stop the NDP from using its procedural tactics to continue to delay the implementation of this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives introduced a motion and all of a sudden, by the rules of this place, all of those opposed to our motion had to stand and be counted. There needed to be 25 opposition members to defeat our motion. What happened? There were only 21 opposition members in this place at that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that speaks volumes about the intentions of the members opposite who actually do not think it is that important to show up to this place during routine proceedings. Nonetheless, only 21 members stood, so the NDP could not defeat our motion. Consequently, it was stymied in its attempts to delay discussion and debate on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2334521,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2334521&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-24</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, because of the procedural tactic the Conservatives used, the opposition was angry. Opposition members were very angry and decided they had to push back, that there was payback and there were consequences. They were angry that the Conservatives pulled a fast one like that, embarrassed NDP members, and stifled their ability to talk about a bill they did not agree with.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? On October 5 in the procedure and House affairs committee the opposition whip introduced a motion to break an agreement. She introduced a motion that would place a permanent status on the provisional Standing Orders. She said no, the opposition was not going to honour the agreement to wait until November 21 and was not going to honour the agreement to allow all staff members to get together and examine the provisional Standing Orders to see whether amendments should or could be made. It was going to say to heck with that, it wanted to break the agreement, and wanted these Standing Orders to be made permanent immediately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the issue. The opposition members broke their word. That much is indisputable. In every question and comment period, I have asked every member opposite the simple question of whether there was an agreement in place and not one of the members has had the courage to stand here and say, “Yes, you were right, there was an agreement and that agreement was broken”. They try to change the channel, skirt the issue, and stand in this place to say that is not really issue. The issue is that we should be discussing these provisional Standing Orders. That is the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When members give their word of honour in this place, I suggest they must honour that word. This place could not operate without it. We all know that. From time to time in committees, opposition and government members get together and say, “We are debating something in committee. Can I count on your support?” If somebody says yes, that word is taken as that person's bond.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we start breaking agreements and breaking our word, then our word is meaningless. This place will not operate. I will give an example of something that affected me, but will show all members how I try to conduct myself in this place.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was first elected in 2004. I was new to this place and new to the committee structure. I was on, ironically enough, the ethics committee at that time. During debate of some motion that was coming forward, the hon. NDP member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A>, I believe, gave me a phone call and told me he was introducing something and that he would like my support. He explained his position to me. I said it sounded reasonable and made sense, so I said I would vote with him and support him when that initiative was brought before the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out fairly quickly that perhaps before giving one's word one may want to consult with one's own party because I found out afterwards that it was not the position my party wanted to take. They gave me some very salient and cogent sort of explanations of why we should oppose the initiative that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78944,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78944&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A> was going to introduce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came before the committee and what did I do? I voted with the member. I opposed our party's wishes. I paid for it. I had a discussion with some of our caucus officers who told me that they did not really appreciate my position, but the reason I did it was because I had given the member my word and was willing to live with the consequences. That is how this place must operate, I would suggest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a fundamental issue and that is the issue of the day, the agreement that was made at the September 19 House leaders meeting has been broken. Nothing else matters. These provisional Standing Orders, I could live with them as they are. I could live with them with minor amendments, but that is not the issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agreement was broken and it was done deliberately for partisan reasons, not for the benefit of Canadians, and not because we want to get these provisional Standing Orders in effect today. They would have been effect in any event come November 21 because I would guarantee that all members of the committee, prior to November 21, would have brought forward a motion to deal with it before the deadline ran out. It would have been voted in favour. Those provisional Standing Orders would have been adopted with or without amendments.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the opposition party and the chief opposition whip brought this motion forward as a form of what probably may be considered as political payback, but in effect the opposition broke an agreement. It broke its word and that is the issue that we have to deal with here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will always disagree on fundamental issues. We will always agree to disagree ideologically, politically and philosophically, but I would suggest, and hope, that every member in this place would agree that when a member of this place gives his or her word to another member, that word should be honoured, and it is not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had, in my opinion again, a serious breach of trust in this place. Some might suggest that the trust has been lacking for a long time. I could agree where some members would suggest that this place is not conducive to trustworthiness. Certainly, all parties are suspicious of the motives of other parties from time to time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite convinced, even as I speak now, that there are members in the opposition ranks who feel that my motives are politically driven. I just want to assure them, whether or not they take me at my word, that they are not. I absolutely believe that when one gives his or her word in this place, it must be honoured. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are starting to break down the ability of members to trust one another in the most primary and fundamental environment of asking whether another member will agree to support one and to support a piece of legislation. When a word is broken, when a trust and a bond is broken, I do not believe we can operate efficiently. That is the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask in summation that every member in this place stand during their comments or in their questions, and please accommodate me and answer one simple question. Do they not believe that when one gives his or her word in this place, it should be honoured?</div>

    </p><a name="Para214501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, at a subsequent meeting of procedure and House affairs, another motion came before the committee. It was in order and was dealt with. It was voted upon and reported to the House. That was that the provisional Standing Orders become permanent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two decisions, one in September and one in October, in fact differed. They were a change of view. However, the committee made that decision and reported it to the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is saying that the decision taken on October 5 to make the provisional Standing Orders permanent violates some informal agreement, but that informal agreement was with regard to the September meeting motion to extend the provisional Standing Orders until November 21.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the government member is mixing apples and oranges here. The committee did make a decision with regard to making them permanent. It was an order. It was reported to the House and concurrence is now being moved. Why is the member saying that it was a violation of an agreement when in fact the committee made the decision?</div>

If a person breaks his or her word once, I suppose the person could break it all the time. When agreements have been made to pair when committees travel, for example, and one party does not keep its word because some other party broke its word on another agreement, then we begin to have serious problems, which is why I keep emphasizing and re-emphasizing the importance of members in this House keeping their word when we make agreements with one another. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us can give examples of agreements we have made with members opposite on a host of different issues.

I think most members opposite would agree that if someone gives his or her word on a certain issue, we believe in that person's word and we have confidence that the person will honour that commitment. While it has worked fairly well up until now, I would suggest that the trust is gone, which is extremely unfortunate.</div>

    </p><a name="Para214511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are watching this, it may seem a rather arcane issue dealing with the provisional Standing Orders but these are the rules upon which we can function and serve our constituents and our country in the House. These are the rules that have been put together to enable us to serve our country and our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this is new. These provisional Standing Orders were put forth and supported strongly by the Conservatives when they were in opposition and by us in an effort to open up this place and make it more democratic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How extreme are the provisional Standing Orders? What are these rules that we are actually talking about? Why do we want them to continue and why does the government wish that they not continue?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Standing Orders would allow individuals in this House to question the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Leader of the Opposition for 10 minutes after they make a speech on a government motion. What is so flawed and so bad about enabling members for the first time to ask questions of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in response to words they have uttered in this House? </div>
    </p><a name="Para214515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the type of questioning that is the pillar of our Westminster system. It allows members to represent their constituents and ask the person who holds the highest office in the land the questions that their constituents are concerned about. This was never allowed before under the provisional Standing Orders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is logical that the Conservative Party would have supported this in opposition and why my party supported these particular changes. It was a very important move to open this House up and become more democratic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules also allow members to split their time with other members. One of the frustrations I think we all have, because there are limited times and limited slots in which to speak, is that we all wish to have an opportunity to speak to particular motions that occur.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, a member only had 10 minutes to speak and therefore only a few members of Parliament had the opportunity to articulate their views and those of their constituents in this House on a motion. The changes we are talking about today allow members to split their time. It allows more members to voice their views in this hallowed chamber. Is that so bad? Is that so undemocratic? Is that such a violation that the government cannot live with this?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisional Standing Orders also allow us to debate concurrence motions. Another frustration I think we all have is that all of us have passed motions in committees. A lot of good work occurs in committee and, in many ways, a lot of the more constructive work on issues actually occurs in committees. The environment in committee tends to be a little more collegial and a little less confrontational than what we have in the House. It is perhaps because we are less than two sword lengths away from each other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reality is that motions passed in committee are oftentimes constructive motions, policy driven motions and motions in the public interest. Those motions, historically, have disappeared into the aether because we never had a mechanism upon which those motions could come to the House for a more fulsome debate and where the public could be made aware of those issues through the substantive debate that would take place on those issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the foreign affairs committee, for example, we in the Liberal Party passed substantive motions and supported motions dealing with Afghanistan, HIV-AIDS, Zimbabwe, Darfur, the Congo and a number of other crises occurring in the world, and we passed those motions.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why on earth would the government desire to quell, quash and stop these democratic interventions that allow a more fulsome and constructive debate and a more solution oriented, policy and factually driven debate where we ultimately get action on the issues Canadians care about? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives would block it because we have a government that is unlike any other that we have seen before. We have a government not by the people and for the people. We have a government by one person, for one party.

His viewpoint is one that is rooted in ideology, where ideology trumps science, fact and everything but the pursuit of power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stems from a type of thinking that comes from an obscure professor in the U.S. named Professor Strauss. This is the Straussian view of the world that is held by a few but important individuals. The intellectual bedmates of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> are people like Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld. They are all acolytes of this professor who lived earlier on in the 20th century.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Strauss' view of the world was not one rooted in democracy. He believed that effective government came from the top, from a small number of people driven by ideology, who would force their will through a government structure and implement those solutions for a country. However, the inherent danger in that is that it violates the very roots of democracy and of this institution. That is what we have now. We have a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> driven by ideology, not driven by science and not driven by facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give some examples, the most egregious example of which is the issue of drug policy. That was manifested this summer in the almost willingness of the government to not allow the safe injection sites to continue in Vancouver. The government maintained that it needed more studies. These studies were done by some of the top researchers in the world and they were published in <i>The Lancet</i>. The studies showed very clearly that the safe injection site in Vancouver saved lives, saved money and was humane. These studies, which were done by independent assessors, some of the top scientific minds and researchers in Canada, showed that the safe injection site in Vancouver worked.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A> he said that more studies were needed and he only extended this safe injection site for one year, not the three and a half years that were required. Why? It is because the government thinks it can hold an election and get a majority and, I believe, stop that safe injection site. The Conservatives will also not allow any other similar sites to occur in any other part of the country. Why? It is because ideologically they believe that safe injection sites are immoral and not in the interests of the public, but that completely ignores the facts.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, it is sad to say, a government run by one <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> who believes that he is an omnibus cabinet minister. That is why we are seeing cabinet ministers, some of whom are very bright people and have very good ideas, being asked to shut up and to not offer any constructive solutions on how they can build public policy. All public policy comes from one person, the Prime Minister and a small number of people around him. The cabinet members are simply asked to trot out these solutions that the Prime Minister offers. That is not democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public who voted for the Conservative Party, particularly those people who are rooted in the Reform angle and who strongly believe in democracy and democratizing this House, would find it anathema to them that their government would not support these Standing Orders that allow members from all sides, including their own, to offer solutions in a constructive way.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent example is the so-called environment bill, which has nothing to do with environmental protection. It has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions, the reason being that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> at heart has chosen to ignore the signs, to ignore the facts and to believe that global warming is not really occurring. He is trusting his ideological belief over the actual scientific evidence, which demonstrates very clearly that global warming is occurring and is due to greenhouse gas emissions and that we have to act to make the changes necessary to ensure that we will be able to reverse this trend. It is very important for us, given our location in the world and the implications for the heating of our glaciers and our arctic areas, which is having a profound impact not only upon our country, but upon the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area is the so-called accountability bill. The accountability bill has nothing to do with accountability. It is but another example of many of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> couching something in a certain way to lead people to believe that it is something it is not. The accountability bill is going to destroy the ability of the public service to innovate and to do the job it has done so honourably for so many decades. It also is going to prevent good people from joining the public service. We are having now and will have in the future a major problem with respect to attrition taking place in the public service and our need to attract to the public service the smart, dynamic, hard-working individuals we have always had.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should people join the public service if Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, the accountability bill, comes to pass, when they will have to be continually watching over their backs and continually having a hammer over their heads, and when their ability to influence and innovate is dramatically affected in a negative way? There are already checks and balances over the behaviour of the public servants, like there are over the behaviour of the House. We do not need any more of those. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the accountability bill has nothing to do with accountability, because accountability is the obligation of us as elected officials and of senior government officials to tell the public what we are doing before we do it and to respond to what has been done in the public interest. That is not what the accountability bill is about at all. In fact, when asked in the House to define simple public accountability, not one of those members could do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there is not even a definition of accountability in the bill. I hope the public recognizes that it is not what it seems and that the government is engaging in a number of behaviours and interventions that are diametrically opposed to the public good.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not supporting these Standing Orders, not making these Standing Orders a matter of the rules on which the House continues, will be a complete violation of what the Conservatives have always supported and what we have commonly come to know as our basic democratic rights as members of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see that the government has been engaging in another pattern of behaviour, one that I have not seen in 13 years. It is quelling and quashing the ability of the public service to deal with members of Parliament, particularly those in opposition. It is very difficult for us to get information about what is occurring in the public service and to have meetings with public servants, who have always been very forthcoming in providing us with briefings in areas of our responsibility. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the new government has come along, I think the message has come down from on high, from the Prime Minister's Office, that members of the public service and the bureaucracy are not allowed to speak to members of the opposition. Roadblocks have been put in place to prevent us from being able to attend meetings and from dealing with and addressing members of the public service in a forthright and transparent fashion. That is a complete violation of our ability to do our jobs as members of Parliament in the service of the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also clearly is engaging in the behaviour of putting forth policies and using issues in a way that can harm Canadians. I will give but one example.</div>

There was not enough time to get the information on issues such as the following. What is the government going to do in terms of the development framework in Afghanistan? What are the government's plans for training the Afghan security forces? What are the government's plans for dealing with the insurgency coming from outside Afghanistan? What is the government's plan to deal with the poppy crop?

He would rather use the issue as a political ploy to try to divide the opposition and to be able to erroneously show the public that those who do not support an extension at this time are somehow against our troops, which is absolute rubbish.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind that is a more evil intention. That evil intention is the desire on the part of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A> to use our troops for political gain. They should never be used for political gain. I hope the public sees that. I hope public understands that what we are trying to do is make sure that the conditions for the success of our mission in Afghanistan are there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have been very clear in trying to articulate and demonstrate to the public that the policies the government has pursued in some areas are not what they seem. The government has trotted out policies on taxes. What it has done is raise the taxes on the poor. How on earth could any government in good conscience raise taxes on those who are the most vulnerable in our society? That is what the government has done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about a child care program. Is the child care program a child care program? No, it is not. It is $1,200 before taxes for Canadians for their children under the age of six. That amounts to less than the cost of the cup of latte a day. That is not child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the public understands that what we are trying to do here in this House with respect to these particular Standing Orders is enable and codify these orders in the House, which would enable us to have debates the public can see, give all members the ability to put forth solutions that would enable us to be constructive in the interests of our constituents, and enable us to work in the interests of the public.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is not whether we want the provisional Standing Orders implemented permanently, because we do. The point is keeping one's word. The point is lying in one meeting and going to another and doing something different.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot think of any example of a situation like that, at least not in the 13 years that I have been here, whereby a government appointed somebody who is sitting in the other chamber to be a cabinet minister and who therefore is hidden from the ability of the people in this House to ask questions and also hidden from being accountable while responsible for a department.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of the public who are watching us know this very clearly. For those who do not know this, I do not know if they cannot possibly fathom why on earth a government would be talking about accountability. Why would a Prime Minister be trumpeting accountability with one arm and muzzling his MPs and his cabinet with the other arm while appointing members of the Senate to be members of his cabinet, to be responsible for departments but shielded from the type of accountability and questioning that every other cabinet minister in this House is responsible for?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was standing and you recognized two Liberal members. My point of order having been raised, I inform you that I will split my time with my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to speak to this motion, in my capacity as vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. From the outset I have been involved in discussions within our parliamentary committee. I do not wish to repeat here everything that was said in committee. In order to maintain a certain credibility, we parliamentarians in this House have a certain obligation to be consistent and behave logically.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, regardless of their allegiance or political opinion, we note that some politicians have credibility problems. They claim one thing when they are in the opposition and, when their party is in power, they claim the opposite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implementation of these Standing Orders—implementation that we wish to be permanent but that has been provisional for more than 20 months—requires some consistency on the part of the Conservative Party and the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain. When the Speech from the Throne was adopted in 2004, following the election on June 28, 2004, discussions were held among the three opposition party leaders: the leader of the Conservative Party, the leader of the Bloc Québécois and the leader of the NDP. During these discussions about the arrival of a minority government, it was agreed that we should adopt some new rules to reflect the reality of a minority government. I will recall that the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, then leader of the opposition, was in full agreement with this approach. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative Party, now in power, no longer likes the rules it thought were fine when it was in opposition. The government, with its attitude and its parliamentary tactics, is preventing the provisional Standing Orders from becoming permanent. We have seen it in this file, as we have seen in many other files, such as those concerning the environment and the government’s foreign policy. I am thinking of Afghanistan and the bombing in southern Lebanon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately this Conservative government is a minority government. Fortunately this Conservative government cannot do what it wants. Fortunately the members of the opposition parties, whose numbers are greater, can prevent the Conservative Party from doing what it wants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the government and the Conservative Party to be consistent. They agreed to change these rules. At the time, the Liberal Party was in government and opposed the changes. Now that it is in opposition, it supports them. The Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois agree that these provisional standing orders should become permanent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to discuss one rule in particular that is really important. I am referring to subsection 106(4) of our Standing Orders, according to which any four members of a committee may, with five days' notice, convene a meeting of a standing committee. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245">(1245)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous rule required ten days' notice. The Conservatives agreed with us to reduce that to five days, for the very good reason that this standing order comes into effect mainly when Parliament is not sitting and an emergency arises. As you know, most committees meet twice a week, so there is no need to convene the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. We met this morning and we will meet Thursday morning, unless some event occurs to change that. This standing order comes into effect and is used most often during the summer and winter holiday recesses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, ten days' notice was required. We agreed to reduce this to five days because of the exceptional nature of the measure. Convening a standing committee requires some unusual event, some emergency to have taken place to bring parliamentarians together as quickly as possible, hear witnesses and report to the House once the session resumes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given how quickly certain events progress, whatever made headlines this morning will still be an issue in five days, but it might not be in ten days. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a clear-cut case of the Conservatives having agreed to reduce the number of days to five but now that is one of the points of contention. Let us reread the transcripts of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The government whip was explicit: it is one of the Standing Orders with which the government does not agree, and one that the government would like to change back to ten days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reminded the government whip that, as far as I could recall, we had used this Standing Order three times when we were the official opposition. We had asked, during the summer, that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade be convened to answer questions pertaining to the discovery of prisoners of war and to the JTF2 unit. We had asked for light to be shed on these matters by convening the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. The Conservatives agreed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology be convened due to the rising cost of petroleum products caused by the greed of oil companies eager to pocket greater profits. The Conservatives agreed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the summer of 2004, I clearly remember being at the centre of a strategy to convene the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, chaired by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78878,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78878&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—St. Albert</A>, to examine the sponsorship scandal. The Conservatives agreed with us regarding the five day rule.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should behave as they did when in opposition and consider the logic behind these changes to the Standing Orders.</div>

As he recognizes, it was this party, in cooperation with others, that put together the provisional Standing Orders in the 38th Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of cooperation in the House is the lubricant that gets things done while partisanship is the friction that causes it to come grinding to a halt. If we remove the lubricant of cooperation, how can we get the job done? We agree with him that the provisional Standing Orders need to pass.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the point being made was that there were some slight and small changes to them. He brought up the one about the amendment. He agrees that it probably should not change, but does he agree that, in their entirety, the provisional Standing Orders are exactly how he would like them or is there a small amount of work that still needs to be done to fix a couple of them?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, that was the spirit of cooperation at the House leaders' meeting, when it was agreed they would be put off and looked at by staff in order to fix some of the small pieces that needed to be fixed. Could the member tell us whether they are perfect or is there a small amount in the provisional Standing Orders that even he would still like to see fixed?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If problems remain concerning the Standing Orders, if other changes must be made that will not result in major changes to procedure and operations, representatives from all parties could sit down together.

The fact remains that it appears that at a House leaders meeting there were discussions about extending the deadline with regard to the provisional Standing Orders to November 21 and also that the staff would be doing work to prepare for potential amendments as well as having meetings. The hon. member for the Bloc will also know that no meetings were called and no instructions were given. There is no evidence of any work having been done. Telephone calls by the opposition whip to have discussions with the government whip were not returned during the whole break week. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that despite the best efforts of the opposition parties to move on this, the government was not willing. Accordingly, a proper motion was moved at the procedure and House affairs committee to make the provisional Standing Orders permanent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are those the facts as the Bloc member understands them?</div>

    </p><a name="Para214607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that the word “hypocrite” is not parliamentary, and I am certainly not going to use it, but I believe that the word “Pharisee” is. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, it is rather unbelievable to witness such a situation this morning. When the Conservatives were in opposition — remember that this took place in the post-Gomery period — they wanted Parliament to be more transparent, for parliamentarians to be more efficient, more accountable, and they wanted to enhance the role of every member. They wanted to put parliamentary business at the centre of this reform. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that members spend a great deal of time in committee. I remember when I was elected in 1993, the leader of the Bloc Québécois at the time, Lucien Bouchard, told us that question period was important and made it possible to exercise some control on the actions of the government, but that it was in committee work that a member reached his true worth. It was there that a member’s knowledge of an issue could be seen, it was there that in-depth examination was carried out and it was there that bills could be improved. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were looking for a revision of the Standing Orders and the adoption of these new rules, which were one of the demands of the Conservatives. I recall even some aspects that were not contained in the new Standing Orders. For example, when they were in opposition, the Conservatives wanted all private members bills brought to a vote. They said that whenever there is a debate, reports or bills, there should be an exchange between parliamentarians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a government of Pharisees we have there! What hypocrisy; what a shame after the promise given for the government to back track! The current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">prime minister</A>, who was then the leader of the opposition, had made demands for an amendment to the Speech from the Throne. All political parties, all the party leaders were agreed on a reform of the Standing Orders. Today, a government that receives 17% of the projected vote in Quebec, and almost 30% nationally, is acting like those traditional parties who lose the confidence and respect of our fellow Canadians. Why? Because they say one thing when they are in opposition and do the opposite when they are in government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, this is not a majority government and, God and the voters willing, it will never be. This is a government that is unable to follow through on promises. Members in this House may have differing convictions. We can lean toward the left or the right. We can believe in government intervention or have greater faith in private enterprise. We may have a different vision of the social contract by which we exist and interact. But, in a Parliament, you cannot behave in such a way as to do the opposite of what you said when in opposition. That is unacceptable and, once again, it goes to show that the Conservatives are an immature party, unable to govern the state respectfully.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get into a bit more detail. What did the reformed Standing Orders provide? First was the matter of opposition days. Members know that, for each parliamentary calendar, opposition parties may submit to the table officer a list of topics of current interest for the consideration of the House, which will be votable. Understandably, the number of opposition days is proportionate to the respective number of seats of the various political parties.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300">(1300)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the official opposition has more opposition days than the Bloc, and the Bloc has more than the NDP. Opposition days are an important mechanism whereby political parties can draw attention to problems. For example, the Bloc Québécois had opposition days on the POWA, the lack of control over gasoline prices, the missile defence shield and lumber. When they were in opposition, the Conservatives maintained that all opposition day motions ought to be votable. Now, they want to backtrack on that. They do not want all opposition day motions to be votable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, how can we expect Canadians and Quebeckers to respect this party when it is unable to follow a guideline, and its principles, sense of honour and commitment keep changing depending on which side of the House it is sitting? That is unacceptable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another aspect of the Standing Orders that was a major improvement, an operating procedure that was to the benefit of all parties, is this ability to convene parliamentary committees on shorter notice. Before the amended Standing Orders were adopted, we could not convene a parliamentary committee without giving 10 days’ notice, whether it was the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities or the Standing Committee on Finance. Parliamentary committees could be convened on 10 days’ notice. Now, if the request is signed by a certain number of permanent members, a parliamentary committee can be convened on five days’ notice. This is important, because even when the House is not sitting, parliamentary committees may have to make decisions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78635,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78635&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Joliette</A>, was the Bloc Québécois international trade critic, he asked that the committee be convened in the middle of the summer because of the softwood lumber agreement. At the time when my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78635,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78635&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Joliette</A> asked that the committee be convened, the softwood lumber agreement was causing the forest industry some concern. As a result of the questions asked by the Bloc Québécois, the government was of course persuaded to improve the agreement. There are therefore times when parliamentary committees have to be convened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would note the excellent work done by my colleague the foreign affairs critic in the last few years, and wish her a prompt recovery; she should be back with us in the near future, or at least that is what we hope for her. Our colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78565,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78565&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">La Pointe-de-l'Île</A> had to ask that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade be convened because of the crisis taking place in the Middle East, the Lebanon crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not understand this double talk, this holier than thou attitude, this hypocritical attitude, which makes people incapable of keeping their word and makes them say one thing when they are in opposition and another when they are in power. What point is there in having a minister responsible for democratic reform? What point is there in talking about recognizing the role of members of Parliament? How can we think that the public will respect their elected representatives if the government zigs and zags and is incapable of keeping its word?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a disappointment! God and our fellow citizens willing this government will never get a majority. I am convinced that our fellow citizens will sit up and realize how unworthy this government is of being given another term.</div>

Yesterday across the floor the Conservative members were laughing and heckling on a very important topic, money laundering. I am hoping they will pay closer attention today, because money laundering is not done by ordinary citizens; it is done by criminals and terrorists. It is a very serious matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I should say that our finance critic is generally in support of what is being proposed in terms of amendments. After all, this builds upon the anti-money laundering legislation that our government brought in in 2001. We have now had the benefit of a few years and the government is reviewing the feedback and the experience to date. It is very timely to bring in some amendments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on one point that I made yesterday which is that one of the amendments actually removes lawyers from the list of those financial intermediaries who need to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. This is something that the committee should look at very carefully.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we contemplated when the government brought in this law was that, for example, a citizen would sit down with his or her lawyer and say, “I would like you to keep this $300,000 in cash in safe keeping for me”. The lawyer under the law as we have it would then say to the person, “Do you realize that I am required under the law to report this to FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, as a prima facie suspicious item?” The client would either say, “Yes, I understand that. Therefore, I will take my $300,000 back”, or “Yes, you may proceed”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis the lawyers in this country have challenged that this takes away from solicitor-client privilege and an appeal court has agreed with them. This amendment takes the lawyers out of the loop of the money laundering reporting, the suspicious transactions reporting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the vast majority of lawyers in this country are honest people. The small minority of people who would take part in money laundering transactions will now find this loophole. The committee should carefully look at that. There are not many realistic options. Finance Canada and FINTRAC are negotiating with the legal profession to see what can be done. This is a serious matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other amendments. For example, it is a requirement by financial intermediaries to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. As it now stands, the law has some criminal sanctions if the financial intermediaries do not report. What these amendments call for is a lesser level of sanction for lesser violations of the reporting requirements under the act. That seems to be a reasonable request.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one issue that is difficult and I know that the House committee, the Auditor General and the committee in the other place have highlighted this, and that is Parliament's oversight over FINTRAC. How do we know that FINTRAC is operating within the mandate that it was given by Parliament? How do we know that the privacy rights of citizens are not being violated? How do we know that it is getting results? Has the information that it is providing to the RCMP and CSIS led to any arrests or convictions? That is something the committee should look at as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other aspects in terms of these amendments that warrant careful examination by the committee. As I said yesterday, when the legislation was introduced, the focus was put on monetary instruments. In other words, all laundered money eventually finds its way or should find its way into a bank account or into cash of some kind. The reality is that the money launderers become more clever and there is a chance that they could be dealing in precious metals or minerals, or items that are not monetary instruments. That has to be looked at. The proposal here with respect to currency traders, for example, is that they be brought under a regulatory ambit that would be managed by the federal government. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315">(1315)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical exchange dealers one would find in airports, and I am not going to give any commercial names, but many would be familiar with these operations, right now they are required to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. They are considered to be financial intermediaries but it is not a very defined or regulated sector. These amendments propose to bring that under tighter scrutiny.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 when the Liberal government brought in the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, we laid out the objectives of the act: to facilitate the detection, investigation, and prosecution of money laundering and terrorist activities financing offences, and to deter money laundering and terrorist financing activities; to respond to the threat posed by organized crime, while protecting personal information; and to assist in fulfilling Canada's international commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues that was dealt with at the time is the balance of the type of information and the reason that certain information could be passed from FINTRAC to the law enforcement agencies and to CSIS. There is always a careful balance between the need for Canadians to be protected from money launderers but also the need for their privacy to be protected. The amendments proposed here call for an added level of information that could be provided by FINTRAC to law enforcement agencies and CSIS to decide if there is a trend that they want to analyze and pursue further.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law still requires that if CSIS, the RCMP or other law enforcement wish to take the issue further, they would have to go to a court and get a judge's permission for FINTRAC to release information above and beyond what we call boiler plate information or basic raw data. Those provisions still stand, although there are increasing abilities to provide additional information under the proposals before us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of these amendments reinforces the need for the banks and financial intermediaries to know their customers. Knowing one's customers is key because that is the way to deal with money laundering activities before they begin. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other elements to the amendments, but I have touched on the major ones. Having been involved in a modest way in 2001 in the design and set-up of the original legislation and the establishment of FINTRAC, my view would be that these are worthy amendments. They should be debated and witnesses should be brought forward with respect to some of the amendments, but generally I believe they should receive the support of the House. Certainly I will be voting for the bill to go to committee for further evaluation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para214673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I would reiterate that the Bloc Québécois plans to support this bill. Obviously, we will take all necessary measures, in committee and elsewhere, to ensure that the right of citizens to protection of personal information is respected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, with respect to the principle underlying the bill, the Bloc Québécois has always felt that fighting terrorist activity funding is one of the greatest challenges in fighting terrorism. The provisions in this bill will also apply to the fight against organized crime, which has been a Bloc Québécois priority for a long time now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a number of bills to make things more difficult for organized crime. As you know, one of our colleagues in this House, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78381,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78381&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</A>, has been working for a long time now to protect Quebec farmers who have been taken advantage of by organized crime groups that used their land to grow illegal crops. We will continue to pursue our long-standing fight against organized crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also think that this bill will enable Canada to comply with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by providing some background on the bill to put it into context.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 15, 1999, the then Secretary of State, the hon. member for Willowdale, tabled, on behalf of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78914,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78914&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A>, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A>, to combat money laundering. It was quite similar to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9543,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9543&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-81</A>, presented earlier in 1999, which simply died on the order paper when that session of Parliament prorogued.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad purpose of the bill was to remedy shortcomings in Canada’s anti-money laundering legislation, as identified by the G-7’s Financial Action Task Force, FATF, on Money Laundering in its 1997-1998 report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the FATF recommended that reporting requirements in Canada be made mandatory—rather than voluntary, as is currently the case—and that a financial intelligence unit be established to deal with the collection, management and analysis of suspicious transaction reports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A> was passed and since then it has been mandatory for regulated financial institutions, exchange offices, casinos and other financial intermediaries to report suspicious financial transactions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the bill's objectives was to put in place, together with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, a system for reporting large cross-border movements of currency. The bill also provides for the creation of a new independent agency, namely the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, which will receive and administer the information reported.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A> was enacted on June 29, 2000, and replaced the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act then in effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now going from Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A> to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2374081,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2374081&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-25</A>, with which we will try to go further than we did at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government is proposing to amend Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A> with the bill we are debating in this House today to increase financial institutions' duties to keep records and report suspicious transactions, with a view to eliminating money laundering and funding for terrorist organizations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come back to that in further detail later in my presentation, but first, the bill extends the application of the act to all organizations that, in addition to dealing in securities, deal in other financial instruments.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325">(1325)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we are also going to add persons and entities that transmit funds by any means or through any intermediary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, this obligation to report information was provided for in section 83.01 of the Criminal Code, which stipulated that the RCMP or CSIS should be notified of the existence of property belonging to a terrorist group. So we will be going a bit further for any transaction that seems suspicious.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other new thing in this bill is the prohibition against anyone opening a bank account for a person or an agency if the client’s identity cannot be established; this seems logical. Under this bill, any financial institution dealing with a politically exposed foreign person—I shall come back to this a little later on—should make sure that senior management has given its approval before undertaking a transaction with this type of individual.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will take the necessary steps to make sure that, if a Canadian bank is dealing with a bank or another institution, it is a real bank, not a fictitious one, a shell bank. That too seems to be quite an appropriate precaution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2374081,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2374081&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-25</A> requires foreign subsidiaries of Canadian banks to comply with the same rules as Canadian banks. So we are going to try and extend our actions to the limit of our powers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally an official of the revenue department will now have the power to transfer any information transmitted by another official under the Charities Registration (Security Information) Act to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. This power is designed to more readily combat the financing of terrorist organizations through so-called charitable organizations or through electronic funds transfers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To continue this scenario, we must also talk about money laundering. Money laundering occurs when the revenue arising from criminal activity is converted into goods whose origin is difficult to trace, and has, in fact, been deliberately hidden. Thus proceeds of crime are disguised in an attempt to make them look legitimate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally these are goods or assets arising from the illegal drug trade or other criminal activities, such as cigarette smuggling, burglaries and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since money laundering and the criminal activities it attempts to camouflage are clandestine in nature, understandably it is fairly difficult to get an accurate idea of the situation. The experts estimate, however, that between US$300 billion and US$500 billion worth of criminal funds enter the international financial markets every year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government estimates that between $5 and $17 billion is laundered in Canada every year. This is a significant amount of money. Although it is difficult to know the exact amount, given the source of the money, this gives us an idea of the seriousness of the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repercussions of organized crime go beyond mere economic consequences and the violence it causes. The social costs involved are also very high.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, regarding this area of the problem, we will try to resolve the issue of funding terrorist organizations. Terrorist groups are resorting more and more to the use of charities to ensure funding. Under the guise of charitable organizations, terrorist groups successfully accumulate the funds they need to plan and execute terrorist acts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, since the implementation of measures aimed at fighting large, structured terrorist organizations, such as al-Qaeda, we are now faced with several independent, separate cells. While larger organizations need enormous amounts of money to finance their operations, weapons purchases and international movements, the new wave of terrorism does not need as much money to achieve its ends. Thus, there is a greater need to develop means to fight against this type of funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering—or FATF—was created in 1989 at the G-7 summit in Paris. Its primary objective is to fight money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities. The task force now exists and has 33 members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk in greater detail about the provisions that amend Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2374081,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2374081&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-25 </A> amends in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',9849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=9849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A> is the mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions in clauses 5 to 11. Under Bill C-22, the reporting of suspicious transactions, which is currently voluntary, would become mandatory. The obligation to report would extend to non-banking financial institutions and certain other businesses. Therefore, the reporting requirements would apply to regulated financial institutions, casinos, foreign exchange traders, stock brokers, insurance companies and persons acting as financial intermediaries, such as lawyers and accountants.</div>

Departments and agents of the government that sell prescribed precious metals will also be subject to the legislation.

An institution will not be able to do business with this category of individuals without first obtaining the approval of senior management. Who are these politically vulnerable individuals, as defined in the bill? They include heads of state or government, members of the executive council of a government or members of a legislature, deputy ministers or people of equivalent rank, ambassadors or attachés or counsellors of an ambassador, presidents of state-owned companies or state-owned banks, heads of government agencies, judges, leaders or presidents of political parties represented in a legislature and holders of any prescribed office or position. All these people are considered politically vulnerable. Before an organization does business with them, its senior management will be informed and will have to act accordingly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major set of amendments made by this bill, clauses 12 to 39, covers the declaration of significant transborder movements of currency. Individuals who import or export large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, such as travellers cheques, must report these to a customs officer. Failure to do so may lead to seizure of the currency or instruments transported unless the individuals decide not to proceed further with importing or exporting them. A mechanism is put in place for that purpose, and we will add, in clauses 15 and 16 for example, provisions authorizing customs officers to search a person or the vehicle of a person if they suspect on reasonable grounds that the person has secreted on or about their person currency or monetary instruments not reported pursuant to the law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision will make it possible for Canada to enter into an agreement with the customs agencies of foreign states which have similar reporting requirements for transborder movements of currency and monetary instruments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third important element is the creation of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada covered under clauses 40 to 72. This bill will create this new government agency, which will be independent and will be responsible for gathering and analyzing the reports it receives under the legislation. The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada will be a central repository for information about money laundering activities across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation authorizes the centre to provide key identifying information of suspicious transactions to the appropriate police force if it has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information would be relevant to investigating or prosecuting a money laundering offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the role of the centre will essentially be to gather information, process it and determine the potential problems and suspicious cases that will be passed on to the police forces. They will be in charge of determining whether to take action or not. I had a chance to meet, at the Standing Committee on Finance, someone from an existing organization in Canada that does similar work. I imagine the centre and the agency will join forces to try to identify suspicious patterns in a series of financial transactions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centre will also raise awareness among and provide information to the public on this type of problem. It will also be authorized to subpoena witnesses and to make an order for the production of documents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to close with the offences covered in the legislation in clauses 74 to 82. The sanctions for breaching these requirements are described in these clauses.</div>

    </p><a name="Para214723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will indeed have to see what that means exactly. Will it allow a two-way exchange of information to better combat money laundering?</div>
    </p><a name="Para214724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the points raised by the hon. member, the main one, the one of greatest concern to me personally and to the Bloc Québécois is unquestionably the protection of privacy. As I said at the beginning of my speech, this is a fundamental issue and a very important one. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, at this stage, we are debating the bill's principle. I think that this is how our colleagues from the NDP see it as well. The principle is good. At committee, we will have to take a more detailed look at what impact the bill could have on people's privacy and see whether it is well balanced in terms of the fine line between privacy, on the one hand, and national security or the fight against organized crime, on the other. If the proper balance has not been struck in the bill as it stands, my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois will work at making or supporting amendments designed to provide greater balance. </div>

    </p><a name="Para214727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, yesterday in debate, during questions and comments, there was a suggestion that somehow, because of the seriousness of the risk associated with terrorism, there should be some kind of a reverse onus and a tougher view on the proceeds of crime. My concern with that is the basic fundamental rights of all Canadians. Even criminals have rights in Canada. We need to protect the presumption of innocence, the rule of law, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member agree that we have to be extremely careful not only in balancing the need to deal with these crimes with privacy, but also to be absolutely sure that the rights and freedoms of all Canadians are equally protected?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hon. colleague spoke about the rights of criminals. We often hear people accuse us of protecting criminals. The problem is that, at the time when we protect them, we do not know yet whether they are criminals or not. That is why we have the presumption of innocence in our society to protect everyone, including potential criminals, for the simple reason that we do not know in advance if they are or not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore always be very careful in this regard and uphold the basic principles of our democracy. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where a person is a known member of an illegal organization or a criminal organization, for example, the Hell's Angels, and that person has assets such as a luxury mansion, two cars in the garage, the speed boat, all the trappings of luxury, but has had no visible means of income for the last 20 years, why should we not be able to seize those assets and put the onus on him to demonstrate that he did not purchase them with the proceeds of crime?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been expressed by some of my colleagues from the NDP, we will be supporting the bill at second reading. As opposed to a half dozen or more other crime bills that have come from the government, this bill at least makes sense. It would address some real problems in the country with regard to money laundering by organized crime and terrorist financing from either potential terrorist groups in the country and, as often as not, from outside the country who are using Canada, as we know, mostly as a conduit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the money is raised in Canada but a great deal of both the money laundering from organized crime and from the terrorist groups outside the country is coming from outside, moving through Canada and on into the United States or back to other countries where it is used to finance terrorism in those countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have some concerns about the bill and my colleague from British Columbia just raised one of them. We do not seem to be able to figure out a way to accommodate the legal community in terms of the lawyers and the law firms having to report either suspicious transactions or large sums of money passing, mostly through their trust accounts but through their offices. That has been an ongoing problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill originated, I would say, at least two years ago and maybe three, and has been held up all that time because of the ongoing dispute between the law societies across the country and the federal government. The law society, in a previous piece of legislation, actually challenged the government in court and was successful in having itself excluded under the terminology and provisions of that particular law. We were hoping that this bill, which we hope will eventually become law, would have included at least some meaningful reporting from the legal community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will explore this more at the committee to see if there is some possibility of that happening and, if not, an explanation as to why not and also what types of negotiations have gone on between the federal government and the legal community, the law societies in particular, to try to resolve this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the very good points about the bill is that it does include the foreign exchange shop. We know from a number of reports that we have had from police sources and our intelligence sources that repeatedly, because they are not covered by the existing law, people have gone to foreign exchange shops, exchanged large amounts of money from one currency into Canadian currency and oftentimes go to another shop to exchange that into another currency, oftentimes U.S. currency, and the money moves on out of the country without any formal recording. This will cease with this legislation coming into effect. It is one of the major holes that we have in our system of protections, both against organized crime and potential terrorist groups, and it badly needs to be plugged. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a concern about the cost of the administration of this program as it is now, and that will become somewhat more onerous, because again, we are bringing in more private sector companies which will be responsible for additional reporting. </div>
    </p><a name="Para214749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know from my colleague from Winnipeg that there has been some expression of concern from small credit unions about their ability to provide sufficient resources, both in terms of technology and in terms of personnel to meet the requirements of this reporting.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355">(1355)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para214750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another matter that needs to be explored at committee, and in particular, to see if the federal government could be doing something to assist smaller operators who are affected by this legislation. It may be by providing them with a software package that would let them track the funds or it may be suggestions on how small financial institutions can streamline their process and still meet the requirements of the act without making it too onerous for them to perform their responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to raise one additional problem, which concerns how this information is used, and I will do it in two contexts. The Auditor General, Ms. Fraser, issued a report on the central agency, FINTRAC, which is the intelligence gathering organization in this country that sifts all this information and helps identify whether in fact it is coming from organized crime or from some terrorist activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her report, which I believe was for the 2003-04 period of time, she found that although a number of transactions had been identified and had been, as permitted under the legislation, reported to both the RCMP and CSIS, neither of those agencies appeared to have used the information, either for investigation purposes or for laying charges. That appears to be an ongoing problem and it is of concern. FINTRAC was running in that year on a budget of about $31 million annually. If we are spending that amount of money on this intelligence gathering program, we should be seeing some results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two subsequent years of 2004-05 and 2005-06, again there appears to have been limited use made of this. This is something that will need to be explored at committee to ensure Canadian taxpayers receive good results from their tax dollars that go into these services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other context where I would like to address the use of this is the issue of privacy and, in particular, the risk that some of this information will find its way into the United States and, under the patriot act, be disclosed to a number of agencies in the U.S. I have not been convinced that we have closed all the loopholes so that this information, the intelligence and results of the investigation which are badly needed in Canada, does not go into the United States.</div>

The lives of these producers and their families, who have, for the most part, been without any income for months, have been turned upside down.

    </p><a name="Para214816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have, unfortunately, chosen to push their ideological “fend for yourself” policies and have unnecessarily cut funding to programs that promote women's equality, adult literacy, programs that make a difference in aboriginal communities, and regional economic development programs that strengthen economies in areas like northern Ontario, not to mention the earlier cancellation of programs to deal with the world's looming climate change crisis and the cancellation of the GST rebates for visitors to Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have met with francophone women in my riding and with tourist operators. I have heard from advocates for literacy and those searching for ways to promote greenhouse gas abatement technology. They all decry these cuts which are simply not needed because of Canada's strong financial position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para214818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support those who strongly urge the minority Conservative government to reinstate funding to these essential programs.</div>

It was decided that it was important to preserve a balance in labour relations. The Canada Labour Code permits the use of replacement workers, but they must not be used to undermine unions’ representational capacity. If that is the case, the unions may complain to the Canada Industrial Relations Board and have the right to start proceedings for that purpose. Only two provinces have an anti-strikebreaker law. The other eight do not want one.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its essence, the bill is about providing greater protection to Canadians. It is about enabling the regulation of an industry which, for better or for worse, has come to occupy a very real place in Canadian cities and towns.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payday lending and the payday lending industry has, in the span of approximately 12 years, mushroomed in Canada to become an industry which is estimated to provide short term loan services to about two million people in Canada each year. It has a volume loan of approximately $1.7 billion annually. I was pleased to table this bill on October 6, 2006, as I believe it would enable more effective protection of Canadians everywhere.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing the substance of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A>, I wish to point out that these amendments are the result of a collaborative dialogue between the territorial, provincial and federal governments.

    </p><a name="Para215042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to situate this bill within its proper context. Doing so will enable us all to better appreciate its significance and the very important and practical consequences it would have in ensuring that everyday Canadians who use the services of the payday lending industry have enhanced protection against questionable business practices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said moments ago, the payday lending industry is a relatively new one in Canada. Despite this, payday lending has, nevertheless, become a familiar fixture throughout Canada occupying prominent places on our streets in our communities. Indeed, just a few blocks away from this place, if one were to take a stroll in either direction, east down Rideau Street or south down Bank Street, the prevalence of payday lending outlets are readily noticeable. This is no different for communities throughout Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payday lending industry is believed to have first appeared in Canada around 1994. Beginning in the western provinces, the industry has since spread across the country from west to east. Whether we are talking about Prince Albert, Saskatchewan; Pembroke, Ontario; or Charlottetown, P.E.I.; the payday lending industry is there. In fact, the industry is currently operating in every province and territory in Canada except in the province of Quebec. In the case of Quebec, the inability of the payday lending industry to operate is a result of that province's decision not to issue licences to businesses that would charge more than 35% annual interest. This has effectively prevented the operation of the payday lending industry in that province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the absence in Quebec, it is estimated that there are approximately 1,350 outlets in the rest of Canada. It is clear, therefore, that the industry is well established. It is equally clear that it is time for effective government regulation of this rapidly growing industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe it is important to ensure that those Canadians who do use the services of a payday lender are provided the necessary protection from exploitative business practices, particularly so among the most vulnerable members of our community. The amendments proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> would allow for this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to be clear about what we are talking about when we speak of payday lending and the payday lending industry. The concept of a payday loan has really become shorthand for what is essentially a short term loan for a small amount. Generally, loans of this nature are in the range of $300 and extend for a period of about 10 days. The reasons that individuals choose to use the service of a payday lending industry are varied. Some use it for convenience while others use it out of necessity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, loans of this nature have been provided by alternative retail lenders in Canada. Associated with this service, these alternative lenders will generally charge a range of administrative and processing fees as well as the interest associated with the borrowing of the moneys. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualification for these loans is generally straightforward. The borrower must first demonstrate proof of a steady income. Most obviously this is established through proof of employment, although employment is not necessarily required. Other sources of income can suffice in certain circumstances, including, for example, pension income. The borrower must have a bank account and must also provide a post-dated cheque or pre-authorized debit to the lender for the amount of the loan plus the associated fees and interest. Repayment of the loan is often due on the date of the borrower's next payday.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in some respects, applying for and paying back a payday loan generally resembles other types of consumer lending. While the service provided is of a similar nature to other lending instruments, the specific form it takes is quite different.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite some time now, the payday lending industry has been the source of significant concern. Most notably, concerns have focused on the very high cost of borrowing, which in some cases can range in the thousands of per cent on an annual basis. Other concerns include the insufficient disclosure of contractual terms, aggressive and unfair debt collection practices, and the fact that these loans can quickly spiral out of control as a result of rolling over loans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these very real concerns, it is time for action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This government has made a commitment to improve the lives of Canadian families. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> reflects this commitment. Bill C-26 would amend the Criminal Code to enable provincial and territorial regulation of the payday lending industry. Currently, section 347 of the Criminal Code provides for an offence of entering into an agreement or arrangement to receive interest at an annual rate of more than 60%. Effectively, this creates the offence of charging interest at a criminal rate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 347 was added to our Criminal Code in 1980. The principal policy rationale driving the inclusion of this provision was to address the practice of loansharking and that activity's role in relation to organized criminal behaviour. This was and remains a laudable goal. Organized crime poses a real threat to the safety and security of our communities. It did in 1980 and it continues to do so today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government continues to take steps to better respond to the threats posed to our citizens and communities by organized crime. These include key legislative reforms in the area of gun crime as well as committing $200 million to strengthening the ability of the RCMP to combat organized crime. We will continue to strengthen our responses in this area, ensuring safer streets and communities for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While section 347 may have been meant to address organized crime, the reality is that the provision has been interpreted as applying to most lending arrangements in Canada, including payday lending. Despite this fact, it is important to point out that section 347 is not a consumer protection tool. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> would clear the way for the provinces and the territories to create the tools they need to regulate the payday lending industry. In essence, the amendments would provide an exemption from section 347 of the Criminal Code for payday lenders under very specific and circumscribed instances. This exemption would be set out under proposed new section 347.1 of the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would this exemption scheme operate in practice? I am glad you asked that question, Mr. Speaker. First, the proposed amendments would define payday loan for the purpose of the exemption. A payday loan would be defined to mean:</div>
    </p><a name="Para215059"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>an advancement of money in exchange for a post-dated cheque, a pre-authorized debit or a future payment of a similar nature but not for any guarantee, suretyship, overdraft protection or security on property and not through a margin loan, pawnbroking, a line of credit or a credit card.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para215060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this definition may seem like a mouthful, it is an extremely important aspect of the proposed amendments. Laws and legal systems are meant to provide a certain degree of precision, clearly defining the limits of the behaviour which they purport to regulate.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520">(1520)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By defining a payday loan in this fashion, the proposed amendments provide the precision necessary to ensure that the exemption will not capture other types of lending arrangements where the policy considerations at play are very different. These amendments are targeted in scope.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have heard the concerns expressed by our provincial and territorial colleagues in relation to the regulation of the payday lending industry and we have demonstrated our commitment through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> to working with them to ensure that Canadians are provided increased consumer protection measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments would further prescribe the types of payday loan arrangements that would be subject to an exemption by providing two additional requirements. First, the amount of money advanced under the agreement cannot be more than $1,500. Second, the loan agreement cannot be for more than 62 days. These are measured and well-considered limitations. They appropriately reflect what we know to be the typical payday lending situation, that is, a short term loan for a relatively small amount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments specify additional requirements before providing for the exemption from section 347 of the Criminal Code. First, the payday lender must be licensed or otherwise specifically authorized under the laws of the province or territory in which the lender is operating. This presupposes the existence of a provincial or territorial consumer protection scheme. Importantly, the provincial scheme will have to include, for the exemption to apply, a limit on the total cost of borrowing under the payday lending agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a province or territory wish to develop such consumer protection measures to address the payday lending industry within their jurisdiction, they will further need to seek a designation from the governor in council in order to provide an exemption from the application of section 347.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In practical terms this would mean that a province or territory which seeks an exemption under section 347 would write the federal minister of justice requesting that a designation for the exemption be issued. The request would need to detail how the province complies with the requirements proposed by these amendments, namely, that the province has legislative measures providing for a consumer protection scheme in place, which includes limits on the total cost of payday borrowing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming this is the case and acting on the recommendation of the federal <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78770,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78770&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Industry</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> would then ask the governor in council to grant or not grant the exemption. At any time, the province, through its lieutenant governor in council, can request that the designation be revoked. Similarly, the governor in council can revoke the designation if the legislation which establishes the consumer protection scheme established by the province is no longer in force.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sensible and effective solution to a pressing concern in Canada. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> facilitates the development of a consumer protection scheme in what has been a largely unregulated area. In so doing, the amendments recognize the constitutional authority over business practices possessed by the provinces and territories through their responsibility over property and civil rights. These amendments acknowledge that the provinces and territories are the most suitably placed level of government to implement a protection regime for consumers which responds to the needs and local circumstances that may exist in different jurisdictions across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pause to point out that the proposed amendments would not apply to federally regulated financial institutions such as banks. Banks and other financial institutions in Canada are already subject to federal legislation. The amendments are specifically targeted at a currently unregulated industry. We know that there is provincial and territorial support for these changes to the Criminal Code to occur. This is because many jurisdictions have indicated that the application of section 347 has been a barrier to their being able to move forward and effectively regulate the payday lending industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments would address provincial concerns. For example, in my home province, the government has already tabled legislation to regulate the payday lending industry. Other provinces have expressed an interest in taking similar steps. In the case where provinces choose not to regulate the payday lending industry, the Criminal Code will continue to apply.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that the payday lending industry has no place in Canadian society. They may argue that the payday lending industry exploits the situation of already vulnerable Canadians and that facilitating the regulation of this industry will only exacerbate the situation of vulnerable Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains, however, that the payday lending industry is a part of our society, and a growing one at that, and we must take the necessary steps to bring it within the purview of regulation. Doing so will ensure that Canadian consumers have more effective protection against questionable business practices. </div>

    </p><a name="Para215075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very recent article in the local paper talked about this industry, about how it was growing and how it affects people. We know that payday lending happens not only with people who are very short of money but also with people who are supposedly very affluent but who find that keeping up with the mortgage and car payments is a real challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the minister is this. Can he tell the House how much interest is made on these loans and how frequently? I know he spoke to it briefly in his speech, but the rate of lending now is quite high for the payday loan industry. What kinds of people actually frequent this? Is it something that people do on a monthly basis or just once in a while to get the money they need to live on?</div>

    </p><a name="Para215078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I indicated, given that it is for a relatively short period of time and for smaller amounts of moneys, generally speaking, we can see the effective rate of interest sometimes exceeding 1,000%. When one is talking about 10 days for $200 and being charged administrative and other fees on top of the interest rate, and when the interest rate per se cannot exceed 60%, the effective rate of course is much greater than that. That is what we are addressing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that in this context of short term loans the effective interest rate may be well over 60%, there needs to be some regulation to ensure that there are guidelines and regulations in place to ensure exactly what can be charged. That is where the provinces will step in. They will set those regulations. There is no specific requirement that any province set those regulations in a specific way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of what kinds of people use this, obviously all kinds of people at all kinds of income levels use it, both the middle class and those who are not as economically fortunate. One of the things a study indicated is that many of the payday loan companies recognize that their clientele comes a very short distance from where the actual offices are set up. Often we see these offices in impoverished neighbourhoods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging by that, it is safe to assume that many of the clients who are utilizing these payday lenders are in fact vulnerable and impoverished people who need this kind of consumer protection legislation.</div>

In fact, we were very close to bringing in legislation when the government was defeated last year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good consultation creates good legislation. Broad-based consultation creates good legislation. I think that is a lesson we can learn. If we do wide consultation, not only inside the minister's department but with stakeholders and people affected, we come up with a proper piece of legislation that is capable of moving through this House rapidly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important and a lesson to be learned. Well defined and well consulted legislation makes efficient use of parliamentary time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will briefly go over some of the history. The payday loan industry, as we have heard, is a growing industry in this country. Over the last decade it has been estimated that there are more than 1,300 outlets and every year nearly 2 million Canadians utilize some aspect of the industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, along with this growth, a smaller portion of people did some practices that included some very costly practices to people who needed these services. In fact, they created things that would have been in contravention of the criminal interest rate, section 347 of the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the dialogue between the Department of Justice, Industry Canada and the Department of Finance, people came to understand that section 347 of the Criminal Code had really been instituted for the criminal organization loansharking type of activity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Payday Loan Association and payday loan groupings try to have a code of ethics and conduct. Even though they are not yet regulated, and hopefully will soon be regulated, in those provinces and territories, they will have to go through the scheme that is in this proposed piece of legislation, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A>. We have some that are working to provide a service in a more ethical manner. Then we have some that obviously work outside the law to create as much money for themselves at the expense of people who are badly needing interim financing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister pointed out, this is not an attempt to in any way deal with the financial sector. We have the Bank Act and financial services, even though sometimes they would be dealing with less than $1,500 loan situations. We are talking about the payday loan which tends to be an unsecured loan situation for a very short period of time. As the minister has said, it is less than 62 days and the monetary limit is $1,500 or less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here a sensible, working, viable scheme that will exempt those provinces that decide that it is beneficial in their jurisdiction to work with the industry to regulate and come up with some protections and regulations. Those who wish to operate in that area can do so in a manner that will be better protective of the public. That usually is a consumer protection jurisdiction of the provincial or territorial governments and not usually at this level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we had to move out of that jurisdiction and carve out an exemption in this bill to allow the provinces to do that. Some of the provinces, notably Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Alberta have indicated interest in doing this. Some other provinces may not be as interested. They will still be living under the Criminal Code jurisdiction and will have to enforce that situation in those jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken a few years to get the bill ready. We are in a situation, at least in my party, to say that we do not see impediments, that this does not force any jurisdictions into making a change. It is actually more permissive. It allows them to step in and put legislation forward where they believe it is in the best interests of the people residing in their jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some provinces, notably Quebec, have already operated in a different manner and the flexibility under the act is there. As noted, the designation of the province will be required under subsection 3 of the bill. In subsection 2 we have the monetary and statutory dates limitation and the licensing authorizations under the laws of the provinces. There has to be an agreement and then the province moves into the designation that is seen in subsection 3.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision for revocation under subsection 4 that should not have to be used, but could be used if necessary and that shows some foresight. Again, interest has been defined, payday loan has been defined, and criminal interest rate is already in section 347, which has a maximum rate already.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is progressive in that it allows jurisdictions that wish it to regulate the industry and to place limits on the costs to consumers of payday borrowing. I believe it would even have been a better ministerial speech had the minister acknowledged the work that predated his government's ascension into power as a minority government. Be that as it may, I listened to the speech by the Minister of Justice and he covered all the bases that needed to be covered in a way with which I would agree.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, this is legislation that can move forward quickly in the House. I want to reiterate that where my party sees that we can advance pieces of legislation that have been brought forward and we can support, we will do so, but where there are hastily put together, non-consultative pieces of legislation, we have to do different things in different circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that I will end my brief comments here today and allow other parties who wish to comment in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank Act is controlled by the federal government. It was meant to be there to regulate banking. It is such an important part of our economy. It is an important part of Canadians' lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if there are any measures her government ever took to curb the loss of banking establishments in rural Canada. If not, what recommendations could she make in conjunction to the legislation that we are dealing with right now to offer some sort of sense of hope to the communities like Stewart, B.C.? These communities are somehow lost in the shuffle of where banks and these payday loan institutions are making their decisions, which is at the bottom of the deck, and very rarely with any respect to the rural communities that some of us represent.</div>

This matter came up at that time during the course of those discussions. As the member well knows, this is not directly relevant to this discussion on the payday loan bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bank Act itself has the sets of notice provisions. I know that they were followed in each and every case where banks made that business decision to cut. We, in all parties, were concerned and made our representations. I know in my own city I made my representations when a bank and a trust company merged together. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do have to understand that the banking industry is a regulated industry and that there was no branch closing that was not done properly by regulation. Nobody got to shortcut any provisions in the Bank Act. In fact, many worked very hard to give the protections as best they could to all the employees in the areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I do want to comment on the availability of the small time situation on a payday loan. We should not be confusing a small amount of loan, which would be done in a banking institution, with a payday loan. There is a difference. It is a small sum. There is no security given. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told the average payday loan is around $280 for a period of 10 days. It is an advance of cash against the customer's next payday. It is not a form of revolving credit. That is not what this is supposed to be. In fact, those things are among the practices, those roll-overs, that we are seeking to get rid of by instituting some of the protection that is in this current bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more designed for that one time unanticipated expense where somebody just needs help to get over a short trying period. It is not a payday loan, a long term credit project, nor is it a title loan; by that I mean a loan secured by a title to a property or an asset, such as a motor vehicle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that payday loan customers are Canadians with near median household incomes and the statistics provided by the Canadian Payday Loan Association puts 53% being women and 47% being men.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to say that to qualify for a payday loan a customer has to be employed and have a chequing account. So it is not really preying at a level that I see a lot of concern.</div>

I do not really see the position of the federal government to be one of intruding and demanding that we make it. In fact that would be ultra vires, out of the jurisdiction of this level of government and it is important that we stay in our area. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole intent of this legislation is to allow a carve-out and let someone in. I am aware of governments that are interested. I believe that the Manitoba government has tabled but has not yet proceeded with its legislation. I understand that as of May 3 last year, British Columbia's solicitor general had publicly called on us as the federal government to provide him with the ability to properly regulate payday lenders. On May 29 the Alberta solicitor general asked for the authority to regulate the payday loan industry in Alberta. This past summer, on July 13, Nova Scotia's minister of service said in the legislature that Nova Scotia plans to introduce legislation on payday loans. There are some. I know Ontario had been more reticent at this stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some who would say that this is a downloading to the provinces. I think there are options here and I view it this way. It is similar to when we were developing the best legislation in consultation with first nations. The way we got five bills through in a minority government was to make sure that on a lot of the first nations governance legislation, regarding economic issues in particular, there was wide consultation. Not only was it done in consultation with the first nations, but often the consultation was first nations led. Here we have a comparable situation where someone is coming forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also be remiss if I did not mention the advocacy of the Canadian Payday Loan Association, which is an umbrella group of about 850 of the currently 1,300-plus payday loan lenders. This group is striving to clean up the industry and in fact operates inside a voluntary code of ethics. The group wants this legislation. In fact it is pushing for it. Representatives of the group came to see me last spring and I said they would have to push the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were prepared to move forward. We had done the consultations and here we are, some months later in the fall. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78758,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78758&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>, in April last year, said in talking with the Canadian press that he planned to take action to attempt to regulate the payday loan industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that when legislation like this comes forward, it cannot just be worked through one department. We have had the cooperation of industry officials inside Industry Canada. They have been working at it with the original umbrella organization since the year 2000. Finance officials have to be involved. When legislation is worked through the appropriate channels and it makes good common sense, it is important to move on it.</div>

In Canada, the industry began to take root in the 1990s. Its growth has not been uniform, however, since it falls under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces over local commerce and civil rights and is thus subject to the rules governing contracts and consumer protection in each jurisdiction. Accordingly, while the federal government believes that this industry now has over 1,300 points of sale, they are unevenly distributed and there are not very many in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several payday lending companies have joined together to form the Payday Loan Association of Canada. That association represents 22 companies that operate a total of 850 points of sale for financial services across Canada, but none in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a payday loan? To the Payday Loan Association of Canada, a payday loan is an unsecured small-sum short term loan typically for a few hundred dollars. The average payday loan is around $280 for a period of 10 days. We can see that payday loans are really meant for low income earners, and this is why, at this point, I want to talk about poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When someone needs to borrow at a high rate from this payday lending industry in order to make it to the end of the month or the end of the week, the reason is that the person is poor in Canada. The most recent Statistics Canada figures, from the year 2000, tell us that there are 1.3 million more poor households in Canada than there were 25 years ago. So the poverty rate among the working population, among people who earn low wages and who will have to do business with this payday lending industry, has gone up. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poverty is rising among the working population. There are poor families, and poor children, in Canada. The most alarming increase in the poverty rate for families has occurred in young families where the head of household is between 25 and 34 years old. We also see that in 1997, 56% of families headed by a single mother were living in poverty, and they accounted for 43% of poor children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are seeing is rising poverty. We are going to try to deal with it by legislating, and this may be legitimate, but the fact remains that what we have seen during that time is that single-parent families, aboriginal people, people with disabilities, members of visible minorities and people with little education are the poorest people in our society. At the same time, the government is cutting funds for literacy training, social housing, the status of women—all measures that are genuinely going to help people deal with what lies at the heart of the problem. It seems to me that we cannot legislate to deal with only one aspect of the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the Criminal Code did not include a definition of payday loan. Nonetheless, it is important that we find a way of solving the problems of poverty in a more comprehensive manner, not going at them piecemeal with a bill like this. According to the federal government, a payday loan is defined as: </div>
    </p><a name="Para215126"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—a short-term loan for a relatively small amount, to be repaid at the time of the borrower's next payday.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para215127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, which falls under the responsibility of the Department of Finance, indicates that it is possible to borrow via a payday loan. This is limited to 30%. I see this amount of 30% on a paycheque after the various deductions and income tax. It is often said that a family should not spend more than 30% of its income on accommodation. This leads to a very problematic situation in which payday lenders will ask their clients to give them a post-dated cheque or pre-authorized withdrawal directly from a bank account, and will add various fixed service charges as well as interest. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a downward spiral that is difficult to stop for these less fortunate families, who, I would remind the House, are becoming even more impoverished. Certainly, more prosperous people do not resort to these lending agencies. They are more likely to go to their bank or credit union, as is the case in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec has its Consumer Protection Act. Payday lenders were once numerous in Quebec but the consumer protection bureau decided to intervene. After that, the combined efforts of the police and the consumer protection bureau all but eliminated that industry within our territory. Furthermore, the Consumer Protection Act contains strict provisions to regulate the entire lending industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we see that opinions are divided on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A>. The Quebec government shares the Bloc Québécois' concerns because we see that, under this bill, any provinces can be granted an exemption by the federal government under certain conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that by placing conditions on exemptions, the federal government is interfering in one of Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. Indeed, Quebec is already regulating this industry, without having to account to the federal government. The maximum interest rate is set at 35% in Quebec, which is far less than the 60% in the Criminal Code. In addition, with its designation provision, the federal government is reserving the right to veto the measures taken by the province that requests the exemption. Although the mechanism for granting the designation is still unclear, it appears that ultimately, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> will determine whether or not to grant the designation. Such a veto, in an area under Quebec's and the provinces' jurisdiction, seems inappropriate to us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remind my colleagues in this House that Quebec does not always welcome vetoes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is therefore opposed to the principle of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26.</A> However, the Bloc Québécois feels that although the federal government has the authority to include in the Criminal Code a maximum interest rate beyond which it becomes illegal to lend money, it does not have the authority to regulate industry trade practices. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government does not need to decide to implement a licensing system or judge the merits of how Quebec and the provinces regulate the practices of this sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, Quebec is free to regulate the trade practices of the companies under its jurisdiction, and the federal government does not need to impose a veto for the legislation to apply. Despite the Conservatives openness and respect during the election campaign, the fact is that the Harper government is carrying on the federal tradition of interfering in the jurisdictions of—</div>

The present Criminal Code provides a maximum limit in the 60% range as the amount of interest that can be charged. The amounts of the loans are very small and these companies have to cover their administrative costs, registration and so on, but even charging $10 for one month on a loan of $200 is way over that limit. This bill would permit the provinces to regulate that and ensure there was no abuse of it. However, it still would allow these businesses, which do perform a valuable service, to carry on with their business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many firms do this. I received a little thing in the mail a couple of days ago from a retailer I will not identify, indicating that there would be no interest until next year. However, written in small letters underneath, it said a $15 service charge would apply. If we compute that as a rate of interest, it increases it considerably, although it is not called interest. This also needs to be regulated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gently correct the member to ensure that what she is talking about vis-à-vis this bill is accurate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our respective provinces, companies clearly sell furniture by saying there will be no interest for one year. However, something else is going on.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said, it is not that we are opposed to an interest rate limit at the outer edges of what working people can afford when they have to deal with payday lenders.

    </p><a name="Para215151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member was talking about 60% interest. If someone borrows $200 at 60% interest—interest rates are always calculated on an annual basis—that amounts to $120. If we divide that by 12, it is $10. For a loan of $200, an individual would pay $10 dollars interest per month. That does not seem exorbitant, but when you make the calculation the rate of interest is 60%. Unfortunately for those lenders, it is possible that $10 per month may not cover the administration costs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That means that, strictly in terms of the profitability of such a service to the public—if it can be called that—the rate of interest would have to be even more exorbitant. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I ask my colleague whether, given the conditions relating to the operation of such a business, we should not simply forget all that and create a bank for small loans and in doing so introduce regulations that better protect consumers? </div>

    </p><a name="Para215155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a family with a very low income needs to borrow a sum as small as $280, it is certain that an additional $10 will perhaps make the difference and enable the family, at the end of the month, to have had the food that they needed. It is not unusual to see this in the poorest families. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that there is a need for companies like these should lead us to ask why there are still poor children and poor families in Canada, when we have been promised so often that there would be no more. I believe that more and more people are being locked into poverty, in a spiral from which they can never escape. They are never able to pay all those charges. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill also makes me think that these companies could also profit from people who are compulsive gamblers, for example. Will those people go to these companies and become caught up in the spiral? We must be very careful and try to understand why these companies exist and how we could try to improve the economic situation of families in Canada. </div>

In other words, the in the case of Quebec, it will continue. In the case of other provinces, they regulate this industry on behalf of their own residents. I think there should be no objection from the members of the Bloc on this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I think it is fair to say that these people, instead of having a bank account, will go to one of these short term financial institutions and they will be willing to pay $10 if they can get their short term loan and pay it back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to just do the math because I had not done it before. If we pay a $10 charge on a $200 loan for 30 days and if we call it interest, it works out very close to 60%. The question is this. Is it really fair to call that interest? As in all cases, there is an administrative component to this that must be covered. If these firms were not permitted to charge that $10 fee, then they would be unable to provide the service and those who want that service would then be deprived of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of the bill is to allow those firms to conduct their business on behalf of those who demand that service.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past in other speeches I have shared the unfortunate and harsh reality that my riding is the poorest riding in Canada. Whether it is measured by average family income or incidence of poverty, Winnipeg Centre is the poorest riding in the country. I bet dollars to doughnuts it has the highest concentration of these exploitative payday loan outfits because they prey on the misery of the poor. They exist solely to take advantage of low income people, desperate people. These people go from the day's drudgery to the evening's despair. They cannot make the end of the week on their meagre earnings, whether it is their paycheque or their social assistance cheque.

Every little strip mall that has a vacancy in our ridings is occupied immediately by another one of these payday loan outfits, be it Paymax, The Cash Store or Money Mart. All these reputable sounding names disguise the fact that they rip people off in epic proportions and in complete violation of section 347 of the Criminal Code. For the benefit of Canadians, this section states very clearly that to charge interest at a rate greater than 60% per annum is not allowed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That provision was put there for a reason. Some of us would argue that 60% per annum is too much, that there is no justification for charging this kind of interest rate. I think the interest rate charged on my Visa is criminal, but it is legal. Visa, at 18%, may make us angry, but these guys, who set up shop to deliberately undermine the law by charging rates of interest that are easily within the realm of criminality, should be condemned, not accommodated by the bill. I call them bloodsuckers and leaches. I call them a scourge on the inner city of Winnipeg for cheating and deliberately exploiting poor people by design.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at who is doing this and how much money they are making. Where else can people get 1,000% return on their investment? A person would be pretty happy in today's stock market to be making 8%, 10% or 12% interest. In the good old days some IPO in the high tech sector could make 20% per annum interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These outfits are making 1,000%, 2,000%, 5,000%, 10,000% interest per annum. One example, investigated by the attorney general of Manitoba, found one cash store was making 10,000% interest, if all the surcharges and service charges are called part of the interest. For the purposes of the law, all those charges end up with net effect of interest at 10,000%. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215172"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen branches of the five charter banks in my riding have left since I have been a member of Parliament. I know that 13 or 14 have left the riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78332,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78332&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg North</A>, represented by my NDP colleague who is not here today. That is almost 30 branches of inner city ridings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, I will not point out whether my colleague is here or not today. I am actually delivering this speech on behalf of my colleague, the finance critic for the NDP, so people can draw their own conclusions as to whether she is here or not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that roughly 30 branches of chartered banks have left, a flight of capital, leaving no financial services in their wake. People do not know that the charter banks have obligations. The charter banks of Canada were given the exclusive rights and privileges to certain very lucrative financial transactions, such as credit card statements, cheque cashing, et cetera, in exchange for providing basic service to Canadians, even when sometimes it is not the most profitable thing in the world to give ma and pa their little mortgage in downtown Winnipeg, even when it is not that profitable to allow people to open bank accounts to cash cheques even when they only have $100.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the banks have an obligation and a duty. If the charter banks are not willing to live up to their end of the bargain, we should tear up their charter, throw the industry wide open to foreign banks and see how they like it then. That is what they have done in some other countries when the charter banks got too big for their britches. We would not have this problem in the inner city of Winnipeg and other major Canadian cities if the banks were doing their job by providing basic financial services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, the people who I know, the low income people in the inner city of Winnipeg, have no alternative, nowhere else to go to cash their cheques. They actually sport their Money Mart card, which is, frankly, a licence to be robbed, as one of their main pieces of identification. I have used the phrase before that villainy wears many masks, none so treacherous as the mask of virtue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Money Mart stores are trying to portray themselves as providing a necessary service. They set up brightly lit, friendly looking stores, are courteous to the low income people who walk in and they issue important looking cards that are not even credit cards but just ID cards for the Money Marts. People carry them around with some pride because the banks will not talk to them, aside from the fact banks are nowhere to be found. People do not have bank accounts but they do have Money Mart cards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never been able to calculate the amount of money that gets sucked out of my riding every month by these thieves. I will call them thieves, at least until such time as the Criminal Code is changed to where we allow greater than 60% interest to be charged. They are involved in illegal activity and we are accommodating them with this bill. Instead of correcting the problem, the bill actually says that we will not stop this runaway roller coaster so we had better change the law to make it legal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least we are ceding the jurisdiction to the provinces so they can hopefully put in place some enabling legislation to control and contain the extent of the problem because the extent of the problem is horrific. These outfits are sprouting up like poisonous mushrooms on every street corner, if I can be forgiven for extending that analogy, because their corporate greed is responsible for a sum total of human misery on the streets of the inner city of Winnipeg that I do not think we can measure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very fact that people cannot make ends meet on their meagre paycheques and are forced to obtain one of these payday loans already means they are in some form of financial crisis. It is not the people we see on the TV ads, well dressed, middle class people driving their cars up to the Money Mart because they are $100 short on this month's paycheque. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way these outfits are structured, people's problems are compounded. Their misery is only starting with the first loan because if they are a day late on that loan, they offer a rollover loan at an even higher rate of interest and more service charges. These companies suck people in and roll the money over until people have reached a level of debt that they can never get out of.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are other things that these outfits do. It is common practice to have people voluntarily sign a permit so their future wages can be garnished, never mind going through the courts. If somebody owes a great deal of money, sometimes companies need to apply to the courts to garnish someone's wages. However, payday companies make people sign this away at the front end. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies will make people put up property, if they have it, as collateral even for a couple of hundred dollar loan, which seems ridiculous, except that they know how fast a $200 loan spirals out of control to where all of a sudden it is not so ridiculous to have a house as collateral for that loan because the loan is not $200 for very long. Cars and boats are not unusual personal guarantees. Sometimes people need to sign away their right to any kind of arbitration or to the services of a credit manager.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies have not only figured out how to charge 1,000% or 2,000% interest, they have figured out ways to preclude the ordinary rights that people might have if they run into credit difficulty to get out from under it. In other words, they own people. Loansharking seems kind compared to these payday loans. I kind of pine for the days when it was just Luigi the leg-breaker who would take care of things. These guys are far more sinister, far more organized, far more corrupt and far more criminal. The leg-breaking that used to go on if people borrowed money at the pool hall, we would probably look forward to that compared to the hold that these companies have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is criminal behaviour. It is organized crime. There are chains of these companies, in effect, breaking the law systematically, the very definition of organized crime. Our reaction as a government, unfortunately, is to accommodate them and to pass legislation to allow these companies to charge more than 60% per annum. It does not say that they can charge 2,000% or 10,000% per annum as in the most extreme case that we have come across, but to accommodate them in any way is offensive to the sensibilities of any decent Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should make us angry. It should make Canadians angry that the best thing we can think of to do when faced with this organized wholesale criminal activity is to accommodate them when we should be looking at our financial institutions to look at the root cause of the problem, which is abandonment by the charter banks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charter banks have packed up their tent and left, not because these branches in the inner city were not profitable, but because they were not profitable enough. Because their branch in the suburbs made more money than the branch in the inner city, they put an addition on the branch in the suburb and told their customers in the inner city to take a bus out to that branch. They closed 15 branches in my riding alone in the inner city of Winnipeg. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is abandonment. It is a vote of non-confidence. It would not bother me if these were independent private businesses because it is their right to pack up and leave. However, these are charter banks. They exist and enjoy their exclusive monopolies at the pleasure of the House of Commons and the Government of Canada. Has nobody tried to remind the financial institutions of their obligations in recent years? They are making record profits quarter after quarter. They cannot count their money. They are like Scrooge McDuck sitting on piles of money that they cannot even imagine their good fortune and yet they are derelict of their duties and leaving the people I represent vulnerable to rip-offs like the payday loan industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payday loan industry even has an association now, which is how they are striving for legitimacy. Can anyone guess who the executive director of the Payday Loan Association of Canada is?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin:</b> No it ain't no New Democrat. It is a former Liberal cabinet minister from Hamilton, I believe by the name of Stan Keyes. Stan Keyes has now seen fit to represent these guys. I do not know what could possibly be his thought process to think that would be okay. Even his wife gave him heck. In this newspaper article it says that when he first told his wife that he was serious about taking on the job as the head of the Payday Loan Association of Canada, his wife asked him if he really wanted to do that. She wanted to know what he was doing to his reputation as a respectable stand up guy, working for those shysters.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> The Liberal Party of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin:</b> No, not the Liberal Party of Canada. He has moved from the Liberal Party of Canada to the head of the Canadian Payday Loan Association. I do not know what the connection is but maybe this explains why, after years of complaining to the Liberal government that these rip-offs were running roughshod over the law and exploiting the people I represent, it chose to do absolutely nothing year after year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went directly to ministers of industry on this very issue looking for satisfaction on this. In fact, I pigeonholed one minister in Manitoba when she was visiting my province. We had our minister of consumer and corporate affairs and we had the federal minister of industry there. I told them both that it was an emergency, a crisis, and that they had to do something. That was years ago, probably 2002 or 2003, and nothing was done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Province of Manitoba has been trying to pass its own legislation to stop these guys but it does not have the jurisdiction to do so. It is a federal matter. Now we have the federal government at least paying deference to the extent of the problem and introducing legislation that hopefully we can segue into some satisfaction for the people I represent, although it will still be up to individual provinces to say how tough each one chooses to get. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am here to say that the payday loan industry is out of control. They are a bunch of crooks. They are a bunch of gangsters painted up as honourable citizens but there is nothing honourable about their industry. They are cheats and they are cheating Canadians as we speak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheer number of them shows us how profitable this is, but, as I said in my opening remarks, where else can people get 1,000% interest? Where else can people get that rate of return? No one can make that kind of investment. I do not think that much money is made selling coke, and I mean cocaine not Coca-Cola. I do not think anyone makes that much money dealing dope. It is irresistible. I do not think anyone can make that much money in prostitution or any of the other traditional rackets. This is a racket to end all rackets and we are actually accommodating them and finding a way to make it legal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is not investing in payday loans. They do not have any ethical investment standards whatsoever. They have no ethical screen. In fact, I think we could argue that the Canada pension plan is obligated to invest in the payday loan industry because its very founding trust document says that the only consideration shall be the maximum rate of return. There are no ethical standards: child labour, polluting the St. Clair River, it does not matter. Our pension plan has to invest in them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand I am running short of time, but I raise that as an aside. I do not want our Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to invest in payday loans. I want to stamp payday loan companies out of existence. They should be squashed like a grape under the heel of Parliament for the offence that they have committed against the Canadian people. They do not deserve to breathe the same air as the good people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A>. They do not deserve to occupy store space. They do not deserve to put up billboards and buy advertising space. They should be run out of business. They should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail. That would be the only suitable way to treat the payday loan industry.</div>

It certainly was not my intention, but under section 347 of the Criminal Code dealing with usury, which is what the term is when a rate of interest is charged which is higher than that allowed by law, there has been only one charge in recent years. It was the province of Manitoba that levied the charge against the company and it is still tied up in endless appeals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned that there has been a lack of enforcement, which should not be a matter for politics or the political realm, but for some reason, I suppose, there has been no confidence that we can make these charges stick. Without legislation that accurately reflects the reality of what is going on in the marketplace, and without a modern, efficient language, we are not going to be able to make those charges stick.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague's point is well taken. We need to modernize the Criminal Code so that it at least bears some resemblance to what is actually going on out there in modern-day Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fairly recent innovation and it takes evil people to exploit it. I do not know how they devise these schemes, but bad people stumble across these opportunities and exploit them. They research them. They do not just look for loopholes. They look for poorly enforced clauses of the Criminal Code. That is what has happened. It is against the law to charge 2,000% interest, but these people had the temerity to try. When they did not get busted, more people were motivated to try, and then more and more. Word spread like wildfire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one is of the human nature of that sort, who would willingly exploit people and capitalize on human misery, this is a golden opportunity. If one is that kind of person and is that low as a human being, the Government of Canada and our criminal justice system apparently are not going to interfere, because we have appealed to the government. We have tried. We have begged. We brought it to the highest level and nobody seemed willing to interfere with what these guys were up to.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember many years ago when I had an NDP friend that I worked with. We had a debate on how to help poor people. During that debate, out of the blue I asked him how much he had given to charity in the last year. He said, “Nothing. It's not my responsibility”. But he believed strongly in the government covering everything. I said, “I guess there's the difference, because I give a lot of money to charity and to individuals I see in need because I believe in that”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend right now in the city of Edmonton, with whom I am working and who is in a bad financial situation. He recently got a cheque. It was not a large cheque. He needed to cash it and I asked him why he did not have a bank account. I told him that he could open a bank account, that the bank would open one for him and I would go with him and help him and he could cash that cheque for nothing. He said, “No. I can't be bothered”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we pass a law that forces these people to have a bank account? I do not know if we should. Perhaps we should.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, he asked me to please stop and he went into one of those instant loan places to cash his cheque. I think they charged him $2 to cash a $200 cheque. There was no interest involved because he did not take out a loan. He had a cheque. It was a $2 charge to cash the cheque. If I go to a bank, I also am charged to cash a cheque because the bank is giving me a service.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the member to stop and think about it. Perhaps these small financial institutions that cater to the small user are providing a valuable service to those people for what is a reasonable absolute charge, but if we compute it into an interest rate it becomes usurious, which is of course the issue in the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are not criminals. They are providing a low level service for a relatively low amount of fees, but when we convert it to an interest rate, which is unjustified in this place, then I think we can get very confused on the issue. I appreciate the heart this member has, but I would urge him to reconsider his vitriolic attack on these people.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come back to the idea about banks not living up to their duty and obligation to provide basic general services to all Canadians as an aspect of their being granted a charter, as are chartered banks. A lot of people do not know their banking rights. Low income people often do not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bank cannot turn down people who want to open a bank account even if they do not have a single dollar. Even if they do not have any money but just want to open a bank account to establish a relationship with that bank for future cheque cashing, for instance, a bank cannot turn them away as long as they have a piece of ID. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe people do not know their banking rights. There has been very little effort on the part of banking institutions to make sure people know their rights, because these are considered nuisance services. An individual might be charged $1.50 in service charges, but probably that does not even pay for the administration costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should know their banking rights. The Government of Canada has a role to play in reminding banks that they have this duty and an obligation, not just in the inner city of Winnipeg but in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, or in some small towns that are losing their bank branches too.</div>

    </p><a name="Para215232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that ministers responsible for financial institutions should have been seized of this issue in recent years because this duty very conveniently seems to have been collectively forgotten by the banks.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could correct my colleague from Edmonton, these institutions are not charging just $1.50 to cash a cheque; sometimes it is 3%, 4% and 5% of the amount of the cheque. I am not saying this is so in every case, but we know of examples where it is that high. That is an absolute rip-off. Nothing is supposed to be charged for cashing a government cheque, period. It is supposed to be a service available to Canadians. If a customer establishes a relationship with a bank and needs an extra $100 one week, he or she could do an overdraft and the service charge would be 1% or 2%. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill amends the Criminal Code to allow for the regulation of the payday lending industry by the provinces and territories. This is a major change which is well received. For years, the payday lending industry was able to operate unnoticed in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will subject this prosperous sector to regulation and offer greater protection to millions of Canadians and their families who have come to depend on this kind of service. According to the leading industry lobby, namely the Canadian Payday Loan Association, this sector services nearly two million Canadians a year. This is a pretty large number, hence the importance of ensuring that Canadians are well protected against harmful practices in that industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passing of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> would first amend the Criminal Code by adding a new provision, namely subsection 347.1, which would exempt payday lenders from the provisions on criminal interest rates where provincial and territorial legislative measures protect consumers in this regard. It would then add a definition of “payday loan”. Finally it would require the provinces to set a limit on the total cost of this type of loan in their legislative measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before examining the content of these amendments, I shall provide a few clarifications on two points. First some background on the payday loan industry in Canada, including its effects on communities across the country, and, second, its debatable practices, which motivated us to take action and propose the amendments before us today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they know more about this industry, I am convinced that all the members will agree that the measures put forward in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> are pragmatic, balanced and necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The payday loan industry is relatively new in Canada. These convenient establishments with catchy names began to appear here about 1994. The industry began in the West, but today it has spread throughout Canada. In fact there are about 1,350 of these establishments in all Canadian provinces and cities, except in Quebec, and they continue to increase in number. Some 2 million Canadians use these services, borrowing close to $1.7 billion a year. This is an astounding amount when we know that all this activity takes place in an market that is basically unregulated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These figures show that the payday loan industry meets a real demand by Canadians. According to some, this industry has no place in Canada. On the other hand, it obviously plays an important role in the lives of many Canadians. There are several reasons to explain why our fellow citizens turn to the services of a payday lender. Convenience is one of them, since many of these businesses stay open late and on weekends. Also, some people think that the popularity of this sector may be attributed to the fact that the country’s large financial institutions have closed their smaller branches, leaving a void among services providing quick and easy withdrawal of funds in many communities. There is also the fact that this service is relatively anonymous and emergencies can occur, with immediate financial consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, this industry seems to have its place in our communities. So it is important that we provide adequate protection from certain abusive commercial practices to the Canadians who use payday loan services, especially the most vulnerable people in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government takes its responsibility for improving the lives of Canadians and their families very seriously and is taking a number of important measures to do just that. Whether it be by strengthening the Criminal Code to make our streets and communities safer or by reducing taxes for our fellow citizens, we are committed to taking effective action such as what we are proposing in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The measures proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> are a careful and effective way of improving consumer protection and meeting the need that has been expressed by various people, including the provinces and territories, for effective regulation of this industry. There are three good reasons for doing this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payday loans are very expensive. In some cases, the annual cost of a loan from a payday lender can be very high, because of the interest, which is charged at a rate that is sometimes several thousand or more. It also seems that the contract clauses are not clearly disclosed by these lenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aggressive collection methods also create problems, as does the speed with which the amount of these debts can grow out of control when they are renewed. In some cases, payday lenders even penalize a borrower who pays the loan before the due date, by charging fees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all these reasons, it should be very clear to all members that there is strong justification for taking action. The changes proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> will ensure that the practices of this industry are effectively regulated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we looked for the most appropriate way of dealing with this pressing public policy issue, we also worked very closely with our colleagues in the provinces and territories. We gradually realized that section 347 of the Criminal Code was going to be the linchpin of the new rules.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 347, everyone who enters into an agreement or arrangement to receive interest at an annual rate that exceeds 60%, which is a criminal rate of interest, is guilty of an offence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who are convicted of that offence are liable to imprisonment for up to five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When section 347 of the Criminal Code was first enacted, its purpose was not to protect consumers. Rather, its aim was to give the police another weapon for fighting organized crime, and more specifically loan-sharking. Whatever the intent of Parliament was at that time, this section applies to loan agreements entered into in Canada, including payday loans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would note, however, that the government does not believe that section 347 of the Criminal Code is the most appropriate and effective instrument for protecting consumers from the unethical and unscrupulous practices that have been observed in some segments of the payday loan industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not the only ones who think that way. Many administrations and several groups in civil society have told us that section 347 is not suited to consumer protection. What is more, these same administrations have told us that the application of section 347 to payday loans presented an obstacle to the adoption of effective provincial regulations. As a consequence, the proposed amendments respond to the needs of the provinces and territories, who are the best placed to provide the required protection to consumers by exempting cases where provinces choose to intervene from the application of section 347. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, section 347 continues to apply in those cases where the provinces do not intervene. We consider this to be an appropriate solution that enables the provinces and territories that are prepared to regulate the industry to do so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to point out that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> will not apply to financial institutions that are regulated by the federal government, such as banks. Under the Constitution of Canada, banks fall under federal jurisdiction and their operation is subject to a number of federal laws. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By and large, the proposed amendments would exempt payday lenders from the application of section 347 of the Criminal Code in very specific and well defined cases. That exemption would be provided under a new section, section 347.1 of the Criminal Code. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645">(1645)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a study, the amount generally loaned in the case of a payday loan is never very high—less than $300—and the duration of the loan is generally short—about 10 days. To be eligible, the borrower must prove that he or she has a bank account and provide a post-dated cheque or pre-authorized debit. The borrower must also provide proof of a source of income. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> describes a payday loan as follows: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This definition is important because it clearly describes the kind of agreement behind payday loans. The proposed changes have a very specific purpose. We want to ensure that provinces and territories are able to regulate payday loans in their jurisdictions. We also want to ensure that only payday loan agreements are covered. We are doing this because the public policy issues raised by other kinds of credit are very different. I think that the definition provided in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> describes payday loans very well. </div>

The loan cannot be for more than $1,500 and for any longer than 62 days. These limits reflect the maximum limits on payday loans described earlier. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill does not propose any regulations per se, not does it set a national limit on payday loan interest rates. What it does instead, in creating an exemption to the application of section 347, is to meet the needs of the provinces, who want to see the obstacles to the regulation of this industry removed. This is important because it is the provinces and territories that are best placed to regulate the payday loan industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ultimate purpose of the proposed changes is the effective regulation of the industry. The best way to achieve this goal is to give the provinces and territories the flexibility they need to set limits on the cost of loans. Thanks to this approach, the regulations that are adopted will be well suited to the specific situations facing the different provinces and territories. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill also provides that section 347 will continue to apply in those provinces and territories that elect not to pass legislation governing the payday loan industry. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a province or territory has made the decision that payday lenders operating within that province or territory are to be exempt from the application of section 347 of the Criminal Code, it will have to apply to be designated for that purpose by the federal government. In order to be exempted, it will have to show that it has adopted legislative measures that protect anyone who wants to take out a payday loan. What those consumer protection measures are will be left virtually entirely to the discretion of the provinces and territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a valid approach in that it recognizes the nature of the situation in each jurisdiction, including, specifically, the way that the industry operates there, and also the existing provincial consumer protection legislation adopted under the powers assigned to the provinces by the Constitution in relation to property and civil rights. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> requires, however, that the province provide for limits on the total cost of payday loans in its legislative measures. I believe that this approach reflects three fundamental factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the provinces and territories are capable of controlling the cost of loans within their jurisdictions. Second, this guarantees that there will be a limit on the cost of borrowing. And third, as we saw earlier, it offers a flexible solution that can be adapted to the characteristics of each province and territory.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Governor in Council will make the necessary assessment before granting a province or territory the designation applied for. The province will apply to the federal Minister of Justice, stating the legislative measures it has taken to control the cost of loans. Then, on the recommendation of the federal Minister of Industry, the Minister of Justice will ask the Governor in Council to grant the designation applied for. The province will then be given the power to exempt a payday lender, by licence or otherwise, from the application of section 347.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, I believe that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> is very important. It offers Canadians greater protection by allowing the provinces and territories to regulate an industry that is in great need of oversight. It sets very clear limits. It defines payday loans and sets a limit of $1,500 for loans that may be made under these rules. It invites the provinces to adopt legislative measures to regulate payday loan agreements, and in particular the total cost of the loans.<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>

The amendments proposed will have an important and real effect on the Canadians who have come to depend on this service. I hope that all members will join me in ensuring the speedy passage of this bill. </div>

I would like to point out that, this year, Mr. Muhammad Yunus received the Nobel Peace Price. He is an economist who established a micro-credit system, with 1,200 micro-credit offices, which today has created jobs for 12,000 individuals. These are small repayable loans made at rates that are probably much lower than 60%.It gives credence to the statement that, and I quote, “Lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people need payday loans and, if for all intents and purposes, micro-credit were available for relatively short periods, would it not be important enough to warrant establishing this system within the banks? They could be asked to play a social role and to loan small amounts. We know quite well that, more and more, banks—all banks—make profits in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, profits often in excess of one billion per year.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary banks have a social responsibility. I ask the member: would it not be better to ensure that banks fulfill their social responsibilities rather than protecting a loan system which, for all intents and purposes, is usurious?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, we have a financial system that was implemented by institutions and designed with a view to protecting consumers through a consumer protection network.

    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para215302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is in fact designed to regulate the payday lending industry. This will be done by limiting the interest rates lenders can charge Canadians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para215303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite pleased as well to see that the minority government is taking advantage of the hard work done by previous Liberal ministers of industry and justice. In introducing this bill, it surely gives a sign that what we were doing before was just fine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is flattering to see Canada's new government actually putting forward many bills that were in the past proposed by Liberals. Despite what my colleagues on the other side of the House may be saying, they are acting as if what was done before was going in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the previous Liberal government that worked with our provincial and territorial colleagues to build the consensus necessary for the legislation that we are discussing today. Currently, section 347 of the Criminal Code of Canada makes it an offence to enter into an agreement or arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate or to receive a payment that is at a criminal rate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that section 347 was introduced initially to deal with the practice of loansharking and its links to organized crime. It was not always the written signed agreement under the shiny lights on the main streets of our cities that these arrangements were entered into, but often in the back alleys and through very informal discussions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although section 347 has been interpreted as applying to most lending arrangements in Canada, including payday lending, it was not intended to be consumer protection legislation or a consumer protection tool for economic price regulation when it was first introduced. It would seem that section 347 was attempting to capture criminals who looked like criminals and not criminals who look like storefront entries as many of the payday lending institutions of today's currency do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness, the Canadian Payday Loan Association itself, unlike the characterization of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A> that would have us believe is made up totally of criminals, is in fact proposing this legislation which will be of benefit to consumers and the people we represent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us look at the scourge of the bad payday lending experience and what it has visited upon our citizens. In British Columbia a judge ruled in a class action that a payday loan company charged criminal interest rates when it included its late fees and processing fees as interest. That is what the court ruled. The ruling is expected to influence the outcome of many decisions. It is an instance of where the judiciary has stepped in to characterize as interest what may be seen as fees and thereby impinging some payday loan arrangements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in Ottawa, a small claims court judge ruled that two payday loan companies suing clients for unpaid debts, this is ironic, were themselves avoiding the law and breaking the law. The facts as they came out were that a loan of $280 rose with interest and penalties to $551 per month. That is an annualized interest rate of more than 2,000% and these people had the temerity to bring it to court to get their money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge could not rule that it was in violation of the law because that was not the dispute in front of the court, but it shows the boldness and frankly, the arrogance of some payday lenders in charging that amount of interest and standing by it as if it were not more than 60% which is clearly set out in the Criminal Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> would not put an end to payday loans. The industry could easily continue to operate, but it is going to operate with controls. It is important to note that the legislation does not apply to loans over a certain amount, $1,500 and over a certain length, 62 days. This act does not replace the Criminal Code. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a principal theme of our discussions today on this bill must address the paucity in the Criminal Code itself to deal with the crime. So anything that is over 62 days that is over 60% ought to be prosecuted.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710">(1710)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In studying the bill, we have learned that there are very few prosecutions. It is time for the government to take this information, as if it did not know it before, and tell the administration of justice officials, both federally and provincially, that we have a section called 347 and it should be enforced. If it is true, but we do not know because we have not had a full hearing on section 347, that only a prosecution or two have been made under this section in the last few years, something has to be done about that. The bill will not cure any of the in excess of 60% in loans that are longer and larger in duration than what it attempts to cover. However, it is a start, it is good legislation and we should support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means, however, that the provinces and territories have to get their acts together. I am very hopeful that the new federal government has kept good relations with all the provincial counterparts and has, like we did before, an easy discourse of opinion on how to best influence reasonable rates, like the province of Quebec has administered for some time under its consumer protection legislation.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para215316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several provinces, including New Brunswick, have already announced their intention to regulate payday lending once this bill is passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the new Liberal government in New Brunswick will address that situation as soon as this is done.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para215318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know T.J. Burke, the new attorney general for the province of New Brunswick. He is the first aboriginal attorney general in Canada, and he is an excellent law official. Once this legislation passes, I know he will be looking to the models across the country, specifically the model in Quebec, which seems to give to our citizens the best consumer protection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payday lending is a growing industry in Canada. Virtually non-existent in 1994, the industry is believed to have grown to more than 1,300 outlets in just 10 years. That is why perhaps this law is just coming to us now. We probably all saw the industry grow, but empirically did not know that 1,300 outlets existed across Canada. Nor would we know, if we are not users of the services, what horror they are inflicting on our citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of payday loan outlets now outrank the number of offices of the Royal Bank of Canada. Therefore, it is important to underline that this is not just a Main Street, Stellarton, one-off issue. The bill is dealing with a Canadian issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 850 or so of these institutions are represented by the Payday Loan Association. They have been very forthcoming in lobbying for a bill to protect consumers. I would suggest to go halfway to also ensure that they have an existence after the passage of the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we may consider, as the bill travels along the process to committee, whether we will strengthen the legislation and attempt to affect and to curb the impact of usury on our citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot say this strongly enough. While VISA cards regularly get 28%, the province of Quebec has chosen 35% as a ceiling interest rate. I cannot say strongly enough how we, as parliamentarians, in the moral persuasive stance that we have with provinces and territories, might suggest that the Quebec model is a good model for the citizens who we share as electors.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para215324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant growth of this sector is actually hiding the dire situation facing many Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, holding a full time job was enough to support one's family. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case anymore. Times have changed. Many Canadians work full time, and some even work more than one job, but that is still not enough to support their families financially. There lies the real tragedy.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para215326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are doing just a bit to help the working poor in this situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a former member of an Open Hands Food Bank organization in Moncton, New Brunswick, food banks are no longer visited by the very poor and destitute only. They are often visited by the working poor, people who work as a couple with minimum wage jobs, people who need to have two minimum wage jobs, people who have children or people who have a letdown in hours at the video store, one of their minimum wage jobs. This means they are forced to go to the food bank or, as I say, le vrai drame, to the Money Mart, to get a loan at a high interest rate to pay the rent, to have groceries and to ensure their children can go to school.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it make sense to borrow money from someone who is going to charge an outrageous interest rate? Of course not. The fact is, however, an increasing number of Canadians have no choice. They have generally been turned down for loans at the chartered banks and other financial institutions. Although many of them have full time jobs and a steady source of revenue, many have no choice but to go for the short term, high interest rate loans to survive between pay cheques.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real tragedy is that in 2006 working hard and having a job might not be enough to support one's family. I find it troubling that more and more Canadians cannot meet their everyday living costs. In recent years many social groups have pointed out that the number of citizens living under the poverty line is growing and that having a full time job does not necessarily protect one from poverty in today's world. This is very unfortunate, something that is compounded by the fact that if a person goes in to borrow $280, that somehow turns into a $551 per month payment. We are doing something, but very little to help that problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we say the bill is good, what about the social safety net that the new government is putting out for the people who are left to have 60% interest loans, from the legal Money Marts, for 62 days for amounts under $1,500?</div>
    </p><a name="Para215331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not over blow what step this small bill is toward the journey of helping us help the working poor. If we combine the statistics of the working poor, the increased usage of our social service agencies, with the major cuts that the Conservative government announced three weeks ago, it is now clear the new government does not care about those most in need, the poorest citizens and the minorities throughout our country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us face it, the Conservatives are leaving the most vulnerable behind. A true national child care program, aboriginal health initiatives, literacy funding, homelessness, affordable housing initiatives, these were all mechanisms to help low income families, they very people who are most victimized by the ravages of the Payday Loan Association members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the measures I suggested have been cut and cramped in the recent Conservative announcements, such as national child care, teaching children how to succeed in life, literacy, teaching children and adults that they can read and they can get better jobs, tackling the homeless initiative, which was once made a very national and prominent program under the former member for Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, the hon. Claudette Bradshaw, are all gone as priorities in the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the government will do some lip service to the Payday Loan Association, mainly because it is a good lobby and it might get some credit for helping the working poor, it is really saying it will not go that far and reinstitute programs, which were of national importance for eradicating the spectre of cyclical use of social services and organizations, such as payday loan institutions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same low income family that works hard to survive but cannot afford to put money aside for rainy days is forced to live from paycheque to paycheque. Exactly the same people are being denied loans from banks and they end up at the payday loan services, probably just before or after they go to the food banks. Before having to do this, they probably had time in their day to get some literacy training, or they may have been able to access some child care initiatives. However, they are not going to be any better off with the Conservative government as the years go by.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720">(1720)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real point is that this is a good step in a long road. The Conservative government must understand it entails much more than just initializing a law that was started by a former government, which is a needle in a haystack with respect to the battle against poverty, especially among the working poor.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para215337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will ensure that those who turn to payday lenders do not fall victim to questionable practices, criminal interest rates and unfair collection techniques. More importantly, it will help make sure that they are not sucked into the vicious circle of debt and outstanding loans.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2368473,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2368473&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> is a positive, necessary step in the right direction and it battles loansharking, but it does not do enough at this point. The House should encourage all provinces and territories to look at the model is the model of Quebec. I hope this will happen at the committee stage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move along the legislative process, we find that many of our models for a just and fair society have come from the province of Quebec. Programs like the national child care program and the legislation for consumer protection are best modelled in Quebec. In our discussion we should encourage the provinces to follow those examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister for the province of Manitoba is in the process of deciding how to deal with the brief put forward by the Payday Loan Association. The president of the Payday Loan Association says that Manitoba's proposed law is in line with the code of best business practices adhered to by its members. It operates 800 of the 1,350 payday loan offices in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is not known is the fee cap the province would set. The finance minister, Mr. Selinger, is proposing to make fees and rates on payday loans subject to public review by the local public utilities board. If the Quebec model is not the model provinces choose to follow, by having consumer protection legislation govern the scheme, then the model of having the public utilities board review rates of interest that can be charged by payday loan associations, which survive this document, would be very preferable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem, as the federal sphere, to have gone away from consulting and advising the provinces with respect to best practices, and not necessarily mandated practices. By this I mean giving them a cheque and telling them they must do this or they must do that. Rather do it in a true constitutional sense, as partners that share the same citizens, the people who vote for them vote for us, and suggest they look at the models, which include the Quebec consumer protection legislation and the suggestion of the very wise finance minister in Manitoba of public utility board regulating interest rates. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public utility boards across the country are made up, by and large, of non-partisan people interested in consumer protection in the areas of energy and transportation. In this case, Manitoba would invade the field by suggesting interest rates on short term loans would be properly in the public domain of the public utilities board. In many provinces public insurance is dealt with at a provincial level and the rates of insurance are decided by a public utilities board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is a very good step. It follows on Liberal legislation, which was being thought of before the government fell. It is enough at this point to say we support it. However, at committee perhaps suggestions as to the how, not the why, the bill will play out across the country can be discussed along with our desire as parliamentarians to ensure the bill is implemented in as even a fashion across the country as possible.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member opposite talked about usurious interest rates and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A> before him talked about the way credit card companies are ripping us off.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us take an interest rate of 18%, which is the rate of a typical credit card. I would like to ask the member this. Let us say he was walking down the street and a stranger approached and said, “Will you lend me $100 and a month from now I will give you $101.50, if I happen to show up, with no security?” Would he lend the stranger the money? I suspect he would not. Yet to charge $1.50 on a $100 loan for one month is 18% per annum.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to get away from the idea that the fee charged is a straight interest charge. We know that many short term loans go into default, so the money is gone. These companies do not get the $101.50. They do not get the original $100 back. It is gone. For them to charge a little more because of the risk of the situation I do not think is terribly unreasonable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to charge $2 for a $100 loan for a month hardly covers the cost of the employees and certainly not the cost of the store for which they have to pay rent, utilities, taxes and so on. They are going to charge maybe $2 or $3 for a $100 loan for a month. That is a service they are providing. If we take that away, then our poor people have nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have other questions, Mr. Speaker, but just from your posture of sitting on the edge of the chair I know I have to shut down for now.</div>

In my community, the owner and operator of the Money Mart is not the chamber of commerce president. He is not the Rotarian president. He is not a person in society who symbolizes best business practices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it is a very risky business in terms of loaning money. That is why loan sharks are in it. They like risk but they also have enforcement, and I see no difference between the example of Louie G., posited by my friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A>, who would break a leg, I suppose, if a loan were not repaid, and the owner of the payday loan business, who would basically bankrupt a person into not being able to afford the necessities of life.</div>

This is one of the most progressive bills we have had in the House and I say that even though I am on the government side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would allow producers to come forward and sell their grain directly to any kind of a processing organization that is controlled or owned by producers themselves. We think this is necessary. It is a tremendous advancement for western Canadian farmers. What could be better than producers finally taking their own product and selling it to processing plants in which they can have a share. The producers can value add that way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other farmers across Canada take these kinds of opportunities for granted, but not western Canadian producers because they are prohibited from doing this. This bill would deal with that situation and help them to have the same advantages and opportunities that others do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real disgrace here is that the opposition is, apparently, going to oppose the bill. I do not understand why they would. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78423,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78423&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Malpeque</A> has said that he wants to give farmers a bigger role in the marketplace. This bill would do that. It gives a tremendous opportunity to farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP members seem to have been taken over by the big city unions. They said at one time that they used to represent the little guy but obviously they do not and they are showing that one more time by opposing this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc, unfortunately, has jumped on this bandwagon by mistake. I do not think that party understands the implications of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it is important for western Canadian farmers to have this opportunity. We are certainly calling on the House to support the bill because we think it would finally bring forward some of the value added activities that we need in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if I can stress how important this is to western Canadian farmers, to our small towns and to our cities to have value added plants, to participate in the ownership of those plants and to deliver their product directly to them. It is a shame that we cannot do that right now. I think we are only asking for what everyone else in this country has. We look forward to the time when we will have that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this bill comes to a vote I call on all members of the House to please support it. I beg the opposition members to reconsider their opposition to it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we talked about the flexibility of the Canadian Wheat Board and the fact that the board can adapt as necessary is indicative. One of the three newest initiatives, the delivery exchange contract, will provide farmers with increased flexibility in how they manage their deliveries and their cashflow needs throughout the crop year. The second initiative is a pilot program for marketing organic grain in partnership with the Canadian Organic Certification Co-operative Ltd.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the bill not for what it does, but because of the means used to change the relationship of western grain farmers to the Canadian Wheat Board. Normally we consider private members' bills as free votes in the House but it is my contention, along with many others on this side of the House and other parties, that this is nothing more than a stalking horse for the Conservative government in an ideological vendetta.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will also prove disastrous for ports such as Thunder Bay, the one I represent in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78979,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78979&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</A>, as it will for Churchill, Montreal and even Vancouver, because when it is decided to send the wheat south, what else will go south? Not only will the marine industry, the headquarters and the research capabilities go south, but will the Vancouver grain industry move to Seattle? Likely. Will Winnipeg and all its research and development capabilities move to Minneapolis or St. Paul? Highly likely.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing here is unravelling the thread, essentially condemning western Canada to a demise. We are putting its farmers essentially at the whim of a market where they have to compete against people and corporations international in scope with all the effective marketing skills they have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talked about the dilution of this, it not only affects those ports, but it also affects the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway system and indeed, the internal marine economy of North America. It will certainly have detrimental effects on Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Windsor and Toronto. We can name them as we go down the St. Lawrence Seaway; they will all be affected detrimentally.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to say we can do one thing with the bill, that this is only to affect one part of it, but when it destroys the railway system, when it destroys the producer network, when it destroys the grain elevator system, that will all have a horrendous impact on the Canadian economy. It is interesting to see that some people just do not care what those impacts will be because of their ideological perseverance, but it will hurt and it will hurt big time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the people we represent, in my riding truly the port and the railways are most affected, but so are the grain elevators, the grain companies and the hundreds of people who work there. Western Canada will also be extremely detrimentally affected. I have actual proof from farmers. I have no idea who they are or what their political background is, but it is highly likely that they did not vote for my party in the last election, but they will the next time because of this highly undemocratic way--</div>

The other elements are the leader’s statements, the ministers’ positions and the government’s position within the committees. They all clearly show that this government, without consulting farmers, has put in place a diabolical machine so that the Canadian Wheat Board will disappear or become so unimportant that, for all practical purposes, it will disappear of its own accord. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that attacking the Canadian Wheat Board is a first, extremely dangerous step. The Canadian Wheat Board has existed since 1940 in its form of monopoly. When it is attacked, it is a first step towards further attack, no doubt, on supply management, which serves very well the interests of Quebec and also many parts of the western provinces and Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dismantling of everything that is government intervention is part of a sort of ideology, of a doctrine that is obvious at all levels, in all departments, and particularly in agriculture. Those people, however, got elected by saying they were going to be the big defenders of agriculture.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that all this got started a few years ago when the Conservatives, here in the House, took a stance in favour of 13 people who had sold their wheat directly in the west. They were prosecuted for this. They had not followed the rule that says that everyone has to go through the Canadian Wheat Board. From that time on, the ideological intention to demolish the Canadian Wheat Board was very clear. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canadian Wheat Board, however, has three very clear mandates: providing a sole marketing agency, pooling accounts and guarantees by government when needed. It seems to me that that is why this board is indispensable for ensuring income and service for farmers and making sure their wheat is disposed of in the best possible way. Furthermore this is what the government should be checking with farmers since no vote has been held. It should at least have a democratic consultation. No. Instead, the Conservatives even had the audacity and the nerve to appoint to the Canadian Wheat Board Mr. Motiuk, who is recognized as a passionate defender of choice in marketing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again shows where the government is headed. We can see from the introduction of this private member's bill and this appointment that the government is determined to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. The government has also set up round tables, but with the very neutral objective of laying the groundwork for a dual marketing system. So consultation is not on the agenda, but the government's new direction is, with the result that the Canadian Wheat Board has refused to take part. In other words, board managers were going to take part in a round table where they would be a party to the abolition of their own agency. It was unthinkable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions by the Conservatives, which are becoming more numerous, are unacceptable in a democracy. A vote absolutely must be held for producers, especially since this bill seems to contravene section 47.1 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act, which reads as follows:</div>

    </p><a name="Para215429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first step. Subsequently, there was the Conservative Party's election platform which spoke of the appointment of a pro-choice director—just one more component; the round table, which stated in advance that we must go with a task force and end up with dual marketing; letter and e-mail campaigns, also orchestrated by the IWC; and, to top it all off, the ministerial order muzzling the Canadian Wheat Board directors as they would no longer have the right to say anything.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, they no longer have the right to participate in a forum or to use, in any manner, their money to publicize action, report on the successes of the Canadian Wheat Board, organize conferences and consultations. No money must be spent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Canadian Wheat Board is muzzled and in the meantime money is spent on establishing a biased consultative panel, which must absolutely lead to dual marketing as the outcome.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out exactly what this bill is intended to do.

It sounds like a terrible thing to allow. People must think to themselves, “What is he talking about in this bill? I had better reconsider. He is talking about allowing prairie farmers to ship their wheat directly to processing facilities which are owned by prairie farmers themselves. That is a terrible thing”. It is amazing that we are standing here talking about this at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, they would not have to go through the Canadian Wheat Board to sell their wheat back to farmer owned processing facilities. That is what this legislation is about. It seems obvious and logical that it should be supported by every member of the House. I would assume that if members were to listen to what it is actually about, they would in fact change their positions and support the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak to the intent of the bill, it widens the marketing choices for farmers and encourages more producers to get into the value added side of the business. We all know that right now farmers could use the boost and really need the boost that would be provided by allowing them easier access to the board grains, wheat and barley, which would be used in processing facilities. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Leon Benoit:</b> That of course includes durum as well. That is what this bill is about. It has nothing to do with the Wheat Board monopoly. This issue should be pretty simple. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to talk about the Wheat Board in a broader way right now. The issue of the Wheat Board and what it should be is a difficult issue. I am the first to acknowledge that. It is an emotional issue. Farmers are split on the issue. It is an ideological debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take the ideology out of the debate and bring it back to one fundamental issue. What is best for farmers who grow wheat and barley, which are board grains? That is what we have to turn the discussion to and away from what we have discussed so far.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to look at the history of the Wheat Board. I have heard members erroneously refer to the history of the Wheat Board and how it got started. They have been completely incorrect in what they have said. I want to point out how the Canadian Wheat Board was founded, why it was founded, and how it got its monopoly and that type of thing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Wheat Board actually was first established in the 1920s. It was established because farmers would take their grain to their local elevators and the companies in many cases would get together and set a price, but the market was not working. People were using horse-drawn wagons, so it was pretty hard for them to take the grain back home again because the market was unfair. The Wheat Board was created to help deal with this.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were founding principles of the Wheat Board, carefully thought out and written down. These were the same founding principles that covered the establishment of all the wheat pools and the pools that were established before that and after that. The Canadian Wheat Board was established by farmers to protect farmers, and its main principle was that it be a voluntary organization, that no one would be forced to use it. That is the reality. That is the truth of how the Wheat Board was established.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did the monopoly come from? The monopoly was put in place during the Second World War in the early 1940s. Why was the monopoly put in place? It was put in place to allow the Canadian government to get cheap grain from Canadian farmers at well below market value to help with the war effort in Europe. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that wrong? It was not wrong the way it was presented to farmers. Everybody had to do their part for the war effort and they did a lot. The farmers were promised they would be compensated after the war for their grain being taken from them by the Wheat Board monopoly, but it never happened. Not only did it not happen, but the monopoly was not removed after the war effort, after the war ended. It was left in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members here talk about a vote on the Wheat Board. Was there a vote when the monopoly was put in place? No. It was done in the cabinet room behind closed doors. There was no vote in the House of Commons. It was put in place and forced upon farmers to get cheap grain for the war effort. Nobody can deny that. That is history. That is the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only say this so that when we are examining this issue we can do it in an honest fashion, knowing how the monopoly came about and knowing the founding principles of the Wheat Board, the main one being voluntary participation. Again, I want to point out that this is not the same position taken in the member's bill. I would never say that, but I am saying that there is a relevance issue. This certainly is not in the member's bill, but it is an important consideration when we are talking about the whole debate on the Canadian Wheat Board issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really concerns me when I hear the member from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78979,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78979&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Thunder Bay</A>. What is his great concern about maintaining the monopoly? His concern is about protecting the port and the shipping industry in his riding. What about grain farmers? I say fine, he should be standing up for people in his riding, and that is good, but by gosh, let us talk about the Wheat Board issue and keep in mind what is good for farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we heard from the member from Quebec. What was important to him? It certainly was not the interests of western Canadian or prairie grain farmers who are covered by the monopoly. It was not that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go to the members of the NDP. This is ideology for them. It really has nothing to do with what is good for farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So who is looking out for what is good for farmers? Members of the Conservative Party of Canada are. We are the ones who are looking out for what is good for farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want to do with the Wheat Board is a difficult thing for all of us to deal with. All the members of the Conservative Party are talking to farmers in our constituencies because we represent those constituencies. We certainly are having that discussion with the farmers in our constituencies and trying to determine the best direction to take to give them more choice in marketing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have said is that two things have to happen. First, western Canadian grain farmers have to be given more choice. Second, whatever is done has to be to the benefit of western Canadian grain farmers. Those are the two really important things when it comes to this debate, not the things that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78423,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78423&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Malpeque</A> or members from other parts of the country want. They have no vested interest in this legislation and their constituents have no vested interest in this legislation. It is not what they want that is important. It is what western Canadian grain farmers want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that I am out of time, Mr. Speaker, which is unfortunate. I have a lot more to say. I will talk about it at another time.</div>

    </p><a name="Para215504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who just spoke suggested that the member from Thunder Bay somehow was not qualified to speak because Ontario farmers who produce grain are somehow not involved in the Wheat Board. As a parliamentarian, I cannot live in every province, and I certainly cannot say that I have a direct vested interest in my riding on every issue that comes before this place, but as a legislator I have a responsibility to inform myself. When I see information being provided to all hon. members that maybe does not tell the straight story, I have a responsibility to participate as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the corporate treasurer of the United Co-operatives of Ontario, which had 100 retail outlets in Ontario in an agricultural co-op. We had the grain in the southwest of Ontario and the dairy in the northeast. When the economic situation turned down, the farmers were always the first ones to get hit. When the economy turned around, they were the last ones to recover. That happens in Ontario. It happens in the agricultural community. It happens in the western grain producer community as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who at the time also had responsibility for the Canadian Wheat Board and spent over a three year period, a fair bit of time, being briefed on a regular basis on developments with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will recall that there was an interesting case when a farmer decided to take his grain down to the United States. Then there was a charge laid and a fine levied. Rather than pay the fine, farmers decided to go to jail instead, as a protest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am not totally ignorant about the agricultural industry or the Wheat Board. I would say, in looking at the bill, that one of the things we should acknowledge is that the Canadian Wheat Board operates like a co-op. It requires the support of its membership. It requires the patronage of its membership to be viable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of grain producers in the west who have transportation distances much greater than those of producers who are closer to the U.S. border, without the Wheat Board they have no option, because they cannot compete. The Wheat Board is the great equalizer. The member will know this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this bill do? This bill says that the producers are going to be given some options. If they want to sell their grain to someone engaged in the processing of grain, that is fine, and by the way, they will not have to pay any fees to the Canadian Wheat Board. This means that by providing these greater options, the Canadian Wheat Board, this co-op that operates in a fairly lean way, is asked to forgo some significant amount of revenue, I would suspect, based on the estimates, that otherwise would have been there if it was handled through the Wheat Board. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have a situation where we are going to start to undermine the fine underpinnings of the Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Wheat Board dies. That is the reality. That is the concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also said that the board is a federal monopoly. That is not exactly so. The board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board actually does have some federal appointees to the board, but the majority of the directors of the Canadian Wheat Board are in fact elected by the member farmers themselves.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1900"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1900">(1900)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para215513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the decisions of the Canadian Wheat Board are not the decisions of the Government of Canada. They are the decisions of the farmers who utilize the services of the Wheat Board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole discussion in this debate is one aspect of it, but it is very clear now that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79002,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79002&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Agriculture</A> has taken a special interest in the Wheat Board and in fact has made certain statements and certain instructions for his officials which I believe ultimately will lead to the demise of the Canadian Wheat Board. Mark my words, this in fact is the beginning of the end of the Canadian Wheat Board if the minority government continues to operate in this fashion, as if it were a majority. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board must survive. I do not believe that members of the Conservative Party will support the continued operation of the Canadian Wheat Board. I do not believe that they support its principles. In fact, I believe they support the large producers in the southern areas of production who want to make a lot more money by exporting to the United States, but they are prepared to sacrifice some farmers for the benefit of others. This is pitting farmer against farmer. That is the problem. That is what is wrong with this wrong-headed thinking, this ill-advised thinking of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Wheat Board has long served the producers in Canada. There have been some good years and there have been some bad years, but the Canadian Wheat Board has provided the safety net and the stability within the grain industry to support those farmers when they needed it. That was the purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board when it was established. It was to ensure that there was a stable marketplace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we have had a situation where there is a massive surplus of grain production. In fact, that has not been the case in recent years. Grain production and the demand have been quite the contrary. So when a member of the government starts saying that Ontario has nothing to do with it, that it is all about the west so let us forget about talking about it, I believe that is nonsense. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an integrated system. The agricultural interests transcend all of Canadian farmers. If we have a healthy agricultural community in the west, it translates into a healthy agricultural community in other parts of Canada, whether it be in the transportation side or not. Members will also know that 70% of the people who work in the agricultural industry are off farm gate. They do not work on farms. If we start to put in jeopardy the Canadian Wheat Board, which will put in jeopardy Canadian farmers, that is going to cost jobs as well. The members also have not addressed that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say to members that this bill is not inconsequential. It is symptomatic of an ill-advised position that is taken by the Conservative minority government.To somehow suggest that we do not as parliamentarians have the right to speak because we are not farmers ourselves and we do not live in the west is a bad starting point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our critic on agriculture has been a champion on behalf of the farmers of Canada regardless of whether it is grain or dairy or otherwise. Farmers need a voice. What they do not need is the divisive voice of the Conservative Party. The unifying voice, the representative voice of the fundamental needs of the farming and agricultural community in Canada, has been represented by the opposition critic for agriculture.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is short, but it does represent in microcosm something that is happening on a larger scale. As I say, I am concerned. I am concerned on behalf of farmers that this is the beginning of dismantling some of the stabilizing influences within the agricultural industry, which will be very bad for farmers in Canada. This is a bad bill. This bill should be defeated at second reading. In principle, I cannot support it.</div>

I am proud to stand today and support the bill. I ask all members to take the time, learn a little more about the Wheat Board and support the bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is producer empowerment. “Who gets the final say with my product?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para215535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a lot of talk about the vote. The member from Mississauga talked about how the Canadian Wheat Board was a co-op. It is the only mandatory co-op I have ever heard of in the history of the globe. He talked at great length about how producers should be assured of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78680,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78680&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sault Ste. Marie</A> said that grain farmers in western Canada had told him in Saskatoon that they were not in trouble because they had the Canadian Wheat Board as a safety net for them. That safety net is full of holes. A lot of farmers are slipping through it. We have a tremendous problem in the grains and oilseeds sector. They are hurting a lot. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to all of this today. I was frustrated and angry. Then I started to think this was the best thing that could possibly happened on the bill. I know the opposition will kill the bill before we get a chance to talk about it in committee, and that is their right to do that. This is a democracy, but I grit my teeth. However, I then started to think.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to get a tape of this sucker and I am going to send it out to every farmer on my database, and there are some 5,000 or 6,000 of them in my riding. They are going to get the biggest laugh of their lives out of this. It shows them who is controlling their livelihoods and how much they understand the pressure that they are putting them under and keeping them under with the Wheat Board, which will not flex like it should.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of talk out there that farmers cannot go head to head with the big multinationals. Nobody is expecting them to do that. Nobody is saying the Wheat Board is even doing that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at other examples in the grain sector such as canola, pulse growers, flax and rye. Oats is a great example. When oats were under the board, 50,000 tonnes was our export in a year. Now it is up to 1.3 million tonnes, plus a burgeoning processing sector in western Canada for oats. That is a success story. Cattle, pork and all these issues go head to head with the multinationals and do very well. They are not clamouring for some release from out underneath the marketing system they are held within.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some mention of transportation, that we were landlocked so we should not do anything but ship out the raw material. That is the absolute wrong way to go.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78423,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78423&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Malpeque</A> put forward had a couple of points in it. It talked about producer empowerment to get higher up the food chain. This bill would do that. It would allow them to have the transportation costs become part of the purchase, not part of them. Since the Crow rate was taken away, it is killing us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc always tries to tie supply management in this. The member who spoke about this used to sit on the agriculture committee. He should know better than that. I have been talking to people in the supply managed sector, the dairy side, and they say the comparison is apples and walnuts, not just apples and oranges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest difference. The supply managed sector is voluntary. If I decide I want to get into the sector, I buy some quota and I am in business. If I want to grow grain in western Canada, I am under the Wheat Board. I have no choice, none whatsoever. If I decide I want to take some quota in a supply managed sector and start a cheese factory, I can do that. I can do that with the quota I have or I can buy more quota, I can start a cheese factory and I can do what I want with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west, I cannot do that without going through the punitive buyback. That buyback entails me selling my wheat to the Wheat Board on paper. It charges me a buyback at whatever it says the world price is that day. Then it charges me freight and elevation to tidewater, those ports that I, as a western Canadian farmer, am supposed to subsidize and keep alive all on my own. I cannot stand that burden any more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the big difference between them. One is voluntary and I can value add. The other one is mandatory and I cannot value add with my product without adding on about 30% to 40% to the input costs of that product, which makes it prohibitive. I cannot get a good bottom line. There is no way they are the same type of thing. We can support one and not the other simply because one is not open to any kind of change, or allowing the in or out. Therefore, that argument flies apart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also quoted section 47.1 of the Canadian Wheat Board Act. What the party left out was the minister can put wheat, barley or whatever is produced in any area in Canada. That means Quebec producers could be under the Canadian Wheat Board, the same as I am. I wish him well with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ontario wheat producers could be under that same single desk selling. If single desk is the answer and the ultimate control, then why do we have three separate marketing boards for grain products across the county? Why is there not one? Why do we not amalgamate them and everybody can roll around in the same bed. That is probably the answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collectivism ideology of the NDP members will not let them grasp the idea that this is a private property right. I own that product, I will deal with it and market it as I want.</div>

    </p><a name="Para215564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governing is about choices and the Conservative government has made a very clear choice to follow in the path of the previous Liberal government. It is offering up to the oil and gas sector, particularly those who are focused in the northern Alberta tar sands around the Fort McMurray area, a little present wrapped with a bow, of $1.5 billion each and every year. I use the word “little” facetiously because $1.5 billion is a significant amount for a government to use taxpayers' dollars to subsidize an industry. It is a deal that was made at a time when the industry actually needed some support some many years ago. If we were to ask any person on the street of all the industries in Canada that need help and support in growing, certainly the oil and gas sector, particularly those companies operating in the tar sands, would not be on the list. The profits have been, as one corporate executive in Calgary quipped, “obscene”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when there is a $13 billion surplus, the government has chosen to cut a billion dollars from much needed programs for Canadians to help them gain literacy skills, to help women define their rights and freedoms under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to help first nations quit smoking, and to help with court challenges. I do not recall these programs being in the Conservative Party's platform at the time of the last election. Lo and behold when the government is absolutely swimming in taxpayers' money, it can find $1.5 billion to shuffle over to its friends in the office towers in Calgary but somehow it also sees the need to cut a billion dollars from programs that were serving Canadians well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government exacerbated the problem by trotting out one of the most sad and lonesome pieces of legislation, the hot air act. It is a bill that purports to delay and hopes to confuse and confound Canadians about what is going to happen with our environment. It is a bill that does not call for any serious regulations for the greatest polluters in the country for 15 to 20 years. We will not see any result in emissions reduction or pollution reduction in this country until 2050, a year when I despair to say that many hon. members in this House will no longer be with us. The legacy we will leave for the generations to come will be a planet with a climate that has warmed up potentially more than five degrees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already seeing what is taking place in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79026,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79026&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</A> in the northwest corner of British Columbia. A pine beetle epidemic has absolutely roared across our province. I will challenge the parliamentary secretary tonight to explain why, in the midst of this challenge and the promise of a billion dollars, which is a significant amount of money to help communities in my region and in other regions across British Columbia to deal with the economic devastation, the government has chosen to take out $12 million. Nowhere is the promise of a billion dollars to be found.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that somewhere around this place the government has a Mack truck loaded up with cash and is ready to roll it out just prior to the next election, but communities need the money now. We are on the verge of an economic swing in<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79026,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79026&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</A>. We need the support to help communities acquire the trade skills. Instead the current government continues the legacy of the last government of robbing from the employment insurance fund, of not supplying the training and development that workers need across our region and other parts of Canada to seize those opportunities and make choices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Mintz, one of the leading economists in this country, was speaking of the income trust fiasco that is taking place across our land. Companies are devolving themselves into income trusts, thereby avoiding many of the taxes that help pay for the roads and transportation, career and development training, universities, health care and all these things that we try desperately to hold on to as Canadians. As these companies shift into income trusts, according to Mr. Mintz, the $500 million in taxes that has been lost to the government has now doubled and ballooned up to $1 billion a year in lost tax revenue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government pretend that it is making correct choices for Canadians while it is cutting programs and not allowing EI dollars to flow? It is cutting essential needs like the small figure of $12 million for the pine beetle epidemic but it is still finding the political will to put $1.5 billion into the oil and gas sector, one of the few sectors in this economy that absolutely does not need the help.</div>

Canada's clean air act would set in motion Canada's first comprehensive and integrated approach to tackle air pollution and greenhouse gases and, in doing so, deliver better air quality and address climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past governments relied on voluntary measures, satisfied that industry would comply. Those days are over. From now on, all industry sectors will have mandatory requirements and we will enforce those requirements. Our plan puts the health of Canadians first and the health of our environment first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's clean air act would amend three existing pieces of legislation to strengthen the Government of Canada's ability to take coordinated action to reduce air emissions nationwide, namely, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, also known as CEPA, the Energy Efficiency Act and the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice of intent to develop and implement regulations and other measures to reduce air emissions published in the <i>Canada Gazette</i> on Saturday, sets out the government's regulatory agenda. The agenda will cover many industrial sectors, including the oil industry, which will directly contribute to reducing air pollution and greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil sands are important to Canadians and the Canadian economy. Billions are being spent by oil companies in Canada. In addition to the direct royalties paid to the Government of Alberta, billions are being paid in taxes to the federal government which will benefit all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil sands production is expected to triple over the next decade and that will be good for Canada's economy. The oil trapped in the oil sands has elevated Canada to the country with the second largest oil reserve in the world, only behind Saudi Arabia. However, government action is needed to ensure oil sands development takes place in a way that respects the environment, and the government will act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach is much more than just a long term approach. With respect to industrial air emissions, the government has committed to determining its regulatory framework, including setting short term targets by next spring. This is a very ambitious schedule and, therefore, we will be seeking focused advice as soon as possible on the key issues.</div>

There is absolutely no call from Canadians to keep subsidizing this sector.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort McMurray, Ralph Klein and former Premier Lougheed have all said that the ship should be slowed down because there is no plan. If the communities and the people involved in this sector are saying that we need a plan and some sort of timeline to develop this, why would the government keep subsidizing this while continuing to hurt communities in my region?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would point out to the member, as I have done before, that I did not know that federal cabinet ministers, as an example, were among Canada's most vulnerable and yet we have cut $47 million by merely reducing the size of cabinet. I would suggest to the hon. member that our expenditure review, which will be saving Canadian taxpayers $1 billion this year, will result in over $650 million annually, which we can then use to benefit all Canadians. That is a fiscal performance to be proud of.</div>

That bill created a salary protection program for workers in case of bankruptcy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago, the Bloc Québécois made a commitment to the unions to propose amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to ensure that the salaries of employees and pension funds would be the first debts to be paid in the case of the bankruptcy of a business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current situation is unsatisfactory. Under the legislation now in effect in our country, an employee who has worked all his or her life for the same company could be left with nothing if the company went bankrupt. In the face of that fact, the Bloc Québécois decided to press the government to correct the flaws in the current legislation and to ensure better protection for workers’ salaries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year and a half ago, the government of the day tabled a bill in this House, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A>. That bill conformed to the principles of social justice that employees must be paid for the hours they have worked. Workers have nothing but their salary as a source of income. Workers’ pension funds are sacred. No one works all his or her life to end up as impoverished as someone who did not worked so hard for so long. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>
    </p><a name="Para215587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned previously, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A> created the wage earner protection program, WEPP. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A> consisted of two components. The first component, dealt with protection of wages, WEPP. The second component dealt with the revision of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. While the WEPP component was not perfect, there were still real benefits related to that program. For example, workers whose company went bankrupt could apply for employment insurance and be eligible for an allowance of up to $3,000 of unpaid wages when the employer declared bankruptcy. The payments made under the program were taxable and took into account other applicable contributions. In this way, regardless of the value of the employer’s assets, workers could obtain the greater part, if not all, of their unpaid wages. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>
    </p><a name="Para215588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Industry estimated that $3,000 per worker would be enough to cover 97% of all unpaid wage claims. The government also estimated that this would cost the Treasury $32 million a year or, in very bad years, $50 million. Meanwhile, the government is running $13 billion surpluses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that the Bloc Québécois disagreed with some aspects of the bill but voted in favour of it because it seemed to be a great improvement on the current situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this adjournment debate is to ask the minister what he is doing. I asked him this question last June in the House and he said that there were some problems with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A> and it could not be implemented right away. He said, though, that he would take care of everything and would soon have more to tell us. Unfortunately, nothing came of this because it is now October and still there is no news about this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, I want to know two things. First, what parts and clauses of the bill are causing problems? I would also like to know when the minister expects to introduce it again in the House, return to it or just enact it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para215592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to suggest to the minister that if it is the bankruptcy part that is causing a problem, he just needs to enact the wage earner protection program. </div>

Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A> also includes a comprehensive reform of Canada's insolvency laws, including the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. As such, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1859128,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1859128&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-55</A> provided a balanced and complete package of reforms on bankruptcy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the wage earner protection program has strong support from parliamentarians, labour unions, the insolvency community and employers. This program should be brought into force as soon as possible. The current insolvency system does not provide adequate protection for unpaid wage earners. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 workers a year are left with unpaid wage claims due to employer bankruptcies. That is why the wage earner protection program was proposed. The program will improve the protection of workers during the insolvency process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of unpaid wage earners has been a major issue during every attempt at insolvency reform over the past 30 years and the issue has never been resolved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage earner protection program will address this issue by providing certain payments of up to $3,000 to workers for unpaid wages and earned but unused vacation pay, so that payment of wages will no longer depend on the amount of assets of the bankrupt employer. It is estimated that this will satisfy 97% of unpaid wage claims in full. In addition, the wage earner protection program will provide prompt payment of wages so that workers receive payment of their wage claims when they need it most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot deny the importance of implementing this program in a timely fashion. However, before the Wage Earner Protection Program Act can come into force, some technical amendments have to be made to ensure that the program will be effective. The regulations necessary to operate the act must be prepared and considerable work needs to be done before implementation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have to convince Canadians that it is important to protect vulnerable workers who suffer an economic setback through no fault of their own. We do not have to convince Canadians that it is the right thing to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para215599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government also understands that protecting Canadian workers when employers declare bankruptcy is the right thing to do.</div>
