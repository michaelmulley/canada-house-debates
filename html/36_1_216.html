am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians, 
including from my own riding of Mississauga South on the subject 
matter of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that human rights abuses continue to be rampant around the world, 
including in countries such as Indonesia and in Kosovo.  The 
petitioners also acknowledge that Canada continues to be 
recognized internationally as a champion of internationally 
recognized human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to continue to 
speak out against human rights abuses and also to seek to bring 
to justice those responsible for such abuses.

Halifax, Nova Scotia on the other coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a petition opposing the presence of nuclear powered and 
nuclear armed vessels in the Strait of Georgia.  The petitioners 
note that the agreement allowing the U.S. use of the Canadian 
Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges, CF METR, in Nanoose 
Bay expired in June 1996, that the cold war is over and that this 
is a cold war facility, that this nuclear emergency response plan 
acknowledges the potential for a nuclear emergency at CF METR and 
that CF METR occupies land and water that are part of the 
sovereign claims of the Nanoose first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call therefore for cancellation of the CF METR agreement 
with the U.S. and an immediate ban on all nuclear powered and or 
nuclear weapons capable vessels from B.C. waters and harbours. 
They also ask that resolving the land claims of the Nanoose first 
nation be a priority issue and that CF METR be converted to 
peaceful uses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following questions will be answered today: Questions Nos. 219, 
220 and 223. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 219—<B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the 
total estimated financial cost of the Canadian Wheat Board's 49 
public forum meetings that are currently being held on Justice 
Willard Estey's grain handling and transportation review 
recommandations? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B> A total of 61 
meetings were held across the prairies to provide an opportunity 
for the Canadian Wheat Board to consult with farmers on grain 
transportation issues.  The total costs of holding these meetings 
have not been finalized.  Expenses for hall rentals and 
advertising will amount to about $40,000, and there will be 
additional costs related to travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 220—<B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the monetary compensation each individual Canadian Wheat 
Board permit book holder will receive from the level of service 
complaint settlement with both CN and CP railway after accounting 
for legal costs incurred by the Canadian Wheat Board? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B> The proceeds 
from the Canadian National, CN, settlement were distributed 
through the Canadian Wheat Board, CWB, accounts. The total costs 
of bringing the complaint was $2.7 million. A portion of this was 
legal fees. The settlement also included rate related benefits 
accruing to farmers in 1997-1998 and for the life of the 
agreement. Due to the confidential nature of the agreement, the 
value of the CN settlement was not publicly disclosed. The 
amount per permit book will vary depending on participation in the 
pool accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Pacific, CP, settlement is valued at $15 million. 
The proceeds will be paid to the CWB in 1999 and 2000 and then 
distributed to farmers through the pool accounts. The legal fees 
for the court case with CP were taken into account in arriving at 
the settlement amount. The amount per permit book will vary 
depending on participation in the pool accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 223—<B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each of the years 1994 through 1998, could the Department of 
Justice provide exact numbers of how many divorces in Canada were 
handled without the intervention of the courts? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  The Department 
of Justice's central registry of divorce proceedings has existed 
since the implementation of the Divorce Act in 1968.  This 
registry was set up as a mechanism to detect and to inform courts 
and the parties of two divorce applications in different 
provinces with respect to the same couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This registry will ensure a court's jurisdiction in deciding on 
divorce cases as contained in subsections 3(2) and 3(3) of the 
Divorce Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The records of the registry indicate that the following number 
of divorces were granted without hearing by the court, by the 
calendar year are:  1994, 66,197; 1995, 66,200; 1996, 58,405; 
1997, 56,258; and 1998, 57,335.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—KOSOVO 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government to 
intensify and accelerate efforts to find a diplomatic solution to 
the crisis in Kosovo through the involvement of Russia and the 
United Nations, and to urge NATO not to take actions that expand 
the conflict and stand in the way of a diplomatic solution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, in launching this debate this morning, 
I would like to explain why the New Democratic Party made the 
decision to use its opposition day, one of approximately three 
opposition days in the course of a year, to introduce this motion 
on Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes that are available to me, because I will be 
dividing my time with my colleague from Halifax West, the NDP 
defence critic, I want to say what this resolution means in 
relation to the critical point, the critical juncture we have 
reached in the desperate search for a speedy, peaceful diplomatic 
solution to the horrifying humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Kosovo crisis began in March 1998, just one year ago, 
700,000 to 800,000 Kosovars have been forced out of their 
homeland.  Another 400,000, perhaps more than that, have been 
displaced within Kosovo.  Massive damage has been done to the 
civilian infrastructure of Yugoslavia by the some 3,000 sorties 
flown by the NATO strike aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know, and they want to know now, that their 
government is doing everything humanly possible to bring the 
hostilities to an end, to bring an end to the atrocities being 
committed by the Yugoslavian government under Milosevic and to 
the military aggression.  They want to be assured that the 
Kosovar Albanians are going to be able to return safely to live 
in their homeland in peace and comfort and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the goal.  That is the objective that supposedly drew 
Canada into this conflict.  It must remain our single-minded 
objective in the days ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, we in the New Democratic Party along with a great many 
other Canadians are gravely disappointed with both the scope and 
the pace of the diplomatic efforts pursued by the Canadian 
government to date.  Instead of bold and creative diplomacy, we 
have had boosterism, we have had followership for U.S. policies 
and for NATO tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lester Pearson would have used Canada's historic tradition and 
role as peace broker to seek a consensus for peaceful solutions. 
He would have done so even at the risk of offending great powers. 
Instead our Prime Minister has toed the NATO line and danced on 
cue.  The past few weeks have been littered with missed 
opportunities where Canada could have exercised independently its 
influence to promote promising diplomatic initiatives, but it has 
not done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is not the day to dwell on failures, to dwell on 
omissions, to dwell on missed opportunities.  Rather, it is the 
time, and this is the purpose today of this motion and this 
debate, to focus single-mindedly on what it is that Canada can 
now do, what it is that Canada must now do to provide leadership, 
to play a key role in bringing us to that diplomatic peaceful 
resolution of the Kosovo crisis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, diplomacy needs to be given a helping hand.  That is the 
objective of this motion, the objective of this debate.  We must 
concentrate our efforts on what Canada can do, on the leadership 
Canada must show in working toward a diplomatic solution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there is a diplomatic window, a window 
that is open just so wide.  It is not a big opportunity, it is 
not a guaranteed path, but it is an opening. 
It is opening because there have been countries that have taken 
initiatives.  Italy, Germany, Russia and the United Nations have 
stepped forward.  Heaven knows, we desperately need the 
involvement of the United Nations.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that for months Canada has celebrated the fact that 
it has gained a temporary seat on the security council of the 
United Nations.  Yet at the very first opportunity that it might 
have used that seat to further the cause of peace, Canada opted 
out.  It said that one could not do anything with the security 
council.  However, the potential for using that avenue still 
exists and we must use it.  It is absolutely imperative that we 
get this issue back into the United Nations arena where it 
belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few days and over the last week there have been some 
promising developments.  Early in the conflict the New Democratic 
Party pushed hard for Canada to take a leadership role in 
persuading NATO to accept the fact that only a genuinely 
international peacekeeping force would be acceptable in 
Yugoslavia and that NATO had to abandon its position that only a 
NATO dominated force would be acceptable to it as a condition for 
peace.  Today NATO has finally moved to that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the conflict it was clear that Milosevic was adamant 
that there be no international presence in Kosovo.  Today he 
appears to have accepted that there not only must be an 
international presence, but that there needs to be international 
troops to ensure the safety and the security of Albanian Kosovars 
returning home or remaining in their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the conflict the New Democratic Party began urging that 
Canada persuade NATO to commit to a position that it would stop 
the bombing immediately if Milosevic would stop the atrocities 
and come to the table.  We are not quite there yet, but we are 
getting there.  We now have Russia taking diplomatic initiatives. 
There are signs of cracks in the Yugoslavian resolve to keep the 
atrocities going.  There is a courageous deputy prime minister in 
Yugoslavia who is acknowledging that there must be some movement 
by Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time for Canada to play a bold and decisive role in 
ensuring that we escalate, that we absolutely accelerate and 
intensify our search for diplomatic solutions and, conversely, 
that we do absolutely nothing to escalate the military action in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has finally recognized that the participation of 
Russia is key.  Everybody who is following the situation in 
Kosovo knows that the participation of Russia in helping to find 
that diplomatic peaceful solution is key.  What this means, if 
this government wants to be taken seriously as a peacekeeper in 
this country and around the world, is that this country must 
absolutely provide leadership in persuading NATO to abandon the 
madness of introducing an oil embargo and creating the spectre of 
military and naval blockades that would without a doubt preclude 
any possibility of Russia participating in finding a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a time when we need the Government of Canada to show 
leadership and courage.  This is not a time to expand the 
conflict in the air, at sea or on land.  Canada must play no part 
in the ill-conceived naval blockade that can only serve to 
inflame tensions with the Russians and the Yugoslavs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we ought to insist that Canada not send the additional 
CF-18 fighter planes which the government committed Canada to do. 
This is essential to indicate that we are serious about 
recognizing that any escalation of military effort is going to 
stand in the way of progress toward a diplomatic solution. 
This would give an important gesture, a concrete gesture that 
would underscore our commitment at this stage to secure a 
diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis.  No less is required of 
us as Canadians and no less is required of us as citizens of the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to this very, very important 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday I had the occasion to visit Winnipeg to attend a 
funeral which was held for a very close relative who had passed 
away.  Funerals have a way of bringing to light the stark reality 
of life and death, what it is all about to be here on earth and 
what we accomplish while we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was in Winnipeg I also had the opportunity to visit with 
my son who is living there.  My son is a fine young man.  I am 
not saying that just because he is my son, he is a very fine 
young man.  He is a very peace loving young man and I am very 
proud of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were sitting in a restaurant having a bite to eat and he said 
“Dad, I got in a fight not too long ago”.  I was very 
surprised.  I said “You got in a fight?” He said “Yeah.  I was 
walking home and I saw this fellow who was drenched in blood.  He 
was covered with blood.  Another person, quite a bit larger, was 
standing over this person, beating him.  I went over to talk to 
the aggressor.  I said `This is not necessary.  Calm down. 
Relax. Go home.  It is all over”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was trying to bring peace to the situation.  Then he turned 
to the fellow who had been beaten up and he told him there was no 
point in continuing with this, that he should just go on home. 
The person who had been beaten up listened and decided to go. 
Then my son turned around to leave because he thought the issue 
was over.  However, the aggressor, accompanied by two other 
people, all charged him.  One came at him from one side and one 
came at him from the other side, and the three of them were 
holding him.  He looked at them and said “So it takes three of 
you”.  He must have touched a chord with their kind of macho 
image.  One fellow said “Let him go and we will fight one on 
one”.  The aggressor who had beaten up the other fellow went 
after my son.  My son, with his Judo instincts from his training 
days when he was younger, very quickly took over, pinned this 
fellow to the ground and held him so that he could not move.  The 
others were quite surprised.  They said “Let him get up and we 
will go”, and they backed off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was torn with conflicting opinions on the situation.  I said 
to him “Jamie, I am proud of you.  You did something that was 
good.  You stepped in to try to help someone who was obviously in 
distress”.  However, I also said “It was kind of an interesting 
situation.  You were lucky because who knows what could have 
happened.  Those people could have had weapons and they could 
have attacked you while you were down holding this fellow”. 
There were a lot of risks involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line was that he had to make a choice.  He made a 
choice to take some risk to try to help someone who was in 
distress, who was at a disadvantage, who was being bruised and 
beaten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell that story because it has similarities to the conflict in 
Kosovo, where people have had to make hard choices which involve 
risk.  That was done at the beginning of this conflict.  I do not 
think anyone questions the motive for becoming involved in the 
conflict.  We were trying to assist people who were being taken 
advantage of and we were trying to end the suffering and the 
bloodshed.  That was the motivation for becoming involved and for 
remaining involved in this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are at a point now where we have to very seriously 
look at what this motion proposes, and that is intensifying and 
accelerating our efforts to find a diplomatic solution—and I 
emphasize the word diplomatic—to the crisis in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in diplomacy there is always give and take on all 
sides.  We cannot have it so that someone can say “This is 
exactly what I want and unless I get that I will not give 
anything in return”.  Diplomacy always involves a matter of give 
and take.  People involved in the labour movement know this.  At 
the negotiating table there is give and take.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain principles beyond which we do not go.  For 
example, in this case we know that there are certain principles 
at stake; the principle of self-determination and so forth.  We 
re-affirm our support for that basic principle.  However, in 
negotiations and in diplomacy there is always give and take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are urging very strongly that the government take the lead in 
finding a diplomatic solution, involving Russia and the United 
Nations, to this very serious crisis.  None of us can doubt the 
seriousness of this crisis.  All we have to do is look at our 
televisions to see the images of the people who are suffering on 
both sides of the conflict.  We see the suffering that is taking 
place and we know that the bottom line is that the conflict must 
end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, when we attend a funeral it comes home very 
quickly that after all is said and done we all end up in that 
same position, lying in a coffin with the life gone from us. 
What people remember afterwards are the good deeds that we have 
done, the way we have influenced someone's life as we passed 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a spiritual phrase which says that if I have 
helped somebody as I pass this way then my living would not be in 
vain.  That is the goal which we must all strive toward, to not 
have our living be in vain and to try to do what we can to help 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we must help to bring about a diplomatic solution 
to this problem, to make sure that no action is taken which 
expands the conflict and makes it worse because we see that sort 
of thing happening quite often.  It could very well have happened 
in the situation involving my son.  He could very well have 
become involved in a situation where the action he took could 
have escalated things.  Fortunately, he was able to take action 
to calm the situation and to use the appropriate amount of force 
necessary to bring an end to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of our concern that nothing be done to expand or 
prolong this conflict that I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member expressed his sympathy for the devastation going on 
in Kosovo.  The NDP clearly thinks this crisis could be settled 
without violence.  However, does the member not acknowledge that 
Mr. Milosevic has violated every possible human principle and 
value and is one of the worst tyrants imaginable?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he also not recognize that extremely strong measures are 
needed to fight this head of state, who has no respect for 
people and denies their rights and is emptying Kosovo?  Do they 
not understand that strong measures such as ground troops are 
needed in Kosovo to repulse the armies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as the strongest measures are not taken against 
Milosevic and the Serbian government, this unfortunate conflict 
will remain unresolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example of my son being involved in a conflict addresses 
that issue.  He came upon a very serious and dangerous situation 
where the human rights of a person were being violated.  He 
diplomatically used every effort to bring that particular 
conflict to a conclusion, to the point where one of the parties 
actually left the conflict through his persuasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strength comes in many ways and through various means. There is 
nothing weak about diplomacy if it is used properly. There is 
nothing weak about exploring all those diplomatic avenues.  I 
feel that we have not explored all of them to their fullest. 
There is no harm in doing that in order to bring an end to this 
very serious situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Halifax West, and indeed the hon. 
member for Halifax, referred to diplomatic efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would be in a position to advise us 
if he has considered the latest peace plan, the Simitis peace 
plan launched by the Prime Minister of Greece and communicated 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I must admit that I do 
not have all the details of that particular effort, but we 
certainly feel that any and all efforts should be considered.  It 
is also very important to get as much information as possible on 
all these efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly from my own perspective I would be more than pleased 
to offer any assistance in terms of discussing any of these 
issues directly with our ministers who are involved in trying to 
promote these plans.  It is an important issue and all of us must 
contribute as much as possible to bring this kind of peace about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the member very closely.  I wondered if he was 
receiving the sorts of letters from constituents that I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a letter from Ken Timewell in my riding, who writes “I 
beg you to work for a peaceful solution.  The humanitarian 
solution being used by NATO is leaving behind too much 
destruction and too many dead”.  He goes on to encourage us to 
use every possible tool that we can to encourage some sort of 
diplomatic resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member receiving many letters like this, the way I 
certainly am at the moment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, I am receiving, as 
I am sure many of our colleagues are, countless letters from 
people across Canada who are concerned about the situation and 
who are urging that peace be our main goal in this particular 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are expressing concern about the environmental damage 
that is taking place, the destruction of schools, the destruction 
of historic buildings and all those casualties that go along with 
the kind of conflict we see taking place.  I am receiving lots of 
letter in that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the motion launched today reminds us that, with the end 
of the cold war, peace based on the status quo, which lasted for 
almost half a century, has ended and we are having an historical 
step backward, an historical anachronism, the revival of ethnic 
conflicts of the sort we had at the end of the 19th century and 
up to the war of 1914.  It is one of the paradoxes that the cold 
war ends and a new period of ethnic strife which simply revives 
quarrels that existed before begins. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to the substance of the debate, we are a member of a 
military alliance, for better or for worse, which was designed to 
end the cold war and which worked very well, so much so that 
after the Korean war there were no direct clashes between the two 
superpowers or their rival blocs.  The alliance is there.  The 
alliance called for this particular action.  As a member of the 
alliance, we accepted the obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not mean that our continuing foreign policy 
has been put to one side.  The emphasis of Canada has always been 
on quiet diplomacy rather than headline diplomacy.  It remains 
our effort to operate through international authority, through 
the United Nations to which all regional security organizations 
are subjected and legally subordinate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts are continuing.  They are continuing through quiet 
diplomacy.  We must move in the first instance through the 
security council while the possibility remains of getting 
unanimous action there.  These efforts are being pursued.  The 
foreign minister is going to Moscow later this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the security council should be blocked, then the opportunity 
remains on the uniting for peace precedent, referred to in the 
House by the hon. member for Halifax West and others, to proceed 
through the general assembly.  It is worth going that extra mile 
and going to Moscow.  That step is being taken.  The foreign 
minister on his return from Moscow will call in on Athens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 25 years, and more particularly in the last several 
years, Canada has had a special interest in promoting peaceful 
solutions in the Balkans.  We have been in continuing 
negotiations with sometimes a breakthrough or a window of 
opportunity seeming to emerge and then, no doubt for temporary 
reasons, disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been negotiating an end to the Cyprus conflict on a 
basis of one country and perhaps two regional parliaments or 
otherwise within it.   Nevertheless, we have been negotiating 
for a solution.  It is in that context that the foreign minister 
will be discussing with the Greek prime minister the ambitious 
plan that Mr. Simitis has launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are merits in the Simitis plan that were not present in 
the German or other plans.  It takes note of what perhaps only a 
member of the Balkan community can really be fully aware of, that 
there are very rarely absolute rights and wrongs, and that the 
capacity to demonize an opposition are not as readily present in 
the Balkans at the end of the 20th century as it may have been in 
the 19th century or in some other period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January, Mr. Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister at the 
time, referred to an initiative that had been taken by the Balkan 
neighbour countries to solve the then crisis in Albania, the near 
civil war situation.  It was solved by two Balkan countries, 
Greece and Italy, Italy being a neighbour to the Balkan 
countries, but regional countries going into Albania at the 
invitation of the Albanian government and bringing peace and a 
consensus under which that country now operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a precedent that can be expanded.  If one operates within 
the United Nations there is nothing to prevent the United Nations 
from designating NATO as a peacekeeping force in Kosovo if and 
when hostilities have ceased, but it would be under the authority 
of the United Nations.  There is nothing to prevent a designation 
of a larger group which would include the addition to NATO of 
Russia or other countries, but it could also be an all-Balkan 
force and limited, conceivably—and this suggestion has been 
made—to non-combatant countries in the present situation.  There 
are members of the NATO alliance that have not been engaged in 
combatant activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. members for Halifax and Halifax West would join 
with me in saying that these are valuable initiatives, that each 
new proposal should be considered and that they can be pursued 
through the United Nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference has been made to international law.  At certain 
periods I wondered whether the legal advisor had been fully 
consulted.  In my professional career, I have often cited the 
example of President Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis when 
law and power operated together.  When the president, as 
commander in chief, consulted the legal advisor and said “Can we 
do it”, he had been advised to bomb the Russian missiles in 
Cuba.  However, he rejected it on the advice of the legal 
advisor. The solution, as we know, was a masterpiece of peaceful 
diplomacy in resolving a dispute which eventually the adversaries 
on both sides accepted gracefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference has been made to the naval blockade.  I would remind 
members that this is an example of policies in evolution.  The 
advice under international law, which was given to President 
Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis, is that a pacific blockade 
can only be used to interdict access of the country that is being 
blockaded.  Third parties cannot be reached.  President Kennedy 
accepted that advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members have been following the statements of our Minister of 
National Defence which have been communicated to NATO, and the 
opinion that President Chirac has expressed, which is in line 
with the advice given to President Kennedy, in a pacific blockade 
we cannot exclude third countries by forceful means.  This advice 
seems to have been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an occasion in which a debate in the House has been 
presented constructively without the desire to make newspaper 
headlines.  Let us solve this problem.  Let us get on track and 
in line with Canadian initiatives through the United Nations. 
Let us go the extra mile, talk to the Russians and persuade our 
allies and associates that this is the right way to go.  This 
process is in operation now.  It has not been trumpeted in 
national headlines but it is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the House that we are trying to work 
through the United Nations.  We will explore all opportunities 
for peace.  After a peaceful solution it should be international. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put to rest the fears of many Serbian Canadians. It is 
not part of Canadian foreign policy or internal policy to 
demonize any members of our community.  It is very clear that 
reconstruction in the Balkans after the present operations must 
also include Yugoslavia.  We do not want to create a power vacuum 
which was the situation in Germany after the hostilities ended in 
1945.  If we create a vacuum any sort of dangerous forces move 
in.  Peace and stability demand an inclusive and co-operative 
effort through the United Nations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wonder if the member could respond to the types of letters I 
mentioned in my earlier intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another letter from Ken Timewell who is very interested 
in this particular issue.  Mr. Timewell does not support the 
aggressive military action by NATO nor does he see how it can 
possibly bring anything but added instability to the region.  He 
goes on to say that it is a tragedy that the Serbian military has 
killed thousands of ethnic Albanians and forced hundreds of 
thousands more to flee their homes.  He also finds it tragic how 
western governments have escalated the crisis with their support 
of NATO while shunning the United Nations, having multiplied the 
number of refugees and produced civilian casualties of their own. 
Mr. Timewell asks us how we can justify supporting the illegal 
bombing by NATO forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the hon. member respond to one of his constituents who 
wrote that sort of letter to him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am receiving hundreds 
of well written and thoughtful letters from my constituents. 
There are deep, emotional wounds on all sides in this situation. 
People are writing and asking what to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go on to the positive side, I think all parties within 
parliament are trying to internationalize the effort, to revive 
the United Nations role and to make sure that the reconstruction 
which will follow, whether it is a completely diplomatic solution 
or something less than that, will be in a spirit of comprehension 
and understanding.  I certainly think it is never a part of 
Canadian policy to devastate a defeated enemy, if it is a 
defeated enemy.  There has to be a place for reconciliation. This 
will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that the refugee situation, which is what 
started it, was the prime argument for NATO's involvement and it 
remains as part of the solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the motion 
before us today is a good one.  I commend the hon. member for 
Halifax for introducing it.  Her motion forces us to consider a 
number of important issues that are now orbiting around the 
conflict in the southern Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first aspect of her motion is a call for a “diplomatic 
solution to the crisis in Kosovo”.  I fully endorse this 
position and have done so from the very beginning of this latest 
crisis in the federal republic of Yugoslavia.  In the House on 
April 12 I stated that the only durable solution for this 
conflict was a negotiated one.  I have heard nothing that has 
changed my mind on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil war in Kosovo is a confusing mixture of historical, 
ethnic and current political problems.  To understand what we are 
confronting we must move beyond the rhetoric that comes so easily 
to public figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fighting today is not solely the result of Slobodan 
Milosevic's policies.  However, for 10 years his regime has done 
nothing but inflame longstanding ethnic distrusts.  Nor does the 
answer lie, in my opinion, in the endorsement of an independent 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A resolution of the current fighting must try to address the 
very real concerns for the security and safety of all people, 
both Serbs and Albanian Kosovars, who have traditionally called 
Kosovo their home.  A dictated settlement that appears to favour 
one side over the other will do nothing but sow the seeds of yet 
another war some time in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No war is ever inevitable.  We can easily encourage future wars 
if we try to impose a peace that one or the other side finds 
unacceptable.  That should not be the legacy of the current 
intervention.  I have always regarded the demand that Belgrade 
accept the Rambouillet peace plan as an initial step toward a 
more conclusive negotiated peace.  The best solution to me seems 
to be the substantial autonomy of Kosovo within the federal 
republic of Yugoslavia, along with ironclad guarantees for ethnic 
minorities.  That autonomy must be understood as not challenging 
in any way the sovereignty of Yugoslavia in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that NATO does not fight to advance the most 
radical Kosovar agenda.  We cannot support the creation of an 
independent and militant Kosovo, which would be the source of 
instability to its neighbours for many years in the future.  On 
the contrary, NATO's actions must create a long term peaceful 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not involved in making policy for resolving the conflict of 
Kosovo.  That is the government's responsibility.  However we 
must make clear that the sole purpose of the current air campaign 
is and must be to create the conditions for a negotiated 
settlement.  The idea of a war for war's sake is pointless.  We 
must therefore repeatedly ask the government to reassure the 
House and the Canadian people that our participation in military 
operations in Yugoslavia is consistent with the achievement of 
the goal of a negotiated peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that the government is terribly concerned 
about giving such assurances.  The Prime Minister's comments last 
week that we would simply follow along with whatever NATO decided 
to do is extremely unsettling.  It raises questions about whether 
we even have an independent foreign policy. 
His refusal to permit a free vote on this issue shows a lack of 
interest in involving parliament in the prosecution of this war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect of the motion today concerns the role of 
Russia.  Everyone in the House will agree that we cannot build a 
new European security system without the active participation of 
Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Russia can no longer project its military power 
with the same effectiveness that it did during the cold war.  It 
is true that Russia is dependent upon western economic aid and 
that Moscow recognizes this dependence.  However the conditions 
that prevail today will not always exist.  Russia is never as 
strong as it wants to be, but we must remember it is never as 
weak as it looks.  We must not act today in a fashion that would 
undermine Russia's willingness to help preserve European 
stability in the future.  However, to some degree that is what we 
have already done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past five years Moscow openly opposed NATO enlargement. 
Nevertheless we enlarged the alliance.  That was not a mistake, 
but we must recognize that Moscow viewed our decision with 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past year Moscow has consistently advised NATO against 
intervention in Kosovo.  It argued that the situation is more 
complicated than some western leaders would have us believe. 
Nevertheless we have intervened and it is possible that the war 
might still escalate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part Russia has given every indication that it wants a 
peaceful resolution of the conflict.  President Yeltsin has 
publicly stated that Russia will not get involved.  He has 
refused Belgrade's request for weapons.  He has ignored the more 
radical demands by radical members of the Duma.  He has made no 
effort to alter the status of the two Russian battalions now 
serving with SFOR in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members might believe that Russia is not really relevant to 
the quest for a solution in Kosovo.  I believe exactly the 
opposite.  As a result of NATO's actions, Russia is the only 
remaining great European power that Belgrade can trust to protect 
its interests.  We must therefore work with Moscow as much as 
possible.  We must listen to what it says about Kosovo and the 
Balkans, a region it knows better than any of the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Russian foreign minister stated that he would not 
be a relay station to transmit new demands from either NATO or 
Belgrade.  He said that Russia was very willing to foster 
dialogue and encourage negotiations.  I think we should take him 
up on that offer.  The Chernomyrdin mission suggests that 
President Milosevic might be prepared to negotiate.  We should 
not let this opportunity pass.  Indeed we should encourage the 
Russians in their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to Belgrade does not mean that we have to accept what 
is said.  Nor does it require that we make unacceptable 
compromises.  So long as we do not abandon the basic moral and 
political objectives of this war, we should always be prepared to 
listen.  In this light I hope the foreign minister is successful 
when he travels to Moscow later this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect of the motion is to “urge NATO not to take 
actions to expand the conflict”.  I think we can also agree with 
this sentiment.  Indeed I feel certain that NATO would agree with 
that, from looking at what happened this past weekend.  However 
the fear that NATO's actions might expand the conflict is 
misplaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is curious that the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas, a 
colleague of the mover of the motion, was the very first member 
to advocate the commitment of ground troops.  Indeed he did so 
both stridently and aggressively.  A few weeks ago in committee 
he loudly demanded a ground invasion of Kosovo now.  I am afraid 
that type of action would inevitably lead to an expansion of the 
conflict.  In fact, it might radically change the nature and 
purpose of the war.  Therefore we must be very careful in using 
such rhetoric or in moving in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add that I believe at this point that NATO's decision to 
impose a naval blockade on Yugoslavia is ill timed and we do not 
have enough information about that mission.  I do not understand 
the reasoning behind a decision that will almost certainly 
antagonize Moscow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that I have many concerns about this war.  I 
raised many of them in the House on the day the hostilities 
commenced.  I repeated many of those concerns on April 12 and 
have done so again today.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that NATO's use of force to stop the ethnic cleansing 
in Kosovo is a legitimate policy.  I also believe, as I have made 
clear today, that we must continue the quest for a negotiated 
peace settlement.  This is not a case of wanting it both ways. 
This is simply the reality of the international system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diplomacy must often be backed up by the threat of military 
force.  I hope the foreign minister has learned his lesson.  Soft 
spoken words in the ears of foreign leaders do not yield 
influence.  In simple terms, soft power without hard power is 
intellectually bankrupt and politically worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I reiterate my support for the motion before us. 
On another day I might have quibbled about some of the anti-NATO 
sentiments.  However, we must rise above these disputes for the 
greater purpose of seeking a swift and successful conclusion to 
the current military operations under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join the hon. member in urging the government to seek the 
assistance of Russia in order to fashion a negotiated settlement 
that is consistent with our moral values and regional interests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I welcome the support of the member for Red Deer for the 
motion, but I did not want to let this opportunity pass without 
correcting one very grave misrepresentation by the hon. member 
during the course of his comments this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated that I as a spokesperson for the New 
Democratic Party had called at a meeting of the foreign affairs 
committee on March 31 for immediate use of ground troops in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that is absolute nonsense. In fact, the 
hon. member will be aware of the fact that the position taken by 
the New Democratic Party then is the position that we take today 
and that my leader enunciated very clearly today.  We must use 
every possible opportunity to arrive at a negotiated peaceful 
solution to this tragic conflict.  We must accelerate our efforts 
to do so within the United Nations, within the OSCE and 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it will be necessary for there to be a peacekeeping 
force on the ground with the ability to protect Kosovar Albanians 
who are returning to their villages, to their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We indicated as well that should diplomatic efforts fail, and I 
emphasize that, should the kinds of efforts that have been 
suggested including the importance of the Russian peace proposal 
fail, should the ethnic cleansing and the atrocities on the 
ground continue, then and only then there is a possibility we 
might look at some form of safe haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that was the position taken then but that 
our fundamental objective is to stop the bombing, to stop the 
atrocities on the ground, to get back to the negotiating table 
under the auspices of the United Nations, to arrive at a 
diplomatic solution and to arrive at a solution that will allow 
the fundamental objective to be achieved, which is the return of 
Kosovar Albanians to their homes, to their villages, to be able 
to live in dignity, peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly I think all of us 
in committee and in the House have been disgusted, upset and have 
wanted to respond to what we have seen on television and have 
read in our newspapers about ethnic cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial response of let us bomb them to the negotiating 
table was the correct one.  I believe all five parties supported 
it and said let us get on with it as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as that sunk in and as we thought about what it would 
be like to go to war in the former Yugoslavia, whether we look at 
the history from the Ottoman days or whether we talk about the 
second world war and what happened or the first world war, all of 
us realize now just how great it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has not sent troops into a war for 46 years.  That is a 
long time.  None of us here were part of those decisions.  Maybe 
a few members were who have been here a long time, but most of us 
were not.  As it sunk in I believe we realized just how we needed 
to examine the whole thing and how many questions we needed to 
ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to know about the mandate.  We had to know about an exit 
strategy.  We had to know about how many people we might lose and 
all those things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have felt that way from the beginning.  I think the member has 
heard me speak about that.  I thank him for his intervention.  I 
felt he was strongly supporting and urging an end to ethnic 
cleansing by using ground troops, by air or by whatever it took. 
That is what I heard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to propose to my colleague the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, which has always favoured a diplomatic solution in 
order to protect the Kosovars and to do all within our power to 
enable the Kosovars to return home as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think that, in view of the way it started, with Mr. 
Milosevic trying to get rid the Kosovar people, he will continue 
so long as there are diplomatic relations?  In other words, does 
he not think that diplomacy encourages Mr. Milosevic in his 
efforts at ethnic cleansing? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, all of us are disgusted by 
the ethnic cleansing which has gone on.  If we look at the 
history of that area, we will find that ethnic cleansing has been 
going on for an awful long time by one group or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it is fair to demonize just one side in this 
case.  There are many issues here and we do not have time to 
discuss all of them. We need to find out how to get those sides 
together.  We have the same aims as everybody else, to get the 
Kosovars back to Kosovo and find some way of making that work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethnic cleansing is not acceptable, but as I mentioned in a 
speech a few weeks ago, it is going on in 21 countries as far as 
I can determine.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first 
I must tell our NDP colleagues how much the Bloc Quebecois 
appreciates this further opportunity they are giving the House 
to debate and discuss the Kosovo issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House will not have too many opportunities to voice its 
opinion, allowing each party to give its point of view on this 
serious crisis, which is not only threatening peace and security 
in the Balkans, but is also threatening or could threaten even 
more international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party are of a same 
mind with regard to favouring a diplomatic approach, a 
diplomatic solution to the crisis which has been going on for 
too long in Kosovo and in this particularly hard hit area of the 
Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all want to see this conflict settled through 
diplomatic means, especially as we as a country and member of 
the United Nations are committed to settle conflicts through 
diplomatic means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read for the record one of the purposes of the 
United Nations, the organization the New Democratic Party is 
referring to in today's motion. The first paragraph, article I 
of its charter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purposes of the United Nations are: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that 
end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention 
and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of 
acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring 
about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles 
of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of 
international disputes or situations which might lead to a 
breach of the peace; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should always keep in mind this important purpose, the 
fundamental goal of the United Nations, and its Charter, which 
should guide our collective actions in this area.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason why the Bloc Quebecois must support this 
motion from the New Democratic Party. As the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas often mentioned in the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and in this House, and as his leader pointed 
out, it is a diplomatic solution that will put an end to a 
conflict that has already cost too many lives, including 
civilian lives. Any war, including non-international armed 
conflicts, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs likes to point 
out, results in deaths, mostly among the civilian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always maintained that a diplomatic 
solution is to be favoured. 
We supported the negotiations and actions that took place within 
the contact group. We supported the Rambouillet negotiations. We 
asked this government on numerous occasions whether it was 
supportive of the will expressed by both sides to reach, through 
these negotiations, an agreement that would prevent the use of 
armed force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also insisted that the Government of Canada attach some 
importance to the peace plan proposed by the German Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, because for us, and for other parties and 
individuals, including many Quebeckers and Canadians, the 
ultimate solution to achieve peace is a diplomatic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Bloc Quebecois is glad to see that efforts to 
negotiate a diplomatic solution are being stepped up.  Today, 
American deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott is negotiating 
with Russian special envoy Mr. Chernomyrdin.  These negotiations 
could pave the way to a diplomatic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the European Union and, in particular, 
representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, who will be 
chairing the Union for the next six months, have also focused on 
a negotiated and diplomatic solution, an approach that has had 
our whole-hearted approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also fully aware of the important role that the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs could play in the discussions in which he 
will take part on Thursday with the Russian president's special 
envoy and his foreign affairs minister.  We wish him all the 
best in this worthy endeavour. 
It deserves the support of this House.  We believe that, coupled 
with the other negotiations taking place, it could culminate in 
a proposal that could be put before the UN security council, 
because that is the body where the issue of how to restore peace 
to Kosovo must again be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The security council was always the forum where a solution to 
this international dispute should have been negotiated.  It is 
unfortunate that the council had to be left out of the loop, and 
not consulted on important decisions regarding a peaceful 
resolution of the dispute in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, the solution will lie in negotiations to bring 
about a settlement and give the Kosovars, who have suffered too 
much during this conflict, a say in their own future, which was 
what the Rambouillet agreement set out to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Serbs and their representatives will see that a people's 
call for autonomy cannot be ignored, that these demands must be 
dealt with, and not be considered inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the focus of the Rambouillet negotiations, and must be 
the focus of negotiations at this time as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, our party has always believed that the use of less 
peaceful means to reach a peaceful and negotiated solution ought 
not to be excluded.  We have supported the air strikes, and 
continue to do so, for one reason and one alone, albeit a vital 
one. 
When it is a matter of putting an end to ethnic cleansing, of 
preventing genocide—and we may learn in the coming weeks that 
there was genocide in Kosovo, although we are not in a position 
to know that today—and of putting an end to such crimes against 
humanity, the use of force cannot be excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, this use of force is not the most appropriate 
means of settling differences, and I trust that all the 
negotiations currently under way will attain this much desired 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas in supporting a 
motion focusing on this aspect and also inviting Russia to take 
part in an international military force to ensure peace in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with a quote from Montesquieu.  I like to quote 
great authors on peace, war and power. 
In <I>The Spirit of Laws</I>, Montesquieu speaks of power as “an 
eternal experiment, and one any man with power is tempted to 
abuse.  Power will grow until such time as it is curbed.  Even 
virtue needs limits. If power is not to be abused, the world 
must be so organized that power puts a stop to power”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, political power and persuasion must put a stop to 
Milosevic, and freedom must be restored to the Kosovars. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member is well aware that the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
will go on a special mission to Moscow toward the end of the 
week and that he will later meet with the Prime Minister of 
Greece. The government wants the circle of concerned parties to 
be widened. That circle must definitely go beyond NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member had an opportunity to look at the 
Simitis plan, proposed yesterday by the Prime Minister of 
Greece. That proposal has the benefit of emphasizing the role of 
Kosovo's neighbouring countries. We all remember the Greek and 
Italian mission to Albania, last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member give his support and the support of his 
party to the Simitis plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that several peace plans are pointing in the same 
direction. Under these proposals, the UN would play a 
determining role in Kosovo, during the post-crisis period. Our 
party supports the idea that the UN should be at the core of the 
solution to this crisis and that we should call on UN 
representatives when the time comes to establish a military 
force.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we must not rule out the possibility of NATO member 
countries, and people from these countries, taking part in a UN 
force, or in a joint force, unless the objections raised by 
Russia are critical to the point that such a force must 
absolutely be under the control of the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Russia must be involved in the decision that will be made. It 
must, because the Serbian forces and President Milosevic will 
have no choice but to accept a force in which Russia has agreed 
to take part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the solution to this conflict truly lies in the UN getting 
involved again, in a decision being made by the security 
council, and in a force that will act during a set period to put 
an end to ethnic cleansing, allow Kosovars to return to Kosovo, 
and ensure that the Balkans can again find peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a German peace proposal to restore stability in 
the Balkans that deserves the serious consideration and the 
support of all the states. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, we do 
not have a lot of time, but I would like to thank the New 
Democratic Party for allowing this House, once again, to 
continue its debate on the events in Kosovo.  Once again, this 
is an opposition initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion and the proposed amendment make significant 
reference to the blockade or embargo that NATO and the European 
countries have decided to decree.  The New Democrats do not 
support a blockade or embargo.  In essence, the reason is to 
avoid upsetting or angering Russia.  Russia has been cropping up 
in discussions since the start of this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would remind my New Democrat colleagues that we 
started bombing Yugoslavia and Kosovo without giving a whole lot 
of thought to Russia. 
Furthermore, I would point out that it was not an embargo or 
blockade that was proposed, but a check, control, at the 
borders, including those of Montenegro. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in this morning's paper, in statements by our own 
Minister of National Defence and a German general, that no ships 
will be stopped by force.  Requests will be made to board ships 
delivering cargo to Yugoslavia, including oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said in their statement that there would not be too much of 
a push.  They are afraid of the reaction of the Russians.  The 
Minister of National Defence went even further, saying that 
Russian oil exports to Yugoslavia would not be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a war of words.  In addition to a real war, there is a 
war of words that, in my opinion, is really not credible. 
Why?  Because, from the beginning, Yugoslavia was told that it 
would be bombed but no ground troops would be sent.  Now, it is 
being told that there will be an embargo, but that no ships will 
be stopped and Russia will be allowed to continue exporting its 
oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a credibility problem in this war, no clear plan of 
action.  All eyes are on Russia.  Our minister is to hold 
meetings; it is worth mentioning and worthy of our appreciation. 
After this visit, Russia will probably put a resolution before 
the security council.  The council will say that, in the event 
of a ceasefire—not peace, because negotiating peace is a long, 
drawn-out affair—in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia, Russia should lead a 
force under the UN.  We will quickly see this in the security 
council in the days and weeks ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And all to the good, if it will end the war. 
Increasingly, we are seeing cracks and divisions beginning to 
develop in the Yugoslavian bloc, just as they are developing in 
this House.  We are starting to qualify our initial reactions, 
our initial statements, our initial press releases.  Divisions 
are becoming apparent in Parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the House is divided, just as the Yugoslavian 
parliament is divided.  The Yugoslav deputy prime minister—who 
may or may not be credible—is becoming open to the idea of a 
unilateral ceasefire, on condition that troops are withdrawn 
from Kosovo.  There is no talk of peace.  That will require 
negotiation, and a signed agreement.  But at least there is talk 
of a ceasefire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good news because President Milosevic has been called so 
many names, and accused of war crimes and of crimes against 
humanity. It was difficult, therefore, for NATO to find someone 
with whom it could eventually sign a peace accord. It would 
appear there is now a breach in the Serb bloc, which could lead 
to a peaceful settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing the same thing here. During the first two weeks of 
fighting, opposition parties, especially the New Democratic 
Party and the Bloc Quebecois, had rather harsh positions and 
were talking about genocide in Kosovo and deploying ground 
troops there. The NDP member corrected our Reform colleague but 
I too remember that we were talking rather tough. The media were 
reporting that several opposition parties were calling for the 
deployment of ground troops. Today the situation has changed. We 
are talking diplomacy. Of course it is important, we have been 
saying it all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we should restrain NATO's eagerness. Let us not forget the 
war in Kosovo is been conducted under NATO's auspices. In the 
end what the amendment from the New Democratic Party is saying 
is that NATO should maintain its current position and not do 
more. What a nice message for Milosevic. It is as if we were 
saying to him “Don't worry, we will not deploy ground troops, we 
will not prevent you from buying oil or food”. This is not the 
kind of message we ought to be sending. The initial message was 
loud and clear. Are we going to stick to it or not? If not, let 
us get out of there real quick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe anything will come of this idea of a blockade 
or embargo, because at any rate right here in Canada, in Germany 
and elsewhere in the world people are saying it is not a real 
blockade, a real embargo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now seeing Canada multiplying diplomatic initiatives, 
which is good. 
But what did Canada do before the war?  On one of the occasions 
when the Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, I asked him what efforts 
and actions Canada had taken in the 9 to 12 months prior to this 
war.  The minister is supposed to be providing us with that 
information.  What action did Canada take to try to prevent this 
war?  What efforts did it make on the diplomatic front? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time we are at war, and the diplomatic process is being 
stepped up, as indeed it should be.  But what was done in the 
past?  We do not know.  What was Canada's role before the war? 
The government has kept very quiet so far.  We are still waiting 
for the documents.  This is not very credible, unless we are 
given evidence to the contrary. We are still waiting for the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much emphasis has been put on Russia, and Canada also wants to 
play an important role.  Canada is an aggressor in Kosovo. 
It is, therefore, certain that a third party will have to step 
in, before an end to this conflict can be reached, hopefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the President of Libya was putting in his two cents 
worth.  Canada can play an important diplomatic role, but not 
with the Serbs. This is impossible.  We are one of the 
aggressors in Kosovo, so a third party needs to be called in, 
and that third party is Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to wonder what sort of ceasefire there will be, in 
the near future, or so I hope. What sort of peace treaty will 
there be?  There are many differing opinions here in this House, 
as well as on the international scene.  Will there be a 
protectorate? Will the be an accord similar to the Rambouillet 
accord?  In the schedule appended to the Rambouillet agreement, it 
was set out that three years after its signing, the Kosovars 
would be asked about their future. Would they opt for 
independence, autonomy or a protectorate? 
The Serbs refused, because they consider Kosovo part of 
Yugoslavia, and they would never let it go.  Autonomy within 
Yugoslavia is one thing.  Independence, never.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rambouillet agreement contained an important element, which, 
rightly or wrongly, offended the Serbs, and which was the fact 
that three years later a referendum would be held and the 
Kosovars would decide their future.  This may be a fine thing in 
the Canadian context, it is very democratic, but, in the Balkan 
context, it is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole picture needs reassessing.  There is a lot of 
improvisation going on.  Everyone recognizes that a tragedy is 
unfolding in Kosovo.  As the conflict continues, peace plans are 
being proposed.  Measures that are not really applicable are 
being advanced.  There is talk of ground troops and then there 
is talk that there will not be any. 
There is a significant lack of planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that things will be resolved very quickly.  Here in 
Ottawa, today, the weather is fine, the sun is shining. In 
Kosovo and in Yugoslavia the roads, bridges, houses, water 
supply and electrical systems are all destroyed.  If the war 
lasts another two or three months, what will happen to the 
750,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania?  Winter will come.  Will 
they spend winter in little tents?  The country is destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to find a peace agreement very soon.  We must propose 
effective means and be credible in our proposals.

Speaker, I followed intensely the comments made by the hon. 
member, who sits on the the foreign affairs committee with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost a decade ago the Berlin wall collapsed and the Warsaw 
treaty was no longer in force.  NATO is now the only military 
alliance in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think forward and assume that the Kosovo issue is 
resolved.  Because the Warsaw pact is no longer in force to 
counter NATO and the UN, what kind of changes does the hon. 
member envision for NATO that would prevent its members from 
acting differently than they would have 10 years ago when the 
Warsaw pact was in place?  Does he have any suggestions to make 
with respect to revamping NATO and the UN so that we can go 
forward into the 21st century with new institutions and without 
the cold war? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, since we are in the middle of 
a conflict, we are not talking about revamping a system or an 
organization. In fact, there was not really any discussion of 
major changes at the Washington summit.  Why?  People are 
waiting to see what reaction there will be to NATO's involvement 
in the conflict in Kosovo.  Then there will be a debriefing as 
to whether or not NATO did the right thing.  The analysis can 
come later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that NATO was not created to do what it is 
now doing in Kosovo.  It took a unilateral decision, without any 
real negotiations or discussion, to play an offensive role.  It 
may be right, but the fact remains that a small group made this 
decision without any real negotiations or discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are asking what role NATO should play.  It is no longer 
the same organization that it was 50 years ago. 
It has changed completely.  In fact, the various types of 
international organizations should be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will NATO become an organization for ensuring the military 
protection of Europe, as seems to be happening, in which case 
there will be military forces on every continent to ensure a 
certain stability?  Maybe so, and maybe not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thought is being given to revamping NATO.  The organization has 
undergone a rapid metamorphosis over the past year.  Should NATO 
revert to its original role, or stay as it is?  That is perhaps 
the real question.

about the devastation and destruction that is taking place in

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked what kind of message we are giving to 
Milosevic.  Does the member feel that the message we are putting 
forth, a strong desire for peace and a desire to use every 
diplomatic effort to obtain peace and end the destruction is 
wrong? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, the problem is what kind of 
message we want to send Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the conflict, everyone agreed on a tough 
stand.  Today, members are questioning the decisions of NATO and 
the European Community regarding an embargo or a naval blockade. 
Through its amendment, one party in the House is questioning 
those decisions, rightly or wrongly, it does not matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What message are we sending today?  NATO has decided to impose 
an embargo or a blockade, not a very stringent one, but still it 
has decided to announce one and Europe supports it.  We are 
saying that this is not the way to go. 
There should be no naval blockade or other intervention, 
including ground troops.  What message are we sending with 
respect to the seriousness of past, present and future military 
intervention in Kosovo? 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I will share 
my time with the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great sadness that I rise in this House today to 
express my thoughts on the action that Canada must take in light 
of the critical situation that currently prevails in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is raising this issue today because thousands of 
Kosovars are deprived and without shelter, security and recourse 
as a result of the unthinkable actions of their own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complex issue and the decisions that face us are among 
the most difficult that our country has ever had to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this crisis, the NDP has been advocating 
a diplomatic solution. But, tragically, initial efforts failed. 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to participate in 
a constructive dialogue or to make compromises. Instead, he 
continued his reign of terror in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are currently witnessing a serious humanitarian crisis. The 
Milosevic government embarked on an ethnic cleansing campaign, 
in an effort to scare away Kosovars from Albanian origin. 
Villages are in flames; men, women and children are being 
killed; women are being raped. Milosevic seems to have succeeded 
in scaring away terrified Albanian Kosovars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember the atrocities committed in Bosnia by Milosevic, 
where over 200,000 people died. Can we allow ourselves to let 
Milosevic continue his rampage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this human tragedy worsened daily, the NDP acknowledged that 
there are times when the world community must react to human 
rights violations with actions, not just words.  This is why the 
NDP has acknowledged the importance of responding with military 
strikes.  Milosevic had to be shown that such atrocities would 
not be tolerated by the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the NATO air strikes, 250,000 Albanian Kosovars saw their 
houses burned before their very eyes.  If the western powers had 
not intervened after so many final warnings to Milosevic, they 
would have been sending a message to the Serbian leader and to 
other tyrants that it was acceptable to terrorize people and to 
violate human rights, without facing any consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to use air strikes is certainly not an easy one, 
but were we supposed to do nothing in response to Milosevic's 
attacks against humanity?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote what Tommy Douglas said at the time of the 
Second World War: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—when a group of anarchists sets itself to destroying the fabric 
of law and order on which human civilization is based, then it 
is my duty to intervene— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the success of the air strikes is now being questioned. 
Ethnic cleansing has been stepped up, and there has been a 
dramatic increase in the number of refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a duty to put an end to this human suffering and to come 
to the aid of the hundreds of thousands of Kosovars who have 
lived with this terror for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the NDP is proposing, after 35 days of strikes, a 
solution based on five elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the immediate cessation of NATO air strikes on the 
condition that the Serb government agree to resume negotiations 
and put an immediate end to hostilities against the Albanian 
Kosovars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the holding of negotiations under the auspices of 
the United Nations with Russia's participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is that the Canadian government should request a 
special meeting of the UN general assembly to debate the Kosovo 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is that no Canadian military contingent is to be sent 
without a special debate in the House with the members voting on 
the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the fifth is that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is 
to continue to help refugees in Macedonia and Albania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use as an example my years of experience in negotiations 
between unions and employers, where there is a labour conflict. 
This boils down to pretty much the same thing, because conflict 
is also involved here. 
Conflicts are always resolved at the negotiating table.  It may 
take a week, two weeks, a month, or three months, but in the 
end, the parties must return to the negotiating table.  It is 
there that conflict is resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the NDP is saying that the negotiating table is 
where these conflicts will be resolved, sometimes with a change 
in position.  I have an example.  On the day of the strike, we 
are in a strong position and that is what we want.  The employer 
too is in a strong position and that is what he wants.  If no 
one is prepared to shift their position, the strike will go on. 
This is why no one can have an absolute position.  You have to 
always be ready to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five elements I mentioned earlier underscore the importance 
of a diplomatic solution. 
Following our interventions here in the House, the government 
finally recognized the importance of diplomatic efforts by 
sending the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Russia later this 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must focus all our efforts to bring an end to this conflict. 
This is why we are asking the government to intensify and speed 
up efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo 
by ensuring that Russia and the United Nations are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I draw on my union example.  Sometimes it is 
necessary to appeal to mediators to help the parties find a 
solution.  Russia must be seen as a mediator and be able to 
intervene and propose solutions to this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO must also be encouraged not to take actions that would 
extend the conflict and hamper the search for a diplomatic 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to my example of a union. When workers are on strike 
or in a lockout situation and solutions are being sought, if one 
party resorts to extreme measures, this will sometimes make 
matters worse. We then think “If only they would calm down and 
go back to the bargaining table”. Even the government agrees. 
This is why we must put these things into place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context seems increasingly favourable to a diplomatic 
solution. We must help make things happen and create a situation 
where Russia and the United Nations can play a leading role in 
resolving this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are so categorically opposed to a naval embargo. 
Such an embargo would only increase tensions and adversely 
affect efforts to find a diplomatic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can provide meaningful leadership in the search for 
diplomatic solutions to this conflict. We should immediately 
focus our efforts on this type of solution. These must also 
focus on the assistance we can provide to the tens of thousands 
of refugees.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the thousands of Canadians for

groups that bring direct and indirect support to the refugees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we must turn our attention to the Canadian military 
personnel participating with courage and integrity in these 
operations. They are the ones making the greatest sacrifice and 
we are grateful for that. We also thank their families for being

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey,

the member's speech.  He asked how we can stop the human 
suffering. He made the point that he felt we should get back to 
the negotiating table to solve the problems.  He wanted a 
diplomatic approach. Then he also said that he wants no further 
action by NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that unless Milosevic is confronted with force, 
he will not go back to that table.  He has already proven that. 
The actions by the NATO forces right now have basically stopped 
the fuel supply to his army so his tanks cannot move.  We have 
taken out bridges so they cannot cross rivers.  Does the member 
really think if NATO withdrew at this point in time that 
Milosevic would go back to the negotiating table and negotiate in 
good faith?  Does the member think that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have never said that we 
should withdraw.  I have said that we should not increase it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put an embargo on the fuel going to Kosovo, another 
country may get involved in this issue.  Instead we would want 
that country to go there and negotiate peace.  That is what is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that what we have said is not to remove. 
If we remove ourselves from it, we want everybody to stop.  We 
want Milosevic to stop the killing he is doing in Kosovo.  At the 
same time, let us stop the hitting and go to the negotiating 
table.  If that does not happen, we are not saying that we should 
remove ourselves, but that we should not increase it.  That is 
what is important.  I want that to be clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
greatly appreciated the comments by my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him that in 1755 the Brits deported the Acadians. In 
those days, the situation was non negotiable. The Brits had 
total control over the situation, so much so that those who 
would have offered to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the 
conflict would never have been heard. The Brits succeeded in 
their endeavour because they had the power and determination to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the situation is evolving in Kosovo is a bit like that. 
We might talk about and wish for a negotiated settlement to the 
conflict, but is it feasible? As my colleague said earlier, 
Milosevic is a barbarian. He has terrorized Kosovo. He has 
violated the rights of a whole population. 
We know he has exterminated, killed thousands of people. We may 
get more accurate figures once the conflict is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems rather obvious that while we want a negotiated 
settlement to this conflict, we must realize that Milosevic has 
no intention of negotiating.

</I></B></P><P align=left>His goal is to rid Kosovo of its population to seize one half, 
one quarter or a third of the territory. Of course, he would 
like to have all of it. In the end, there is only one solution, 
and that is to keep up the pressure against this barbarian, to 
force him back to the negotiating table. Wishful thinking will 
settle nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not believe this situation is very similar to or 
worse than what the Acadians went through in 1755? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague spoke of the 
Acadians of 1755.  I wanted to speak of them in my remarks, but 
have chosen not to.  I would never want it to happen again, 
because the people at home, although our ancestors left, still 
talk about 1755, the year the Acadians were sent away from their 
country and arrived here in Canada by boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the solution to say that there is no limit and that 
everything will be destroyed?  That is the issue. 
There are strikes at the moment, but how many are we prepared to 
do?  Is success achieved through destroying another people?  I 
agree with my colleague that Milosevic is wicked, but are we 
going to destroy his people?  Are the people wicked or is it he? 
This is where we have to use our good judgement and ask 
ourselves whether we are doing enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish to say a few words in the debate this morning, 
basically to underline the importance of a serious diplomatic 
thrust to try to bring an end to this very unfortunate conflict. 
Hopefully the initiatives being taken now by the foreign affairs 
minister, by the Russians and by others will bear fruit.  We 
should put a real emphasis on trying to accelerate the diplomatic 
efforts of finding peaceful solutions to what is happening in 
Yugoslavia, what is happening in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It need only be said in passing that we oppose what Milosevic is 
doing.  It is abhorrent.  It is barbaric.  Something has to be 
done to stop what he is doing to the people in Kosovo. I also 
believe that we should try to escalate the presence of the United 
Nations in terms of it taking an initiative to do what it can to 
bring about a very peaceful solution.  Right now people are 
suffering in that part of the world.  People are being bombed. 
People are being killed.  People are being exterminated. That has 
to end and end as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to try to bring a bit of human face to this situation if 
I possibly can.  In 1968 I had the opportunity to go into the 
middle of a very vicious civil war in Nigeria, into the breakaway 
province of Biafra.  This morning I dug up a comment in a speech 
I made in the House on November 26, 1968, a little over 30 years 
ago.  I was only 12 years old; I was elected at the age of 11 or 
thereabouts to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent two weeks over there.  I spent one week on the Nigerian 
side and I spent one week in the war zone on the Biafran side.  I 
had an experience which changed my life forever in terms of what 
humanity is all about.  I literally saw people dying after being 
bombed.  I saw people dying of starvation in huge sick bays in 
refugee camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that particular time I travelled there with a Liberal member 
of parliament by the name of Ralph Stewart.  Before us a couple 
of other MPs had gone, a Conservative named David MacDonald and a 
New Democratic named Andrew Brewin.  We went there to try to 
bring attention to the suffering and the need for some 
humanitarian help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember flying into what was then known as Biafra.  At 
that time the Nigerian armies had encircled the province of 
Biafra.  There was a form of genocide going on where hundreds of 
thousands of people were dying.  We flew in under the cover of 
darkness on a church plane bringing drugs and landed on a small 
jungle air strip.  I spent seven horrifying days actually seeing 
what happens when there is war.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being caught in a bombing raid and having bombs drop 
literally a few metres away.  We thought we were going to die 
because these bombs were coming out of the darkness of a jungle 
night.  People were screaming.  Some people were saying the 
rosary.  Other people were crying and running and being 
scattered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terror is hard to put into words.  I reread the speech I 
made in the House back on November 26, 1968 describing the trip. 
The then minister of external affairs was Mitchell Sharp, and he 
spoke right after me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we saw was a Catholic hospital that had just 
been bombed.  Another was a Red Cross hospital that had just been 
bombed, both of them by mistake, I am sure, according to the 
military authorities at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also went to many refugee camps and what they called feeding 
centres and sick bays.  They would feed people at five o'clock in 
the morning just before dawn, before sunrise, because if the 
bombers came over and saw a huge crowd of people in a jungle 
opening there was a chance that there could be an attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of things I referred to in my speech, and I remember it to 
this day, was going to a feeding bay where they had 3,500 
pregnant and nursing women coming for their daily iron pills and 
a bit of fish stock that was provided because of the protein in 
fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go through this experience, to get caught in a bombing raid, 
to hear the airplanes doing the strafing, to go up to a war front 
and see wounded soldiers, and to be close enough to hear the 
rat-a-tat-tat of machines guns in the darkness of a jungle night, 
it certainly had an impression on me.  I did not think I would 
come back many times during that one week.  It had an impression 
on me of how uncivilized human beings are at times to one 
another.  Everything has to be done to bring an end to that kind 
of torture and torment.  I just wanted to relate some of those 
comments to try to make this situation a little more real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brunt of the situation now is being borne by the Kosovars 
who are in huge refugee camps.  Some are in Macedonia and some in 
Albania.  Many of the Kosovars are still trapped behind the lines 
in their native province, the part of Serbia they come from and 
have lived for many years.  Many of these people are dying of 
starvation.  Many of these people are being shot.  They are being 
executed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was in Biafra, for example, at a hospital or a 
church when a worker came out of the jungle with a child in his 
arms who might have been four or five years old.  The child was 
basically just the skeleton of someone who was barely clinging to 
life.  In my life I have never seen a person as emaciated or 
skinny as that little child was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of thing is happening now.  It is happening in 
Yugoslavia and it is happening because of a madman named 
Milosevic.  It is also happening because there are NATO bombs 
being dropped in Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in these little jungle villages and lying there with 
bombs dropping, I realized one thing.  A bomb does not 
discriminate between a very poor black African peasant and a 
white politician from the western world.  It does not 
discriminate at all.  If one did not believe that going into that 
situation, it becomes a reality extremely quickly when a bomb is 
dropping out of the sky.  We all have the same kinds of fears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people are going through hell on earth and there is no 
better way of putting it than that.  It is an absolute hell on 
earth.  We should do what is being initiated today.  We should do 
whatever we can to escalate the diplomatic offensive by bringing 
in Russia, the United Nations and other countries like Canada 
that are highly respected in the international forum and building 
up the diplomatic offensive to try to bring an end to the 
killing, the torture, the bloodshed and the hell on earth that is 
occurring in that part of the world.  That is what we have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we should signal as a country that we do not 
want to escalate the conflict by being part of a naval blockade. 
I do not think we should be doing that.  It just leads into the 
possibility of making the situation more of a tinderbox.  It 
brings in the possibility of a conflict with Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil that goes into Yugoslavia comes primarily from Libya and 
from Russia.  As the President of France, Jacques Chirac, said a 
few days ago, if one stops a ship bringing oil to that part of 
the world it is basically an act of war.  We know the situation 
now in Russia where there is basically no government.  It is a 
situation that is almost analogous to anarchy.  There are 
ultranationalists, communists, unrest and economic chaos.  It 
would not take much to push that country into a situation where 
this conflict could escalate beyond control of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should do everything we can, absolutely everything we can, to 
bring a diplomatic end to this kind of a crisis.  Those people 
are suffering.  Those people are dying.

People do not know where their homes are.  Their homes have been 
destroyed.  This is real and genuine human suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand here in a parliament well dressed, well fed, well 
nourished and with shelters over our heads.  It is difficult to 
imagine the suffering these human beings are going through.  They 
are like us.  They are human beings.  They are being deprived of 
their loved ones.  They are human beings that suffer pain and 
death and see their families being killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of thing is very dangerous and could escalate.  We 
have a fine reputation around the world, going back to the days 
of Lester Pearson and before, where we are the peacemakers.  We 
are respected.  We have diplomatic clout and diplomatic power. We 
should do all we can to escalate that and emphasize that in the 
hours and days that remain in the next week or so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I compliment the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle on 
his intervention.  I have two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that after the initial statements from NATO 
on a naval blockade, the commentaries made by the Minister of 
National Defence are very close to those used by President 
Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis where a similar situation 
existed in the naval terms, which were fully compatible with 
international law?  The Government of Canada is very clear on its 
commitment to international law and its commitment to the United 
Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree also that after fulfilling our obligations to 
NATO, we are bending our efforts in the last few days and the 
last few weeks to getting the issue back to the United Nations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the explanation of the mission to Moscow of the foreign 
minister, the mission to Greece, the discussion of the Simitis 
plan for a more inclusive international force which must 
certainly be there when peace is restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly agree and 
I think that is what I said at the beginning of my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased there are some initiatives on the diplomatic front. 
I am pleased our Minister of Foreign Affairs will be involved in 
these diplomatic initiatives.  I am pleased the Secretary General 
of the United Nations is now trying to involve himself and the 
United Nations in seeking a diplomatic solution to what is 
happening in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree with what the member has said.  I am sorry I was 
not here for question period yesterday.  I have no idea what the 
Minister of National Defence said either inside or outside the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank our colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle for 
sharing his Biafran experiences with us.  It was very useful for 
this House to hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others could tell similar stories of events in Sierra Leone, 
southern Sudan, Iranian or Turkish Kurdistan, more tales of 
atrocities, rapes and crimes against humanity, which are as 
serious in those regions and countries as they are in others, 
and this is what must be of concern to us in the aftermath of 
this crisis.  These other crises must be considered equally 
important and they too merit diplomatic intervention and 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like it when there are references made to the late Lester B. 
Pearson, for there is one thing the two of us have in common. 
Like the former Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs, 
I favour bow ties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But my question to the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle is as 
follows:  The motion refers to United Nations participation.  I 
would like to know exactly what the NDP members have in mind. 
They are, no doubt, aware that the United States appears to be 
behind a security council resolution at this time, which calls 
for the council to again get involved in this international 
dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what they had in mind or is it, first and foremost, UN 
participation in an international military or civilian force in 
Kosovo.

UN initiative.  The secretary general is in Europe.  This is a 
very important initiative. We support it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in the future there is going to be a ceasefire, there is 
going to be a settlement, and hostilities will stop in that part 
of the world.  I believe there is going to be a need for an 
international force to keep the peace.  We believe in our party 
that the force should come under the auspices of the United 
Nations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with a colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few months we have witnessed the greatest 
humanitarian disaster in Europe since World War II.  In the heart 
of Europe and on NATO's doorstep the people of Kosovo have been 
forced to abandon their homeland and have suffered unimaginable 
atrocities, not because of anything they have done, but simply 
because of who they are.  We hear reports of men being taken 
outside their homes to be shot, women being raped in front of 
their families and children being orphaned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House calls for a diplomatic solution. 
This has always been the preferred course and NATO's political 
objectives still include a diplomatic settlement.  This motion 
not only ignores this fact, it also ignores the situation which 
confronts us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After long and hard months of political and diplomatic activity, 
Canada and its allies have chosen to taken military action.  The 
resort to military force in Yugoslavia was a decision reluctantly 
taken, but Mr. Milosevic left us no choice.  He consistently has 
refused to live up to agreements he has made.  At the 11th hour 
at Rambouillet the Yugoslavs turned their backs on diplomacy. 
Taking military action was, and still is, the right decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternative, to do nothing and allow Mr. Milosevic to pursue 
his deliberate policy of repression and ethnic violence, was 
simply unacceptable to Canada, the NATO alliance and, indeed, the 
international community.  By responding as we did, Canada and its 
allies have taken a strong step toward a goal that has always 
been in our national interest, a peaceful and democratic Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military objective is clear and our will to see it met is 
unshakeable.  The NATO campaign is aimed at diminishing and 
degrading the tools the Milosevic regime has been using against 
helpless civilians in Kosovo since last year:  the Yugoslav 
military, the police and paramilitary forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not be a short mission.  It is difficult to be patient 
amidst such a humanitarian tragedy, but we should not waver from 
our chosen course.  All NATO allies understood from the beginning 
that the struggle was not going to be easy.  Military operations 
as large as this rarely are easy, if ever, and we need to provide 
the desired results as soon as we can, but it will take time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air campaign is having an effect on the Yugoslav military 
and police forces.  The first phase of the air campaign struck at 
the nervous system of the Yugoslav military machine, its air 
defence and command and control networks.  The second phase is 
designed to degrade the overall strategic capability of the 
Milosevic regime.  This includes strikes against Yugoslav forces 
operating in and outside Kosovo, at military infrastructure and 
at other assets which allow the Yugoslav forces to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Past experience shows that Mr. Milosevic does not respond 
without pressure.  NATO operations are making him pay a price for 
his actions.  In the space of a few weeks NATO attacks have 
destroyed more than 50% of Yugoslavia's fuel reserves and 
significantly reduced the capacity to refine the remaining oil. 
Sixteen of Yugoslavia's early warning radar sites have also been 
severely damaged or destroyed, and 35 ground attack aircraft and 
half of Serbia's MiG-29 Fulcrum fleet are gone.  Airfields and 
aircraft support facilities have been severely damaged and key 
routes which Yugoslav forces used to move supplies to and from 
Kosovo and other parts of the country have been degraded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for everyone to recognize that these strikes are 
having a real impact on the situation on the ground.  Yugoslav 
forces are running into problems with fuel, with munitions and 
they are having trouble supplying their planes and tanks.  NATO 
has steadily intensified its air campaign by increasing the scope 
and tempo of operations and will continue to do so until Mr. 
Milosevic accepts the legitimate demands set out by the 
international community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the last three weeks Canada and other NATO 
allies have increased their contribution of aircraft to the 
campaign.   The Canadian forces are playing a significant role in 
this operation and we are all very proud of their efforts in that 
regard.  Our initial contribution of six CF-18 fighter aircraft 
was increased to twelve in response to a NATO request for 
additional combat power.  In response to NATO's most recent 
request for additional aircraft, Canada announced on April 17 
that another six CF-18s would be deployed, bringing the total 
Canadian contribution of CF-18s to eighteen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian forces members are also playing an important role by 
flying in the NATO airborne warning and control aircraft.  These 
planes not only help direct our planes to their targets, they 
also provide warning information about hostile aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO is prepared to introduce ground forces in Yugoslavia to 
monitor and enforce a peace agreement along the lines set out by 
the Rambouillet talks in February.  That is important to note. 
This is a clear demonstration that although we are currently 
engaged in military operations, NATO wants and is desperately 
looking for a diplomatic solution, and is actively preparing for 
the time when such a solution is reached.  I believe that is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Milosevic chooses peace and meets the demands of the 
international community—and we hope he does—a peace monitoring 
and implementation force will be established.  As the government 
announced during the House debate on this subject, Canada is 
prepared to contribute between 500 and 800 personnel to this end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend in Washington NATO marked its 50th 
anniversary.  There was a clear message of unity and 
determination among alliance members to end the violence in 
Kosovo.  The crisis represents a fundamental challenge to the 
values for which NATO has stood for half a century:  democracy, 
human rights and the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and its allies seek a diplomatic solution, but we are 
being realistic about how this can be brought about.  Words alone 
will not bring Mr. Milosevic to his senses, and that is 
unfortunate.  We tried for months and it produced nothing.  NATO 
wants a diplomatic solution, but we have to make Mr. Milosevic 
want one as well.  To do this, more than words are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intensified military operations are designed to put more 
pressure on Belgrade.  Reducing this pressure would do nothing to 
bring about a solution at this time.  I want to emphasize that 
diplomacy has not been forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Washington NATO allies recognize the role that Russia can 
play in trying to find a diplomatic solution based on the 
conditions set out by NATO and the international community.  The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs is going to Moscow to hold 
discussions with the Russians regarding this matter.  The 
diplomatic route can be retaken at any time, but that decision 
lies with Mr. Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the European continent is confronting a serious crisis. 
Kosovo is a very small place on a very large fault line, an 
historic crossroads of religion and ethnicity that has often bred 
hatred and violence.  It is in the national interest of Canada 
and its allies to prevent this region from once again sparking 
wider instability, just as we have a moral imperative to not 
simply watch from the sidelines as hundreds and thousands of 
people are brutalized and forced from their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons we must stay the course and end the violence 
in Kosovo.  Peace will not be achieved if we are weak willed and 
lose the courage of our convictions.  We must continue to hold 
the tools of diplomacy in one hand and military means in the 
other.  The dark forces at work in Kosovo will not be turned back 
in any other way, and that is important to note. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to comment on the words 
of the member who just spoke.  I agree completely with him.  I 
think his speech was excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the world cannot stand by and expect that peace 
will just happen.  I am a peace loving person.  I think I speak 
for all of my constituents in Thornhill when I say that we wish 
for world peace. 
However, we cannot stand by and watch terror, ethnic cleansing, 
rapes and murders; the violence we have seen from that 
unfortunate part of the Balkans.  We cannot stand by and allow 
dictators, those who would dictate to the world on their terms, 
without standing firm and expressing the values in which all 
Canadians believe.  The world has stood by too often in the past 
and not acted in a way which would make us proud.  We must stand 
for peace, for human security and we must do what we can, united 
with our NATO allies.

time, hoping that Mr. Milosevic and those in that terror stricken 
part of the world will indeed, as the member said, come to their 
senses, come to the peace table and establish a plan for the 
return of the refugees to Kosovo.  Hopefully we will see peace in 
that region, which for too many generations has been troubled 
with violence and hatred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member on his speech.  I have no question for 
him.  He said it all and he said it eloquently.  I know we have 
had many opportunities in the House to debate this issue and I 
thank the House for the opportunity to add these few words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the points she raised.  We need to work together effectively to 
bring about the kind of solution that is important for this part 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed a problem area and we need to stay the course in 
this very important effort.  It is incumbent upon the Canadian 
government to do so and I know that the Canadian people are very 
much with us in this matter, knowing full well that we are doing 
the right thing and doing it in a manner consistent with the 
values that unite us as a nation and define us as a people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there has been a lot talk in this debate about 
international law.  I point out to the member that there are 
several instances in the very recent past where countries have 
militarily done things that would appear to be in violation of 
international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite, for example, Canada's seizure of the Spanish trawler, 
which was a seizure that actually occurred on the high seas. 
This occurred during the cod crisis.  The reason for the seizure 
was that the Spanish were fishing on the high seas, just off 
Canada's fishing grounds, and were destroying the cod stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very vividly talking to a member of the diplomatic 
community who said that seizing a vessel on the high seas is a 
declaration of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know now, in retrospect, that most of the world agrees with 
that move; that countries do have to take action, even on the 
high seas, if it is a matter of protecting not only their own 
resources but the world's resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out also that we have another unusual circumstance in 
this situation.  Canada still has representation from Yugoslavia 
here in Canada, even though we are in the position where we are 
making military strikes on Serbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not now a situation where we should be expecting to revise 
some of the international laws and conventions that were 
basically framed in the 19th century and the early 20th century 
as we go into the new millennium? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is incumbent upon us 
always to look at various conventions and other articles of law 
in the context of world peace.  What we are doing in that part of 
the world is effective and it is important that we carry on in a 
manner consistent with the values of Canadians and our NATO 
allies.  That is the right course.  Canadians expect us to do 
that and that is precisely what we are doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as hon. members will know, our government has pledged to 
keep the House and the people of Canada fully up to date on the 
scope and nature of Canada's involvement in the humanitarian 
crisis in Kosovo. 
There have been regular briefings of members of parliament as 
well as full discussion in question period and during debates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will remember that prior to commencing military action 
against the government of Slobodan Milosevic, NATO had drawn up 
plans to deploy an international force to Kosovo to ensure the 
fair implementation of a just peace in that troubled province. 
Members will also remember that in February they debated Canadian 
participation in such a force.  There was broad support across 
party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now rise to inform the House that Canada has received a formal 
request from NATO to initiate the deployment of our portion of 
the peace implementation force to the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia.  Today we intend to inform NATO that the government 
agrees to this request.  My colleague the Minister of National 
Defence will provide the specific details and timetable for this 
deployment. These troops, some 800 in total, will join 12,000 
NATO troops that have already been pre-positioned in the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to move into Kosovo as part of a 
peace settlement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to assure hon. members that the purpose of this 
deployment does not extend beyond what has already been debated 
in this House.  The sole purpose is to support the principal 
objective that Canada, and all of our NATO allies, have pursued 
for many years in Kosovo: a fair and just peace, one that would 
allow the people of Kosovo, once again, to live in peace and 
security, that ensures that the machinery of repression and 
atrocities is gone, and that they can safely return to their 
rightful homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of great pride to me, as Prime Minister, that 
members from all sides have spoken out with eloquence in favour 
of these principles, and have endorsed a role for Canada in 
enforcing them.  As a body, we have given voice to values that 
our people hold so dear, tolerance and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians also know, the government, together with our 
NATO allies, is also involved in seeking a diplomatic resolution 
to this crisis.  That is why the Minister of Foreign Affairs is 
travelling this week to Moscow to meet with Russian officials 
and the Secretary General of the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that the military and diplomatic course that NATO 
is pursuing will, over time, bring a just end to the crisis. 
But I would also like to assure all members that, if there is a 
NATO request to deploy Canadian troops in combat, the House will 
be consulted before any final decision is taken. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the few minutes I have left to talk about what 
happened over the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, we have renewed the collective agreement of 
NATO.  In the debate on Kosovo it was extremely clear that all 19 
nations involved were unanimous in the need to carry on the air 
strikes to persuade the government of Belgrade to end the 
atrocities, the murdering and other things that are happening, to 
withdraw its troops from Kosovo and to permit international 
troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week there was a statement made that only NATO troops were 
involved.  We as Canadians initiated talks about having an 
international group involved, not just NATO.  That is what is 
being debated at this time.  But the five conditions have to be 
met by the government of Mr. Milosevic before we stop the air 
strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very important too is that all the countries surrounding 
Yugoslavia, countries like Bosnia, Albania, Croatia, supported 
the actions of NATO when we met on Sunday morning.  Later on we 
had a meeting with the group of nations involved in the 
regroupment for peace.  The group involved many of the new 
republics of the former USSR.  They were in agreement and talked, 
to my great satisfaction, about human rights, democratic rights 
and so on. 
It was an uneasy situation because about six of them were former 
members of the politburo.  Somebody made the observation that was 
just to show the progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very evident that the government of Milosevic is 
completely politically isolated at this time.  We have to 
intensify the economic pressure on it so it will withdraw from 
Kosovo and permit the Kosovars to go back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of activity.  The House rightly asked us last 
week to propose the involvement of the Russians. Everybody is in 
agreement on that.  Kofi Annan is going there this week. The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs will be there. There is some 
activity.  There was some discussion with President Clinton on 
Sunday morning.  The president informed some of us privately and 
after that collectively of the nature of the discussion.  There 
is at least discussion at this time and there is a desire by the 
Russians to be part of a peaceful solution, just as the premier 
of China told me when he visited Canada not long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is playing the best role we can.  We are one of the many 
countries there.  We are making a peaceful solution a priority. 
It is clear there will be no peaceful solution unless we persuade 
Milosevic to do what was agreed upon in Rambouillet. It was 
agreed upon in Rambouillet by everybody including the Russians. 
The difference we had and still have with the Russians is about 
the air strikes.  After so many years of negotiation and 
precedent in Bosnia and elsewhere we had no choice but to proceed 
with air strikes. According to the briefing we had, they are 
having some effect on the government of Belgrade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some positive signs like the statement made by the 
vice-prime minister on Sunday which was quite in contradiction 
from the official position of Belgrade.  We do not know whether 
it is just another tactic.  President Milosevic has been very 
good at using all sorts of tactics to postpone and postpone and 
postpone.  As we have unfortunately learned, long before we had 
started the bombardment, more than eight months before, he had 
already started a plan of cleansing and murdering the Albanian 
Kosovars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working hard to find a peaceful solution. In the meantime 
it is very important for everybody to know that the resolve of 
the 19 nations was extremely strong and very clear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I left for Washington, I thought there would be 
considerable division and that discussions would be rather 
difficult, but I quickly realized that there was unanimous 
agreement that what the government of Belgrade was doing had to 
stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is that NATO took on a role in this mission, 
because the political stability of all of Europe is at stake. 
If this problem is not resolved, there will be repercussions in 
all the other countries.  I met with the presidents of 
neighbouring countries, such as Bulgaria and Hungary, which are 
already seriously affected by the crisis. 
There are 300,000 Hungarians in the northern province of 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the tension and the problems of many heads of government 
makes quite an impression. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very fortunate to be far away from the problem in some 
ways, but for those running a government that is very close there 
is a lot of tension.  It is very difficult for countries that 
have people of the same faith as the Serbs.  It is extremely 
complicated to manage, but everybody has shown solidarity through 
NATO and the neighbouring countries have clearly stated that we 
have to carry on. 
We all pray that it will terminate as quickly as possible.  We 
are doing everything we can on the diplomatic front.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some different points of view in the House of Commons 
and that is normal.  But all the leaders of all the parties have 
supported the action of the government and the action of the 19 
countries involved in NATO.  I would like to use this occasion 
again to say thank you to the members for their participation and 
collaboration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a member of NATO for a long time.  I was very 
pleased that the president of the United States referred to Mike 
Pearson and quoted him about the purpose of NATO.  NATO today is 
not only to defend against invasion. We have moved for the first 
time on a question of human rights and protection of the dignity 
of individuals and so on, contrary to what has been done so far. 
This is probably establishing a new situation that might make 
sure that what we have seen and still see in Kosovo will not be 
repeated elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that is done in the context of the stability of Europe. We 
have established our commitment to stabilize Europe for 50 years. 
We see the new members of NATO, the Czech republic, Hungary and 
Poland there. Immediately on becoming part of NATO they are being 
forced to be in a situation like that and are showing support of 
the collective effort which is extremely rewarding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say thank you to the House.  I think I probably 
broke the rules but if not, I am willing to take some questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for 
making this announcement in the House.  It certainly does give 
members an opportunity to raise questions and comments. I have 
two questions for the Prime Minister with a bit of preamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I think the House has agreed that the three 
objectives that are being pursued in Yugoslavia are the moral 
objective of stopping the ethnic cleansing; the political 
objective of creating a safe home for the Kosovars in the region; 
and the military objective of damaging the Serbs' military 
capability to the point where they cannot practise ethnic 
cleansing and come to the negotiating table.  I do not think 
there is much disagreement here on the overall goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question would be, could the Prime Minister perhaps 
elaborate a little bit further on how the particular creation of 
this peacekeeping force will enhance those goals in practical 
ways? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is a follow-up to the debate we had in the 
House some weeks ago. I think there was general assent in the 
House to Canada's role in the air strikes that NATO was carrying 
on. There was a strong feeling, certainly in the House and I 
think in the country, that if Canada was to expand its role in 
any way, either through ground troops or perhaps even a naval 
blockade, that it would be very important to have a motion 
presented to the House to give the government a mandate to do 
whatever it was proposing to do and to have a vote on that 
motion.  Canadians would then be clear on what authority was 
being given to the government.  In that debate questions could be 
raised about how the creation of this peacekeeping force would 
achieve the ultimate objectives and also precisely would Canada 
have the capability to do what is being asked of it by NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question would be, in light of the announcement that 
the Prime Minister has made, will he be bringing a motion to the 
House asking for a specific mandate to endorse this increase in 
our role in the Balkans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answer to the 
first question, it is part of the plan that was established at 
the Rambouillet discussion and submitted before the conclusion 
that we should send some peacekeepers there.  Other countries 
have sent their peacekeepers.  There are 12,000 of them.  We have 
not. Because of distance it is more complicated for us, so we 
waited until they were needed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no peace agreement is reached they will not move in or become 
involved.  These are not ground troops.  They are peacekeepers. 
They will go in only when there is an agreement to move.  They 
will be on the ground and will have the proper equipment.  Six or 
eight helicopters will be available for reconnaissance.  At this 
time they are helping the people involved in the humanitarian 
task in Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a chance to talk with the Macedonians.  Their economy has 
gone to virtually zero with 40% or 45% unemployment at the 
moment.  They cannot take everybody.  This is an extremely 
complicated situated.  I can guarantee the House that they are 
there and ready to move.  If there is a peace agreement, they 
will move quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not afraid of a vote in the House of Commons.  The question 
is:  What is the proper thing to do?  We can have debate. 
However, we operate under a certain system.  I am not afraid of a 
vote because I know the vote will be clear.  In our parliamentary 
system, the government has the confidence of the House.  If a 
government loses the confidence of the House there are many ways 
to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard talk about a blockade or an embargo.  We have a 
ship available over there.  The leader of the opposition gave me 
the impression that members would now like to have a vote on the 
presence of this ship that is already there.  Does that mean that 
every little move by the armed forces and the government will 
result in a vote in the House of Commons?  That is not how our 
democracy and legal system operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is the executive and needs the support and 
confidence of the House of Commons.  This was done on previous 
occasions.  I am afraid for the future of the House of Commons if 
this is the best way to run an operation.  Great Britain felt it 
had no hope, not because the government was afraid of losing with 
its huge majority, but because it was keeping the principles of 
the executive and legislative bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the leader of the Reform Party wants to have a vote, he can 
frame a motion.  The Reform Party still has two votable motions. 
A debate could be held tomorrow if the Reform Party wanted one. 
It can draft any resolution it wants.  It can indicate what it 
wants and what it does not want.  It can also agree.  We can hold 
a vote to see who agrees and who does not agree with what we are 
doing.  The Reform Party has the option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a representative of the executive of the government, I have 
to presume that I have the confidence of the House, otherwise the 
system would break down.  I do not want to be political, but we 
have had more debates on this than ever before.  I made an 
agreement with all of the opposition parties to have take note 
debates where everybody can speak up and express their views. I 
found the late debate to be very good because we had general 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of having a vote on every little move is not the 
system under which we operate.  I did not establish the 
distinction between the legislative and the executive for the fun 
of it.  It would be easier for me in this case because I do not 
see a strong opposition.  However, I have to remain very 
responsible for the proper administration of the political system 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, we all appreciate that this is a 
very important issue that we are dealing with.  I would just 
bring up a small point.   With the unanimous consent of the 
House, I will entertain at least one question from the leaders of 
the other parties.  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like some clarification from the Prime Minister on a 
couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what exactly will be the role of the troops leaving for 
Macedonia in a few hours? It is said to be peacekeeping, but I 
would like to know more specifically what role they will play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, around ten days ago we raised the point that the 
deployment of troops in the Balkans, even for peacekeeping 
purposes, in Macedonia rather than in Kosovo, might prove to be, 
in the short or medium term, the first step towards a military 
presence with an offensive mission in Kosovo itself. 
Admittedly, Macedonia is a lot closer to Kosovo. This is a 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why the Prime Minister is not holding a debate here in 
the House, followed by a vote, as Germany did and as the Czech 
Republic will do if ground troops are to be deployed. Prime 
Minister Jospin also announced France would vote on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the Prime Minister's attitude nor the 
reasons for it. We are not asking to vote on every single 
military maneuver that might take place, on every little move. 
This is not what we are asking for. Rather we are questioning 
the very principle of deploying ground troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover I am told the House must follow parliamentary 
procedure; it just happens that in this House votes take place 
every day after debate, of course. We hold a debate and then we 
vote on a variety of issues much less important than the 
deployment of troops, be it for peacekeeping or an offensive 
military operation. It seems to me it would be in keeping with 
the House's responsibilities to hold a debate, followed by a 
vote, as we do on so many other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I had explained 
it earlier, but I will be glad to explain it again. In preparing 
for an agreement with Belgrade, it was anticipated that troops 
would be involved. We hope an agreement can be reached at the 
earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were asked to send troops so as to be ready. The troops that 
are currently in Macedonia help greatly with the refugees. This 
is one of the reasons we were asked to be there. We have 
helicopters that may eventually fly over Kosovo, but right now 
they can be used to help refugees. The troops will not go to 
Kosovo until there is an agreement. If they must go, I said I 
would come back to the House of Commons with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other issues, it goes without saying that votes are 
held every day. But I explained that, with an issue such as this 
one, the parliamentary system is based on the confidence that 
the House of Commons has in the government. In a situation like 
this one, we assume, since we form the government, that we have 
the authority to act until we lose that confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said that we now have a mechanism that did not exist in 
the past. Nothing prevents opposition parties from asking 
questions during an opposition day. It is not the government's 
responsibility to do that. We will examine any motion to that 
effect and vote on it. However, we assume that we have the 
confidence of the parties in the House. The Bloc Quebecois had 
an opportunity a few days ago. It could have asked a very clear 
question, but instead it asked an ambiguous question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the debate in the House, the Reform Party asked a 
strange question on a motion that had nothing to do with the 
crisis in Kosovo, but referred to a committee holding 
consultations in western Canada. The opposition is not 
interested in using the opportunities that it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point, the issue of confidence will be dealt with 
specifically in a motion. On June 9, a vote will be held in the 
House of Commons on supply for the Department of National 
Defence. The House can vote against this. That is one way of 
going about it. The opposition cannot have it both ways. If it 
does not want us to do this, it should reject the defence budget, 
then we will not be able to go. This would then become a vote of 
confidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I first 
want to say how very much we welcome the decision of the Prime 
Minister to enter this important debate today.  It has been very 
much in the spirit that we intended in introducing the NDP 
opposition motion today that we have this forum to discuss 
further what we are going to do to intensify and accelerate our 
commitment, as a nation, to find a speedy, peaceful, diplomatic 
solution to the Kosovo crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say again, what we have expressed publicly and on the 
record, that we think having an opportunity to vote is an 
important issue.  I have some difficulty in understanding where 
the Prime Minister is coming from because when we were in the 
gulf war we had six votes in the House and no one saw that as an 
erosion of the government's confidence or ability to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question today does not focus on any votes around any 
possible escalation of military effort.  It is our urgent hope 
that the point that we have now reached means that we will not be 
talking about escalating the military effort but rather we will 
be focusing on escalating the diplomatic effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's statement today about the deployment of 
troops for peaceful purposes only is very much in the spirit of 
the position we have set out in our motion.  We will of course be 
very vigilant in making sure that we are only talking about 
peaceful deployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question focuses on the motion that we put before the House 
because that is the debate we are having.  In relation to the 
Prime Minister's assertion about the critical importance of 
Russia's participation in advancing a peaceful solution, the 
Prime Minister knows that Russia has said that under no 
circumstances will its participation be possible if NATO proceeds 
with an oil embargo and the possibility of a naval blockade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, will the Prime Minister assure Canadians today 
that he, on behalf of Canada, and the foreign affairs minister 
and the defence minister, will stake out clear, unequivocal 
opposition to any such course of action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a golden opportunity here to advance peace.  We have an 
opportunity with the foreign affairs minister going to Moscow in 
what I think is increasingly an opening up of diplomatic 
opportunity to say that we will provide leadership in ensuring 
that Russia's position on this issue is respected and that we 
will not do anything to jeopardize the possibility of being able 
to continue to involve Russia in advancing a speedy, peaceful, 
diplomatic solution to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not a 
blockade.  On Sunday I said that we would do nothing to provoke 
the Russians.  The embargo is done.  A lot of people can help to 
ensure that economic isolation is made clear to the government of 
Milosevic.  As I said before, what is the use in bombarding the 
refineries when gasoline will still come in by ship from the 
south to replenish what was lost?  We cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the diplomatic front, when we started collectively to talk 
about only NATO troops there, Canada was the first to say it 
should be enlarged.  The embargo will be a collective decision. 
It will not be a blockade.  We are not planning to use military 
ships to sink Russian tankers.  We are only talking about an 
embargo.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Russians have an interest in finishing it too.  They are 
opposed to the air strikes but they are in favour of Rambouillet. 
There is no doubt about it.  We feel very strongly that we have 
to carry on.  It is not the time to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that it is known Milosevic has been extremely 
skilful at quasi-agreeing to something and then delaying and 
delaying while doing his job.  Now the collective result is to do 
it.  The weakening of his infrastructure is huge and it will 
intensify.  He is completely politically isolated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read, and probably members read it too, that there was hope in 
Belgrade with the news that Russian planes would come to rescue 
them.  They are not there and they will not be there.  The 
Russians like us would like to have a resolution of the conflict 
but the five conditions have to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NATO is not there, the Kosovars will not want to go back.  It 
is very nice to say that there will be no more bombardment, but 
they will think twice before going back to a place that has been 
devastated.  Their homes have been burned by the Serbs and their 
cities have been destroyed.  They are now in Albania.  When we 
ask them to go back home they will want to go back under a 
certain security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another element.  We have to stop the conflict.  A 
group in Kosovo is using arms today to try to make Kosovo 
independent. This is another side of the problem which has to be 
kept in mind. We want peacekeepers there so that the people of 
Kosovo can go home, live a normal life and have the freedoms we 
are all fighting for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
many of my colleagues, I wish to thank the Prime Minister for 
taking the time to come and speak to the House.  We are very 
grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Prime Minister has announced that Canada will be 
sending peacekeeping troops, what we used to call blue berets, 
to Macedonia.  They will not be wearing blue berets, because the 
operation will be NATO-led. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know which countries have asked for this, 
because the Prime Minister said it was NATO that had called for 
troops, not the UNHCR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Prime Minister tell us what contribution other 
countries are making?  By sending troops at this stage, is the 
Prime Minister saying that hostilities will soon be over?  What 
is the rationale for sending peacekeeping troops, at NATO's 
request, to Macedonia right now?  If it is to help refugees, the 
request should perhaps have come to us from the UNHCR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, on the topic of the naval blockade, we are told that this 
is neither a blockade nor an embargo, but simply a check of what 
is going into Yugoslavia.  Would the Prime Minister comment on 
what the newspapers were saying this morning, that the Minister 
of National Defence and a German general said that there is no 
question of using force to stop ships travelling to Yugoslavia 
through Montenegro, nor is there any question of using force to 
stop the entry of Russian oil? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last question is this.  Is the Prime Minister ruling out a 
peacekeeping force other than NATO's in Kosovo, perhaps under 
the UN, with the Russians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just explained the 
role.  The British, the French, the Italians and the Americans 
are already there, under the NATO umbrella. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sent troops in the context of the preparations for the 
Rambouillet agreement, which did not happen.  We were asked to 
do the same.  There have been discussions and now we have 
received an official request, but it came from NATO.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the embargo, we have asked the military to prepare a 
plan.  At present, the details are unknown.  As I explained, 
this is an embargo, which means that weapons will not be used to 
set up a blockade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the details on how this will work, at this point we do 
not know what types all the vessels deployed will be exactly. 
Some are completely above-board.  It must also be kept in mind 
that the democratically elected government of Montenegro must 
not be weakened any more than necessary.  Montenegro is a fairly 
independent province of Yugoslavia, and things between it and 
the government in Belgrade are rather tense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the focus must not be on the south at the 
expense of our actions in northern Kosovo and in the Belgrade 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that the peace force sent to Kosovo will be a UN 
force.  That is what we want.  I do not know if that will be 
possible, but more than NATO is needed, and we have already said 
so in this House, last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the word from Brussels was that only NATO troops should 
be involved, personally, I remain convinced that the Russians 
and Ukrainians are needed in order to make the foreign presence 
in Yugoslavia more acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had an opportunity to speak to President Kuchma.  Not 
many have contacts with the government in Belgrade, but he has 
sent his Minister of Defence and Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
Belgrade. 
He has given me his view of the situation, and among the points 
he raised, I agreed with him that countries other than NATO 
countries ought to be involved in any future peace force.

today, I would like to comment on what we have heard this 
afternoon from the Prime Minister.  I appreciate his being in the 
House to present this information and his giving Canadians and 
members a brief lecture on politics 101 and the executive 
authority of the government in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Prime Minister and the executive branch of 
government that along with their executive decision making power 
comes something called executive responsibility.  The opposition 
will be holding the government accountable for every action it 
takes which seems to be inappropriate to the official opposition 
and to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to that I have great concerns over the types of 
troops we have heard are being deployed to the Balkans.  The 
Prime Minister has given us very few details about those troops. 
He has given us a number of 800 troops, but he has said very 
little about their role and their missions of operation. He has 
said very little about all of these things.  I get the assurance 
from the defence minister that he will also speak to these 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the House agrees executive decision making is 
in the mandate of the Government of Canada as is executive 
responsibility.  We will do everything to make sure the proper 
troops are deployed and the capabilities are there.  We all know 
the government has reduced military capability over the last five 
years since it came into power.  It will be held to account for 
all those things.  The auditor general has pointed it out.  The 
chief of the defence staff has also pointed out the capability 
deficit we have now after six years of Liberal dominance in the 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I digress.  I rose this afternoon on behalf of the 
people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak to the opposition motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government to intensify and 
accelerate efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in 
Kosovo through the involvement of Russia and the United Nations, 
and to urge NATO not to take actions that expand the conflict and 
stand in the way of a diplomatic solution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate members of the Canadian Armed Forces, 
particularly those in the air force who have done a superb job in 
executing the sorties and missions they have been given over the 
last 35 days.  All Canadians should take time to thank them for 
that, and to pray for their safe and speedy return to Canada. All 
of us want to see a diplomatic solution to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein lies the problem with the motion.  In the way it was 
written it makes it sound as though we have not been concerned 
about a diplomatic solution.  In the newspapers I read on a daily 
basis and in the media reports I see, the diplomatic flurry of 
activity surrounding Kofi Annan, the ministers from Russia, our 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and other interested parties has 
definitely increased.  Canada must show its absolute resolve not 
to fray away from its NATO allies in this terrible tragedy 
happening in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion lays out some assumptions that the Russians and the 
UN have been kept out of the negotiations.  I feel that is 
totally false.  I would not even want to be sending that message. 
That is why I cannot support the motion before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the UN has been in the Balkans 
for most of this decade, trying to resolve various territorial 
and ethnic disputes.  There is increased diplomatic activity 
going on right now, but there has been such activity for the last 
10 years.  We have tried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the NDP think this is some whim NATO has embarked 
upon for no good reason, they are sadly mistaken.  We have to 
remember Canada's involvement.  We have a stake in it as well. 
Eleven of our peacekeepers have died through peacekeeping 
operations in the Balkans.  I do not say that lightly.  I am 
quite concerned about that.  Do we have a stake in it?  Of course 
we do, because those people did not die in vain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO has taken military initiative due to the failure of an 
agreement in the UN to take action against Serb ethnic cleansing 
in Kosovo.  Russia and China would oppose UN sanctioned action in 
the security council.  We know that full well.  Kofi Annan has 
even identified that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous to say that Russia has been excluded.  Russia 
is important.  Every media report, everything we see, shows that 
all the stakeholders are trying to get Russia involved.  Russia 
is seen as an important mediator to end this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind members of the House and maybe my colleagues in 
the New Democratic Party of the goals.  I am not condemning the 
NDP for bringing the motion forward.  They drafted the motion in 
the spirit of wanting to find a solution, but I do not think 
there has been a lot of thought into what they are saying here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, one of NATO's goals is to end ethnic cleansing.  Second 
is the withdrawal of Serb forces.  Third, refugees must be 
allowed to return to their homes in Kosovo.  Fourth, NATO 
peacekeepers must be allowed to enter Kosovo.  Fifth is a 
political solution.  That is the fifth link in the NATO agreement 
to which the 19 member states have agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already striking Yugoslavia with our NATO air forces to 
reduce the ability of the Yugoslavian military and paramilitary 
to commit aggression. 
This is very, very important and it is working.  The evidence 
shows that this tactic is working.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments made yesterday by the deputy prime minister of 
Yugoslavia show that the political decision making powers are 
fraying on their side.  We cannot allow them to fray on our side. 
NATO must maintain its resolve to continue the campaign until the 
Yugoslavian leadership accepts a negotiated settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this type of motion I would have to ask what kind of 
message are we trying to send to Mr. Milosevic?  He would love 
this motion, because this motion shows cracks in NATO's resolve. 
I just do not think that is appropriate at this juncture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have successful air operations continuing.  We are reducing 
the Yugoslavian army capability.  That is very important and 
there are signs that a political solution may be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also remind people that on April 12 the Leader of the 
Opposition laid out some principal objectives in supporting the 
government and NATO.  The first was that it attains the moral 
objective of halting ethnic cleansing.  Second was that we 
achieve the political objective of creating safe homes for 
Kosovars and stabilize the region through negotiations.  Third 
was that we pursue the military objective of damaging the 
military capabilities of Yugoslavia to reduce its capacity to 
practise ethnic cleansing and bring the Yugoslavian government to 
the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was home on the weekend I met up with a World War II 
veteran and I had a conversation with him.  His name is 
Lieutenant Colonel Harry Kwarton. I said to Harry, “Sir, what do 
you think of what is going on right now?” He said to me, “At 
the end of the second world war we told the world that we would 
never let this happen again, and you bet we are doing the right 
thing by being there and supporting this”.  I think we are on 
the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate our troops and again remind the 
government that I for one will be holding it responsible for its 
executive decision making.  It had better make sure that the 
capabilities it commits are the proper ones and we have the 
ability to do the job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
once again I am pleased to stand in the House on behalf of the 
constituents of Edmonton East and contribute to a very important 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a proud war history, but our role in this conflict is 
very different from our triumphs in Europe earlier this century. 
While I support the troops no matter where in the world they are 
sent, I too share some reservations with respect to our role and 
long term plan, if there is one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is prepared to support our involvement 
under the following guidelines with respect to the war in 
Yugoslavia.  We must obtain the moral objective and halt the 
ethnic cleansing that has been perpetrated by the Yugoslav 
government.  We need to achieve the political objective of 
creating a safe home for Kosovars by stabilizing relations 
between the federal republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours 
through peaceful negotiations.  We will pursue the military 
objectives of damaging the offensive military capability of the 
Yugoslav government and reduce its capacity to practise ethnic 
cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No country in history has ever been conventionally bombed into 
total submission and likely never will.  It is clearly evident 
even to most armchair generals that a more comprehensive plan is 
required.  The largest participant in this mission, the United 
States, knows all too well that a 20th century ground war would 
be both ugly and deadly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Military force is only a tool with which to achieve our 
objectives.  The Reform Party has noted that it is prepared to 
support military force and the commitment of Canadian forces only 
if our government demonstrates to this House that new commitments 
from Canada are needed to halt ethnic cleansing and to provide 
for a safe return of Kosovar refugees and that the government 
demonstrates to the House that all Canadian duties fall within 
Canada's existing military capabilities and guidelines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now the Liberal government has not been open with 
parliament and the Canadian people.  The three take note debates 
on the crisis have been little more than a public relations 
token.  Canada's elected government has really had no say at all. 
Most recently this issue came up with regard to ground troop 
deployment.  Any naval blockade is also an escalation in this 
conflict and in my view deserves the attention that ground troops 
are due too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last debate was on April 12 and took place two weeks after 
Canadians were already involved in the conflict.  The government 
informed parliament of Canada's involvement in the bombings when 
Canadian planes were in the air.  Most important, there has never 
been any vote in parliament on Canada's involvement in the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has played no role in setting the parameters for 
involvement once again if we end up enforcing a NATO naval 
blockade. We must not fool ourselves into thinking that stopping 
ships on the high seas will not escalate this crisis.  We must 
have clearly understood rules of engagement before we embark on 
any escalation in or around Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must change its approach and keep parliament 
fully informed and involved.  Canadians call on the government to 
give parliament a role in setting the parameters and conditions 
for continued or additional Canadian military participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has supported the use of air power as a means 
to stop Serb ethnic cleansing activities in Kosovo and to force 
Mr. Milosevic to the negotiating table.  The air campaign has 
been presented as the best alternative.  It would not have been 
acceptable or morally right to sit idly by and watch fellow 
humans massacred and driven from their homes.  It would have 
handed the president a victory and fed his appetite for greater 
conquests.  On their own, air strikes might not exert the 
necessary pressure to encourage Serb disengagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human race has witnessed acts of genocide throughout its 
history.  Genocide is not solely the horrendous byproduct of 
certain wars.  Incidents of genocide are not war related at all. 
Genocide is also a failure of humanity, the dark side of a 
civilization run amok.  We must admit that Kosovo unchecked could 
be just this, death and destruction of homes and whole families 
by dictate of a man gone mad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for groups that have been decimated by genocidal 
acts that the world remember the particular atrocities in order 
to learn and understand what happened.  Groups affected by 
genocidal acts want only to be remembered.  The genocides of 
world history cannot be distinguished on the basis of size and 
scope.  It is commonly understood that our history has witnessed 
one holocaust and many attempted genocides.  In my view genocide 
should be regarded more as a failure of civilization than a 
product of war, whether it be the Ukrainian famine, the Cambodian 
killing fields, the Holocaust, or now reportedly Kosovo. In my 
view Canada should institutionalize remembrance through the 
construction of a stand alone world genocide museum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO's collective strategy is seemingly starting to have an 
effect.  We ought to give it more time to work.  However, as the 
situation on the ground in Kosovo changes and new commitments are 
considered, the government must demonstrate to this House that 
any such commitments still fulfil the primary objective of 
stopping and reversing ethnic cleansing and Milosevic's genocidal 
tendencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our pilots and troops are to be congratulated for the fine 
effort they have been making.  They have been doing their best to 
help reverse this tide of inhumanity.  For that we should be 
proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The families of ground force peacekeepers in past missions 
worried daily.  Children had no idea of what horrors their 
parents had witnessed and had little understanding when their 
parents returned home permanently different from when they had 
left.  Post-traumatic disorders are serious, debilitating and 
devastating to families who seek to pick up from where they left 
off months earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committing Canada's ground force troops will undoubtedly mean 
facing these challenges and trials again. 
Are we learning from past experiences?  We must be extremely 
careful in planning our troop deployment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago retired Major General Lewis MacKenzie stated in 
the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we are not in a position to participate in any prolonged ground 
offensive in Kosovo.... During the past 20 years, successive 
governments, both Liberals and Tories, have used Canada's modest 
military as a cash cow which has resulted in a dramatic reduction 
of its operational capability. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments were made by one of Canada's most respected 
military leaders.  General MacKenzie is saying that the ability 
of the Canadian forces to sustain long term ground operations, 
especially those far from home, has been sharply eroded by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993 and 2000 there will have been $9 billion in defence 
cuts.  About 18,000 troops have been cut.  Morale is at rock 
bottom, especially when money is being spent on sex change 
operations and combat bras. Our soldiers are lining up at food 
banks and wearing hand me down battle uniforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see the distinction between the escalation by land or 
by sea.  Whether it is a blockade or an embargo, an escalation is 
just that and has inherent dangers and concerns.  Putting our 
frigates on front line service as floating targets is daunting 
enough.  To do so without clear objectives, plans of action and 
with poorly understood engagement rules in my mind is reckless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should clearly define the role of our naval contribution with 
every bit of seriousness as that we would with ground troops. The 
government must allow the military leadership of the Canadian 
forces to be more honest and forthcoming.  Our military command 
must be allowed to brief all members of our involvement.  We 
understand that sensitivity and confidentiality are very 
important in military planning and we would be pleased to have 
the briefings in camera.  For the sake of our troops' safety we 
must remember that the need to know must be appropriately 
balanced through careful disclosure and full public debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this motion 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say clearly at the outset that we in Canada, we in the 
government, seek peace.  As always we prefer to seek peace 
through peaceful means. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its quest for peace and security, Canada has always favoured 
diplomacy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our diplomatic heritage has become a tradition that we further 
at all opportunities.  It is something that we are justifiably 
proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even our elder statesman of diplomacy, the former Prime 
Minister Lester Pearson, the father of peacekeeping, understood 
that military force had a necessary role in achieving peace and 
security.  Why?  Because sometimes words and threats are not 
enough.  Negotiations require two parties at the table together 
believing in what their words and promises can achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been and are willing to sit at that table.  At this 
point President Milosevic is not. Let me remind the House of Mr. 
Milosevic's appalling track record when it comes to willingness 
to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1998 the United Nations passed resolution 1160 calling 
on all parties to reach a peaceful settlement.  This was followed 
by UN resolution 1199 in September.  It demanded that both sides 
cease hostilities and improve the rapidly deteriorating 
humanitarian situation in the region. In October 1998, backed by 
the threat of NATO air power, an agreement was reached that 
established a ceasefire and allowed for an observer mission led 
by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to 
verify compliance.  The agreement also called for strict limits 
on the deployment of the Yugoslav security forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, and true to form as we have seen over many years, 
Mr. Milosevic did not keep his word. 
Yugoslav forces violated the ceasefire, responded 
disproportionately to the actions of the Kosovo Liberation Army 
and carried out a campaign against civilians in clear violation 
of international humanitarian law.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this gross misconduct, we still gave negotiations 
another chance.  Talks quickly began in Rambouillet, France. 
These negotiations sought a peaceful solution by balancing the 
interests and the demands of the parties.  The interim agreement 
we reached provided for a high degree of autonomy for Kosovo, but 
as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  In the end the 
Kosovars agreed.  They exercised courage and they signed the 
agreement.  Mr. Milosevic did not.  Eleventh hour efforts by U.S. 
envoy Richard Holbrooke proved fruitless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By March 24 we realized that the diplomatic track to that point 
in time had run its course.  Our patience and our commitment to 
leave no diplomatic stone unturned was once again rewarded by Mr. 
Milosevic's unwillingness to honour the agreements that he had 
made or to seek a peaceful resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just described the long history of our diplomatic efforts 
to stand against Milosevic's tyranny.  This crisis represents a 
fundamental challenge to the values of democracy, human rights 
and the rule of law.  These are values which Canadians have 
defended in words, but also in deeds in the first and the second 
world wars, in Korea and, more recently, in the gulf war.  They 
are also values that NATO has upheld since its inception some 50 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military actions are justified.  We have been forced to use 
the military tool because the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has 
repeatedly violated United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
It has spurned attempts to forge a negotiated peace, with 
catastrophic results to the people of Kosovo.  The unrestrained 
assault by the Yugoslav military police and paramilitary forces 
on Kosovar civilians has created a massive humanitarian 
catastrophe and threatens to destabilize the surrounding region. 
These have been extreme, calculated and criminal policies.  They 
cannot be defended on any ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  The military action against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia supports the political aims of the 
international community.  Our objective is to foster a return to 
a peaceful multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo in which all of its 
people can live in security and enjoy universal human rights and 
freedoms on an equal basis.  Canada and its allies are united in 
this objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an objective that is supported by the UN Secretary General 
and the European Union, and by Russia.  Even Russian efforts to 
seek a negotiated settlement were met with half-hearted 
concessions and a flagrant disregard for the need to respect 
basic human rights and international law.  However, the alliance 
shares a common interest with Russia in reaching a political 
solution to the crisis in Kosovo and will work constructively 
with Russia to this end wherever possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of the forthcoming mission of my colleague, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, and we wish him well in his efforts to help 
bring that about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community is united in its ultimate preference 
for a negotiated settlement in this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I finish I would like to provide some additional 
information on the latest developments.  As the Prime Minister 
indicated just a few moments ago, Canada has now received a 
formal request from NATO to deploy to the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia the military contingent we had identified 
some months ago as our contribution to the international peace 
implementation process in Kosovo.  We have agreed to this 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia will consist of up to 800 people and will be equipped 
with about 280 vehicles and eight Griffon helicopters.  Its main 
components will be a reconnaissance squadron, which will be 
capable of conducting surveillance and security operations in 
Kosovo.  In fact, they will be using some of the latest 
equipment, such as the Coyote. 
The helicopter unit which I mentioned will carry out airborne 
surveillance, transport and medical evacuation missions.  Also 
added to this team of about 600 people will be 200 combat 
engineers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our force will operate as part of a British armoured brigade 
within the NATO led allied rapid reaction core.  That is why we 
are going to Macedonia.  That is where the British brigade is 
located.  These troops and these functions complement and 
supplement those which the British will be providing.  We 
currently work with them in SFOR in Bosnia and it will be a 
similar kind of arrangement in Macedonia.  The British already 
have troops in the region and they are counting on us to be there 
with them.  The secretary of defence for the U.K. specifically 
said that to me in a meeting held last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take our force up to 60 days, we hope a little less, to 
reach the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and become 
operationally ready.  This period is necessary to assemble the 
required military equipment and logistical supplies, move them by 
rail to Montreal and then by ship to Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister pointed out, our Canadian forces 
contingent will be part of an international peace implementation 
force.  In other words, they will be peacekeepers.  Although a 
peace settlement has not yet been reached, deploying our people 
now will serve two important purposes.  First, it will allow our 
force to integrate fully with the British brigade and to train 
with them so that they can respond rapidly and effectively when a 
settlement is reached.  Second, our troops will be able to 
provide immediate support to ongoing humanitarian operations in 
the region until and after a peace settlement is reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our military campaign we are achieving what we set out to 
do.  The cost of standing idly by is being measured in the lives 
of our fellow human beings.  We have seen so far a callous and 
ominous disregard for human security.  Canada always prefers a 
diplomatic solution.  Our tradition has always been to appeal to 
the powers of reason and to try to achieve peace without the use 
of force or even the threat of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have gained a deserved reputation as a peacekeeper, 
no one should ever forget that we have never and will never shy 
away from the stronger means if that is what is necessary to 
pursue peace and human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
minister mentioned troops in Macedonia, saying that they will be 
equipped with Griffon helicopters, which will conduct security 
operations in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to elaborate on this because we were under the 
impression, after listening to the Prime Minister's statements, 
that our troops would be stationed in Macedonia only. There was 
no mention of Kosovo for the time being, but the minister said 
there will be security operations in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean there will be forays into Kosovo? I would like 
the Minister of National Defence to elaborate on this.

mention at the beginning of my speech that I will be splitting my

</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question, we are pre-deploying our troops to 
FYROM, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for eventual 
movement into Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping mission when a 
ceasefire and a peace settlement has been reached.  That has 
always been the plan.  That was what was talked about in terms of 
the Rambouillet agreement, that we would have an international 
military presence in Kosovo to ensure the peace and security of 
Kosovo and for the Kosovars to be able to live in peace and 
security.

order.  I wonder if you would seek the unanimous consent of the 
House to extend the time for questions to be put to the minister 
by about five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is 
asking the House for unanimous consent to extend the period by 
five minutes.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
have now had the announcement today that the troops are moving 
closer and closer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the terrible destruction of innocent people in 
Kosovo.  They have been raped and murdered, their houses burned 
and their livelihoods destroyed.  The hearts of all Canadians go 
out to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what has been happening.  NATO leaders huffed and 
puffed and then they started to bomb.  In the meantime, Milosevic 
has continued his ethnic cleansing and the situation has 
worsened.  We now have the announcement that troops are moving 
next door into Macedonia.  There is this creeping effect that 
seems to be dragging us more and more into this morass each and 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what is going to be left of the Kosovars and Kosovo by 
the time we get around to pushing Milosevic out of that region so 
that these people can live peacefully.  What kind of timetable 
does the minister have?  It seems to me that by the time this 
thing drags out at the speed that NATO is moving there will be 
nothing left to save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
concern expressed by the hon. member.  We have that concern as 
well.  We are anxious that this matter be brought to an end as 
quickly as it possibly can, using both military and diplomatic 
means.  We want to see a solution to this matter as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air campaign is being intensified.  Additional aircraft are 
going into the area.  The Apache helicopters will soon be 
deployed.  As the weather gets better more sorties will be 
carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that we want to do this.  We would rather have 
Milosevic come to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put in place last fall this air operation plan.  We then 
spent every bit of time between then and March 24 trying to find 
a diplomatic resolution to the matter.  Still we must seek every 
opportunity to find that diplomatic resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, so far Mr. Milosevic has not yielded to what the 
international community asks of him, to pull back his troops and 
to let the Kosovars return to their homes.  Yes, they are going 
to have to rebuild their homes.  A lot of them have been burned 
out.  They are going to need help in doing that.  In fact the 
entire region is going to need help in reconstructing itself and 
moving forward economically.  A lot of reconstruction work will 
have to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far Mr. Milosevic has not yielded.  He ignores the 
international community.  He goes on with his ethnic cleansing 
and the butchering of the people of Kosovo.  We cannot stand by 
idly.  We have done everything we can to this point in terms of 
diplomacy.  We will continue to do things in terms of diplomacy, 
but meanwhile the air campaign will intensify until the Yugoslav 
government comes to the table and agrees to the terms.  Then we 
can put in place a peacekeeping force, which will include 800 
Canadians, to make sure that the Kosovars can return to their 
homes in peace and security.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I tend to agree with the minister this time.  It does not always 
happen, but I think we are making the right move this time in 
moving in our peacekeepers.  In fact, we said before that they 
probably should be there so they have a better chance to 
pre-train, as the minister said, and become a little more 
inter-operable with their British counterparts, with whom they 
will be working in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the training background of the troops we are planning to 
send?  Has it been strictly in peacekeeping?  Will they be 
prepared to defend the borders, for instance, if there are 
incursions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments and the support of the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead.  I am pleased to receive particularly his 
remark that this is the right move to make.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the training they have received, all our troops 
that go overseas or to any mission receive standard training of 
combat capability.  Part of the 1994 defence white paper was to 
have multipurpose combat capable troops.  They also receive 
specific training relevant to the mission and relevant to 
peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peacekeeping nowadays, as we have seen in Bosnia and in other 
areas, requires our troops to be able to defend themselves 
because of some very difficult circumstances. The Medak pocket 
was a great example of that in Bosnia a number of years ago. They 
have to be combat capable because peacekeeping can be dangerous 
at times.  Over 100 Canadians in the years that we have been 
involved in peacekeeping have lost their lives in peacekeeping 
missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have received standard combat capable training, specific 
training relevant to peacekeeping and specific training relevant 
to this mission.  They will continue to get training while they 
are in Macedonia with the British brigade because we want the 
units to work well together.  Our Canadians will be 
self-sustaining.  They will be a sustainable force but they will 
work with the British and will get further training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the borders, each of those countries has 
responsibility for their borders.  We will also be there helping 
out in terms of the refugee problem wherever we can be of help. 
We would certainly want to make sure the refugees are protected, 
so there may be occasions when we could be involved.  We hope 
that will not be the case in terms of that kind of defence.  The 
essential responsibility for the borders belongs to each of the 
surrounding countries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
question will be very brief.  With respect to the 800 troops that 
will be deployed, the minister mentioned combat capable.  Does 
this mean these troops will be armed?  Second, where will these 
troops be coming from, which particular area of Canada, which 
base? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, they will be 
armed just as they are armed in Bosnia, as they are armed in most 
other theatres of peacekeeping operation.  They will be armed and 
able to defend themselves if that becomes necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be deployed out of Edmonton, Alberta.  As I indicated 
earlier there will be some 280 vehicles.  Those vehicles will 
start to move toward Montreal.  They will then be put on a ship 
and sent to Europe and then taken from there into the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Because of the extra sense of urgency, the even added 
sense of urgency that has come about as a result of the Prime 
Minister's statement, I seek unanimous consent of the House to 
extend the question and comment period by five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to extend the question and comment period by five 
minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
certainly am very pleased and thank the House for the unanimous 
consent to extend the question and comment period.  This is an 
extremely sensitive situation and an extremely important issue of 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister expressed support for Canadians accelerating 
the conflict in the Balkans in two ways:  first by the 
possibility of putting an embargo in place and second by sending 
Canadian troops to the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of National Defence.  Are we in 
fact at war now?  Has the government now decided that Canada is 
at war and, if not, should the decision of whether Canada goes to 
war be made by the executive branch of government or by 
parliament, by all members of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question has to do with the chief of defence staff. 
We are sending 800 troops to the area.  They are going as 
peacekeepers.  The minister said that.  However, with the 
acceleration of the conflict, it is quite possible that these 
troops could be involved in full combat before this situation is 
over.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister have assurance from the chief of defence 
staff, the person who would make decisions about the capability 
of our troops and whether they are properly equipped, that if it 
becomes a full combat situation Canadian troops can in fact meet 
the obligations that NATO will place on them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, with respect to 
the question of whether or not this is called a war, I think most 
people call it that.  However there are also legal implications 
of using that term.  That term has not been used in the case of 
this conflict by either side.  In fact it was not officially used 
in Korea.  Korea was called a war by everybody but that was not 
part of the official terminology.  Neither was it in the gulf. 
People will call things as they see them, but there is no change 
in the status as a result of what has been announced today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would beg to differ that the actions we have taken today are 
accelerating the conflict.  We are sending troops over to be part 
of a peacekeeping mission.  That has been made quite clear.  It 
has also been made clear that if they change to doing anything 
else, anything that involves a heavier kind of conflict or less 
permissive kind of atmosphere going in on the ground into Kosovo, 
that matter would come back for debate in parliament and would 
require a decision of the government as well.  That commitment 
sticks.  These people are only going over there for that 
business.  That hardly accelerates the conflict.  They are just 
going over as peacekeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of what they are capable of doing, they are capable of 
being involved in a greater combat situation than we would hope 
peacekeeping would involve because they are trained as combat 
capable troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be speculation on the different kinds of readiness 
they would require, depending upon where we end up in terms of 
going into Kosovo, but our military planners are looking at a 
number of options.  That is as far as it goes because the 
commitment at this point in time is to continue with and 
intensify the air campaign and to have the 800 troops as part of 
a peacekeeping force that would go into Kosovo when a ceasefire 
peace agreement has been reached. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
thought there was unanimous consent to give the member five more 
minutes. He already has had five additional minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The five minutes have 
expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, there 
are times in politics which go beyond partisanship; I believe 
the motion before us today is one of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I am speaking for all of us here, and certainly for 
all Canadians, when I say that our priority is to reach a 
lasting and peaceful solution as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke last week about Kosovo, as did many of my 
colleagues, I mentioned that a peaceful solution would be more 
likely if the Russian government were involved on a more 
proactive basis. The Prime Minister also pointed this out on 
several occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I really congratulate the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, who is soon to leave for Moscow to urge the Russian 
government to participate proactively in the quest for a 
solution involving the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The talks the minister is about to embark on with Russia, 
together with certain NATO colleagues and the UN secretary 
general, could open the door to the possibility of a real and 
lasting solution. I believe this is the way to go in this 
conflict.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we must do whatever we can, together with the UN 
community, to avoid an escalation of the conflict including a 
naval blockade, which will make it all that more difficult to 
enlist Russian co-operation.  We must resist at all cost the 
temptation placed in our way by the British, among others, to 
escalate the NATO intervention toward an eventual ground war.  I 
rejoice in this connection.  At a summit meeting in Washington 
last week NATO leaders, including our Prime Minister, rejected 
the use of ground forces for military purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, however, we all agree that Canada should play a leading 
role in the peacekeeping effort.  In this sense I welcome the 
intervention of the Prime Minister and the Minister of National 
Defence today that we will get ready with our peacekeeping forces 
to participate actively in that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than ever now we must put our partisan differences aside 
and support wholeheartedly the initiative of the foreign minister 
and his colleagues in the search for prompt diplomatic solutions 
which might include economic and other sanctions through the 
United Nations, a solution which will achieve the return home of 
the Kosovars so savagely cast away from their rightful place and 
home in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any solution should guarantee a lasting peace, and we are 
committed to guaranteeing a lasting peace through peacekeeping 
operations and the return of the Kosovars home to lead a normal 
life again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this will be a UN peacekeeping force which will include a 
broad spectrum of the various nations that usually participate in 
peacekeeping operations.  We must be mindful that any solution 
will include the need to have a plan for reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of the Kosovars into their rightful homes and the 
reconstruction of the damage caused by the conflict.  Once peace 
has returned it will take a formidable international challenge 
including massive financial resources both to guarantee peace and 
to ensure reconstruction and renewal of Kosovo and the areas 
destroyed by the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I join with all of us in the House in praying that the 
initiative of the foreign minister will be successful.  I wish 
him and his colleagues in NATO and other countries, including the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, a successful and 
positive result in Moscow and Godspeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his comments.  He spoke about the 
peacekeeping force and I am sure he heard earlier the hon. 
minister speak about that force as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member, being on the government side, have any 
knowledge of whether or not the Russians have been informed of 
this massing of troops?  Would he feel that might jeopardize or 
impair ongoing diplomatic efforts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not have any 
particular knowledge except that there are now some 12,000 troops 
already in place for peacekeeping purposes in the same way as our 
800 troops will be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister confirmed that these troops are there purely 
in anticipation of a peacekeeping role in Kosovo.  The foreign 
minister is going to Moscow this week.  I am sure he will assure 
the Russians that this is the intention of the troops there 
including ours.  I do not see it prejudicing any possibility of a 
solution involving the Russians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we have now been 
discussing the problems in Kosovo for more than a month.  I 
believe it is important for us to examine the progress we have 
made because the Prime Minister has just told us that he is now 
sending troops to Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is, briefly, as follows: Kosovar refugees have 
been driven out of Kosovo.  Of these, some 140,000 are in 
Macedonia, 375,000 in Albania, and 75,000 in Montenegro.  Some 
are in France, and a few in England.  It is estimated that, in 
all, about 735,000 Kosovars have been forced out of their 
country. 
In addition, it is estimated that another 500,000 to 800,000 
have been forced out of their homes but remain within Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that there are about two million Albanians in 
Kosovo, this means that more than three-quarters of the 
population is now experiencing instability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation requires us to ask ourselves what our reaction 
should be, as a country that is outside this theatre of military 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we cannot be insensitive to the situation, but it 
must be kept in mind that what we are seeking first of all is to 
restore peace.  We also seek to prevent more Kosovars being 
forced out of their country.  We seek to restore peace.  We want 
to see the expelled Kosovars be allowed to return to their 
country of origin and start to rebuild. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we cannot oppose any action that might lead to the 
achievement of these objectives.  The last measure we discussed 
was an embargo by NATO members and neighbouring countries to 
block oil supplies to Serbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if, after we have bombed oil refineries and destroyed 
this means of oil production, they succeed in obtaining oil 
supplies from outside, we have not really resolved the problem. 
There are in fact countries that would stand to benefit since, 
for them, this is a new export target.  It could be economically 
attractive, as a stopgap measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a blockade.  I think that was made 
clear.  Setting up a blockade could be very dangerous, because 
it assumes military force will be used against tankers bringing 
supplies to Serbia. 
There could be Russian tankers among these ships, and the 
Russians are sympathetic to the Serbian cause, at present.  Will 
we open up new fronts?  I think we have to be very careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An embargo implies the willing consent of all possible oil 
suppliers.  If the international community is aware of the 
danger Kosovo represents, it should willingly agree to this 
embargo and refuse to deliver oil to this country in conflict.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best solution is still patience, diplomacy and political 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true we are dropping bombs, and there are skirmishes. 
There is no ground combat, but there is air combat.  However, we 
must think that, beyond the fighting, there will have to be 
peace one day. So every action taken today must be taken, 
considered and planned according to what will happen at the end 
of the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to crush a people and a political regime, 
but to crush the feelings and emotions of a people is something 
else.  These people will have to live together after the 
conflict and live in peace. 
The Kosovars and the Serbs will have to live next to each other 
and maintain economic, social and political relations. They will 
have to accept to live as a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When two peoples are pitted against each other, they can be 
forced to cohabit. They can be physically forced to do 
something, but we cannot change their souls, their minds, their 
feelings and their emotions through force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of this conflict may be felt for many years, if 
not generations. This is why we must carefully measure the 
impact of each action, to avoid exacerbating the psychological 
state of those who will have to live together after the conflict 
has ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must save lives, not only the lives of Kosovars, who are 
currently mistreated and forced from their homes, but also the 
lives of Serbs. There are Serbs who are innocent in this 
conflict. There is a president, a dictator who does not care 
about the population. However, there are also innocent Serbs who 
are being forced to take military action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all the Serbs are prepared to take arms in this conflict. 
These people also deserve to live. They too are at the mercy of 
a tyrant and they will need understanding and help. Their lives 
deserve to be saved just like those of the Kosovars and of the 
people in neighbouring countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instability in the Balkans would pose a threat to all of Europe 
and perhaps even to the other countries that might be drawn into 
a world war. 
We must take great care that this goal of saving lives now does 
not lead us to thoughtless acts of war that would yield 
undesirable results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, the decisions being made are very serious. This is 
why we congratulated the Prime Minister today on informing us of 
Canada's most recent decision to send troops over there.  We are 
delighted that the House was the first to be informed, but we 
believe this is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still ask for a vote on this and on the deployment of troops. 
We do not know what the future will bring.

their pension surplus and turn it into a personal account for the

Canada would be committing peacekeeping forces to Kosovo.  The 
mission would be to enforce a peace agreement when it is reached 
with the Yugoslav government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are being asked to commit peacekeepers to Kosovo, is 
the government assuming that there will soon be a peace agreement 
to enforce there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we hope there will be a peace agreement and we are 
working hard to try to achieve one.  As I said in the House 
yesterday, there are a number of active discussions going on. 
There are a number of interventions taking place in Moscow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some indication has come out of Belgrade that certain political 
leaders there are of a mind to do it.  We are actively engaged in 
trying to get a diplomatic process together to get agreement on 
the five points that have been raised, and particularly come to 
grips with the fundamental issue of having an international force 
in Kosovo to protect refugees.  That is the key issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say to the hon. Leader of the Opposition is that we 
are making every effort, along with many others, to try to bring 
that about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if there are no solid signs from the Yugoslav government 
that it is prepared to commit to a peace agreement, what is the 
government really committing these troops to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these ground troops enter Kosovo, even under the umbrella of 
a tentative peace agreement, is there not a real possibility that 
they will find themselves involved in a serious armed conflict 
and what we are really being asked to do is to commit ground 
troops to the conflict in Yugoslavia? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister said today, these 
800 troops are being sent over in connection with peacekeeping 
functions.  They will be located in Macedonia.  They will be 
working with a British brigade.  That is why they are going to 
that specific location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already some 12,000 troops in Macedonia who are there 
for purposes of moving into Kosovo when a peace agreement is 
reached.  Then we will go in there to help bring about peace and 
security for the people of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other reason for them to be there.  As the Prime 
Minister has said, if there is any change in those terms or 
conditions there would be further debate in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what we do not want to do is commit 800 Canadian troops 
to a peacekeeping role in Kosovo and then three, four or five 
weeks down the road have the government come back and tell us 
that these troops are now engaged in a full ground war because 
the peace agreement collapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure that these troops are committed to 
enforcing a peace, in other words not making war.  If what the 
Prime Minister wants is a commitment of Canadian ground forces to 
peacekeeping activities only, why does he not bring a clear, 
votable motion to that effect before parliament? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will make the position very clear.  We have already 
had four take note debates on this matter.  There has been 
general assent for the idea of Canadian troops being involved in 
peacekeeping activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see any change from that situation as compared to what 
the Prime Minister had to say so eloquently this morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that could be some comfort except that this morning a top 
American envoy met with the Russian government.  Those 
negotiations were hampered by the NATO embargo of Russian ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO has a no compromise position that makes it hard, if not 
impossible, to broker a peace deal.  How could this NATO no 
compromise position ever entice the Russians to broker a peace 
deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not quite sure what this no compromise position 
is that the hon. member talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just come from a NATO summit where the basic outreach to 
the Russians was strongly endorsed by all the countries.  We 
talked about the need to have a broader international force, not 
just a NATO force.  We talked about the importance of developing 
major initiatives in the Balkan region to help in the 
reconstruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a no compromise position.  What there is 
no compromise on is the fundamental principle of securing the 
safety and rights of the people of Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  We agree, Mr.

Foreign Affairs will soon follow the American envoy, the UN 
secretary general and the foreign minister of Greece in a 
diplomatic mission to Moscow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What specifically will our Minister of Foreign Affairs be able 
to bring to the table in Moscow that is not already being offered

himself? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
To begin with, Mr. Speaker, I hope the one thing I can bring is 
the full endorsement of the House, representing all Canadians, to 
find a peaceful resolution.  That is what I hope I can bring.  I 
hope we can be assured of that matter, because we decided coming 
out of the Washington meetings that it was important to engage in 
a dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, one thing we have very much in common with the 
Russian government at this point in time is that we both want to 
see an involvement of the United Nations Security Council as a 
major player in helping to secure a peaceful resolution.  That is 
something we can identify with and work with the Russians on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to this morning's Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, while the European 
Union is trying to put an oil embargo in place against 
Yugoslavia, some U.S. companies are selling oil to Yugoslavia. 
This would appear to be a completely ridiculous situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell us whether some U.S. 
companies are indeed delivering petroleum products to 
Yugoslavia, in violation of the European embargo? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if that is the case, but 
the United States government, along with the European Union 
governments, would want to ensure that such products which are 
supporting the war effort of the Yugoslav government would not 
get into Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea behind the embargo that NATO would be involved in 
policing would ensure the will of these individual governments is 
met when merchant ships are coming toward that harbour. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find it somewhat surprising that the minister would not be aware 
of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it is rather important to be kept current, 
since adoption of such a strategy of bombing the Yugoslav 
refineries would place our soldiers in danger, if the Yugoslav 
forces have fuel to fight back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs will be going to Moscow.  Can he 
assure us that no Canadian company, or foreign company with 
subsidiaries in Canada, is delivering petroleum products to 
Yugoslavia in violation of the embargo and of the entire 
strategy upon which there should be total NATO solidarity? 
Otherwise, this becomes ridiculous; we are just shooting 
ourselves in the foot. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, according to the information we have, no petroleum 
products have been exported from Canada since January 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case Canada is clearly on line with what the embargo is 
presenting.  We will make sure that if countries sign on to the 
embargo they will adhere to its requirements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hope for a diplomatic solution through Russia appears to be 
fading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, in Moscow, Mr. Chernomyrdin repeated that NATO's 
air campaign had to stop to allow negotiations with Belgrade to 
get under way. As for Mr. Draskovic, he seems to have backed 
down from the comments he made yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, I ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs if the 
deployment of additional forces in Macedonia, as announced by 
the Prime Minister, and the call up of 33,000 reservists by the 
United States are signs of the imminent sending of ground troops 
into Kosovo? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the leader of the New Democratic Party put it 
properly this morning.  The commitment made today to fulfil our 
commitment to ensure there is a peace implementation force is one 
of the best signs and indications that we want a peaceful 
resolution to the dispute.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
also believe that a diplomatic solution is best. However, the 
number of troops now gathering outside Kosovo's border is very 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Prime Minister make a slip of the tongue this morning 
when he said that helicopters may be used in Kosovo? In making 
that comment, did he not give another indication that the 
sending of ground troops into Kosovo is now imminent?

<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  We are sending them there for 
peacekeeping purposes.  The helicopters are part of the 
reconnaissance purpose of the Canadian forces that will be there. 
There are some 800 of them.  They will be in neighbouring 
Macedonia.  They will be there working with the British.  They 
will take some training time when they get over there so they are 
ready to move into Kosovo when a peace agreement is reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, they will also be able to help out in the

<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the foreign affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has announced that it is sending 800 ground troops to 
enforce a peace settlement in Kosovo.  However there is no peace 
settlement.  What we have instead is a NATO embargo in the face 
of Russian objections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government believe this interference with Russian 
ships, this military escalation, enhances prospects for a 
peaceful settlement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime Minister answered that question 
very succinctly this morning when he said the whole purpose of 
the embargo is to continue to apply the pressure that is 
necessary to bring the Milosevic regime to the table to begin to 
negotiate . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not go out of our way to provide any provocation.  It 
will be done within sort of the legal rules.  We have asked the 
planners at NATO to come up with the proposals that would 
incorporate those kinds of elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing is what I said yesterday, trying to get a 
balanced approach.  We will continue the negotiation but continue 
the pressure at the same time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has said that he supports his foreign affairs 
minister's diplomatic mission to Moscow.  However, again today he 
made it clear that he also supports the NATO embargo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sets us on a collision course since Russia has made it 
clear that it will not respect a NATO embargo.  How can the Prime 
Minister pretend that this provocation will help secure Russian 
co-operation for a peace settlement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not see it that way.  I really want to suggest 
to the hon. member that what is being applied, coming out of the 
NATO summit meetings, is the important unified position of 
keeping pressure applied to the Milosevic regime through the air 
campaign, through cutting off supplies to his military 
activities.  At the same time it is important, as a clear 
connection to that, that we undertake negotiations and have the 
Russians become involved in seeking the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly can report to the hon. member discussions I have had 
this morning with some of the people who have already been there. 
It does not appear to be as big a problem for the Russians as it 
appears to be for the leader of the New Democratic Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question relates to the Prime Minister's announcement this 
morning.  We all hope in the House that the Prime Minister will 
make a full report to parliament on the NATO Washington meeting, 
as Prime Minister Blair did in his parliament yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have orders in council been passed authorizing the sending of 
Canadian air force personnel and peacekeepers to Yugoslavia?  If 
not, how are their veterans benefits being secured? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for anybody who serves in the Canadian 
forces in an overseas mission in a hostile situation there are 
special allowances and special provisions with respect 
subsequently to pensions for any that are injured.  All of these 
apply in this particular circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are absolutely determined if we send any of our peacekeepers, 
any of our air force personnel into harm's way, to look after 
them as best we can.  We will reduce the risk to them while they 
are there.  If something does happen—we hope it will not—to any 
of them we will look after them as best we can. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
according to the defence minister's own staff and according to 
legal counsel from the House of Commons, the order in council 
that is in place is inadequate at the present time and the 
statutes are not sufficient.  Our research indicates that the 
order in council the minister referred to last week is 
insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Prime Minister today to pass a retroactive order 
in council to ensure that our troops, both in the air and on the 
ground, will receive the veterans benefits when they return.  Or, 
will it turn a blind eye to these troops as it did to merchant 
navy veterans 54 years ago?

the official opposition offers its moral support to the 800 
troops that the government has committed today.  I think 
Canadians should all pray for a safe and speedy return.  However, 
there are many questions that must be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 800 Canadian troops heading to the former Yugoslavia will be 
working in conjunction with the British Fourth Armoured Division. 
Canadians want to know precisely what the command and control 
structure will be.  Will our troops be commanded by Canadian 
officers or will the British have complete command and control 
over our forces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course the immediate command of our 
forces will be by the Canadians who are there, but they will be 
operating as part of a British brigade, so they will be working 
closely with the British in that connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the details of that will be worked out, as is required, 
and we will be happy to inform members of the details. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
these are urgent issues on which all Canadians want to have 
details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important questions that must be answered today, 
however, is the matter of rules of engagement for this mission. 
Somalia and Bosnia have shown us that the rules of engagement 
must be established at home, in Canada, before the deployment of 
a mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Canada determine its own rules of engagement, or will they 
be determined by NATO?  Will the defence minister tell us 
precisely today what those rules of engagement will entail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, they will be NATO rules of engagement. 
We are part of NATO and we are part of working out those rules of 
engagement.  I would be happy to provide the hon. member with 
that information.

Mr. Speaker, there is a very substantial difference between

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last September 
18, the federal government announced the injection of $300 
million into a new program aimed at helping the provinces meet 
the costs of health care for all victims of tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Quebec already has a similar program, which provides care 
to all tainted blood victims, does the minister intend to pay 
Quebec its fair share of the federal funds on a per capita 
basis, that is $75 million? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
already offered Quebec its share of this funding to ensure the 
availability of medical services for those infected with 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already sent documentation concerning this proposal to my 
colleague, the Quebec Minister of Health, Mrs. Marois.  I await 
her response. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 1996 
throne speech, the government made the commitment that it would 
not put into place any new cost-shared programs with the 
provinces or, if it did, there would be a right to opt out with 
full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of this program for assistance to tainted blood 
victims, will the government finally respect its own commitment 
from 1996?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is, unfortunately, mistaken.  This proposal is not 
affected by the commitment she refers to.  The commitment is not 
pertinent to this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we proposed is merely an approach that will ensure that 
people infected with hepatitis C can have access to the required 
medical services now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have proposed a certain approach to Mrs. Marois, and I await 
her response.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Paul 
Glover at no time raised the issue of criminal proceedings.  The 
young men raised it themselves in an attempt to escape civil

where victims can seek redress for pain and suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister again:  Does the Young Offenders Act apply to 
the civil courts?  And there is no appeal pending.

<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-78, the pensions bill, is complex and has profound precedent 
setting implications, yet the government moved closure after only 
four hours of debate.  Some 670,000 Canadians will be affected 
directly, and many more indirectly, by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the President of the Treasury Board assure the House today 
that he will approve extended committee hearings across the

<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
those affected have been expressing their concerns for at least a 
year.  We have been negotiating in particular the issue of joint 
management of the pension plans with them.  The employee 
representatives have been quite aware of the issues for months 
and months.  We have discussed with them.  We have laid out the 
issues in front of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have in Bill C-78 is something that is in the 
interests of public servants and in the interests of taxpayers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
President of the Treasury Board has insisted ad nauseam that he 
has the right to take the $30 billion pension surplus because the 
government has paid the shortfall of about $13 billion over the 
years. If the plan owes the government $13 billion, where does he 
get off taking $30 billion to pay for that?  I could get better 
terms from a Las Vegas loan shark.  I probably could get better 
terms from my Bank of Montreal MasterCard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Minister not take his $13 billion and leave the 
rest where it belongs to provide pension benefits for deserving 
retirees? 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-78 guarantees to public servants and continues to 
guarantee to them all the benefits they have been guaranteed 
before.  None of these benefits are affected except that the 
number of benefits are increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, public servants have had absolutely no 
responsibility for the funding of the plan.  It is the taxpayers 
who have taken all the risks.  It is the taxpayers who have 
funded all the deficits.  It follows that it is the taxpayers who 
deserve the surplus.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eleven years ago Transport Canada officials determined that the 
Kelowna air traffic control tower did not meet minimum safety 
standards because the air traffic controllers cannot see the 
runway and cannot see the taxiway. A temporary permit was issued 
to allow the tower to continue to operate on the condition that a 
new tower be constructed.  Eleven years later, there is no new 
tower. Will the minister instruct that a new tower be built? 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Nav Canada is responsible for air navigation in the 
country and for assessing the appropriate regime that should be 
used in the present circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the particular question, I will get back to the hon. member 
after researching the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to underscore the fact that Transport Canada is 
absolutely adamant that safety especially in our skies is our top 
priority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if safety is the number one priority, let me read from 
the Transport Canada report on Kelowna which states: “Due to the 
location and/or height of the control tower, portions of the 
runway and taxiways are not visible.  The problem is becoming 
even more serious.  The margin of safety has been jeopardized. 
Visibility has been identified as a major safety concern”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from a Department of Transport report and I believe it 
speaks for itself.  We should have a new tower in Kelowna 
immediately.

removing 100,000 tonnes of gravel from the Fraser River without a

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister of Indian affairs struggled to her feet

Speaker, I met earlier today with representatives of a number of 
Canadian cities that are homes to professional hockey league 
teams. I am happy to say to the member that nobody asked for 
subsidies for professional hockey players.  There was a lot of 
concern expressed about the value that mayors in particular 
perceived there to be for their communities to have a team 
present. Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and Montreal were represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have agreed that I will continue to meet with representatives 
of the appropriate stakeholders in order to consider what can be 
done to ensure we do not lose all our hockey teams.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister 
of Indian affairs knows that aboriginal women do not enjoy the 
same rights as ordinary Canadian women across the country.  She 
knows that in the event of a marital breakdown, most often it is 
the aboriginal woman who is out of the house and on the street, 
and often with the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the minister and the government negotiated a 
treaty with the Nisga'a that does nothing to address this problem 
and makes it out of reach that this could ever be entrenched as 
rights for aboriginal women in the future? 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I know is that as a 
result of talking with aboriginal women, in Bill C-49 we have 
actually taken steps to ensure that land codes will include the 
reflection of matrimonial property for women in those 14 first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Indian Act now we talk about communal properties and 
there are no opportunities for aboriginal women.  We have 
identified and want to have a fact finder to help us deal with 
the issue of matrimonial property.  I expect to receive input 
from that fact finder and make continued progress in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is aware that there are about 100 firefighters in

understands as well that this is the most dangerous occupation in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firefighters are requesting that they be able to qualify for 
reduced CPP benefits at age 55, with full benefits at age 60, 
rather than the current ages of 60 and 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Minister of Human Resources Development agree to 
propose an amendment to the Canada pension plan so that

of their dangerous occupation and do so without financial loss?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will use this question and comment period to 
congratulate the member for Joliette on his speech. He has 
stressed how important it was for NATO and Canada to take a very 
firm position in order to bring the situation in Yugoslavia back 
to normal, while being very active on the diplomatic front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him the following question. 
Students at La Pruchière school, in my riding, sent me more than 
one hundred messages they have written to children in Kosovo to 
give them hope, hope that the war will end soon and they will be 
able to live like normal children again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Joliette tell me whether a vote by the 
House on Canada's position on this crisis and the deployment of 
troops would not help the diplomatic efforts undertaken by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Canada and all those involved in 
this conflict bring about a peaceful settlement as soon as 
possible, thereby responding to the call from the students in my 
riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
letting us know about the whishes of children in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that we in Quebec live by the democratic spirit of 
institutional governance. We want to live peacefully, this is a 
concern children have very early on. For them to convey this to 
children in Kosovo shows that Canadians and Quebeckers in 
particular are a peace-loving people who, even when they have to 
take this kind of measures, are still seeking international 
peace and stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a situation like this one, a vote is a must. We just gave a 
mandate to our troops. We are sending from 600 to 800 soldiers 
supposedly to keep the peace, but we never know when the 
conflict might escalate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, the paper <I>Le Monde</I> was reporting today 
that the 12,000 NATO troops already deployed had stones thrown 
at them; two weeks ago a jeep was set on fire; and already there 
are signs of impatience. These people are not in Kosovo, they 
are in Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the soldiers we are sending in come under attack? Will they 
be the target of violence? Do they have the mandate and 
authority to defend themselves? 
If so, they seem to, according to what the minister said this 
morning. But if they have a mandate to defend themselves against 
attack by the extremists over there, what assurance do we have 
that there will be no escalation, that things will not 
degenerate?  What assurance do we have that they will not be 
forced to attack in order to defend themselves?  Where is the 
line drawn between legitimate self-defence, attack and combat? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the troops are perhaps right on the verge of 
engaging in a combat that will lead who knows where. 
It would therefore be important for this House to send a 
message, through a precise and clear vote in this House, a heavy 
majority vote, to these people who are headed off to defend 
freedom, to defend democracy, telling them “You have the support 
of all Canadians and all Quebeckers.  The people are behind you. 
They support you because they know you are going to defend the 
freedom and the spirit of democracy they hold so dear”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What more do we need?  The Prime Minister tells us that, if 
there were any changes in the situation, he would come back to 
the House for a debate.  At the end of a debate, a mere 15 or 20 
minutes are needed for the House to be heard through a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it that the Prime Minister's daily agenda is 15 or 20 minutes 
too short, or is it because the issue is not on the cabinet's 
agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has spent hours upon hours, sometimes until 3, 4, 5 
and even 8 in the morning, debating such issues. Since we can 
talk for hours on end, what prevents us from taking an 
additional 15 minutes to vote on these issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister spoke of the need for flexibility, for being 
able to react quickly in extreme situations. But would 15 
minutes prevent him from taking quick action? France stated its 
position through its prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Lionel Jospin assured French parliamentarians that the 
possibility of a military involvement on the ground would not be 
considered without submitting the matter to them. “In such a 
case, you would be consulted in a formal fashion to authorize or 
not, through a vote, such an intervention”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If France can do it, so can Canada. This is what respect for 
democracy is all about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in this House to debate with you the motion by the New 
Democratic Party, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call on the government to intensify and 
accelerate efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis 
in Kosovo through the involvement of Russia and the United 
Nations, and to urge NATO not to take actions that expand the 
conflict and stand in  the way of a diplomatic solution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I would like to inform this House and my NDP 
colleagues that we will support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this motion because it is very similar to the 
position the Bloc Quebecois has upheld and encouraged before and 
during the conflict in Kosovo, namely, a diplomatic solution 
that would involve the United Nations, Russia and, why not add 
China.  We must not forget China.  It is still a member of the 
UN security council and has a veto.  China alone could paralyze 
all the actions of the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always hoped that the current conflict in 
the Balkans could be resolved under the aegis of the United 
Nations, as was Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, in 1991. 
Unfortunately, the close historical ties between Russia and 
Serbia, like the special relationship Yugoslavia maintains with 
China, has made the diplomatic route increasingly difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict we are currently witnessing in Kosovo is the 
product of many years of instability in the Balkans, fomented 
primarily by a single man, or should I say dictator, Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than ten years, Milosevic has played with the nerves of 
the people of Kosovo and the international community.  Patience 
has its limits.  Before this conflict began, members will agree, 
a number of diplomatic attempts were made.  The diplomatic 
impasse has lasted for over a year.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again, the international community tried to come 
up with a diplomatic solution to end the war and repression in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were UN resolutions 1199 and 1203, as well as the October 
1998 accords between the OSCE, NATO and the former Yugoslavia, 
which were never enforced.  We could also include the 
Rambouillet agreement, but the refusal of Yugoslavian 
authorities to sign this agreement was at the root of NATO's 
offensive against Milosevic and his war machine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the foot-dragging, discussions and negotiations, the 
situation in Kosovo became unbearable.  In fact, we now know 
that Milosevic's strategy was to play for time in order to 
complete his ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois supported NATO's 
military intervention in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia so as not to 
let the situation in Kosovo worsen further, and the present 
situation there shows that we were right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNHCR estimates that close to 585,000 Kosovar Albanians have 
taken refuge in neighbouring countries.  Seventy thousand of 
them had already fled to these countries between March 1998 and 
the first NATO air strikes on March 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 120,000 refugees in non-neighbouring countries, 
mainly throughout Europe, which, according to UNHCR estimates, 
brings to over 700,0000 the total number of refugees who fled 
Kosovo since 1998. Not to mention the rapes, physical atrocities 
and mental anguish a whole people has had to endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of these atrocities, it was appropriate for the 
Bloc Quebecois to support an intervention by NATO. This did not 
mean diplomatic efforts had to stop. There is always room for 
diplomacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in times of crisis that the strengths and weaknesses of an 
organization become apparent. In this respect, Canada's foreign 
policy has showed its weaknesses through its lack of vision and 
direction and, as a result, its lack of credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a member of the UN security council since 
January 1. 
How then can we explain that Canada, through a lack of 
initiative, did not intensify its efforts to give the UN its 
rightful place in this conflict? Once again, Canada's 
international relations policy has been dictated by the United 
States and countries in the alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to mention some mind-boggling improvization. Last Friday, the 
Prime Minister said that a UN negotiated solution to the 
conflict in Kosovo was not foreseeable in the near future. 
However, three days later, he now hopes the UN will participate 
in an international force to be deployed in Kosovo when the war 
is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that the Prime Minister just remembered Canada is a 
member of the UN security council, and that it is about time it 
used this influential position to find a diplomatic solution to 
the conflict? 
After 34 days of conflict, Canada has finally woken up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canada's duty to use every means possible to try to 
provide the security council with a draft agreement reflecting 
the main thrust of Rambouillet.  Or yet again, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs could take advantage of his visit to Russia on 
Friday to push the German peace plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the saying goes, it is best to strike while the iron is hot. 
With the new open-mindedness that seems to be developing in the 
Yugoslav government, whose deputy prime minister has said that 
his government was prepared to accept a peace plan which called 
for deployment of a UN force to Kosovo, is the Canadian 
government going to have the presence of mind to pass this 
proposal on to NATO as well as to the UN security council? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A breach seems to be developing on the diplomatic front.  Canada 
therefore has a duty to intensify its diplomatic discussions in 
order to restore the UN to its rightful place in this conflict.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, with the massive exodus of refugees into the 
various humanitarian aid camps, where there was such chaos 
initially,  coupled with the fact that Albanian gangsters were 
diverting donated food supplies, the difficult political 
situation in Macedonia and Montenegro, and the logistical 
complications in Albania, is the Canadian government going to 
carry out a thorough examination of roles and responsibilities, 
and of how the work of the humanitarian organizations and the 
military ought to be co-ordinated in future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, 
there seems to be a blurring of roles between what is 
humanitarian and what is military, since the army is 
administering the refugee camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, we must tip our hat and express our gratitude for the 
vital help the military has provided in the various refugee 
camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Military logistics were essential in setting up the various 
refugee camps.  However, as Jacky Mamou, president of Médecins 
du monde, has stated, the organization considers military forces 
turned humanitarian unhealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mamou is concerned as well about practical organization, and 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will there be a NATO co-ordinator?  Will they put themselves at 
the disposal of the HCR? Whose role it is to protect refugees? 
That is the real problem. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the European commissioner for humanitarian aid, Emma Bonino, 
agrees. Here is what she has to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military can help us in an emergency, but we have very 
different roles, the management and co-ordination of humanitarian 
aid activities must be left to humanitarian agencies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She too referred to a certain cultural clash between the 
employees of humanitarian agencies and the NATO soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Canada, as a member of the United Nations security council, 
take the initiative and propose thorough consideration at the UN 
and in NATO of the distribution of roles and the co-ordination 
of humanitarian aid activities in the event of another conflict 
of this size?  We must learn from our mistakes and make sure 
this confusion does not recur in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada could, if it wanted, be a leader in humanitarian aid.  Up 
to now, in the conflict in Kosovo, Canada has been content to 
simply provide troops and aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the meetings the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
has on Thursday and Friday this week with the UN secretary 
general and his Russian counterpart will turn Canada into a 
credible player on the world diplomatic stage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure once again to speak on this topic.  I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Durham.  The last time I 
spoke on this subject was at one o'clock in the morning.  This is 
a far more civilized hour and I hope I am a little more coherent 
at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after speaking in the previous take note debate I was 
asked by a reporter what I thought of the debates.  I said to him 
at the time that I thought parliament was struck with a severe 
case of me-tooism.  I was not only out of touch with my party's 
view on this matter but I was out of touch with other members of 
parliament.  I thought that the Prime Minister's position had 
been vindicated and that he had a working consensus with the 
Parliament of Canada to prosecute this war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do live in a democracy and I will take this 
opportunity to pursue my line of dissent in order to push the 
edges of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential question here is whether the war in Kosovo can 
ever be considered just.  I bring the attention of the House to 
an article by Marcus Gee in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> who 
articulates five essential questions:  Is the cause righteous? 
Are the intentions good?  Was the war declared under proper 
authority?  Is there a reasonable chance of victory? Are the 
means proportionate to the end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of the debate, I am perfectly prepared to 
concede that the cause is righteous.  Clearly the stated aim of 
the prosecution of this war is the protection of Kosovo 
Albanians.  That is in and of itself a righteous cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is, are the intentions are good? It is 
pretty obvious that this is not a war of conquest, that this is 
not a war of revenge.  We do not appear to have any strategic 
goals. There is no obvious benefit to any of the NATO members 
other than an attempt to bring harmony to this very troubled part 
of southeastern Europe.  It may even be argued that NATO has been 
unselfish in its attempt to bring resolution to ancient conflicts 
which have existed in this area of the world for years and years 
and which certainly precipitated World War I and arguably also 
may have precipitated World War II. 
I am prepared to be equally generous in the question that the 
intentions were good.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question is, was the war declared under a proper 
authority?  The obvious answer is no.  Canada and indeed no other 
NATO nation has yet to declare war on the sovereign state of 
Yugoslavia.  We are bombing a sovereign nation without ever 
making a formal declaration of war.  It is the first time we have 
actually engaged in offensive actions against a sovereign 
territory in over 50 years and we have done that without actually 
ever having declared war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have not bothered with the niceties of a UN resolution. 
I appreciate it may be difficult to obtain a UN resolution either 
at the security council or at the general membership level. 
However, having said that, it seems to me that we want to work 
both sides of the fence.  We want to say for some purposes that 
we respect the views of the United Nations and we support and 
commit ourselves to the United Nations; however, when those views 
as expressed through the security council are not to our liking, 
then we do our own independent thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very significant issue for Canada, in part because we 
are such avid UN supporters.  Unlike our U.S. ally who considers 
the UN to be an irritating irrelevancy, we have been UN boosters. 
We have paid our dues on time.  We have always signed up for any 
peacekeeping initiatives.  We articulate our views to the world 
through the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ignoring the obtaining of the UN resolution, in large measure 
we also ignore the rule of international law.  That will have 
implications which we have yet to contemplate for us as a nation 
and for other nations. It also undermines our commitment to other 
international institutions, such as the International Criminal 
Court, which we have so assiduously pursued.  It appears that 
when it works for us, we use it, but when it does not, we ignore 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question is, is there a reasonable chance of victory? I 
suppose we could have been persuaded that the first few days of 
bombing would bring Mr. Milosevic to his knees.  I would submit 
that either that was a gross miscalculation of the resolve of the 
citizens of Yugoslavia, or it is a gross miscalculation of Mr. 
Milosevic's military muscle, or it is a gross misreading of the 
ethnic hatred that literally has been in that country for 
hundreds and hundreds of years, or we have been fed a line of 
propaganda which changes over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air bombing will not do it.  We have control of the air, in fact 
we have control of the sea, but the only place where it counts is 
on the ground.  Interestingly, prior to the Washington summit the 
talk was whether we were going to commit ground troops.  After 
the summit, the talk clearly shifted.  It was that we were going 
to impose an embargo and that we would occupy the airspace of 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An embargo certainly has not worked all that well in Iraq.  It 
has hardly brought Iraq to its knees.  As to occupying other 
countries' airspace and land, we already use it anyway whether we 
have their consent or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final question is, are the means proportionate to the ends? 
Some people who have spoken on this issue have talked about the 
greatest oxymorons of the 20th century:  bombing for peace, 
humanitarian hawks, killing to save lives.  To state the phrases 
is to point out their logical absurdity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we look at the victims to date.  Prior to the 
initiation of the bombing there were about 2,000 dead on both 
sides of the conflict, I would say disproportionately skewed to 
the Albanians, but there were certainly some dead Serbs as well. 
After a month of bombing we certainly have a lot more than 2,000 
dead.  Indeed, I suppose we have at least 2,000 dead Serbians. We 
certainly have a lot more than 2,000 dead Albanians. We have 
displaced about 1.5 million out of the 1.8 million Kosovar 
Albanians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, as the war drags on, the toll will exceed 2,000.  The 
real question is how many people have to die before this madness 
ends?  How many victims will have to cry out before sanity 
prevails? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our other speaker and I attended the national prayer breakfast 
last week.  The speaker at the national prayer breakfast was Kim 
Phuc. 
Ms. Phuc was the subject of that classic photograph in the 
Vietnam war.  She was the naked little nine year old girl running 
toward the photographer, fleeing the napalm bombing.  The napalm 
was burning her clothes and the skin off her body.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Phuc told her story.  There was not a dry eye in the house 
as she told about her pain and her suffering and her life since 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is in some respects the quintessential victim of the 20th 
century, of an era we consider modern warfare.  Now Ms. Phuc is a 
Canadian citizen, living in Ajax, a community just east of my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I speak to the House I cannot get the image of Kim Phuc out 
of my mind.  I cannot rationalize this war and have that image in 
my mind at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask myself if this a just war and if it is based on 
good intentions.  Is it under proper authority?  Does it have a 
reasonable chance of success?  Are the means we are using 
proportionate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can members of the House answer these five questions.  If in 
fact they can answer them then I suppose we should prosecute this 
war.  If in fact they are troubled by those five questions then I 
think we need to address the Kim Phucs of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague's 
presentation this afternoon.  Obviously he put a lot of thought, 
energy and effort into his speech on this issue of such 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of our present situation with the no compromise 
position, as it was called during Oral Question Period today, 
that NATO has taken with regard to the present conflict in the 
Balkans.  I am reminded of another hard line taken by the allies 
in the second world war when they coined the phrase unconditional 
surrender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe very strongly as a student of history that it 
was quite appropriate at that time to have a demand of 
unconditional surrender by the Axis forces during the second 
world war, the very hard line approach being taken by NATO at the 
present time is not very conducive to negotiating a peace 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the comments made by the hon. member across the way, 
would he care to elaborate on his speech and on what his thoughts 
are about perhaps NATO backing away from its hard line approach 
in the hope of achieving a peaceful settlement in the near 
future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, like all members of the 
House, I presume on a certain level of thoughtfulness and presume 
on a certain level of concern about this issue which yields no 
ready answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought at the end of the weekend that in some respects NATO 
had stepped back one or two steps from pursuing its goal on a 
kind of unconditional basis or on a no compromise position and 
that the diplomatic initiatives and the engaging of Russia were 
put into a higher level of engagement.  I was somewhat comforted 
by that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can still see the wagons circling.  There is obviously a 
military agenda in terms of circling Yugoslavia and not only 
bombing it but bringing the embargo into play.  I was somewhat 
comforted by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not there.  I cannot actually know what is going on, but I 
take some comfort in the fact that our Minister of Foreign 
Affairs flies off to Russia this week to engage the Russians, who 
many people argue are the key to the resolution of this conflict.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to share something with my colleague and ask for 
his comments.  An e-mail came to me today and was addressed to 
the scientific community.  It read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Colleagues, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to inform you that the threat for the VINCA Institute of 
Nuclear Sciences in Belgrade is going to be bombed is now 
realistic.  As our attitudes and understanding of situations are 
different from the ones that politicians have, I am warning the 
scientific community of the disaster that would occur if the 
VINCA facility (two nuclear reactors, accelerator installation 
and ammonia cooling system, isotope production etc.) are hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that you will consider this information very seriously 
and I am appealing to you to do as much as you can to prevent 
that from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hoping that soon you will be able to continue your 
collaboration, I am sending you my best regards, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yvanka Bozovic 
</I></B></P><P align=left>VINCA Institute of Nuclear Sciences. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a nuclear facility in Belgrade.  Does my hon. colleague, 
who is very close to my riding and shares a lot of my concerns, 
have any comments to make in this regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the essential presenting 
proposition of all NATO nations is that this is a humanitarian 
intervention into a situation in another sovereign state to 
prevent an ethnic disaster or a genocide, the new world order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The converse of the new world order is that modern warfare can 
visit on populations and on environments disasters that people in 
World War I, World War II, the Korean war and even the Vietnam 
war could only vaguely understand.  We have the ability to create 
a situation in Yugoslavia which will literally last for thousands 
of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend points to one possible area where if the facility were 
bombed it would last literally thousands of years as the damage 
spread over the area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
always pleased to follow my colleague from Scarborough East.  He 
was speaking about the meeting, which I think was last week.  Kim 
Phuc was there.  I agree with his sentiments about the people who 
listened to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to refresh our memories, she is the girl in the classic 
picture of a little girl running down the road naked, having just 
been struck with napalm in the Vietnam war.  I know as she told 
her story that all of us were very cognizant of the fact that we 
were engaged directly in a campaign of dropping bombs and other 
so-called military hardware in the area of Serbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can ever forget about the realities of war. It 
is very nice to be able to sit home and look at it on our 
television sets as if it were a strategic, very clean process.  I 
do not think our television sets tell us about the horror and 
suffering of whatever side it is, whether Kosovars or Serbians or 
others are involved in this tragic affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great reluctance that we deal with the whole issue of 
aggression, whether we are aggressive or whether we are trying to 
defend a group of people from further aggression among their own 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from Brussels where I attended the 
interparliamentary union.  This is a group of parliamentarians 
from 130 nations around the world.  It meets on a biannual basis. 
The discussion there was basically about Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a great opportunity for me.  I know the Reform Party does 
not like to participate in these things, thinking they are a 
waste of time and money, but for me it was a great opportunity to 
talk to parliamentarians from that area of the world.  The 
Yugoslavs were there.  The Russian federation was represented, as 
were Bulgaria and most of the countries that surround the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to talk to these people about some of the 
history of these conquests.  I had the opportunity before that to 
look at an art museum.  I went in and looked at the various 
pictures.  There was a very tragic picture of a murder, of 
somebody stabbing somebody with a knife.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the bottom of the painting where it read “The War 
in Kosovo, 1825”.  It tells something about this conflict which 
seems to have been going on almost indefinitely.  I believe it 
started with the penetration of the Ottoman empire into Europe 
and the gradual withdrawal and downfall of the Ottoman empire. As 
this happened different ethnicities mixed within Europe, 
specifically in the areas of the Balkans.  The Kosovar people are 
basically Muslim while the Serbian population is Christian.  This 
seems to be the nucleus of the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us in Canada think this as kind of absurd.  The object 
of the exercise is that we can all live together in spite of our 
cultural differences and religious beliefs, but apparently that 
is not so in that part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another element that is very much a part of the process is the 
whole issue of sovereignty as has been mentioned a few times 
today and in other debates.  What is the limitation of 
sovereignty?  The member who spoke before said that he did not 
think we had attacked a sovereign country since the second world 
war.  That is probably the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world population is now changing to the point that it 
recognizes there is such a thing as human rights.  Human rights 
to a certain basic fundamentalist supersede the rights of 
sovereign countries and how sovereign countries deal with the 
people within those borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian jurist heads up the World Court.  It is very 
unfortunate that the World Court is not as strong as it should 
be.  We need to support the World Court process a lot more.  If 
people like Slobodan Milosevic thought they were involved in this 
war, that bombs were going to land on them, or more important 
that there was a higher court, a world court that would actually 
try Slobodan Milosevic for some of his atrocities, this conflict 
could have possibly been nipped in the bud before it got totally 
out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada and our international partners have to be more 
judicious in bringing a form of justice throughout the world.  We 
have to temper our views about sovereignty to the point where we 
will not tolerate its entrenchment or overriding of the basic 
fundamental human rights we believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an oddity that the nations which are the strongest critics 
of NATO's actions invariably are countries with their own human 
rights problems.  It is an odd case where the NATO forces have 
got together and basically said it is time to draw a line in the 
sand concerning just how far we think a nation can go in ethnic 
cleansing, or whatever the case may be, to show that we are not 
willing to tolerate it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A regrettable crossing of the line has occurred here.  It is 
appropriate that we take this kind of action.  It is regrettable 
because I do not think anybody wins in a war.  Nobody wins by the 
destruction of assets.  Nobody wins by the expenditure of large 
amounts of money on military hardware and other things. Everybody 
is a basic loser.  It is unfortunate that the international 
community has let this situation get to the point where we have 
to take this action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the good intentions of my NDP colleagues who want to address 
the need for a diplomatic solution, I do not think there is any 
question that Canada, its NATO partners and others in the United 
Nations have tried to arrive at a diplomatic solution to the 
issue through the former Yugoslavia, from Bosnia to Croatia and 
so forth.  It does not seem to be in the cards.  I do not know 
why we do not seem to be able to curb the desire of Mr. Milosevic 
to cleanse that country.  I know his policy is Serbs for the 
Serbians and the way to do that is simply to remove that element 
within his population that is not homogeneous. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we cannot let Mr. Milosevic be successful.  The 
fifth point of this is the one that is bothering everybody, which 
is the continuation of some kind of force after the conflict has 
been resolved. It is clear we must resettle these people in their 
homelands.  It will be very expensive because their homes have 
been destroyed.  Their businesses are gone.  It will take 
significant amounts of capital.  It will not simply be expending 
money on the military or peacekeeping forces within the former 
Yugoslavia.  It will also require capital assets to rebuild 
businesses and so forth.  It has to be done because there is a 
fundamental human point here. We cannot allow ethnic cleansing to 
be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in eastern Europe I was surprised when I talked to 
people, for instance in Poland.  Poland before the war was a 
multi-ethnic society.  Today it is homogeneous.  Mr. Hitler's 
policy was successful in Poland.  It is a homogeneous ethnic 
group. We must not let this be successful in the eyes of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, having the Russians on board is a good idea. When I 
got to the conference, the Russians moved a motion condemning 
Canada and the NATO forces for their aggression. Mr. Speaker, you 
would be surprised to know that none of the countries, in spite 
of the fact that they dislike the military conflict going on, not 
one country bordering on Yugoslavia supported the motion, other 
than Russia itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable we have had to come this far.  We are trying 
to find a diplomatic solution to the problem.  The Russians are 
not nearly as significant a force as some people would like to 
believe.  Remember that Russia is likely to declare bankruptcy as 
a nation this year.  It has defaulted on significant amounts of 
its government debt.  I question how much of an asset it would be 
to resolving this matter for us.  It is always nice to have 
friends on side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has never said that only a NATO force can occupy the area 
but we have to have a force.  It has to be armed so that we 
ensure this conflict does not start up again and a long term 
peacekeeping solution can take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To resolve these conflicts will take at least a generation. A 
lot of the skills that our armed forces have in the area of 
peacekeeping will be very much in demand in that part of the 
world.  I am happy to be part of a country and part of a 
government that supports this humanitarian effort.  I can only 
hope it ends in success shortly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague talk 
about the Ottoman empire, the ethnic cleansing that is happening 
today and the ethnic cleansing that has happened over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he realizes and supports my view that this ethnic 
cleansing is not something that is just happening today. It has 
happened for the last 700 to 800 years, since the Ottoman empire 
was formed and resettlement back and forth of Christians and 
Muslims has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague agree with me that we should recognize 
that the ethnic cleansing is not only occurring today but it 
occurred back in the early 1900s when the Ottoman empire was 
falling apart and was disengaging?  There was ethnic cleansing at 
that time with genocide of the Armenians, the Pontians and so 
forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will my hon. colleague support unanimous consent in the House 
that we realize that ethnic cleansing did not just take place 
today but it occurred in 1914 to 1922 with the Pontians and 
Armenians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not answer the 
specifics of that, but the issue of ethnic cleansing, whether it 
has been holy wars or whatever the case, has been with humanity 
as far back as history books were written. The point is that we 
have to move beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are approaching the 21st century.  Surely we have developed 
at least a degree of a civil society that would say this is 
ridiculous and it has to to stop and we will not allow people 
like Slobodan Milosevic to be successful.  He will have to learn 
to live with ethnic diversity, just as we do every day in the 
House and in our country. 
It is something we have to promote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to participate in 
debate and dialogue on the war in Kosovo.  Unfortunately I did 
not have that opportunity during the take note debate on April 12 
because the time available was not sufficient to ensure that 
every member of parliament who was interested in having a 
dialogue on the issue was able to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would question why we need another debate.  What is the 
purpose of today's debate?  I can only say to all those 
individuals that this is an issue that is consuming Canadians 
everywhere across this country.  It is an issue that deserves our 
utmost attention. It is an issue around which we have to be 
consumed and giving of our time and energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today with this motion because we know we have to 
find a solution, a peaceful solution, a diplomatic solution, a 
political solution to a crisis that has gone on far too long.  We 
are here today because it is day 35.  It is now 35 days since 
NATO began its air strikes over Yugoslavia.  It is 35 days of 
seeing images of bombing, of death, of destruction every time we 
turn on the TV or open a newspaper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These images are not just being seen by all of us in this 
chamber.  Canadians everywhere are experiencing those images and 
asking questions.  Why?  Was there any other way? How long? 
Where will it go?  What does it mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started grappling with this issue shortly after the bombing 
began, when we knew there was no immediate resolution and quick 
expedition of an end to this crisis as we were promised and as 
was suggested by the government.  Shortly after that we all had 
to start asking those questions.  We had to hold ourselves 
accountable to constituents and Canadians everywhere about what 
it meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians at that point were starting to ask if this was 
possibly another Vietnam. The news media started commenting on 
the possibilities of World War III.  Originally I thought that I 
was being paranoid, that this cannot be, that it is not reality. 
But as the days have progressed, those thoughts have come to 
dominate the dialogue in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know and understand, and I am sure all members in this House 
understand, that it is absolutely imperative for us to keep 
searching for a peaceful diplomatic resolution of this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in one way or another are forced to answer the 
questions of young children who see the images on TV and wonder 
what it means and where it is going.  It is getting harder and 
harder to answer those questions.  It is getting harder and 
harder to offer assurances to young children about the hope and 
prospect of a peaceful world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many today have talked about what we have been hearing and 
feeling over the last number of days and weeks.  Some have talked 
about the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees living in 
squalid conditions without any hope of returning to their 
homeland.

stranded, starving and without hope within Kosovo.  We have seen 
and heard about the impact of the bombing and all of its 
devastation in terms of the economy, the environment and people's 
very lives.  Over and over again we are taking in this news, 
trying to digest it and to figure out what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Durham suggested that we have tried peaceful 
solutions, that there are no peaceful solutions, that we have to 
live with what we have got.  We are here to say, as we have said 
clearly every day since parliament returned on April 12, that 
there has to be a peaceful, political and diplomatic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there were signs and we received some news that there is a 
little bit of progress.  The Prime Minister announced today that 
Canada would be sending in 800 troops to be part of a 
peacekeeping effort in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before I continue, I want to indicate that I am 
dividing my time with the member for Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there was a little news that we could take some comfort 
in.  However, at the same time that an announcement was made 
about Canada participating in a peacekeeping force in the region, 
we heard that the government was as determined as ever to 
participate in accelerated and expanded military actions and 
activities in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Prime Minister say today absolutely and 
unequivocally that the oil embargo will happen.  He said that 
notwithstanding the possibility of accelerating the conflict 
because of the situation involving Russia.  We heard no 
suggestion by the Minister of National Defence or anyone else in 
the government that they will put a hold on sending more CF-18s 
into the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the government talks about putting in 
peacekeeping troops and searching for diplomatic solutions, there 
is no sign that the government is showing the kind of leadership 
on the diplomatic front which is absolutely required.  This 
motion is here today to say stop accelerating military action and 
start accelerating diplomatic alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be an option.  Thirty-five days of death and 
destruction and the possibility of the aggression spreading and 
of this war continuing for any length of time are enough to make 
all of us say that we have to find that diplomatic peaceful 
solution.  The government has to keep trying to find that 
peaceful alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said as early as March 31 that there had to be reinvigorated 
efforts on the part of the government to call for a suspension in 
military operations at the same time as calling for Milosevic to 
stop the atrocities on the ground.  We stood in the House and 
called for the government to stand up and show leadership around 
the uniting for peace alternative.  We are here today to urge the 
government to show that leadership at this critical time in this 
long and drawn-out conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect a concern of my constituents and Canadians 
about the future.  While we grapple with this situation, while we 
are searching, pleading, urging and working toward peaceful 
diplomatic solutions to the crisis in Kosovo, we also know it is 
not too soon to begin thinking about the future and ensuring that 
this never happens again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention a quote from Marcus Gee, as did the Liberal 
member for Scarborough East. 
This is in the context of the kind of dual role the United 
Nations is expected to fulfil and the obligation it imposes on 
all of us as we go down the path to the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two roles combine the old idea involving the integrity of 
nations with the newer idea involving the integrity of the 
individual.  Based on that idea, it shows that the UN holds 
responsibility for promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and for fundamental freedoms for all.  It is in the 
fulfilment of those dual objectives that we must learn lessons 
from the Kosovo crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliament, as a country and as a member of the 
international community, we must now seek solutions of a 
diplomatic, peaceful nature that will ensure that we are able to 
address any atrocities against human beings anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am faced with questions daily from constituents who say, “Do 
we as a country have a double standard?  Does NATO have a double 
standard?  How did we respond as a nation, as an international 
community to the Kurds in Turkey?  How do we respond to the 
situation in East Timor?  What is our record on Guatemala?” 
Those questions keep coming back to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that we end that double standard and put all of 
our energy and resources into finding a mechanism at the 
international level for combining our dual responsibility around 
the integrity of nations and the integrity of the individual.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to follow my hon. colleague after her well 
chosen remarks on this particularly sensitive, important and, in 
some ways, dark debate that we have to have in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to understand and review the history a 
bit.  In these kinds of debates and in these critical times, we 
sometimes forget where we came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A month ago in the House, the government, as a partner with 
NATO, recognized that there were atrocities being committed or 
about to be committed in Kosovo.  The government and the country, 
as a partner in NATO, felt that we had an obligation as the peace 
talks in France fell apart to do what we could to protect the 
ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no question that there was mounting evidence that 
those people were in a dangerous situation.  We know the history 
of the Balkans and we know that there is an unsettled political 
situation there.  We also know that there is, as in many parts of 
the world tragically, ancient grudges and ancient hatreds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, with all party support, the government through NATO 
participated in a bombing campaign.  No one, I submit, believed a 
month ago that we would still be bombing Serbia today.  That is 
not to be critical of anyone.  I do not think the parties in the 
House who supported the government in its resolution believed 
that 30 days from that date we would still be bombing those 
cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one thought that NATO would move outside the selected bombing 
targets which we thought, and I think everyone concurred, would 
be military targets.  No one thought that 31 days after the 
bombing began, instead of bombing military targets we would be 
bombing the president's home, rightly or wrongly.  No one 
believed we would be bombing television stations.  No one 
believed we would bomb every single bridge across the Danube 
River.  No one thought that we would collectively wreak the kind 
of destruction that has happened in the last 31 days.  No one in 
any of the NATO countries—so as not to be overly critical 
here—and I think no one in the House foresaw the immense tragedy 
that would result in the movement of the ethnic Albanians across 
the border in such mass numbers, or the slaughter that would take 
place in their communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence of that is in the simple fact that the 
international community was unprepared to help the refugees.  It 
is a testament to the United Nations Refugee Commissioner that we 
have since been able to contain some of the tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the first week across this country and across the 
world people were asking “What are we going to do about the 
refugees crossing the border”.  I think there is evidence that 
no participating member of NATO, including Canada and the members 
of the House, foresaw the kind of long term campaign that has 
been ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time began to change things a little bit and positions began to 
change. I am proud to say that in this party when Kofi Annan, the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, laid down what he 
thought would be five conditions that might bring the parties 
back to the table, this party urged the government to respect the 
historic position of Canada as a peacemaker, as a peace invoker 
and as a diplomat in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urged the government to go further than that and to say 
“Look, perhaps we can even drop those demands.  Perhaps we can 
even weaken those a little bit to bring Milosevic to the table. 
Perhaps if we say, stop the atrocities that are taking place on 
the ground and come to the negotiating table, then perhaps NATO 
could stop bombing”.  We pressured the government in that 
direction, all the while maintaining our support because it is 
important for this sovereign nation to work with the support of 
the House.  The Prime Minister alluded to that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think we have to measure the changes in the 
international climate against a tone that I get uncomfortable 
with in the House.  Sometimes when I hear us talking, I think of 
us as siblings in the family of man saying we have a problem with 
another of our siblings.  Today, there is a paternalistic tone 
entering the debate where we say that we will ensure that things 
happen in Kosovo, that we will ensure that our rules, our demands 
and our five conditions are met.  That is not the historic role 
of this country.  The historic role has been to brokerage between 
peoples and nations who have those paternalistic attitudes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop and examine the history regularly in the debates 
in the House to ensure that we are proceeding on a direct course 
to where we wanted to go in the first place, which was to ensure 
that the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo was met.  Whether that 
meant assisting in the creation of an independent Kosovar state, 
whether it meant peacekeeping forces as a buffer, whatever it 
was, that was our goal.  It was not to bring Milosevic to his 
knees.  It was not to wreck the Serbian economy.  It was to 
ensure that the Kosovars, the ethnic Albanians, could live in 
some peace in their homeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rigorously and every day, we in this party have fulfilled our 
obligation under the Constitution of Canada.  Under our 
parliamentary obligation and responsibility, we have suggested 
alternative measures to the government.  We pursued vigorously in 
question period, in debate and in all-night debates in the House 
various other options that the government might pursue.  Those 
included ensuring that the United Nations play a significant role 
in the peace negotiations in this international crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not now and has never been the role of NATO to usurp the 
United Nations as a governing world body.  We must be clear on 
that.  Granted, NATO had to act in this situation because the UN 
was in some ways paralyzed and we could not afford to turn a 
blind eye and say that because of bureaucratic situations we 
simply could not act.  Let us be clear when we talk about 
peacekeeping forces.  Let us be clear as we move toward the 
negotiating table that it is the United Nations and not NATO that 
is the international force that all countries respect. This party 
pushed and encouraged the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Prime Minister to bring that message to the NATO table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that over the weekend we have seen, I hope, 
some significant results because of that kind of pressure. Canada 
should be proud that it has been singled out in NATO as the 
country to try and talk to the Russians, who play a crucial role 
in this debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is now pursuing two aspects.  We are still fully 
participating with NATO, but we are aggressively pursuing a 
diplomatic effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced this motion today because we are now caught in a 
strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Canada has a kind of 
potion that we drink.  On the one hand, we are telling Russia 
that we are the country that can help bring peace, and on the 
other hand, we are laying down conditions that can impede that 
very progress by saying that we will support an embargo, which 
Russia has adamantly refused to recognize.  We are saying that we 
want to bring peace to Serbia, but at the same time we are saying 
we will supply more planes if we have to, to continue bombing the 
very people we want to come to the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last minute that I have, I want to review the resolution 
that my party has proudly brought into the House of Commons, and 
that is that we call on the government to intensify and 
accelerate efforts to find a diplomatic solution.  That is our 
history and that is who we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are nations that are very good at making war.  We are not 
one of them.  There are nations that are very good at bringing 
about peace.  We are one of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the government to accelerate and find a diplomatic 
solution to the crisis in Kosovo through the involvement of 
Russia, which everyone recognizes has to be a key player in this, 
and the United Nations, the governing world body.  As signatories 
to the convention on Human rights, we have a role to play. 
Surely we cannot ignore the very body that we look to, to enforce 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to ensure the involvement of Russia 
and the United Nations to urge NATO not to impose a naval 
blockade or take any other actions that expand the conflict and 
stand in the way of a diplomatic resolution.  That is our motion. 
That is our role as a nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to my colleague from the New Democratic 
Party with great interest.  He made some interesting comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just wondering if he could make something clear to me.  Is 
he asking that NATO stops bombing or is he asking that NATO 
continues bombing?  Does the motion that his party brought 
forward today support stopping the bombing of Yugoslavia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are saying that at 
this point we stand by our support of the government in its 
initial phase, and we understand that includes bombing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are very hesitant to support any further 
acceleration of military activity.  I think the hon. member knows 
what I mean by that.  That is why it is included in the 
resolution.  We have very real concerns about the imposition of a 
naval blockade that can only accelerate hostilities among the 
very people that we are trying to bring to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have very real concerns about bringing in more Canadian 
troops.  The Prime Minister talked about 800 troops today being 
ready to go to Kosovo.  We assume that is in a peacekeeping role, 
but we view that with very grave concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister 
and the hon. member who asked the question, do not take the 
support of the other parties in the House for granted, but that 
support is always contingent upon the absolute diligent pursuit 
of diplomatic efforts.  Movements that will accelerate 
hostilities will not help bring about the diplomatic solution 
that Canada so desperately wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying at this point that we will continue to support the 
government and our initial commitment to NATO.  We also 
understand that means bombing today, but it does not mean 
increasing planes and setting up blockades that will lead to 
further hostilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in this debate, the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle 
recounted how he visited Biafra during the Biafran war in the 
late 1960s. 
He told of the horrors of seeing the people starving and the 
people suffering in Biafra, and just generally the horrors of 
war. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1615

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another side to that equation because at the time of 
the Biafran conflict I was in Britain at Leeds university doing 
post-graduate work.  I chummed around with two other young men of 
my age, in their mid-twenties.  One was a Jewish fellow from 
London and the other was a fellow by the name of Bennett 
Okuwosa.  When I first met Bennett he was a Nigerian.  When I 
last met him at the end of my two year term he was a Biafran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevance of the three of us and my friend being Jewish is 
that in the two year period that I knew these two young men both 
the six day war occurred in Israel and the Biafran war broke out 
in Nigeria.  One young man was, shall we say, on the side of the 
winners and the other young man, my friend Bennett Okuwosa, was 
on the side of the losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before these tragic events came about we were very much the 
three musketeers.  We used to shoot pool together and drink beer 
together and go to dances and sometimes we studied and, though we 
came from very diverse backgrounds, we had as much in common as 
young men around the world would have in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But then my friend, who we used to call Bennett, confronted the 
problem of the Biafran war.  What happened there was another case 
of ethnic cleansing.  The Biafrans had spread out of Biafra, 
which is a province of Nigeria, into the rest of Nigeria and had 
taken over many of the positions of responsibility in the 
Nigerian economy and political society.  This created a great 
deal of resentment among the Muslim population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biafra was a classic situation, as so often occurs, where 
religious strife breaks out which is really only a guise for 
economic competition and economic resentment.  So it was in 
Nigeria.  The Biafrans were expelled from all positions and were 
basically driven out of all of Nigeria and back into Biafra.  In 
Biafra they decided that they would form a break-away state, 
which led to the Biafran civil war and all its horrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communications stopped with Biafra basically.  My friend Benno 
had a very large family.  He endured the time when his brothers, 
who had various positions of authority, were picked up by the 
Nigerian police and disappeared.  Of course, throughout the 
Biafran war he had to endure the knowledge that his people were 
suffering terribly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, his contribution to the war, because he was in the 
agricultural sciences, was to try to raise rabbits for Biafra 
because, of course, there was a terrible shortage of protein and 
terrible starvation in his home country.  In the end, I do not 
think he ever went back.  The last I heard of him was a letter 
from Berlin.  I think he settled in Germany in the end and raised 
his family there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will jump from that to events of just a week ago Monday.  I 
held an open town hall meeting in my riding to which I invited 
everyone to come and express their feelings on Kosovo.  My 
particular riding, Wentworth—Burlington, and the whole area 
around there has a very high percentage of Serbian Canadians.  We 
had an open meeting and it was a very emotional event because, 
while one might have expected much anger, in fact there was much 
anguish, much hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I held the meeting because I wanted to give the opportunity for 
the Serbian Canadians to come and express their feelings because 
this is a democratic country.  Although there were some remarks 
on the causes of the war and the fact that the ethnic Albanians 
had taken over society and Kosovo and all of that kind of thing, 
and many of them were there illegally, those arguments did not 
ring with as much weight as the terrible anguish that these 
Serbian Canadians had, not only for their kinfolk, but for what 
was happening in Kosovo, in the former Yugoslavia.  Or in 
Yugoslavia, I suppose it is called still. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, one man asked me “What will happen if Canada 
actually declares war on Serbia?  Will it mean that I will be 
interned?”  Another woman worried about her son in the Canadian 
forces.  What is going to happen if he is sent over in a combat 
contingent and winds up in combat with his kin? 
One can imagine the situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people were worried about the young people of military age 
who had left the country a few months before the actual bombing 
started.  They knew that their children would be called up. 
Indeed the call is now for anyone of 14 years of age or over to 
join the military forces in Serbia to combat the invasion.  One 
can imagine the terrible fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were my fellow Canadians suffering.  They were hurting and 
they were hurting because of what was happening in the homeland 
that they had left.  There is no doubt that they are Canadians 
now, but they still have strong ties to where they come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When thought of that way we have to realize that this is not 
just a matter of stopping the bombing and coming to a diplomatic 
solution.  This is not a matter of partitioning Kosovo or making 
it independent.  This is a matter of making sure that as we lead 
up to a settlement of this conflict we leave the door open for 
forgiveness so that Kosovars and Serbians can live together once 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Canada has an indirect role to play in this because 
we are the classic example of a country with all kinds of ethnic 
diversity and of people who come from conflicts in other parts of 
the world who can live together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end I think it is very important on the part of the 
government and on the part of all of us to make sure that we are 
very careful in the distinctions we make when we talk about what 
is happening in Kosovo.  Biafra was a clear case of ethnic 
cleansing.  The Biafrans were driven out of the rest of Nigeria 
because they were Christians and the others were Muslims, 
although I say to members that religion was only an excuse.  In 
1915 in the former Ottoman empire I believe that the Armenians 
were driven out of Turkey primarily because Turkey was at war. 
This was another case of ethnic cleansing.  But these are not 
necessarily cases of genocide.  Genocide is probably the ultimate 
horror and the Holocaust was genocide.  It was not just a matter 
of ethnic cleansing but a matter of destroying the very ethnic 
memory by killing everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost every nation in the world has been guilty of ethnic 
cleansing at one time or another.  I will give an example of our 
own Canadian experience in the 18th century with the Acadians. 
The British expelled all the young Acadian men from Nova Scotia 
and distributed them down the shores of the American seacoast. 
The Boer War began in the 19th century.  The British were at war 
with the Boer farmers in South Africa.  Women and children of the 
farmers were rounded up and put in concentration camps where they 
died and had terrible experiences.  If we want to go back to a 
case of genocide we can go back to the American west.  Here the 
American authorities systematically destroyed the food supply of 
the aboriginals, resulting in their death.  We could go to the 
Ukraine between the wars and we will find Stalin who 
systematically destroyed the food supply of the Ukrainians.  This 
is genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genocide is a terrible word, but when it comes to civil war, and 
the expulsion of an ethnic population, almost every nation in the 
world has been guilty of it to some degree or another.  We have 
to bear in mind that we have to make these distinctions.  If we 
do not make these distinctions, the people I saw at my town hall 
meeting will feel that they are branded with a guilt, with a 
stain, which they do not deserve any more than the Americans, the 
British, the French or anyone else who has been in colonial 
power who has engaged in some kind of civil war or repression, 
however terrible.  Some kind of repression is involved in the 
expulsion of an ethnic, religious or racial group.  We have to 
make those distinctions very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think now in terms of how we are going to find a way 
to bring the Serbian community, the Serbs and the Kosovars back 
together.  I believe this is the country that can lead by 
example.  As long as we as members of parliament, and we as 
Canadians everywhere are prepared to go out into our communities 
and listen to one another, no matter what our backgrounds, our 
religions or our languages, we set an example that hopefully can 
be followed after this war.

listened with great interest to the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington, and I must even admit that I was touched by 
his comments. I was touched when he talked about his days as a 
student in London with two former colleagues, one a Jew and the 
other a Biafran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he digressed quite a bit from the NDP motion calling on 
the government to intensify and accelerate efforts to find a 
diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo—if we do not want, 
at this point, to talk about a war—and to involve Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if he personally intervened in the 
Liberal caucus. If so, what proposal did he make to bring the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of National Defence and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs—who, incidentally, is leaving this 
evening to meet his Russian counterpart—to find a diplomatic 
solution? What personal action did the hon. member take to 
convince his government to try to find a diplomatic solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost a great deal of our ability to act as peacekeepers,

United States and the other countries by sending aircraft that

national caucus I did rise and go to the microphone, in front of

help us out of this impasse that is occurring in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the golden opportunities that is presented here is that 
Russia can become involved.  If Russia can be part of the peace 
plan, then it will help Russia feel a restoration of confidence 
of its important role in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about countries and peoples hurting, and we have to 
realize that the Russians are hurting now as well.  They are not 
hurting just economically; they are hurting because the end of 
the century has been hard on them.  We have to give them the 
opportunity to find their dignity.  They can find their dignity 
by taking an important role in bringing peace to this region. 
That is what I said in national caucus last Wednesday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to tell the hon. member that these 
distinctions between ethnic cleansing and genocide are perhaps 
helpful, but I still marvel at his description of the Armenian 
situation the other day in the House.  I would like him to tell 
us whether or not he feels that a genocide took place in Armenia 
at the beginning of the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, however, has to do with the UN's role.  Since he is 
willing to talk about what went on in his caucus, could he tell 
us to what extent the UN's role was discussed?  What is his 
personal position on the importance of involving the UN in any 
resolution of this conflict in Yugoslavia? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can only talk about what 
I said.  I cannot talk about what others said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pick up on the ethnic cleansing.  It is so very 
important to make the distinction between ethnic cleansing and 
genocide. 
It is very difficult to forgive genocide under any circumstances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because so many nations historically, going back to the ages of 
the Greeks and the Romans and even before, have been guilty of 
one form of ethnic cleansing or another, after the war the 
Serbians, Serbian Canadians and Kosovars can at least appreciate 
that nothing has happened in Kosovo, however horrible, that is 
any different than what has been going on in nations and 
societies across the world since the beginning of recorded 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is when we apply too big an epithet that we make it almost 
impossible for the people to communicate after the war. Then we 
entrench hate.  There is enough hate in the Balkans.  We have to 
find a way to get people to stop hating one another. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will refer to the last comment about getting people to stop 
hating.  I heard Henry Kissinger, I think it was, say that was 
probably not a possible scenario in these parts of the Balkans. 
Hate is deeply ingrained in the souls, hearts and minds of the 
people in that region.  I wish it were so that by holding up 
Canadian values or values which we hold dear we could communicate 
in some way that they should stop hating.  I wish it were that 
easy but I fear it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Halifax and the New Democratic 
Party for putting forward what I frankly consider to be a 
responsible position in a responsible use of an opposition day. 
We have had scenes in this place where motions have been put 
forward that frankly would be seen as nothing more than 
grandstanding for the purpose of perhaps espousing certain 
philosophical viewpoints or somehow trying to embarrass the 
government.  I do not think the motion does that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states that the government should intensify and 
accelerate efforts to find a diplomatic solution.  Who among us 
would not want that to happen?  Who among the population of this 
great country would not want that to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission being undertaken by the minister later this week, 
with meetings being set up in Russia and meetings with the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, is an effort to do 
exactly that, to find a way to answer a question I have some 
difficulty answering when constituents call me:  How did this 
happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at history to find out how and why this has 
happened and why we are debating it today.  It is responsible of 
an opposition party to suggest that the government should 
increase efforts to find a diplomatic solution. I agree with them 
that it should happen.  I also think it is responsible for us to 
urge NATO not to accelerate the campaign beyond what is currently 
going on in an effort to try to find a diplomatic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.  I was 
very interested to hear my colleague from Hamilton—Wentworth say 
that he had held a town hall meeting.  I wondered what it would 
be like to have a town hall meeting in Kosovo.  I wondered how 
people who have been driven out of their homes and who have 
watched their fathers, their husbands and their sons assassinated 
in front of them would feel about participating in a town hall 
meeting. This is not media hype; we have heard testimony from 
refugees who have stood by and watched their mothers and their 
daughters raped in front of their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they would be so shocked at the democratic process which 
my colleague held in his riding that they would not know what to 
say.  They could not imagine describing the horror and the pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we strive to find diplomatic and peaceful solutions, we 
have to take a look at why we are in this position in the first 
place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1949 former Prime Minister Lester Pearson, whom I think all 
Canadians and members of this place would consider one of the 
great men of this century, won a Nobel prize.  He signed an 
agreement with 11 other countries to form an alliance called the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  That membership has expanded 
to 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the purpose?  Was it just some kind of window dressing 
following the war, that we should all get together once a year 
and have a barbecue or something like that?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were 12 and now 19 countries that recognized a number of 
different threats existed in the world.  The most obvious would 
have been the spread of communism in 1949.  We saw what happened 
with the wall.  We saw it go up.  We saw it come down.  We saw a 
country divided.  We saw what happened economically and 
philosophically, or from any aspect of society we want to look 
at, to a country that could have been, should have been, might 
have been and might still be again a great country, Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be a bias but I happen to think it is one we all 
believe in, the bias of democracy.  This is a people who have 
been put in a terrible position because of the spread of 
communism and because of the militaristic attitude that occurred 
in that country.  They wound up in a destitute situation.  NATO 
was formed to monitor the spread of communism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tito was in charge in Yugoslavia and the army was there. I 
witnessed firsthand in 1990 when I was part of a parliamentary 
delegation as a member of the provincial legislature the first 
free elections in Croatia since the end of the second world war. 
Yet there were still armed soldiers standing over the ballot 
boxes intimidating the people as they came in.  They stood there 
and did not move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how incredulous some of the Croatian people were when 
I went up to the armed soldiers and put a Canadian pin on their 
lapel.  They were quite astounded that I would do that. Thinking 
back I was a little nuts to do it.  In any event I was being 
friendly and extending a friendly hand to those people.  We could 
see tears in the eyes of the Croatian people as they lined down 
the street to vote for the first time since the war.  It was 
truly one of the most amazing and moving political opportunities 
that I have experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most of us in this place I am really rather spoiled.  Think 
of where we live.  Think of the fact that I have often said in 
this place that our weapons are hopefully our minds.  Our 
ammunition are the words that we hurl at one another.  We do not 
kill one another.  Hopefully we do not.  There may be days when 
some would feel that way but generally speaking we are not a 
violent people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we see what is happening and we a partaking in what can 
amount to nothing other than a military action, or call it 
whatever we want.  It is war against a regime.  I do not consider 
this a war against the Serbian people as a nation.  Although I 
have to openly admit obviously Serbs will be injured and killed 
in this exercise.  That is a terrible tragedy, but we cannot sit 
back and do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the Canadian people would say if Canada, a 
participant in NATO for the last 50 years, was to step back and 
say that we will not be involved in this situation; we were there 
for the good times and liked the conferences, but we will not 
participate in this action.  I do not see how we could in any 
moral conscience take a position that we would not participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pray and hope, as do all Canadians and members of the House, 
that what we have seen today will not escalate into the use of 
our soldiers in active combat.  It may yet happen, but we hope it 
will not.  They are there.  They are being positioned to go in to 
implement a peace settlement.  I hope that our minister and our 
Prime Minister can meet with the Russians and do what the NDP is 
talking about and what we would all like to see, to see if Russia 
can implement a peace settlement with this regime to end the 
fighting and the killing.

is keep a sustaining peace in that part of the world and help the 
Kosovars readjust, go back in and rebuild their lives.  I know we 
all pray for that, and hopefully we will see it in the not too

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask our eloquent colleague whether he could answer 
the question I asked the member who spoke before him regarding 
the role of the UN and what was said about this role during 
their caucus meetings, or what their supporters say at public 
meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How important does he think the UN's participation is in any 
solution and what does he think should be the relationship 
between the UN and NATO in resolving the conflict in Kosovo? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the UN should be 
involved.  As a result of the meetings our minister will be 
having in Russia and with the UN secretary general, I hope we 
will be able to bring them in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be realistic as well and realize that NATO serves a 
very specific role that is somewhat different from that of the 
United Nations.  The theatre for the United Nations is the entire 
world.  That is not true with NATO.  The theatre for NATO is 
Europe and the Americas.  It is not Asia, Africa or the Middle 
East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NATO could come in, and China and Russian were prepared to 
come in and co-operate in negotiating a peace settlement, that 
would be entirely appropriate.  Hopefully the movement by our 
minister to go there and meet with them will see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would more appropriate, if it is possible, to have NATO 
forces enforcing a peace settlement.  However we have to get a 
peace settlement first.  As long as Russia stays on the outside 
and is not prepared to come in to the negotiations, I fear the UN 
is marginalizing itself because of one or two of its members. 
Hopefully we can see some serious involvement by the United 
Nations over coming weeks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like my hon. friend to make one or two comments 
regarding not what is happening in Serbia or in Belgrade but what 
we are doing to our own population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to his attention the plight of a mother and a father, 
Zorka and Milan Lavrnja who visited Canadian immigration at 
Bucharest.  Their son was applying to immigrate to Canada. They 
are Canadian citizens; they hold Canadian passports.  They went 
into the embassy and were told: “You are Serbian Canadians.  We 
do not want to look after you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we in the House fostering better relations and better 
communications within our own communities?  What happens when a 
Canadian official overseas, such as the embassy in Bucharest, 
says that to a Canadian citizen?  Could my colleague from 
Mississauga give his reaction to exactly what we are doing to our 
Canadian citizens if they are of Serbian background? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if anybody in the 
employment of this country were to make a statement like that, 
and it could be proven, he or she should be fired.  It is plain 
and simple. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have another question for the 
hon. member, who seems to take a great interest in NATO's role 
in this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the American defence secretary, William Cohen, said that 
the international military force should be NATO-led.  What does 
the Liberal member think? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know there is an 
attempt by some to somehow demonize the role of the Americans in 
this conflict.  Let me simply say that NATO has a constitution 
and a mandate.  In that mandate it is very clear that the 
responsibility of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is that 
it is one for all and all for one if a member is attacked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Americans happen to be the largest and perhaps 
the most dominant player because of their economic clout and 
their military clout I think is a given.  The role that Canada 
can play and should play is being rightly played out on the 
international scene by our Minister of National Defence and our 
Minister of Foreign Affairs in trying to do exactly what this 
motion is calling for; that is, trying to find a peaceful 
solution and working with Russia, which can indeed be a catalyst 
in finding a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that while the Americans would have little 
if any influence over Mr. Milosevic, the Russians do have some 
influence.  We know that the Russian military has provided arms 
and weaponry to the Serbian military over the years.  That is 
fine.  That is a legitimate arrangement, a commercial contract. 
We know that they have a relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than trying to demonize the Americans and turning this 
into either a partisan issue or some kind of conflicting 
issue—and if the hon. member did not mean that I apologize, but 
that is how I interpreted it—I think our role as the Canadian 
government is to work alongside the Americans as a partner in 
NATO and to try to find a solution by our meeting with Russia and 
the United Nations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
Hon. member for Vancouver East, Housing; the Hon. member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, International Trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first let me indicate that I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. member for South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As immigration critic for the PC party, I want to make a few 
comments and remarks on the human tragedy that is Kosovo.  Every 
day on television we see a tide of Kosovar Albanians fleeing to 
refuge outside their homeland, leaving behind their burning 
villages, leaving behind their friends and relatives who have 
been spirited away or even executed by the Serbian security 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years we have seen similar scenes in 
Croatia and in Bosnia, but the sheer speed and magnitude of the 
current exodus has riveted the world's attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion talks of a possible diplomatic solution to that 
crisis.  I think it is safe to say that our party would support 
the motion.  It is a very good motion indeed and I sincerely hope 
that it is possible.  In the meantime, I would like to comment on 
two aspects of the crisis, the refugee situation and the military 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Kosovar refugees, we are very pleased that 
Canada went on record as willing to accept and made preparations 
to take in about 5,000 of these unfortunate people.  As a nation 
whose involvement is driven by humanitarian concerns we could do 
no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other situation about which we are concerned is our military 
position in all of this.  It is indeed regrettable that we did 
not debate this matter before our air force was committed to 
fight.  The bottom line now is that we are embroiled in a 
military conflict overseas.  Many military experts feel that this 
will inevitably lead to the involvement of our ground troops as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is concerned about the way we seem to have become 
involved in this conflict without a long term view of the 
consequences.  I know that war has not been formally declared, 
but people are shooting and people are being shot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind the House that this region of Europe tied down 
many Nazi divisions during World War II, in a grinding war of 
attrition, with terrible atrocities committed on all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen examples of how ethnic cleansing in Croatia 
and Bosnia came about, with enough blame and enough blood to go 
around for everyone involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have every confidence in the professionalism of our armed 
forces, but I fear that the government has presided over our 
military being reduced in numbers.  As well, it is sadly lacking 
in the equipment to do the kind of job that we will probably be 
called upon to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot play at war.  NATO is now committed.  It has very 
little choice but to follow through on those commitments.  In 
Vietnam, for instance, we saw what it was like to fight a war 
wherein the daily targets were decided in the White House and not 
in the Pentagon.  The result was a war that dragged on for years. 
No matter if we call this a conflict or a war, we had best be 
clear about our objectives and have the will to do what is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot forget that the Yugoslav leadership will be ruthless 
in the use of their military and paramilitary forces, so we must 
not send our soldiers and airmen into harm's way with one arm 
tied behind their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that Canada, once a leader in world affairs, a 
champion of United Nations peacekeeping, is now caught up in this 
conflict.  However, the die has now been cast and we had best get 
very, very serious about our diplomatic, our humanitarian and our 
military roles in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian nation has the stature and the reputation to 
influence events, as it did in the gulf war and more recently in 
Croatia.  However, those events took place when Canada had will 
as well as stature.  There is no evidence that this government is 
able to supply that level of leadership.  From what we have 
learned of NATO discussions, other members decided to launch an 
air war and Canada merely decided to go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Prime Minister, if others decide that ground 
troops are necessary Canada will not be the one to say no.  That 
is not a muscular foreign policy.  It is no foreign policy at 
all.  The announcement that we are sending 800 peacekeeping 
ground troops to the region is another escalation of our 
involvement.  Our possible involvement in a naval blockade also 
complicates our situation, especially if the Yugoslavian navy 
decides to fight back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we can take a number of steps to try to 
reassert our leadership with regard to the Kosovo situation.  The 
first is to work seriously with Russia, which is the only power 
with open lines to the Serbian leadership.  We must not forget 
that internal forces in Russia are pushing it to become involved 
as well.  No other nation is better placed than Canada to help 
Russia find a constructive role, yet we have no evidence that 
Canada has actively played a role in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good sign that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will now 
go to Moscow, but does he have specific proposals to make, say, 
on the proposed naval blockade or on a UN resolution on the type 
of international security force that would allow refugees to 
return home in safety? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada is a member of most of the international 
organizations which will be involved in developing the political 
settlement in Kosovo when the war is over.  We should be at work 
now on humanitarian and reconstruction issues and on security 
issues as well.  Once this conflict is over our aim must be to 
have a southern Europe that is a more stable place than it was 
before this conflict started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the government should be clear about ground troops.  It 
has not yet been clear on that issue.  Short of a diplomatic 
solution, it seems to me that ground troops will be necessary to 
finish what has already been started by air attacks.  The Prime 
Minister, however, has been coy on that issue and this undermines 
confidence in Canada's position on the issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Government of Canada should lead the way in dealing 
honestly with the public and the parliaments of NATO countries. 
This is likely to be a long conflict, with unsettling images and 
unsettling news.  It began with significant public support 
because the issue was seen as a humanitarian issue.  However, 
once there is killing on both sides questions will be raised 
about NATO's strategy, especially with respect to ground troops. 
There is a difference between support for humanitarian goals and 
support for NATO's strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best road to public confidence is openness, clearness and 
truth.  The Canadian people are a good people and they deserve 
good leadership in this crisis, better leadership than we have 
seen so far.  It is time for government to hold parliamentary 
debates on these matters before our troops are put in harm's way. 
It is time for government to make clear our objectives and our 
ways and means of carrying out the various roles that we will 
have in this escalating conflict.  In short, we should discuss 
our duty, define our duty and fulfill our duty with all of the 
determination and pride which have served us well in crises past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to today's motion, I would certainly support 
continued and vigorous diplomatic activity on Canada's part.  I 
also think it is crucial that Russia, a long time Serbian ally, 
be involved in finding an end to this conflict.  However, any 
solution must involve the refugees being allowed to return home 
under the protection of an international and, hopefully, a United 
Nations peacekeeping force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kosovo is burning.  Parts of Serbia are in ruins.  NATO cannot 
walk away from what it has started.  However, at the same time, 
no country is eager to get involved in a protracted ground war. 
Therefore, I am sure that all NATO countries would welcome a 
reasonable solution that would end the fighting and restore the 
refugees to their homes and to their homeland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to what my hon. friend 
across the way had to say.  On one side he said that ground 
troops are unavoidable and we have to send them in.  On the other 
side he said that the United Nations may be an international 
peacekeeping force.  I am a little confused as to whether or not 
he is supporting ground troops.  I am confused as to whether the 
hon. member is suggesting to the House that we should send in 
ground troops at this stage of the game when there have been 35 
days of bombing with no result.  We do not see Milosevic backing 
away.  We have heard the Yugoslav deputy prime minister, who is 
from the opposition party, saying that we need to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague across the way says that we are in a war.  He is a 
little ignorant about the history of that part of the world.  He 
should study it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to first open his book, learn what has been done 
in that part of the world and then come to the House and try to 
tell members what the government should do.  Sending ground 
troops over there will result in body bags coming home.  I am 
just wondering if the hon. member across the way wants to 
volunteer the first body bag that comes back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should make it clear 
that I do not think the member was involved with me in that 
debate, but somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let me say that we support our role in NATO.  We 
are one of 19 member nations of NATO and we support the bombing 
campaign that is currently going on.  We support our eventual 
involvement in sending in ground troops, should that be 
necessary.  Obviously we would first support diplomatic efforts 
being made by this government to ensure that we do not have to 
involve our soldiers in a ground troop force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is very important indeed that the government 
lay out what its objectives are with regard to this war.  What is 
the long term view of the consequences involved?  What is our 
strategy, for example, in participating in a naval blockade 
should the Yugoslavian navy decide to fight back?  These are 
questions to which we have not received answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out to the hon. member, there is a difference 
between support for humanitarian goals and support for NATO's 
strategy, but I think this government is sadly lacking in 
leadership.  It has not yet laid out its long term views and 
objectives regarding this war and what our strategy would be 
should ground troops become necessary. When the time comes, we 
will support ground troops if there is no other alternative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
tempted to get into the questions and comments part of the 
earlier debate but I will stick to the speech I very carefully 
wrote out.  I hope the parliamentarians in this room will have 
some intelligent questions to ask at the end of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed the British 
parliament for one and one-half hours and during that time took 
questions from British MPs on Britain's role in Yugoslavia. Today 
the Prime Minister of Canada had a press conference to inform 
Canadians and Canadian parliamentarians that we would be sending 
peacekeepers to the Balkans.  Canadians should reflect for a few 
moments on that comparison, a one and one-half hour information 
session versus a press meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has deliberately left parliament out of the 
briefing process and has not been forthwith and open to 
parliamentarians.  At least today the Prime Minister has made 
some attempt to correct that imbalance.  I commend this Liberal 
change of tact because it puts the government in a position where 
it is more responsible for its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions that must be raised over this 
government's handling of this critical issue.  It is time the 
Prime Minister clearly defined Canada's objective in this 
campaign and more important the role we have occupied in NATO, 
and the Prime Minister's involvement and interaction with our 
NATO allies. The question begs to be asked as to what has 
happened to Canada's former leadership in these areas.  I would 
submit that Canada is not only not being listened to by its NATO 
allies but worse yet, is following blindly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's objectives are not clear.  Our strategy is not clear. 
And now by the looks of things, this Prime Minister is sending 
our soldiers into battle with no clear concise objective and no 
strategy to accomplish this vague goal.  Surely the Prime 
Minister is finally going to be held responsible for such ill 
conceived and blatantly anti-military decisions such as “I will 
take the contract and write zero helicopters across it”.  As a 
representative of Canadian soldiers and airmen, I hang my head in 
shame that we would irresponsibly consider sending Canadian 
pilots to war in planes and helicopters that are older than the 
pilots who fly them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the minister of defence stated that he was close to 
procurement.  I would like to state for the record that vague 
phrases such as “we are close to procurement” will be 
meaningless to pilots forced to fly unsafe helicopters. I dare 
say it will also be meaningless to troops who will depend upon 
these helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of this war are unclear, the strategy is flawed 
and Canada's role of having any significant say in decisions that 
will eventually cause the death of Canadian soldiers is in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO entered this war with the president of the United States 
declaring that the U.S. would not send in ground troops. Where 
was Canada's respected position?  How well was Canada listened 
to?  Did we complain about the outright stupidity of such 
tactics?  Canadians know that Canada's voice has not been heard. 
Canadians also know that Canada's opinion is not requested.  Our 
soldiers are at war against a veteran military power while our 
government is at best anti-military and at worst irresponsible in 
terms of our soldiers' lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me this debate is not about what Canada should be doing. 
This debate is about whether Canadian lives will be sacrificed 
because their government is sending them to a war without proper 
training and worse yet, without proper equipment.

parliamentarians and governments making difficult decisions.  I 
can even accept the government being led blindly by the nose. 
What I cannot accept, and what no parliamentarian should accept, 
is giving our soldiers a job to do, albeit a job they are trained 
to do, but a job they do not have the tools to complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tens of thousands of Canadian soldiers have died in foreign wars 
to assure Canadians that decisions that are made which affect our 
troops will be made by Canadian generals and by Canadians 
themselves.  I hope these soldiers did not die in vain. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have not had the opportunity to speak on this issue in the 
previous days of debate.  Unfortunately I did not make it on the 
list of speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I would take it from a different tact today by talking 
about the concerns expressed by my constituents on both sides of 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from an elderly gentleman who was concerned 
about the Aviano air base and whether or not there was protection 
in case Milosevic lobbed some missiles.  I have letters claiming 
that this NATO action is completely illegal and should not be 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few people have become very emotional about the issue, but I 
must say that overall there has not been a lot of public reaction 
to this despite the serious nature of the issue. Last week while 
monitoring radio talk shows in the Vancouver area, we did not 
pick up a single call on this issue.  Despite the serious nature 
of this issue and the fact that Canada is involved in this 
international conflict, it would seem that the average person on 
the street considers it too far away and something that is not 
important enough to worry about. I receive more letters about the 
taxes families are paying and the difficulties with the 
immigration system or justice issues than I receive about the 
situation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless there are some strong feelings out there. I want to 
put on the record some of the input I am getting.  It is 
frustrating for me as a person who is reasonably well travelled 
that I have never been to the region where this conflict is 
taking place.   All of the constituents who have written to me 
have not been there either. Sifting through all the information 
can be frustrating in trying to make sure that we have the 
correct impression about what is going on in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the one thing that everyone agrees upon is that the 
conflict has been there for a long time.  Without making 
judgments as to who is at fault or who is doing what to whom, the 
conflict has been there for a long time.  Perhaps there is a lot 
of truth in the argument some constituents are presenting that 
doing what we are doing will not solve the problem, that it may 
actually exacerbate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frustrating not to have been there.  It would have been 
valuable and interesting to have heard from any members who had 
lived there or had relatives there.  They could have given us 
some inside information about the way people feel in that 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question at one of the military briefings at the 
defence committee last week regarding the number of refugees and 
how much that problem had escalated.  Were there ten times as 
many refugees now as there were six months ago?   The answer was 
that there had been a large increase in the number of refugees 
but it was not related to the bombing but rather to the police 
activities of driving people out of their homes. That is 
indirectly related to the bombing. Because of the bombing going 
on police were getting more enthusiastic and driving people out 
of their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had no opportunity to cross-examine and pursue this further to 
get deeper into the question. This relates to the frustration of 
not having intimate knowledge about the area and being certain 
that the information we are getting is 100% correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a couple of excerpts from some of the letters I have 
received.  These reflect some of the concerns coming from people 
in my riding.  Mr. Ken Moir wrote to me and said in part of his 
letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are in greater disarray as the bombing attacks 
continue.  The objective of the bombing attack is not being 
achieved-may turn the war into an infantry assault-at very great 
cost, and should not be considered in any way whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my opinion an infantry assault would be a preamble to WW 3. 
Let our MPs ponder this unthinkable probability, and think 
wisely as to how Canada is to proceed either in NATO or out of 
NATO. It is my opinion that (the Prime Minister) is not the 
leader that we so urgently need at this time.... Where is Lester 
Pearson when we need him?  My views have some input from my time 
in Europe in WW 2 1943-45.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a concerned person writing in with his feelings about 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lady who writes to me quite often, Victoria Hogan, sent me an 
e-mail addressed actually to the defence minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opinion is not reflected in the alleged 78% of Canadians 
approving of our bombing of Yugoslavia.  If asked, I most 
certainly would have said NO, and so would hundreds of people of 
my own personal acquaintance.  In fact, today on national TV 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> Columnist Barbara Yaffe said that the media 
has been giving a very one-sided account of events in Yugoslavia, 
and that this could well account for this so-called majority 
opinion. I had thought so right from the start, but Barbara was 
courageous enough to say it on national TV. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Hogan goes on to express her opposition to what is going on, 
much in the way that Ken Moir did, asking us to concentrate much 
more on diplomatic efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the credit of the NDP, that is the basis of the motion that 
is before us today.  I will read it into the record for members 
who may have missed it:  “That this House calls on the 
government to intensify and accelerate efforts to find a 
diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo through the 
involvement of Russia and the United Nations, and to urge NATO 
not to impose a naval blockade or take any other actions that 
expand the conflict and stand in the way of a diplomatic 
solution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to disagree with the intent of the motion.  I know 
there has been a lot of support for it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving back to some of the correspondence I have received, I 
received an e-mail addressed to the Prime Minister from Nenad 
Gajic, who I believe is a person from the Yugoslav area, 
expressing a strong protest toward NATO's and consequently 
Canada's declaration of war on the federal republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have acted unilaterally in this matter.  You led Canada into 
aggression against a sovereign country which did not attack 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a different perspective of the situation from someone 
who has come to Canada from that region and is very disturbed 
about it. I know other members have received e-mails like that 
from people who have come here perhaps as refugees or as 
immigrants and feel that Canada has declared war, that we are 
doing entirely the wrong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to mention Mr. Ken Timewell who writes to 
me regularly on issues of peace throughout the world, or perhaps 
conflicts throughout the world.  I received a letter from him 
dated April 17: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just returned home after a vacation abroad, only to learn 
that the Canadian government is actively supporting the U.S.-led 
NATO bombing of “Serb targets” in the Balkans.  Worse still, I 
am told that all five major political parties in Canada support 
this illegal military action.  It is truly a sad time in our 
history. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Timewell goes on to mention that he does not support the 
aggressive military action by NATO members and does not see how 
it can possibly bring anything but added instability to the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wrote to me again a few days later and we had several 
discussions on the telephone too.  This gentleman was deeply 
concerned about the issue.  He wanted me to get his concern on 
the record in the House and I am pleased to do that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had quite a discussion about whether or not he had intimate 
knowledge of the region.  When he wrote his second letter he did 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps not unlike yourself, my knowledge of the recent history 
of the Balkans is quite modest, however I am working hard to 
become informed on the subject. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then goes on to say that despite his lack of information of 
an intimate nature about the area, he still within himself is 
opposed to this type of conflict and really does not want us to 
be involved. He goes on to encourage us to get involved at a 
diplomatic level.  That relates back again to the thrust of the 
motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That puts on the record some of the concerns which have come 
through.  I must say I have had many more letters against what is 
happening than those for.  As I mentioned at the beginning of my 
speech, listening to the radio talk shows and looking at letters 
to the editor in the newspapers, there really has not been a lot 
of public reaction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if other members have found this in their ridings 
as well.  We have certainly received letters from individual 
constituents, but the public as a whole does not seem to have 
reacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That pretty much wraps up everything I needed to get on the 
record today.  I welcome any input from members as a result of 
what I raised today.  If there are any questions I would be 
pleased to answer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we get to 
comments and questions, could the hon. member for North Vancouver 
confirm that it was his intention to use a 10 or a 20 minute time 
slot?  Was he sharing his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was to use 10 minutes for 
my speech and 5 minutes for questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague from North Vancouver I too have had a considerable 
amount of input from constituents on this issue.  They are very 
concerned about what is happening.  I also have had the full 
spectrum of responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have asked “What are you doing using my taxpayer money to 
bomb my relatives over there?” There is a very genuine concern 
on the part of people with family there who may not necessarily 
be on one side or the other of the initial conflict but are in 
the line of fire of the bombs that come from high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the opposite view where others ask “How come when 
we have an internal conflict in our country we have to take on 
the whole world in order to try to solve it?” Those are 
questions that we need to work through by increasing debate.  We 
need to see if we can find a solution to the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that the government is proceeding in a way 
which I think is perhaps very ill advised.  Regardless of what we 
do in our country, it is very important for us to have the 
consensus and support of our people.  That can only come by 
having a debate and by having a vote on an issue of great 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the government that it does not like to have debate 
on things which are controversial.  A day or so ago we had the 
unseemly event of the government invoking time allocation on 
matters that it did not want to have too many people across the 
country getting upset about.  It used time allocation and said 
“We will not talk about it.  We will just do it and we will tell 
our guys how to vote”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the fact that members are not given 
the opportunity to cast a vote on Canada's involvement.  That is 
wrong.  We should be able to express our support for our troops 
if we are to send them.  Or, we should be able to say we are not 
sending them for very good reasons.  That can only come when 
there is open and honest debate with a vote at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am distressed about what is happening in Kosovo.  I am 
certainly supportive of the motion before us today.  I believe we 
should be solving problems like this one with debates and votes. 
We should not be solving such problems with bullets, body bags 
and bombs.  I know that is the dilemma we face.  We have 
President Milosevic who is hell-bent on promoting this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had family at the brunt end of such dictators and such 
people who do not value the lives of others, I have a great deal 
of sympathy for those who are now being forced out of their homes 
and out of their country.  That is exactly what happened to my 
family a scant 70 years ago.  I remember as a youngster hearing 
my family members, my grandparents and others, talking about it. 
It is totally distressing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard of these people and the atrocities to which they 
were subjected, my first reaction was just like that of everyone 
else's.  What can we do to stop this killing?  What can we do to 
stop this ethnic cleansing, as it is called? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really think that is a misnomer.  Somehow it makes the word 
clean become a dirty word.  I wish we could come up with 
something better in the English language to describe it.  It is 
devastating and dreadful.  Surely it would be good if we could 
persuade that president to stop this and to engage in 
negotiations, as we would all love to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do with a person who says “I am not talking; we have 
decided what we are doing and we are just going to go ahead with 
it?”  Does one then put the force of war and attack into his 
face and have him face the consequences?  I suppose that is the 
only other alternative.  In that instance we have to work 
together with all other countries in the world to protect the 
lives of the people who are being so unfairly attacked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son has spent some time in that part of the world and he had 
some gruesome stories to tell about some of the atrocities.  They 
were things that we do not like to even talk about because they 
are so dreadful, things that were being done to women and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, that is exactly what happened to my family when family 
members were being attacked.  Three of my grandfather's brothers 
were shot.  That is the day that my grandfather said “I think we 
are going to leave”.  They escaped the bullets directly 
themselves.  They got out because of the atrocities that were 
being committed against their friends and family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening in Kosovo.  These people are fleeing a 
dreadful enemy, a dreadful attacker, a ruthless attacker.  I have 
great sympathy for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had my druthers, what we would do is provide as much help 
as we could for those who are fleeing.  It should be done in the 
province of Kosovo.  Perhaps our troops could secure a part of 
the country or make arrangements with neighbouring provinces and 
provide for those people so that their needs are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the House can imagine it.  We take our 
amenities of life for granted.  My son reported that one of the 
things that amazed him about that part of the world was how 
similar it was to ours.  The homes looked the same.  The streets 
in the towns and cities looked the same.  He said the only 
difference is when one gets close to the homes one sees that they 
are riddled with bullet holes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is dreadful to think that tomorrow we might be pushed out of 
our homes.  We would no longer have our own beds to sleep in.  We 
would no longer have the facilities and amenities to which we are 
so accustomed.  We would just be out.  We would be living in 
tents, if we were lucky.  Otherwise we would be out in the open 
with an uncertain food supply, an uncertain water supply and no 
shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of them are suffering from illness and injury. I would like 
to see Canada being the leader.  We have a reputation as being 
peacekeepers and providing for people in a humane fashion.  I 
would like to see Canada up its efforts in this area to make sure 
those who have escaped the ravages of this attack at least have 
their immediate physical needs met over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are a lot of non-governmental agencies working in 
the area.  I encourage our government to support them because I 
think they administer that type of assistance in a very efficient 
way, at least the organizations with which I am familiar.  They 
are there.  They are reaching out a hand of friendship and help 
to those people, and that is what we should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meanwhile we should seriously look at what we can do, as 
the motion suggests, in forcing the hand of Mr. Milosevic to the 
table, forcing him by demanding that there be negotiation and 
that he start to talk about what his plans are and what we can do 
to work this problem out and stop the atrocities toward people.

has to be done.  I would certainly encourage us to up the ante in 
terms of a diplomatic approach. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, while I respect the member opposite and many of the 
things he said I just have to bring him up on one point.  He 
called for a debate, and I do believe that we have been having a 
debate right here.  It is a debate where at least this member of 
parliament feels he is not speaking for the government side, but 
I am speaking for the nation, speaking for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether there is a vote or not at the end of this debate, the 
important thing is that we should be here in our privileged 
positions as members of parliament, as the very few people in 
this entire country that can actually speak from our hearts and 
speak for our constituents about the situation in Yugoslavia at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alluded to the lack of a vote and I have to also 
comment on that, even though I do not want this debate to become 
partisan.  Unfortunately, his leader at every opportunity has 
complained about the lack of a vote in this kind of debate that 
we are having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the United States.  In the United States the 
president can unilaterally declare war.  He is the chief of the 
armed forces and he is unreachable by Congress.  It is true that 
in the United States he can go on for a long time until the money 
runs out and carry on a war; but here in Canada our leader, if he 
does embark on a military enterprise, be it a declared war or 
undeclared war, is still subject to challenge in this House at 
any time in a vote of no confidence.  In the United States they 
cannot get rid of the president except by impeachment if he 
decides to embark on a military venture of any kind, like Vietnam 
for example; but here in this House we always have the 
opportunity to vote the government down and out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality, however, is that if it comes to MPs deciding policy 
in times of conflict, whether it is a war situation conflict or a 
diplomatic conflict, we cannot make informed choices in our votes 
if we are not at the NATO table, if we do not have the same 
information that the Prime Minister has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is plugged into the intelligence services. 
The foreign minister is having talks with the Russians.  All of 
this pertains to whether or not we will do something tomorrow, be 
it whether we will send a frigate out into the sea to conduct an 
embargo or whether we will use combat troops or whether we will 
use peacekeeping forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House one cannot ask us, we MPs, to decide on the future 
of the nation when we cannot be at the table.  We cannot be at 
the table, as we have already seen in the House because of a 
member of the Conservative Party who rose in this House and asked 
questions pertaining to the disclosure of covert operations that 
were occurring in Yugoslavia, theoretically, which could put 
members of our forces at risk.  So long as we cannot guarantee 
that members will keep the confidences entrusted in them, we 
cannot have a vote in this House because we can never be 
entrusted with all the knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I somehow still have this 
belief that the very essence, the very foundation of democracy is 
the elector voting.  All of us have been sent here by people on 
the basis of a vote and we make decisions in this House based 
upon a vote.  I just find it very ironic for us when we are 
dealing with such an important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that bears very heavily on me is the fact that 
those people who are now being deployed to Macedonia to be ready 
to enter a ground war are soldiers from my riding. I should be 
able to be here to debate and to vote on whether or not we are 
committing them at the risk of their lives, their health and 
their safety.  As their representative in the House of Commons, 
which is supposed to be the supreme body here, I should have the 
authority to actually express it in a vote. 
I do not think I will back down on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should take all necessary steps to provide 
a humane and fair resolution for those infected with hepatitis C 
through the blood supply system, and provide for research, 
education and support into the identification of other inherited 
bleeding disorders, in particular von Willebrand's disease. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be on my feet again on this 
very timely topic.  I just want to remind the House that it will 
be a year ago tomorrow that we voted on the compensation package 
for all hepatitis C victims.  I want to read into the record the 
motion the House voted on a year ago. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to act on the recommendation 
of Justice Horace Krever to compensate all victims who contracted 
Hepatitis C through tainted blood. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is of course that the government only recognizes 
those individuals between 1986 and 1990.  That pretty well 
explains my motion.  What we have are innocent victims outside of 
that time package who are as deserving of compensation as those 
people within that time period.  It is a very narrow period of 
time that the government purposely designed.  It has created 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always figured, and I think most of us have, that Canada 
is a very fair and generous country.  When we are leaving victims 
outside a package designed to compensate them there is something 
dreadfully wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go through some of the numbers just to point out how 
generous Canadians are.  We are very supportive as a people, as a 
group and as a country of compensating all of those victims. 
These are some statistics.  Statistics alone cannot obviously 
tell the story.  I will be the first to admit that no government 
should operate basically on public opinion all the time because 
there are other factors that have to be considered.  However, I 
think this gives a sense of what Canadians are thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics tell us that 89% of Canadians support providing 
financial assistance to all persons with serious adverse 
consequences as a result of contracting hepatitis C from the 
blood supply system; 83% of Canadians believe it is unfair that 
pre-1986 victims are not eligible for financial assistance; and 
only 9% said it is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of supporting compensation, it is pretty unanimous 
across the country.  For example, in Ontario it is 88%, 93% in 
Quebec, 87% in B.C., 84% in the prairies and 95% in Atlantic 
Canada.  It is pretty compelling when we take a look at the 
statistics in terms of public support for compensating all 
victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote directly from Justice Krever's report, volume 3, 
page 1029.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compassion of a society can be judged by the measures it 
takes to reduce the impact of tragedy on its members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Volume 3, page 1045 of that same report, Krever states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, our treatment of the blood-injured has been unequal. 
After years of suffering devastating financial losses, many 
persons infected with HIV from blood or blood products, or their 
surviving family members, finally did receive financial 
assistance.  Other Canadians— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and we are talking about hepatitis C people— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—who have suffered injuries from blood therapy have not received 
any compensation.  Yet the needs of those who have been harmed 
are the same, regardless of their cause and whether or not fault 
can be proved.  Compensating some needy sufferers and not others 
cannot, in my opinion, be justified. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Canadian people are in complete agreement with 
Justice Krever.  We cannot justify a package that leaves people 
outside.  Think of the dates, 1986 to 1990.  It means that if 
someone became infected because of a blood transfusion on 
December 31, 1985 they would not be compensated.  A day later, 
New Year's day of 1986, they would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of perverse logic would lead someone to believe that 
type of package would be acceptable to the Canadian people?  It 
is not acceptable.  We in the House fought for months on that 
particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago tomorrow will be the day when the Liberals stood up 
and supported a package that discriminates against victims of 
hepatitis C through no fault of their own.  Why would they do it? 
Why did they do it?  They just simply kowtowed or bowed down to 
pressure exerted on them by the Prime Minister.  They all stood 
in their place and did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  And the Minister of Health.  They all 
knew full well that what they were doing was not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  That's not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Health Minister will have her chance to speak, 
but I will remind her that it is true.  They did kowtow to the 
wishes of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow on the front lawn of Parliament Hill a rally will be 
taking place.  It will be led by a man by the name of Joey Haché 
who criss-crossed Canada by bicycle last year in an effort to 
raise public opinion on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from the notice, not that I am using it as a prop, 
but it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wednesday, April 28, noon on the front steps of Parliament—no 
rally...just a statement.  I'm asking all Opposition MPs to join 
me for 5 minutes to show victims across Canada that they haven't 
been forgotten!  Can we still count on your support against the 
Liberals? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can count on our support on this side of the House.  I 
believe he can probably count on support from across the aisle as 
well, from some of those people who found it very difficult to 
stand in their place and support a measure they did not believe 
in.  They have now had a year to think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so crazy about the government's position is that it is 
saying it cannot afford to compensate all victims so it will 
compensate some.  I say this position is dictated more by the 
Minister of Finance than it is by the Minister of Health. 
On numerous occasions, on questions in the House, I would say 
“would the real Minister of Health stand up”.  Do members know 
which minister would rise on such questions?  It was the finance 
minister because he was the one holding the purse strings.  He 
was the one, more so than the health minister, who dictated who 
would be compensated.  It was so ridiculous when $1.1 billion was 
announced only for the victims between 1986 and 1990.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our people today talked about helicopters.  This is the 
same government that cancelled a necessary helicopter deal. It 
cancelled a legal and binding agreement which cost the taxpayers 
of Canada $750 million.  It did not build a single helicopter. 
The helicopter issue resurrects its ugly head from time to time 
in this Chamber simply because what is going on in the world 
today is part of this debate.  It cancelled the deal, which just 
paid its legal costs, to buy itself out of a piece of business. 
It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did the same thing with Pearson airport.  The people of 
Toronto are suffering because of a lack of leadership on the part 
of the government in the expansion of Pearson airport.  What did 
the government do in that case?  It cancelled the deal. It cost 
the taxpayers over a billion dollars to simply cancel a a binding 
contract it did not want with all the <I>i</I>'s an <I>t</I>'s 
dotted and crossed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take those two deals alone, we are talking about $1.75 
billion.  However, for the sake of argument, let us say $2 
billion because the government is still adding and counting in 
terms of the Pearson deal.  We still do not yet know what the 
final settlement will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that it cannot compensate hepatitis C 
victims but it can carry out a political vendetta against 
whatever group at whatever cost.  It does not have to talk about 
compensating innocent Canadians.  This falls directly at the 
doorstep of the Prime Minister.  It is not too late to do 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logically one might ask why this issue would resurrect its ugly 
head again in the House of Commons.  Did we not have enough to 
say about it last year?  We have not had enough to say about it. 
This issue will continually resurrect its ugly head until the 
government deals with it.  Members are going to hear this from 
this side of the House time and time again.  We are going to keep 
throwing in motions and using standing orders to remind the 
government that it did the wrong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to go through the clippings to realize how poorly 
the Liberal government handled this.  The Red Cross, which has 
had its own set of problems, said that all victims should be 
compensated.  The September 19, 1998 headline from the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> said “Payments to blood victims ruled out. Ottawa's 
enhanced health care offer is met with scorn”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on even into the Senate, that chamber of sober second 
thought which we sometimes criticize on a daily basis in this 
place.  It even recommended that all victims be compensated. What 
happened?  Some governments acted on their own.  They showed some 
leadership.  The Government of Ontario, recognizing an injustice, 
compensated all victims in that province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I called upon the province of New Brunswick last December to do 
the same thing.  On December 16, 1998 I met with Premier 
Thériault and his health minister, Mrs. Breau, on that very 
issue.  I suggested that they should compensate all victims or at 
least extend the compensation on an interim basis to those people 
before the package was agreed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other sad fact about the compensation package that was 
announced is that not one single victim has received a cent of 
compensation.  Now there is a protracted legal argument because 
of the mishandling by the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is the provinces have to act alone. 
Unilaterally they should do it as the province of Ontario has 
done.  We would like to see it happen in all the provinces.  If 
they have to take the leadership on this issue, so be it.  We do 
not have a government that will take the leadership or has even 
shown an inch of leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all fairness we are all disappointed with the announcement 
that only the 1986 to 1990 victims will be compensated.  We want 
to see all victims compensated.  I look forward to the debate on 
this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to debate this 
motion which was first put before the House in 1997. I say to the 
member opposite who moved the motion that a lot has happened 
since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome this opportunity to speak about this very important 
issue and remind the House of the leadership taken by the federal 
government and in particular the Minister of Health regarding the 
issue of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question the plight of Canadians who contracted 
hepatitis C from the blood supply evokes in all of us an 
overwhelming impulse of concern and sympathy.  People who were 
injured or ill and who needed blood transfusions turned to our 
blood system in their time of need.  Mr. Justice Krever so ably 
described in his final report that the blood system served to 
compound their problems because the blood they received was 
infected with hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health 
put $1.1 billion on the table to settle lawsuits and legal claims 
for the period between 1986 and 1990.  We know from the debate 
which took place in the House the reason for that time period. 
There was an acknowledgement both in Mr. Justice Krever's report 
and among public policy experts in Canada that had different 
decisions been made in 1986, there might have been a different 
result.  We know that it is always hard to judge those issues, 
but decisions were made in Canada, decisions were taken in Canada 
that were different from the international standard that had been 
established in 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past December an agreement in principle was reached by the 
negotiators.  I understand that significant progress is being 
made to finalize the settlement proposal which will go before the 
courts for approval.  That is enormous progress on this very 
difficult and important issue.  We believe that whatever 
settlement is proposed, it is the courts that must say that this 
is fair.  That is the foundation of the policy of the government, 
one of fairness and one of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the specifics of the emerging settlement, the 
government is confident that these negotiations have been the 
appropriate way to proceed, given that these matters have to be 
resolved before the courts and Canadians want a full, 
comprehensive and responsible solution to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the privilege of serving in public office for almost 
20 years, at the provincial level for 12 years, five of those in 
government, seven in opposition.  I say to members opposite that 
being in opposition affords them a certain luxury of being 
irresponsible.  But being in government, good public policy 
requires that governments be responsible in the decisions they 
propose. 
I believe the government has been responsible and compassionate 
in its approach on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the Canadian tradition of moderate compromise, we will 
solve in a responsible way the difficult issues of the past as 
they relate to hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, this negotiated settlement should in 
financial terms give a measure of comfort to many of the 
individuals who were infected with hepatitis C by the blood 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federal government has had to take a longer and broader 
view. Hepatitis C is still a relatively new disease to the 
scientific and medical communities.  The federal government has 
taken decisive action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past September the Minister of Health announced a 
comprehensive federal initiative including funding for medical 
research, community support, public education, improvements in 
disease surveillance and to work to find those who might not yet 
know they are infected with hepatitis C.  The Minister of Health 
announced a proposal to the provinces and the territories for a 
significant transfer payment to be made to ensure that the health 
system in each of the provinces responds as fast as it can and as 
appropriately as it can to the health needs of those infected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not been an easy path. We should not forget that it 
took federal leadership to have this issue receive the attention 
it has received to where we are today which is trying to settle 
those lawsuits between 1986 and 1990 and provide health services 
to those who were infected outside of that window where if other 
decisions had been made, perhaps the outcomes and the results 
would have been different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal investment in hepatitis C is now very significant, in 
all totalling more than $1 billion, but it is not only money that 
measures the level of federal commitment in this area.  It is 
also what these initiatives represent in terms of the commitment 
to knowledge and scientific development and fostering new 
productive relationships, all the while preserving and respecting 
the federal role in health and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the next few minutes to review some of 
those successes in addressing the hepatitis C issue that the 
federal leadership has brought about in just a few short years. 
While we all acknowledge that there are things yet to be done, we 
do not spend enough time acknowledging that which has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me start by pointing out that as in all things 
Canadian, this issue has required interjurisdictional 
collaboration.  Federal, provincial and territorial governments 
have worked closely with one another to see that the transition 
to a new blood system, one that Canadians can have confidence in, 
has gone as smoothly as possible and that blood and blood 
products in Canada are as safe as they can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, the federal government has had a leading role in 
what has been a very successful transition.  A key part has been 
to ensure that all jurisdictions are of the same frame of mind 
when it comes to making the safety of the blood system paramount. 
That is a huge accomplishment.  That is a significant and 
important change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additional $125 million in support of the federal regulatory 
and disease surveillance role, and up to $50 million to help the 
provinces pay for their public health function of finding those 
people who are infected with hepatitis C are clear indications of 
the federal government's commitment to ensuring that these 
functions are sufficiently resourced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has acknowledged that people infected 
with hepatitis C might not always have reasonable access to the 
health services they might require over time, and that increasing 
resources would help to address this problem. The Minister of 
Health has offered $300 million to the provinces and territories 
as a way to cover the needed medical care over the next 20 years 
and to focus our attention on resolving the issues surrounding 
this disease. The provinces and the territories have yet to fully 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also moved to meet the needs for more information and 
more support.  We could not wait until the research momentum had 
built up by itself.  For that reason the federal Minister of 
Health announced dedicated research funding of up to $50 million 
over the next five years because we need answers if we are going 
to help those people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that the federal government has been 
funding efforts to educate medical professionals and the public 
about hepatitis C.  All these indications suggest that our 
efforts are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we know many people who suffer with disabilities apply 
for the Canada pension plan as an important source of income. 
There are people with all kinds of disabilities.  We all know 
from our constituency work that the process of determining 
eligibility through the Canada pension plan disability benefit is 
very thorough.  That means it is difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP adjudicators look at each case to determine if the 
disability genuinely prevents the person from working at any job. 
To ensure that adjudicators are aware of hepatitis C, its 
implications and its impact, Human Resources Development Canada 
has carried out very specific training for the adjudicators. 
People with hepatitis C over the years will now have adjudicators 
who are responsive and sensitive and who understand hepatitis C. 
That is something we do not talk about, but it is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of activities that require the kind of 
commitment we have seen from the federal government. Without this 
commitment there would not be the momentum behind the 
comprehensive approach to dealing with hepatitis C that we see 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last word I would like to make today on this important 
motion is that the action taken by the federal government is not 
only appropriate and good public policy, it was the right thing 
to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 273 which we are debating today is a noble motion and 
one that should enjoy the support of all sides of the House, 
except the Liberals of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this kind of motion did not receive their support 
exactly one year ago tomorrow.  Joey Haché was here that day.  He 
is a very young victim of tainted blood.  He stood in the gallery 
while the Liberals voted not to compensate him for his sickness. 
One year ago Canadians witnessed a very important vote in the 
House on a matter that can only be described as a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the federal government that controlled the Canadian blood 
supply that infected about 60,000 Canadians.  We forced the House 
to vote on that issue because of the cold-hearted position of the 
Minister of Health.  In the beginning he wanted to close the file 
and compensate no one.  Today after about a year of holding his 
feet to the fire, he is willing to compensate about 20,000 of the 
victims of tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year 1,200 of the victims died.  Many of the victims have 
already died. It is as if the health minister is stalling so that 
as many of these victims as possible can die before he is finally 
forced to open up the vaults of taxpayer money he and his pal the 
finance minister have siphoned off the paycheques of Canadians 
and then pay off the victims who have successfully struggled to 
stay alive without any help from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members on this side of the House were very sad, very 
emotional and very angry when that vote was held in this chamber. 
We knew that the Liberals would vote against compensating 
Canadians infected with federal government controlled tainted 
blood. On this side of the House we were frustrated, but we tried 
to get the Liberals to allow the House of Commons to do the right 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the House the tears being shed were of a 
different nature.  Backbench Liberal MPs were weeping openly 
because even though they and their constituents felt that we 
should help the people infected with tainted blood, they had to 
vote against helping those Canadians.  If those Liberal MPs did 
not vote as they were told to vote, the Prime Minister would 
ensure that they were punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no free votes in the House as long as the traditional 
kind of political party like the one across the way holds the 
majority of seats in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will not even agree to televise parliamentary 
committee meetings.  Why?  Because they want Canadians to know as 
little about this place as possible. They want to hide the way 
they are forcing their MPs to vote and govern.

Minister and the lack of compassion shown to Canadians by the 
government.  We know because it keeps on spending tax dollars and 
it refuses to give us tax relief even though the budget is in 
surplus.  Canadian families are suffering under the heaviest tax 
burden by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, outside the House, Canadians are working on an 
alternative to traditional political parties.  The alternative 
will truly be democratic and will put an end to the government 
that talks the talk about democracy but fails to walk the walk 
when it comes to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut $23 billion in health care and education 
since it came to power.  The government has refused to eliminate 
waste and duplication in federal spending.  It has already spent 
$450 million on a gun registry system that is estimated to cost 
about $1.2 billion.  It appears the Liberals are sucking money 
out of health and education to pay for the highly questionable 
gun registration system.  In fact, it should emphasize education 
and health care that would help our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Does the member opposite not have to be on topic?  I 
think he must be dreaming that he was in the Liberal caucus when 
he was in the Reform caucus when all these members were tuned up 
for their indiscretions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is certainly 
not a point of order.  The hon. member for Surrey Central has 
been on topic and is on topic.  The topic goes around in circles 
and he is part of that circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very much on topic 
and I am exposing what the government is supposed to do and is 
not doing.  In fact, it takes money from health and education 
which it should spend on our children, on our families. The point 
I am trying to make is that the government has focused on the 
wrong target.  It spends millions of dollars on things like free 
flags, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals spent $3 billion helping 40,000 fishermen thrown 
out of work due to the failure of the federal government managed 
east coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Liberals not spend money to help the surviving 
40,000 hepatitis C victims whose lives were thrown into jeopardy 
by federal government managed blood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on and on.  I have little time to describe the 
shameful record of the government that has caused this motion to 
be brought before the House for debate.  The Liberal government 
allowed Justice Krever to be held up in court so that he could 
not report to Canadians what he had found during his inquiry. The 
health minister withheld vital documents from him, but Justice 
Krever continued to fight and would not let it go. He submitted 
his report to the House, but the Liberal government virtually 
ignored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario and Quebec are ready to compensate hepatitis C victims 
without discrimination.  The Liberal health minister by contrast 
is only compensating his legal beagle buddies by providing them 
the means to launch lawsuits and have the victims pay the lawyers 
in order to try to make the federal government compensate them 
for the federal government's mistake of giving them tainted 
blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has been calling for immediate 
compensation before it is too late for many victims of tainted 
blood who need help right now.  We on this side will continue to 
call for a no fault insurance fund to compensate all victims. 
This was one of the recommendations of Justice Krever, by the 
way, if members on the other side who are heckling have 
forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 87% of Canadians believe that provincial and federal 
governments have a moral obligation to compensate these victims, 
and 72% of Canadians believe it is unfair to compensate for HIV 
or AIDS while denying the hepatitis C victims compensation.

diseases on the other hand that we can test for and seek to 
control, including von Willibrand's disease.  We should be 
concerned about these diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member who proposed the motion is aware there is 
no way that the Liberals will entertain paying heed to this 
concern. This is a government that lacks compassion and lacks 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these diseases and bleeding disorders should be studied.  I 
am talking about a broader picture.  We should do the most and 
the best research we can to tackle these diseases and screen them 
out of our blood supply.  We could make progress, but we have to 
prepare a blueprint and a long term vision.  We know the Liberals 
do not have that and do not want to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the motion we are debating today is wishful 
thinking.  Canadians know that Liberals will fight, drag their 
feet, dig in their heels and be dragged kicking and screaming 
before they show compassion and compensate the victims of 
government controlled tainted blood.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is sad to 
have to debate this matter again today.  Justice Krever's report 
was tabled over one year ago—its anniversary is coming up 
tomorrow. Still nothing has yet been settled for the hepatitis C 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion introduced by the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest, which dates back to November 1997, just a few days 
after the Krever report was tabled, is as current as ever, for 
this motion recommended compensation for all victims of tainted 
blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us this evening reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
all necessary steps to provide a humane and fair resolution for 
those infected with hepatitis C through the blood supply system, 
and provide for research, education and support into the 
identification of other inherited bleeding disorders, in 
particular von Willebrand's disease. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here we are, still debating a motion that is as current as 
ever, a year after the tabling of the Krever report. That is 
what is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the report, the government, in March 1998, after 
voting against an opposition motion calling for compensation of 
all victims of hepatitis C, provided $1.1 billion in 
compensation to people who contracted hepatitis C between 
January 1, 1986 and July 1, 1990, because it did not acknowledge 
making a mistake either before or after this period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a year later, the motion is still relevant—sad but 
true—because there exists no fair and just compensation for all 
victims of hepatitis C, who were contaminated by this blood, as 
the hepatitis C people put it “This rotten blood we were 
injected with”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-273 calls upon the government to take every possible 
measure to find a fair and equitable settlement for people 
infected by the hepatitis C virus. 
In this regard, an initial step is possible in the form of a 
transfer to the Government of Quebec of its share of the $300 
million announced last September to compensate all those who 
became victims, regardless of the date. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this $300 million were transferred on a pro rata basis to the 
people, we could say in Quebec that we had a fair share of this 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide a little background, Quebec and Ontario felt that the 
government's offer fell short and the two of them announced they 
would extend the compensation program to include all victims, 
regardless of the date.  In September 1998, the federal 
government announced $300 million to pay the medical costs of 
people infected through the blood supply system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Quebec already has a program to cover medical expenses, 
the Quebec government asked that its share be used to extend the 
compensation package to more people because, as members know, 
the federal government does not recognize victims infected prior 
to 1986 and after 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Quebec already pays for medical expenses and since the 
federal government announced $300 million in compensation, 
Quebec would like to get its share so that it could use it to 
compensate all victims, that is those infected before 1986 and 
after 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This request is based on the government's resolution, announced 
in the 1996 throne speech, to no longer use its spending power 
to establish programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction 
without the provinces' agreement. That resolution also included 
a right to opt out with compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now, it appears that the formula used to distribute the 
money between the provinces, which was always based on the 
population of a province, may no longer be valid. Instead of 
paying $75 million, or 25% of the $300 million, as provided 
under the established formula, the federal government is only 
prepared to give Quebec $45 million, or 15% of the total amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change caught everyone by surprise. Neither the Quebec 
government nor the victims or the organizations working for 
them, including the Quebec chapter of the Hemophilia Society, 
can understand why Quebec's share does not reflect its 
demographic weight, that is 25% of the overall population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is said to have based this figure on 
epidemiological studies. This is a very haphazard method, since 
hepatitis C is difficult to detect. Indeed, many people may be 
infected without knowing it, because they are still symptom free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using this sort of calculation, there is a risk of serious 
errors that will ultimately penalize the victims, who are 
waiting for some sort of compensation to improve their condition 
and quality of life as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why both the Canadian Hemophilia Society and the 
Government of Quebec intend to put pressure on Ottawa to keep 
the population-based formula.  Thus, those who contracted the 
disease before 1986 and those who did so after 1990 will be able 
to count on $75 million instead of $42 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been more than a year since the offer for those who 
contracted the disease before 1986 and after 1990 was announced. 
We now know what is in the agreement and we are still waiting 
for the courts to approve it. 
But, according to the Canadian Hemophilia Society, it is already 
unacceptable.  We are also waiting for the results of the Red 
Cross's negotiations with its creditors to see how much it will 
be able to offer victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain: the issue is far from resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the member for New Brunswick Southwest also calls 
on the government to provide for research, education and support 
into the identification of other inherited bleeding disorders, 
in particular von Willebrand's disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The September 1998 announcement also mentioned $50 million over 
five years for prevention, public education and research into 
hepatitis C and other related diseases. 
The House will agree that $50 million is a minimum, and that 
much remains to be done to fully understand and treat these 
diseases.

have been turned upside down because of deficiencies in the 
blood supply system.  We are appealing to people to show 
compassion and ensure that those who have been the victims of 
this national tragedy are properly compensated.  The goal is not 
to assign blame, but to ensure justice for all victims of this 
unprecedented tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government prides itself on guarding the safety of Canada's 
blood supply system. 
It can and it must do what is necessary to ensure that all 
victims of the contaminated blood scandal are treated fairly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on the motion 
brought forward by the member for New Brunswick Southwest, which 
is very timely and appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that it is about one year ago today that we were 
faced with a most regrettable situation which will go down as a 
very sorry chapter in the history of this country.  Joey Haché 
and other victims of hepatitis C were in the gallery and observed 
the proceedings as the government cracked the whip and required 
all members of the Liberal Party in the House to vote against a 
motion that would have ensured fair and just compensation for all 
victims of hepatitis C in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health talks 
about the successes around this issue.  I have a hard time trying 
to find any successes on this issue.  I feel nothing really but 
much shame and embarrassment that we have a government today 
which failed to do the right thing in terms of this being a moral 
issue and to follow the legal requirements, as we understand them 
to be, ensuring that all Canadians are able to have access to 
blood products, to drugs, to food and to medical devices that are 
safe beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary referred to several measures which 
she says provide evidence of that success.  She points to the 
$1.1 billion settlement for compensation cases which fall between 
the period of 1986-1990.  She fails to mention that not one penny 
of that $1.1 billion has been paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only about a month ago that we received a press release 
from the hepatitis C organizations on the anniversary of the day 
when the government made its very arbitrary and regrettable 
decision to limit compensation to those infected between 1986 and 
1990.  The Canadian Hemophilia Society reminded us that it has 
been a year since this compensation was promised.  Erma Chapman, 
the head of the Canadian Hemophilia Society, stated very clearly 
that there has been no money paid to any of the victims.  She 
stated: “There are seriously ill people who urgently require 
treatment but do not have the financial resources to pay for it. 
The hepatitis C virus is one that can cause serious liver damage 
that can lead to death.  We call on the federal government to 
provide a method to fast-track assistance to those in serious 
need of treatment and care for their hepatitis C infections. 
Victims have died waiting for help from their government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first point that the government makes with respect to its 
so-called success in this area, the government has failed to 
ensure that any method of compensation is active in ensuring that 
victims of hepatitis C are receiving some sort of assistance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point which was made concerns the financial 
commitment of this government to assist provincial governments in 
meeting the medical needs of hepatitis C victims and in helping 
community groups support education, as well as ensuring that 
quality of life mechanisms are in place for victims of hepatitis 
C.  There has been very little movement in that regard.  I refer 
specifically to the fact that on September 18, 1998 the Minister 
of Health clearly announced a $50 million program to ensure that 
there would be assistance and help when it comes to hepatitis C 
disease prevention, community based support programs and 
research.  That program is still not up and running.  Not a penny 
of that $50 million is flowing to community organizations and 
victim support groups to ensure that the system is in place to 
provide meaningful support at a time of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a part of its so-called successes, the government has also 
talked about its movement to ensure that proper and active 
regulatory systems are in place to absolutely guarantee that this 
kind of tragedy will never happen again.  In the year that has 
passed since we last dealt with this very critical issue we have 
seen nothing but evidence after evidence that the government has 
not learned one lesson from the blood tragedy which this country 
experienced or acted on one bit of advice from Justice Krever who 
called very clearly for the government to recognize the error of 
its ways and to move toward an active, not a passive, regulatory 
approach when it comes to blood, food and drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an observer watching this government, it would almost seem 
that it has forgotten the lessons of the past, that it has 
decided to completely ignore Justice Krever because it has shown 
not one iota of interest in moving toward a firm, active, 
intensive regulatory approach in all of these areas around which 
human safety and health is so much a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had the experience of going through four months of 
hearings around the issue of organ and tissue donation and 
transplantation.  It was a major disappointment for us to learn 
that this government had not learned from Justice Krever and was 
not prepared to apply the recommendations of the Krever report 
when it came to organs and tissues.  Canadians see that blood is 
no different than organs and tissues.  All are invasive 
procedures which require extra precautionary methods, yet this 
government refuses to take a proactive approach when it comes to 
the safety of Canadians.  It has put on the table a risk 
management framework for the matter of organs and tissues, 
suggesting, despite everything we have learned from the blood 
tragedy, that there may be circumstances under which this 
government may not be held liable.  For the first time, despite 
Krever, this government is actually raising the possibility of 
indemnification from the responsibility of ensuring the safety of 
Canadians on all of those issues and matters regulated under the 
Food and Drugs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a hard time pointing to any successes on this issue.  My 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I are left with the 
need to keep raising this issue and to try to convince the 
government to reopen this sorry chapter in the history of our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have actually happened in the year since Joey Haché 
and others were in the gallery watching developments unfold, not 
the least of which was a major documentary by the <I>Fifth 
Estate</I> in January 1999 pointing to the serious problems with 
respect to blood collected from prisoners in the United States 
coming into this country and the government not taking 
precautions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was further evidence to Justice Krever's report about the 
deplorable actions of this government, the absolute negligence on 
the part of this government to ensure the safety of blood 
products.  I think that evidence alone should be enough for the 
government to realize that it must reopen this question and it 
must look for a way to ensure compensation for all victims of 
hepatitis C because we are dealing with the failure of this 
government to uphold its responsibilities under the law of the 
land.

Southwest used in quoting Justice Krever who said “The 
compassion of a society can be judged by the measures it takes to 
reduce the impact of tragedy on its members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those words in mind, today we are calling on the government 
to show the compassion and leadership Canadians have come to 
expect from their national government toward victims of tragedies 
and disasters.  We urge the government to take whatever steps are 
necessary to ensure that hepatitis C victims in this tragic 
episode are equally compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only through this and putting in place corrective measures 
to ensure that these circumstances are never repeated that we as 
a nation can move forward with confidence and a sense of justice 
worthy of Canada's traditions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank all parties and members on this side of 
the House who support my motion.  It is encouraging when the 
Bloc, Reform, NDP and Conservatives agree.  I hope Canadians have 
noticed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can always tell when the government is nervous in this place. 
Its members yak continually and try to throw off the speakers 
when discussing a topic the government is not comfortable with. 
We started off this debate by reminding the Canadian people that 
exactly a year ago every one of those Liberal members, including 
the ones that are presently in the House, stood on their feet and 
denied compensation to innocent victims of hepatitis C.  If I 
were on that side and did the same thing, I would be extremely 
nervous.  In fact, most of us would be hiding under our desks 
after having done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party is the only party that can swallow itself 
whole on an issue like this and then come back into the House and 
defend it.  No other party can do that.  That is exactly what the 
Liberals are doing.  They have swallowed themselves whole. They 
always pretend to be the defenders of the underdog, the 
underprivileged, the poor and the sick, except when it comes to 
doing something.  In this case, they did nothing for a group of 
innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not deny that the parliamentary secretary is a pretty 
good person outside of this House and she probably is a 
compassionate person, but that speech of hers sounded like it 
came from an accountant.  Why?  Because it was drafted by her 
lawyer.  Who is her lawyer?  Allan Rock.  Who is Allan Rock?  The 
Minister of Health.  That is bureaucratic gobbledegook. Is 
gobbledegook a parliamentary word?  I guess in this case it would 
be because that is all it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can tell by their expressions that the Liberals are not very 
happy with our having resurrected this ugly issue, because they 
look bad on it.  They still look bad on it and it is not going to 
go away easily.  It is not going to die a natural death. Why? 
Because on this side of the House we are not going to let it die. 
We are not going to let the issue slowly fade away.  It is an 
important issue.  It is an issue that Canadians want addressed. 
The victims want redress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to step through some facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the federal government did not properly fulfil 
its duties as a blood system regulator.  This means that it did 
not keep a close eye on the activities of the Red Cross. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the federal government reacted too slowly to 
the threat of blood borne AIDS and mistakenly played down to 
Canadians the risk of the virus contaminating the blood supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the provinces which funded the Red Cross blood 
program did not provide timely and sufficient funds for 
scientific tests that would have screened out blood contaminated 
with the AIDS virus and hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the provinces did not do enough to track down 
infected blood recipients, some of whom were unaware that they 
had AIDS and unknowingly passed it on to their sexual partners. 
The same applies to hepatitis C.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the Red Cross took inadequate steps to 
implement a screening program that would have prevented high risk 
donors such as sexually active gay men from donating their blood. 
It does not end there.  It allowed contaminated blood from the 
American prison system to come into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the Red Cross did not move quickly enough to 
replace its inventory of contaminated blood products used by 
hemophiliacs with newer heat treated products that were safe.  It 
has nothing to be proud of in what it did for those victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until all of those victims are compensated we on this side of 
the House will continually fight for them.  At some point the 
government will have to atone for its sins.

no real support forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today to say that we will not stand for it.  Nor will 
we let up on our demand that the federal government do right by 
the thousands of people in B.C. affected by this crisis.  It is 
something for which we have been fighting for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in July 1998 and again in December 1998 I wrote to the 
minister urgently asking the government to support 
recommendations from both the Barrett commission and the 
Condominium Owners Association of B.C. for tax relief and GST 
rebates.  To date the federal government has rejected these 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of this year the B.C. municipal affairs minister 
visited Ottawa to pressure the federal government to participate 
in the B.C. reconstruction loan program.  The answer from the 
feds was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 17, I questioned the minister of public of works in the 
House and asked why on earth the federal government would offer 
federal loans to B.C. with interest rates so high that the 
province would be better off accessing them on the open market. 
Instead of admitting that the offer was hypocritical at best, the 
federal minister's response was that the issue required further 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all these efforts and despite the heartfelt need of 
thousands of desperate homeowners, the Liberal government has yet 
to act.  Empty expressions of concern do not contribute one bit 
to the repairs that are needed to get these homeowners back on a 
secure footing.  The feds have even refused to partner with the 
province in assisting housing co-ops that are facing the same 
problems, many of which were built under federal housing 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 24, the Government of British Columbia announced that 
housing co-ops could apply for provincial assistance.  Clearly 
the Government of B.C. is helping resolve this terrible 
situation, but the question remains where is the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government in Ottawa has turned its back on 
thousands of leaky condo owners in B.C. left stranded as their 
assets literally drain away.  It is a shameful ploy that once 
again shuffles the interest of western Canadians to the bottom of 
the deck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once and for all I ask the federal government to provide support 
and to participate responsibly in the program to help desperate 
B.C. owners of leaky condos.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the national housing agency CMHC has been working in 
co-operation with others involved in housing research, design, 
construction and regulation to determine what improvements need 
to be made to design and building practices to eliminate these 
moisture related problems for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the Barrett commission report provided a wide 
range of recommendations on how to improve the situation for 
condominium owners.  The report called for CMHC to double 
residential rehabilitation assistance program funding for British 
Columbia.  The Government of Canada did this for fiscal year 
1998-99.  In addition to providing more RRAP funds, the 
Government of Canada has also offered $75 million in bridge 
financing for the reconstruction fund that was mentioned by the 
member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC is also working toward solutions to resolve the issue 
through our National Housing Act mortgage loan insurance.  Some 
home owners with moisture damaged units have NHA insured 
mortgages.  These individuals may have access to a number of 
financial options.  Applications will be assessed by the approved 
lenders and CMHC on a case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to assisting home owners who currently have an NHA 
insured loan, CMHC has negotiated with the British Columbia's 
home protection office to provide mortgage insurance for their 
provincial program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that it is the position of the government 
that tax relief or a tax subsidy as suggested by the Barrett 
commission would not be an equitable option for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure as a 
former resident of British Columbia to ask a follow-up question 
in our late show today. On March 25 I asked: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for the past year Canadian lumber companies have been able to 
ship value added, rougher headed lumber products which are used 
in the exterior trim and finish of building projects to the 
United States without paying U.S. duties. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week U.S. customs announced that it was planning to 
reclassify Canadian exports of rougher headed products and 
subject them to strict quota limitations, thereby putting 
thousands of jobs in British Columbia at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government commit today to fight this blatant attempt 
to break international tariff rules and to ensure market access 
for the important products and protect forestry jobs? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the response from the hon. Minister of International 
Trade who said with crocodile tears: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we will not accept this American ruling—We will challenge 
it— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically he sounded like Churchill for a second:  We will fight 
them on the beaches.  We will fight them in the trenches.  We 
will fight them all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be completely honest, we could stretch this to Christmas 
trees exported from Nova Scotia.  We could talk about the salmon 
disputes with Alaska and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious the United States does not respect Canada 
when it comes to international trade deals or rulings of any 
kind.  It looks at us like a lap dog and walks over us.  The 
rougher headed lumber is a classic example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tried to put through Bill C-55, and look at all 
the hubbub it caused.  It is quite clear that the current 
Minister of International Trade has absolutely no standing with 
the United States government because it continuously walks all 
over us in everything we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion to the hon. parliamentary secretary who will 
answer this question is that instead of the international trade 
minister looking after his future occupation, whatever that will 
be, he should start concentrating on Canadian jobs and Canadian 
exports in order to protect those jobs, especially in interior 
and coastal B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government actually stand up for Canadian workers 
and Canadian towns, especially when it comes to the lumber 
industry?  Being a former resident of British Columbia, I may say 
it is an absolutely beautiful province.  Just like in Nova Scotia 
those people have a right to live, work, access resources and 
export them worldwide and not just to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deserve to be respected.  Our government should be fighting 
harder for those people in British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for more than 17 years the politically influential U.S. softwood 
lumber industry has sought action by the U.S. government to 
restrict Canadian access to the U.S. lumber market.  On that 
point the member was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, however, may be unaware that Canada won the 
last softwood lumber dispute with the U.S. in 1994, so we are not 
lap dogs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was this defeat and the subsequent threat by the U.S. 
industry to file a new countervailing duty case that gave rise to 
the softwood lumber agreement.  The industry and provinces wanted 
to avoid another long and costly legal battle with an uncertain 
outcome, hence their advocacy and support for the 1996 softwood 
lumber agreement with the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the hon. member that the government is very 
concerned with actions by the U.S. customs service to reclassify 
lumber products that are currently exempted from the softwood 
lumber agreement.  We are sparing no effort, as was stated by the 
minister, to counter these reclassifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bring the hon. member up to date, last week Canadian and U.S. 
officials held a meeting under the softwood lumber agreement 
dispute settlement mechanism.  We outlined our objections to the 
U.S. proposal to reclassify rougher headed lumber.  Moreover, we 
have already signalled our intention to raise this 
reclassification at the World Customs Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member likely knows that we are already challenging the 
U.S. customs reclassification of drilled studs at the World 
Customs Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no misunderstanding.  The government will 
vigorously oppose all attempts by the U.S. to expand unilaterally 
the coverage of the softwood lumber agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
