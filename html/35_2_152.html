	<B>Mr. Janko Peri</B>G<B> (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the people of Cambridge, I am delighted to congratulate 
Cambridge lawyers Milena Protich and Robert Pettitt, recent 
recipients of the Law Society of Upper Canada's 1997 Bicentennial 
Award of Merit. To celebrate its 200th anniversary, the Law 
Society of Upper Canada introduced this special award which 
recognizes the incredible contribution lawyers make to their towns 
and cities through community work. This award of merit was 
bestowed on Ms. Protich and Mr. Pettitt for their powerful sense of 
community giving and exemplary dedication to public service.
<P>
	Again, I congratulate these two community spirited lawyers for 
their ongoing voluntarism.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity to call attention to the 40th anniversary of 
the <I>Guide de Montréal-Nord</I>, which was founded on January 1, 
1957 by publicist Paul Trudeau and journalist Yves Ryan, the 
present mayor of Montréal-Nord.
<P>
	This weekly, delivered to every home in Montréal-Nord, is part 
of the Groupe Transcontinental, which owns some 100 weeklies in 
eastern Montreal and the lower Laurentians region. It has been 
edited for some  years now by Jean-Claude Banville, a man with a 
great commitment to his community. I will be attending the gala 
evening event which will mark the start of these celebrations on 
May 23.
<P>
	My congratulations to the management, the journalists, the 
support staff and all of the readers of the <I>Guide de Montréal-Nord, 
</I>a weekly with an essential role in the social, cultural and 
community life of my riding of Bourassa.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two years ago a 
young woman from my riding named Tammy Fee was brutally 
assaulted, raped and threatened with death in her own home after 
being stalked for weeks.
<P>
	The man who perpetrated this vicious attack, Rick White, was 
immediately apprehended, charged and convicted. Now, after only 
two years of incarceration, he is scheduled for parole on May 23.
<P>
	Tammy Fee is so afraid that this man is going to come after her 
that she is seriously planning to change her name and identity and 
relocate somewhere else in Canada so that Rick White cannot find 
her. In other words, she fears for her life so much that she is going 
underground to hide.
<P>
	Surely this is appalling testimony to the lack of concern the 
criminal justice system and this Parliament have shown for the 
rights of victims in this country.
<P>
	Tammy Fee is not just a victim of violence, she is now also a 
victim of this justice minister's policies.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
VIA Rail is reducing the level of maintenance on railway passenger 
cars assigned to service in northern Manitoba.
<P>
	VIA bulletin C-100 makes it very clear that the company has 
approved ``a reduction of the level of preventive maintenance'' on 
cars used in northern Manitoba. These cars ``will not be allowed to 
run in any other service''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9478"> 9478 </A></B>
<P>
	The creation of such a second class passenger rail service in 
northern Manitoba is ridiculous and unacceptable. The highest 
standards are required, given the adverse track conditions, greater 
distances and cold weather.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Canadians do not want a two-tier passenger rail system any more

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my riding 
is being honoured by the visit of a municipal delegation from the 
city of Rafah in the Gaza strip headed by Mayor Saied Zourab. 
They are returning the visit to Rafah by Waterloo Mayor Brian 
Turnbull and city official Paul Eichinger.
<P>
	During their stay they are doing as our delegation did in Rafah: 
observing the operation of water and landfill facilities, social 
services and civic administration.
<P>
	Through this exchange we can learn from one another ways of 
improving life in our respective communities. The ties of 
friendship that are established between our communities so far 
apart will contribute to peace and understanding.
<P>
	This exchange is jointly sponsored by the Federation of

role in participation and in the promotion of understanding and 
co-operation between ourselves and other countries on a

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides): </B>Mr. Speaker, the last 
Liberal Party of Canada publication, <I>Women Working to Win</I>, leads 
us to make the following remark.
<P>
	What is the difference between men and women candidates for 
the Liberal Party of Canada? For women, the package is as 
important as the contents. For men, neither has any importance.
<P>
	Who will go and pick up the kids from daycare during the 
campaign? Nobody, because the Liberals have not created the 
150,000 daycare places promised in 1993.
<P>
	What will the theme song of the ideal Liberal female candidate 
be? ``Do my laundry for me now, honey, and I promise to do yours 
after the election''.
<P>
	It is all very fine to laugh at these funny remarks, but it is sad, 
and annoying most of all, to see the lack of confidence this party 
has in the political potential of women, whom they consider as 
either Superwoman or Miss Universe. With the year 2000 less than 
1,000 days away, there is still work to be done on the situation of 
women in Canada, particularly where the Liberal Party of Canada

<P>
	The mission of the Canadian Cancer Society is to eradicate 
cancer and to enhance the quality of life of people living with 
cancer. The society, in collaboration with its research affiliate, the 
National Cancer Institute of Canada, achieves its mission through 
research, education, patient services and advocacy of health public 
policy. These efforts are supported by volunteers in communities 
across Canada.

	Cancer takes an enormous toll and most Canadians have been 
touched by cancer in some way. 1997 will see an estimated 130,800 
new cases of cancer and 60,700 deaths from cancer this year. The 
most frequently diagnosed cancers will continue to be breast cancer 
for women and prostate cancer for men. Lung cancer remains the 
leading cause of cancer death for both sexes.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every day, we get distressing news from Zaire. Because of 
the civil war, the country is now cut in two, and thousands of 
refugees continue to flee as the troops advance. The Zairian state is 
on the brink of chaos.
<P>
	This morning, for instance, we heard that President Mobutu just 
fired his newly appointed Prime Minister, Étienne Tshisekedi, and 
appointed a general in his place. Martial law has been proclaimed 
throughout the country. In other words, Africa's largest country is 
on the brink of anarchy.
<P>
	Could the Acting Prime Minister tell us the official position of 
the Canadian government on the situation prevailing in Zaire?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada is very concerned about 
the situation in Zaire today, as it has been in the past months and 
years. The situation has deteriorated even further today.
<P>
	Canada believes that there has to be a peaceful resolution to the 
chaos which exists in Zaire at this time, a situation which puts in 
jeopardy the security of so many Zaireans and others.
<P>
	We are asking for all parties to sit down and discuss a peacefully 
negotiated resolution to this. We believe that the Africans 
themselves must find a solution to this problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning we heard that the White House was urging 
President Mobutu to relinquish his post and go into exile. This 
would be essential to guarantee stability in Zaire.
<P>
	Does the Canadian government also intend to ask President 
Mobutu to leave his post and his country for the sake of his people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is not 
asking the president to leave the country at this time.
<P>
	Canada believes that Africans have to resolve their problems. 
Obviously western imposed solutions in this area of the world have 
not succeeded in the past. We are trying to urge not just the 
Zaireans to resolve the problem but with the help of regional 
Africans to resolve this very serious problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone agrees that the country is on the brink of 
anarchy, and every day at least 120 refugees are dying in the camps.
<P>
	Still on the subject of Zaire, my question is directed to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Considering that a 
number of Zairian nationals have been ordered deported to that 
country and that this may happen very  shortly, will the minister

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs continued 
to deny the democratic legitimacy of Quebec's National Assembly, 
which was elected by the people of Quebec, anglophones and 
francophones, and to require the agreement of certain pressure 
groups before taking any action with respect to the linguistic school 
boards issue.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, by setting himself up as the sole 
judge of what constitutes a consensus in Quebec, he is confirming 
that the 1982 Constitution did indeed undermine the authority of 
Quebec's National Assembly and that it allows Ottawa to deny the 
collective will of the people, as expressed by their government?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, it is because of section 43 of the 1982 
Constitution that it is even possible to make such an amendment 
bilaterally.
<P>
	Second, I am in complete agreement with the statement made by 
my counterpart, Mr. Brassard, last February 12, and I quote: ``The 
unanimity of the National Assembly in itself is not proof of 
consensus, but it is certainly of more than passing interest''.
<P>
	And he added: ``Consensus does not mean unanimity, I agree, 
but it is obvious that the consensus must include the anglophone 
community''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would remind the minister that it is the Government of Quebec that 
is responsible for finding a common ground with all stakeholders in 
the education sector.
<P>
	Why does the minister continue to refuse to recognize that the 
only judge of what constitutes a consensus in Quebec is and must 
be the National Assembly of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Because, Mr. Speaker, it happens that we too are elected 
representatives of Quebec, because all elected representatives in 
this House consider Quebec  part of their country, and because this 
is therefore a matter of concern to all Canadians and to all 
Quebecers.
<P>
	I believe I am defending a value of great importance to 
Quebecers when I say that there should be no constitutional 
amendment until we can be sure that there is a consensus that 
includes the minority concerned, when the amendment concerns 
the minority in question.

already taken care of victims'', he said. ``It is a provincial 
jurisdiction'', he said.
<P>
	These excuses do not sit well with victims like Theresa McCuaig 
or Debbie Mahaffy. They say the only thing that is holding up the 
victims bill of rights is the minister's lack of political will.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

member opposite the government fully agrees that everything that 
can be done should be done to improve the system to make it more 
sensitive to the interests of victims.
<P>
	It is for that very reason I voted in favour of the resolution to 
send to the committee the suggestion that a committee of the House 
look at a victims bill of rights. I voted in favour of that. Members 
of the Reform Party on that committee know the committee has 
been busy with work and is now addressing the issue.

this minister can handle academic questions on jurisprudence but 
when the question calls for feeling and for practical action on

dispassionate reasoned analysis for an unfeeling approach to these 
issues.

than any other in the past has spent time with victims of crime, has 
made it his business to meet with victims of crime, has listened 
directly to their stories of tragedy, and as a result has acted to 
improve the law of the country.
<P>
	I have already made clear that in its dedication to improving the 
system for victims the government takes a back seat to no one. We 
are in favour of looking at a bill of rights. The committee is doing 
that now at our request.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	We intend to build on what we have done through legislation so 
far to improve the system of justice for the interests of victims of 
crimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, victims do not want time with the minister. They want a 
victims bill of rights.
<P>
	A right is a right is a right. Victims have a right to be informed 
about the judicial process. They have a right to have their voices 
heard at all stages of that process and at parole hearings. They have 
a right to know about potential plea bargains and other backroom 
deals between lawyers. They have the right to be protected from 
intimidation, harassment and interference.
<P>
	Why does the justice minister not simply recognize these 
fundamental rights now and bring forward a victims bill of rights 
before the federal election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will await the report of the 
committee which is hard at work on that subject now.
<P>
	Yesterday the committee heard moving and important testimony 
from victims on what is needed. Let the committee report and then 
the government will respond.
<P>
	I will not allow the hon. member to challenge my commitment 
or the commitment of the government to the interests of victims. 
We sit in the House every day, most of us, and watch members of 
the Reform Party shamelessly exploit the tragedy of others, 
shamelessly exploit the sadness of victims. It is a sad and frankly a 
disgusting spectacle.
<P>
	We have shown by action over the last 3.5 years that we are 
prepared to step up and act where necessary to improve through 
legislation the justice system for victims.
<P>
	Members opposite should bear in mind that we take a back seat 
to no one when it comes to commitment to victims.

to proceed with a constitutional amendment. At the time, the 
official opposition in the New Brunswick legislature had voted 
against the application. Nevertheless, the federal government 
acceded to New Brunswick's request.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs realize that, by 
requesting legal or regulatory guarantees for Quebec's anglophone 
minority, he is not treating Quebec the same as the other provinces, 
as he knows perfectly well that the others would refuse to consider 
such guarantees for the francophone minority? Does the minister

different standard for Quebec, yes or no?

<P>

	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> In the case of New Brunswick, it was very obviously 
an amendment that would expand the rights of the minority. All

Conservatives and the NDP. The only party not in favour was the 
COR, a party created especially to fight bilingualism. It is a sorry

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, apparently, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is 
continuing the work of his mentor, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. He keeps 
trying to diminish the powers of the National Assembly by giving 
the federal government the power to intervene directly in the case 
of a reform made by Quebecers for Quebecers.

veto?

that was a disgrace we heard in the House of Commons.
<P>
	That young lady lives in my riding. The Minister of Justice tells 
us he cares about victims. The victim of Darren Ursel was sexually 
abused beyond anyone's understanding in this room and Darren 
Ursel got no time in jail, thanks to the government's Bill C-41 and 
conditional sentencing.
<P>
	Again, does the Minister of Justice and the Liberal government 
believe it acceptable that any female in Canada can be raped, 
beaten, humiliated, and the  criminal receive no time in jail? Is this 
what he calls victims rights?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for as long as there has been a 
justice system and for as long as we have had politics there have 
been people like the hon. member who is prepared to do what he is 
doing. The responsibility of those in government is to rise above 
this sort of ploy, to remember what is in the public interest and to 
remember what is responsible government.
<P>
	The hon. member did not tell the House that the case in issue has 
gone to the British Columbia Court of Appeal which will have an 
opportunity to consider all the circumstances of that case, and it 
ought not be discussed here.
<P>
	I want the House to note that the hon. member and his colleagues 
pretend to have a monopoly on concern about victims. The reality 
is that they talk and we act. We have done more for victims over the 
last 3.5 years through solid legislation than any other government

<P>
	I ask him what rights, in his view, the Government of Quebec is 
getting ready to take away from the anglo-Quebec minority in the

he should tell us that the Quebec government is not taking any

close, the Government of Canada has said that, yes, linguistic 
school boards are entirely valid.
<P>
	Second: Is there sufficient support in the society in question, 
including within the community? That is what must be determined, 
and it is up to the Government of Quebec to do so because this is its 
plan and its jurisdiction and it is the one in a position to make 
amendments and provide assurances that will make it possible, in 
effect, to modernize Quebec's school system. That is everyone's

Resources Development.
<P>
	Recently, Pierre Dagenais, the Director of the Société de 
développement économique de la région de Sherbrooke, 
condemned the federal government because its transition job fund 
was available only to regions with more than 12 per cent 
unemployment. It seems that the Sherbrooke region, with its 11.5 
per cent unemployment rate, is not entitled to this form of federal 
assistance.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Human Resources Development explain to 
us how the Sherbrooke region can be excluded from such a job 
creation program, when it ranks fourth poorest of 25 major 
Canadian cities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the question 
from the hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. The 
transition job fund is, of course, one of the accomplishments of 
which this government is very proud. It is part of the employment 
insurance reform.
<P>
	What we are doing is this: to assist people who are without jobs, 
in areas where there is more than 12 per cent unemployment, we 
help people create jobs. We are partners with other levels of 
government or with the private sector who are prepared to create 
jobs.
<P>

	We have put $300 million into this fund. More than 30 per cent 
of it will, moreover, be invested in Quebec businesses in the years 
to come in order to create jobs. I admit, the 12 per cent criterion 
is merely an arbitrary figure. The main thing was to invest these 
funds in regions with the greatest need. We chose 12 per cent as 
the cut-off level.

the Sherbrooke region is disadvantaged by this program, and is 
placed in direct competition with all of the cities in Canada, and of 
course all of Quebec.

this response that the Sherbrooke region ought to import 
unemployed people from elsewhere in order to be eligible for some 
consideration by this government?

one does not go very far.

only yesterday she announced six job creation projects with which 
my department will be involved in the coming weeks-for, as you

these various social agencies are being put in by government 
cutbacks and the incredible burden they are having to bear? Does 
he really think that these voluntary and in many cases charitable 
organizations, whether churches or other groups, can pick up the 
slack which is being created by government cutbacks? They 
cannot. What does the government intend to do about this very 
disturbing fact?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that as a result of government cutbacks at all 
levels, federal, provincial and even municipal budgets, social or 
voluntary agencies have had to pick up a lot of the slack. One 
certainly understands the pressure they are under.
<P>
	In the last budget, in order to enable them to raise money, we 
provided a number of tax credits so that they would be able to bear 
a bit more of the burden.

	Nonetheless, I think the member's question is very much to the 
point. That is why right from the very beginning when we 
proceeded to do the necessary clean-up of the nation's finances we 
approached it in as humane a way as possible. In other words, we 
left as much money in the hands of those government departments 
that were helping people. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development has brought in a number of programs to help poorer 
children, and that is what the whole new child tax benefit is all

the T-3 building and ancillary services for a total of $719 million.

the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The minister and his department knew or should have known 
that the Digby scallop fleet could not possibly survive on the 
scallop beds in the Bay of Fundy alone. Corralling the inshore fleet 
into this confined area would result in over harvesting and depleted 
scallop beds. Atlantic groundfish, Pacific salmon and now 
scallops-DFO's management record is a litany of failure.
<P>
	Will the minister take immediate steps to ensure that a proper 
management plan is put in place which will provide a long term, 
sustainable fishery for the inshore scallop fleet.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are two scallop fleets in the area of which he 
talks in the Bay of Fundy, inshore and offshore.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He would know them well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Yes, he would know them well. In 1986 an 
arrangement was made and negotiated between these two fleets 
that a line would be drawn from Yarmouth across the Bay of Fundy. 
Each fleet would fish inside or outside the line, produce their own 
conservation harvesting plan and their own fleet rationalization, 
which was basically to have the right number of resources to match 
the fish that are there and the boats.
<P>
	This was actually held by the federal court 10 years later, last 
year, to be legitimate when the inshore made an application to fish 
offshore.
<P>
	He spoke about the management plan. Last year, as a result of the 
condition of the inshore fishermen, the management plan made an 
allocation of 100 tonnes outside the line for inshore scallop fishery 
on the basis that it was a one-time agreement and that the two fleets 
would get together and sort it out in the future.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my point of order 
is with respect to an answer given by the Minister of Finance to a 
question.
<P>
	I draw your attention to citations 348 to 352 of Beauchesne 
which has to do with statements by ministers. What he gave was 
primarily a statement by a minister and should have been so 
directed.
<P>
	Second, I draw to your attention citation 408 of Beauchesne in 
which it states explicitly that questions should not require a lengthy 
and detailed answer. Answers to questions should be as brief as 
possible. Citation 410 states: ``Time is scarce'' and ``Brevity both 
in questions and answers is of great importance''.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	It is quite obvious that the member asking the question and the 
minister had communicated beforehand. This could have been done 
in another venue and I object strongly to this.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Your objection is noted. I try as best I can in 
question period to keep both the questions and the answers to a 
reasonable length of time. I am sure all hon. members will want to 
do that in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my point of 
order is somewhat similar to the point of order by the member for 
Elk Island.
<P>
	My reference is to Beauchesne citations 348 to 350 as well. 
There is no opportunity during question period for either a House 
leader or a member of this assembly to stand on a point of order or 
raise a question at the point of time when what we felt was a 
violation of principle occurred. That was very difficult. We were in 
your hands at that point in time. We felt that the Minister of 
Finance may have had a very important answer.
<P>
	I know some of my colleagues reacted very strenuously and we 
are not in character when doing that kind of thing. But under the 
circumstances there was no other way that we could react to the 
situation than to-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> What am I going to say, that the answer was too 
short? It was not. It got away and that is my fault. It was your 
Speaker's fault. I am going to try to keep those questions and the 
answers a bit shorter.
<P>
	I would remind all hon. members that the question is the 
question, whatever way you want to put it. As long as it is in order, 
of course we are going to let the minister answer. But I would ask 
you again, please, when you are putting the question, in the 
preamble and in the question itself and also in the giving of the 
answer that you give some consideration to the length of the 
questions and the answers and I will try to be more vigilant. Today 
it got away from me and that is the way it is. I am sorry.
<P>

<P>
	(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> I wish to advise the House that the government 
intends to move that both of the bills just introduced be referred to 
committee before second reading, pursuant to Standing Order 
73(1).
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House do now proceed to the Orders of Day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I thought I heard two motions by the minister. First 
he said that the government was going to move that the two bills 
that have just been introduced be referred to committee before 
second reading. Then he went into the second motion which you 
have just read. Can you give us some clarification on the 
disposition of the first motion that he read?
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for St. Albert has raised 
the question of what happened to the first motion put by the 
minister. The minister was just expressing an intent to refer the bill 
to committee. If I heard correctly it was not a motion.
<P>
	The second point raised by the member by implication was why 
he was raising it here rather than as some other matter under the 
daily routine. I am informed that this can be done. It has been done 
in the past under all sorts of rubrics including the tabling of 
documents and statements by ministers. There is no difficulty with 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> It is not often that I am confused but I am 
confused now. I recall the minister's words quite clearly. He moved 
that the two bills be referred to committee under a section of the 
standing orders. I want to ask a question of clarification.
<P>
	Were the words of the minister an actual motion, or was he just 
saying that under the standing orders the bill would be 
automatically referred? I just did not quite understand. Perhaps, 
Mr. Speaker, you could clarify that for me.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When the minister stood after the other 
motions were dealt with, he indicated he had an intent to refer them 
to the committee. Therefore it was not a second motion. It was a 
notice of motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was my understanding the wording that the hon. 
member from the government side used was that he moved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9490"> 9490 </A></B>
<P>
seconded by, which made it in the form of a motion whether 
appropriate or not.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is essentially repeating 
the point made by his colleague. If the member does not approve of 
the matter he is certainly at liberty to vote against it.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADALABOURCODE">CANADA LABOUR CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 11 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-66, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) 
and the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time and 
passed; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would 
like to know if my right as a member of Parliament to present 
petitions has been taken away from me today?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will realize that the 
effect of the vote is that petitions are not heard today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak on Bill C-66 again, a revision to part I of the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Certainly revisions to the Canada Labour Code are past due 
because there have not been any revisions to this part of the code in 
the last 20 years. It makes one wonder why the government is in 
such a hurry where this bill is concerned.
<P>
	For the record I would like to clarify some allegations put 
forward by the Minister of Labour in answer to my colleague from 
St. Albert earlier today in question period.
<P>
	When my colleague asked the minister why he was not removing 
the chairman of the CLRB for his alleged extravagances on his 
expense account, the minister asked why the Reform Party was not 
co-operating and was filibustering this bill. I believe the record 
should be set straight.
<P>
	When this bill was brought to the House, the government asked 
if the Reform Party would concur to send it straight to committee 
before second reading. The Reform Party said it would be glad to 
oblige. We went directly to committee, heard witnesses and applied 
for some witnesses. We did not get every witness we would have 
liked but we understood that it went with the territory of being the 
third party in the House. However, we said that we would be 
constructive rather than obstructive, but the minister says we were 
filibustering.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister alleged that we were actually 
filibustering. I cannot understand how in the world agreeing on our 
part to go directly to committee before second reading would be 
filibustering. That is rather a leap of logic.
<P>
	When the bill came back to the House at report stage, the chief 
government whip asked if I would agree to extending the hours on 
this bill. I asked him how long that extension would be. He said that 
it would not be very long and so I and my party agreed. Again, how 
can this possibly be construed as filibustering the minister's bill? 
This is the second time we have bent over backwards to 
accommodate the minister. Filibustering, my foot. 
Accommodation.
<P>
	The record will show that six members of the Reform Party have 
spoken to this bill. This is an extremely important bill particularly 
to western Canadians and to grain farmers in our area. It is not 
exclusive to grain farmers but it is definitely an area in which grain 
farmers are affected. Six of our members to this date have spoken 
to this bill. This is hardly a filibuster, even by Liberal standards.
<P>
	I find the comments by the minister irresponsible and flippant. 
The comments by the minister have been extremely irrational. How 
can the minister say they read all about this in the newspaper and 
now they are going to check it out? Correct me if I am wrong but is 
it not the minister's responsibility to check these things out on an 
ongoing basis? Or does he not monitor the operations of his 
department and the boards that operate in that purview?
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I certainly hope Canadians are paying attention today, the same 
Canadians who watched the irresponsible display from the minister 
during question period. I believe I have done my part to set the 
record straight.
<P>
	The bill we are talking about has no provisions for final offer 
selection arbitration. True, it does have some provision for loading 
the grain products that reach the coast on to the ships once they are 
in the terminal elevator, but there is no dispute settlement 
mechanism. If there is a work stoppage, whether a strike or a 
lockout, in the grain handling system anywhere between the farm 
gate and the terminal in the next week or so, the government's 
reaction will be to enact back to work legislation. Part of that back 
to work legislation would be the use of final offer selection 
arbitration to bring the two sides together to solve the impasse.
<P>
	If this tool is good enough to use in an emergency, on an ad hoc, 
piecemeal basis, which seems to be the way the government likes 
to run all its operations, why would it not be a good tool to have in 
place at all times?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It makes too much sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Far too much sense. With this bill the 
government and the minister have tried to placate the labour 
movement and the labour representatives in the Bloc and the NDP 
by bringing in back door anti-replacement worker legislation. It is 
neither fish nor fowl. It does not allow replacement workers and it 
does  not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9492"> 9492 </A></B>
<P>
disallow replacement workers. It left to the discretion of the board; 
discretionary powers again.
<P>
	Every piece of legislation we have seen in the House allows the 
minister and the governor in council discretionary powers. Here is 
a piece of legislation that allows the Canadian industrial relations 
board the discretionary power to rule whether replacement workers 
are an undermining factor to the existence of the union or whether 
they will be allowed and in what situations. Here we have another 
piecemeal situation where neither labour nor management has a 
clear cut definition of the status on replacement workers.
<P>
	It has been pointed out many times before that we are talking 
about roughly 700,000 employees who come under the jurisdiction 
of the federal government, people in the transportation, 
telecommunications and banking industries primarily.
<P>
	It should be noted that this is not legislation that covers all other 
organized labour in Canada. There are roughly 700,000 people 
employed in Canada who will be affected by this bill.
<P>
	Final offer selection arbitration is the one tool that we feel is 
very useful to both management and labour. It can be equally used. 
I have explained the mechanism in the House before but I do not 
mind doing it one more time for clarity. Anything this good bears 
repetition.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The bargaining process would go on as usual. We all know that 
in the transportation sector, in particular the railroads, the grain 
handling industry and the longshoring industry, labour and 
management do not seem to have much incentive to come to an 
agreement expediently. I say that because if there is an impasse 
both labour and management seem to take the position that it does 
not really matter how earnestly they bargain because if they come 
to an impasse the government will legislate them back to work. The 
stoppage, whether a strike or a lockout, will be of short duration. 
Where is the incentive for them to bargain in earnest?
<P>
	I believe final offer selection arbitration would encourage them 
to go through the bargaining process. If they could not find a 
solution the onus would be on them to name a mutually agreed 
upon arbitrator, to list the areas in which they agree, to list the areas 
still in dispute and to present their final positions on those items 
still in dispute to the arbitrator for a decision. The arbitrator would 
not say that these are the two positions and he will make his 
judgment somewhere in the centre. His obligation would be to take 
all of one position or all of the other position; final offer selection. 
That is an incentive. That is the incentive for them to say they do 
not really want to use an arbitrator and get down to brass tacks and 
settle this thing themselves.
<P>
	I am not singling out labour and I am not singling out 
management as being at fault. We have seen as many  lockouts 
disrupt grain shipments as we have seen strikes disrupt the grain 
industry. This is not simply a plea for the farmers in my area. We 
are talking about a lot of other goods like potash, coal and even iron 
ore.
<P>
	Speaking strictly for the farmers, not only is it an economic 
hardship to the farmers but it is an economic hardship to the entire 
country. When we cannot ship our grain to the west coast, get it on 
the ship and get it to our customers, not only are the farmers the 
losers but Canadians in general are the losers.
<P>
	I talked to one of our colleagues the other day who said that 
while in China they were asked if Canada still produced grain. This 
was a shocking question. Of course we produce grain. We do not 
produce enormous quantities but we produce excellent quality 
grain in malting varieties, milling varieties, pasta varieties; all 
kinds of grains and oilseeds. The retort was ``you would never 
know it because nobody comes over here to sell the stuff to us''.
<P>
	Canada has a lot of work to do as far as its reputation as an 
international reliable supplier of a quality product. We have no 
problem whatsoever with the production of grain. We could 
produce more grain if there were a market for it. Profit is not a 
four-letter word. Profit is what among other things keeps this place 
operating. It is what greases the wheels of industry. It is what puts 
people to work. It is what pays taxes.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	If we cannot continue to be a reliable supplier of products, if our 
reputation is damaged to the point that buyers of grain in China 
think that Canada no longer supplies the stuff, our credibility as an 
international supplier is severely damaged. It is high time we did 
something about it.
<P>
	Bill C-66 has provided us with one study after another. We had 
the west coast ports inquiry. We had the Sims report. I was 
fortunate to make presentations to both those task forces. I 
recommended to the Sims inquiry that the final offer selection 
arbitration be included in the recommendations to be included in 
the bill. During the Sims inquiry hearings I suggested that the 
10-year appointment of the chairman of the CLRB was too long 
and should be reduced to five years. Perhaps, as it is coming to 
light, even five years is too long.
<P>
	I return to my original point. I am appalled at the position the 
minister takes when he is questioned by my colleague with regard 
to what he will do about the chairman of the CLRB and his 
ridiculous expense accounts.
<P>
	The most recent west coast ports strike in 1994 was estimated to 
cost around $125 million just in port costs. The indirect costs were 
said to be in excess of $250 million. Perhaps we have threatened as 
much as a half a billion dollars in future grain sales.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9493"> 9493 </A></B>
<P>
	I have quite forcefully made the point that harmonious labour 
relations in Canada are certainly important. The bill does not do 
a lot to improve labour relations in Canada. It might do something 
to improve relations between the government and the Bloc 
Quebecois. I am not sure of that but it might. I do not think it 
gives labour and management the tools they need to resolve their 
differences.
<P>
	Perhaps I should make it perfectly clear that we are not 
advocating government interference should be a factor in settling 
labour disputes.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	We are making the point that final offer selection arbitration 
used to the ultimate would be not used at all. In other words, if 
labour and management did not reach an agreement among 
ourselves, they would say final offer selection is what the 
legislation obliges them to do. Therefore the onus would be 
entirely on us and agreement would be achieved between the two 
parties. That is always the best deal. A negotiated deal is always 
better than an imposed deal. The ultimate winners in this entire 
scenario would be the Canadian people.
<P>
	We are considering the bill at a time when the Canadian 
economy can ill afford any more blows. We are considering it at a 
time when there is a high unemployment rate. Unemployment has 
been in the double digit range for the last 75 or 76 months. It is 
almost impossible to compare today's situation with what it was in 
the 1930s. I hope that we never get to that situation again. What is 
comparable is that at no other time in Canada's history other than 
the great depression in the thirties did unemployment remain at 
such unacceptably high levels for such a long period of time.
<P>
	Anything this place can do to ensure that labour and 
management are a bit more harmonious or a lot more harmonious 
would certainly be welcome in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I see that my time is quickly drawing to close. I appreciate the 
opportunity of speaking once again to this important piece of 
legislation. It has a couple of redeeming factors, but it would have 
been nice if more members of my caucus could have had an 
opportunity to express their views.
<P>
	I conclude by saying once more the co-operation we have shown 
to the minister in the processing of the bill can hardly be construed 
as filibustering.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with a great deal of interest to my colleague. He 
brought forward his ideas on how labour disruptions could occur 
much less often and be solved much more quickly. I agree with his 
ideas about final offer arbitration.
<P>
	As I was listening to his speech I recalled a couple of years ago 
in the House at the time of the last major work  disruption in grain 
shipments on the prairies. In my riding and province farming or 
agriculture is huge. It is the biggest industry in Moose Jaw-Lake 
Centre.
<P>
	In thinking back to how the government handled the disruption 
at that time, I remember the government bringing in back to work 
legislation which the House was called back on a Sunday to pass. 
Since then I have been on radio shows a couple of times with the 
member for Saskatoon-Dundurn who accused the Reform Party 
of not caring about western farmers because we did not show up on 
a Sunday to support the back to work legislation.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	First, we supported the legislation because it was the best thing 
we had at that time.
<P>
	Second, we asked for pre-emptive legislation prior to the strike 
so that it could not happen. Of course the government in its wisdom 
saw fit not to do it.
<P>
	Third, the member for Lethbridge put forward a private 
member's bill on final offer arbitration, which was not passed, 
shortly before the strike.
<P>
	On three occasions the government had the opportunity to stop a 
major labour disruption but saw fit to do nothing and to let it run its 
course.
<P>
	There are something like 27 unions between the farm gate and 
the ports. Any one of the unions or any one of the management 
companies could either strike or lock out its workers. Something 
like 54 organizations could disrupt grain movement from 
Saskatchewan, from the farm gate to the ports. It is unacceptable 
that 54 groups could tie up the whole agriculture industry. When 
the big boys play, the farmers pay. That always happens.
<P>
	Is my colleague convinced that final offer arbitration would 
solve and put an end to these labour disruptions in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
question.
<P>
	I do not know that any legislation could be a 100 per cent cure. 
There may still be some margin for error. However this will go a 
long way to settle the disputes my colleague talked about.
<P>
	To put it in the farming vernacular, owners of livestock are 
obliged to keep them off the road so the public can travel without 
fear of running into livestock. They are supposed to use reasonable 
care and precautions to keep livestock from getting on to public 
highways. They put up fences which 99 per cent of the time keep 
the livestock in. There is no way under the sun they can ensure 
livestock will be in all the time. There is no way under the sun they 
can satisfy all demands of labour and management at all times.
<P>
	Labour and management would be far better served by final offer 
selection arbitration than by back to work  legislation after a work 
disruption takes place. That is basically equivalent, to use the farm 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9494"> 9494 </A></B>
<P>
analogy again, to maintaining a proper fence or chasing livestock 
up and down the road trying to get them back in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting the government claims Reform was not 
here on that weekend to support its back to work legislation. I was 
here. I spoke for the full time I was allotted by the government. 
Many of my colleagues were here as well, notwithstanding the fact 
that we came from the farthest part of this great country to make 
our speeches. It was a very catastrophic time for a lot of people: for 
the rail companies, the farmers, the grain people and everyone else.
<P>
	The member from Moose Jaw previously questioned my 
colleague. He pointed out that we tried to bring in pre-emptive 
legislation which would have prevented the strike but the 
government refused to it. We tried to get something done when CP 
Rail went on strike. Again the government did not do anything. It 
did not do anything until CN Rail went on strike.
<P>
	There is a well substantiated rumour that the government was 
intentionally waiting until CN went on strike so that it could bring 
in legislation with a different type of arbitrated settlement and 
impose the kind of settlement that would enhance the viability of 
selling CN Rail so the government could look good. If something 
like final offer selection arbitration had been brought in, the 
government would have lost an opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Has the hon. member heard such rumours? Does he put any stock 
in them? Would he like to see something put in place to protect the 
workers of the rail companies with grain handling, all the people 
who are involved in such a nefarious plot by this government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly my learned colleague, the 
transportation critic, has had his ear to the ground. Far be it from 
me to impugn the motives of the government but at the same time, I 
take great stock in the advice of my colleague, the transportation 
critic.
<P>
	He asked specifically whether I would like to see protection in 
place for the workers. Absolutely. Protection is of ultimate 
importance. Workers have rights and they should have protection 
against such alleged manipulation for the sake of creating a certain 
political climate or saleability or non-saleability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to speak to Bill C-66 and put a few things straight on the record.
<P>
	First, as members may recall, the Minister of Labour at least 
twice this week has accused the Reform Party of filibustering this 
bill. I do not know whether it is because spring is coming or an 
election is coming, but the accusation by the government that 
Reformers are  filibustering the bill is absolutely false and cannot 
be justified under any circumstances whatsoever.
<P>
	This bill has been around for a long time. The hours of the House 
were extended one day so that the bill could be debated. The 
minister twists the record, falsifies the record of the Reform Party 
which has been willing to work with the government to ensure that 
legislation is passed.
<P>
	The House did not start until two o'clock this afternoon. We have 
a short day on Wednesdays because the House is only open in the 
afternoon but under the House rules. This is deemed to be a whole 
day's debate even though it is only an afternoon's debate.
<P>
	The government, for about the 38th or 39th time or whatever 
number of times it is, introduced time allocation and shut down 
debate on the bill. Not only that, but it had the gall to bypass part of 
routine proceedings so that the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley could not present her petitions.
<P>
	Canadians cannot be heard. Private Members' Business, if there 
was any to be presented, was bypassed so that other members, apart 
from government members, could not be heard.
<P>
	The minister of state for financial institutions got his motions on 
the books. He was able to refer his ways and means motions to 
committee. From that point on, when it came to the opportunity for 
the rest of the members, indeed the rest of the people in the country, 
to be heard the Liberals moved to government orders of the day, 
wasting time and preventing the Reform Party and the other parties 
from debating this bill.
<P>
	Where are they? They are sitting quietly hoping that we will 
walk away and let this issue die. Then they can get on with the 
business and get it through the House. They can be off to an 
election a year and a half before they are supposed to go.
<P>
	These are rather unusual times. The Minister of Labour is 
making these types of accusations. Today during question period, 
the Minister of Finance was up making a ministerial statement, 
taking away time from question period.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister is in Washington visiting our neighbours. 
When he was asked a question on illegal drugs, he thought it was 
good for trade. He has to pay attention. Not only should he be 
paying attention down there, he should start paying attention to 
what is going on in here. If he is out talking to the people around 
the country pretty soon at election time, he may find out what he 
thinks he is going to hear is going to be totally different to what he 
actually will hear on election day.
<P>
	Bill C-66 deals with the labour code and the Canada Labour 
Relations Board. I have been having a debate with the Minister of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9495"> 9495 </A></B>
<P>
Labour during question period about  the chairman of that board 
who I have said, on more than two occasions in the House this 
week, has to go. The Minister of Labour has said we should pass 
Bill C-66 in order for him to do his job and get rid of this fellow as 
the chairman of the board.
<P>
	I cannot imagine why the minister would want to wait until Bill 
C-66 is passed. As we know, it is going to pass today because time 
allocation states ``that is it, it is a done deal, stop, no more, vote''. 
Since the Liberals have a majority it is a done deal.
<P>
	I do not know what his excuse is going to be tomorrow when Bill 
C-66 is passed, because they have used the government majority, 
and Mr. Ted Weatherill is still chairman of the board. The minister 
will not be able to stand up in this House and tell us: ``If we pass 
Bill C-66 I will be able to get rid of the chairman''. By that time 
Bill C-66 will be passed.
<P>
	I was reading in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today on the front page 
``Weatherill accused of bias in dispute. Reform charge comes on 
top of expenses saga''. As members know, this person who has 
gone into the public trough in excess. He is in over his head. He has 
jumped in all the way. He is swimming in it. This is a guy who 
spent $148,000 wining and dining around the world the last eight 
years. This is a guy who spent $440,000 of Canadians' money on 
an expense account because he did not really have to account for it.
<P>
	He was given the privilege of having an open-ended expense 
account and said: ``Boy, am I going to have a good time''. He did 
have a good time: $733 dinners for two in Paris. That is more than 
the average family spends on groceries and more than many 
Canadians earn in a month. That person has the gall to think that he 
can justify spending that kind of money on dinner for two because 
he happens to meet somebody who he is impressed by, some 
professor from the Sorbonne University in Paris. Well, see if I am 
impressed. I am not.
<P>
	This guy is the chairman of the Canadian Labour Relations 
Board. Members may find a hint of contempt in my voice when I 
talk about this gentleman because the Canada Labour Relations 
Board is a quasi-judicial body. It is governed by the rules of the 
courts. Mr. Speaker, you were a lawyer in a past life and you know 
about the courts. The rules of the courts state that you are impartial. 
Not only are you impartial but you must be seen as being impartial.
<P>
	Let me quote from page A2 of today's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At least three members of the board, including the chairman, must be present at 
hearings. The chairman is, in effect, the chief judge of any dispute.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although he is not called a judge, the chairman, because of the powers conferred 
upon him, is bound by judicial protocol, including the bias rule.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thought this was an intelligent fellow. The article goes on to 
state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An arbitrator or a board chair or a judge in the middle of a case should never, ever 
go out with one of the parties without the other being there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was said by Mr. Levitt. We are not talking about something 
that is controversial. It is very basic. It is not controversial and it is 
that obvious.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Going out for dinner with one side and not the other isn't right,'' said Mr. Levitt. 
``Bias, in the judicial context, is not just a fact of bias-it is a reasonable 
apprehension of bias.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And a reasonable apprehension of bias would occur, he added, even if a 
quasi-judicial board chair takes out one side of a dispute on one occasion and 
follows it up the very next day with a meeting with the other side.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Have you ever heard of a judge doing something like that,Mr. Speaker? I have not.
<P>
	He continues: ``Even that is totally improper''. Reading on, we 
find out that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Weatherill presided over the hearings and deliberations. During that period he 
held the following meetings in Montreal:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was a dispute between CN and CP on one hand and the 
unions on the other. I am going to start quoting again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nov. 7, 1990, Mr. Weatherill and CN's senior counsel John Coleman share a $213 
dinner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Feb. 7, 1991, Mr. Weatherill attends a reception for Don Fraleigh, CN's assistance 
vice-president, human resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Feb. 21, 1991, Mr. Weatherill and CP vice-president Robert Colosimo share a 
$227 dinner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>May 22, 1991, Mr. Weatherill shares a $164 lunch with CN's senior counsel John 
Coleman.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nov. 14, 1991, Mr. Weatherill spends $264 to dine with CN's Coleman again-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In July 1992, the labour board ruled that the unions be disbanded and replaced 
with the CAW.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister has the gall to stand up and say today during 
question period: ``I see it in the papers, but I was not aware of what 
is going on''. Treasury Board knew what was going on. He, as the 
minister in charge, should have known what was going on. The 
government has been paying the bills and the minister says he does 
not know what is going on and he has to check it out because he has 
read it in the newspaper. This is the government that says it is in 
control. Have you every heard anything like that, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	What do the people think? I turn now to page A15 of the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The depredations of the notorious English highwayman, Dick Turpin, pale by 
comparison to the plunder of the public purse by Ted Weatherill. If ever the 
expression ``Swilling at the public trough'' has literal application, this is it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Leo M. Bereza, Ottawa</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9496"> 9496 </A></B>
<P>
	How about another little short one? The whole page is of letters 
related to Mr. Weatherill.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Congratulations to the Citizen staff. You caught the ``rat'' in the food trap; this is 
good ``gut'' instinct reporting. With an election coming up, the taxpayers are soon 
going to be sold the fiscal restraint bill again. Public servant double-dipper Ted 
Weatherill positively sickens me. Out-of-control bureaucrats should all be given a 
season's pass to McDonalds's where the rest of us have to eat.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Robert Beck, Carp</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How about this one entitled ``I am not amused''.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In common with thousands of other Canadians this is the time of year that I have 
to rework my finances to ensure I have funds available to pay my income tax. How 
appropriate then that we are all treated to the smiling face of Ted Weatherill along 
with his evasive responses to any questions that might justify his personal expense 
claims over the last number of years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As I look at his photos one more time I am convinced that this man is not smiling 
at all. He is laughing at me-and I am not amused.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Don Ferguson, Nepean</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The whole page is full of articles on this fellow who happens to 
be sitting in a high position with a $120,000 to $140,000 a year 
salary. He ran up $440,000 of expenses in eight years. He spent 
$148,000 on meals in eight years. He compromised himself. He 
compromised the board. He compromised the rulings of the board. 
He stays there and I wonder why.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Labour says that he just read about it in the paper 
and he has to check it out. His department has been overviewing 
these expenses and paying the bill. It is absolutely shocking.
<P>
	Is that all? I publish the waste report. It gets a bit of press around 
the countryside periodically. Last January when I brought out a 
waste report I pointed out the illegal tax scams carried on by 
political patronage appointments.
<P>
	While the government would not give me the names, I was able 
to find out that a board member-and as far as I can tell it was not 
Mr. Weatherill but another board member-was getting a tax free 
allowance on top of his salary which is not covered off in the 
Income Tax Act. It is illegal that he should be getting that money 
tax free. I reported the information to the Minister of National 
Revenue.
<P>
	That was not the only one. I listed eight or ten different people, 
all patronage appointments, who were participating in the illegal 
tax scam where they are claiming travel allowances, moving 
allowances, transitional allowances and apartments in a different 
town.
<P>
	The Commissioner of Official Languages gets an apartment in 
town courtesy of the taxpayer. Everybody else has to pay tax. He 
seems to be exempted because the  government says it does not to 
play by the rules it writes because it is above them.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour is prepared to tolerate a chairman who 
thinks he is above the rules and has compromised himself in every 
which way. He sits there smiling in a photo on the front page of the 
paper and saying: ``I m not going to quit''. He is challenging the 
Minister of Labour and saying ``fire me''. I hope the minister fires 
him. It is long overdue and we have only known about it for three 
days.
<P>
	The minister sweeps it under the table by referring it to the 
auditor general. He stands pleased as punch and says that when he 
found out about it he immediately referred it to the auditor general. 
The auditor general reports to the House. He will not be able to 
report back until the fall. If the rumour mill is right the election will 
be long over by then.
<P>
	It is just like the Somalia inquiry. Let us bury it during the 
election time. Let us bury Mr. Weatherill during the election time 
and see what happens in the fall. That is not the way to govern.
<P>
	The Liberals want to go to the people of Canada during an 
election and say they deserve their vote to continue. How could 
they look people in the eye? They have swept the garbage under the 
table so that Canadians cannot smell it. They will bring it out like 
dirty linen in the fall after they have been comfortably voted us 
back into office. How can they do it? It beats me.
<P>
	We know the Liberals. They have been around for a long time. 
They seem to be able to do that with a smile. I am quite confident 
they will try to do it again. The point is that they can only deceive 
some of the people all the time and all the people some of the time. 
Perhaps this time they will find out they did not deceive very many 
people.
<P>
	I cannot imagine why the Minister of Labour is hanging on to 
Mr. Weatherill. I have been on talk shows across the country 
regarding this man. No one is prepared to stand up and defend him.
<P>
	The expenses are bad enough. However he cannot understand the 
situation of compromising his position, compromising his rulings, 
compromising his colleagues or compromising the government. It 
is documented. When we phoned CN and CP all they would say is 
no comment. They did not deny it. The minister stands by him and 
says that they have to wait until the auditor general reports some 
time in the future and at that time perhaps they will take action.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	They have all the documentation at their fingertips now. They 
have had the information at their fingertips all along. They have 
known for years this guy went way overboard all the time, every 
time. He has never forgotten to claim even a two-bit cup of coffee. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9497"> 9497 </A></B>
<P>
He takes  his common law wife with him and thinks we will pay for 
that as well. There seems to be no limit to what he will do. There 
seems to be no limit to the way he has compromised his position. 
Yet the Minister of Labour stands by him.
<P>
	If this fellow is not gone in the next couple of days, at election 
time I will be asking why he is still there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member for St. Albert.
<P>
	Not only on this bill but on many bills he has been very 
concerned about and very watchful of waste in the House. I am sure 
he finds it as galling as I do when members on the other side, the 
Minister of Labour and others, have the audacity to come into the 
House and claim that Reform is responsible for holding up the back 
to work legislation during the national rail strike. They claimed we 
would not come in on a weekend to assist in getting the bill 
through.
<P>
	As I mentioned before when I rose in response to our labour 
critic's statements, we tried to prevent it from ever happening. 
Once the back to work legislation finally came forward we 
supported it. We were anxious to move it through because a lot of 
people were being hurt by the strike: workers, farmers and all 
others.
<P>
	Consideration of the back to work legislation in the House 
extended into the weekend. I understand it cost many tens of 
thousands of dollars an hour to operate the House, money that came 
out of the taxpayers' pocket. As if everybody else was not hurt 
badly enough, the taxpayers were dragged into it as well. It cost the 
government money which it does not seem to mind.
<P>
	Reform was supportive. We were here supporting the legislation. 
The Bloc Quebecois was holding up the bill, denying it swift 
passage.
<P>
	As the hon. member is very involved and our watchdog on 
government waste, does he have any comments on the unspeakable 
bad taste of the government that came into the House and suggested 
Reform was holding it up when we were doing everything we could 
to assist in the passage of something that should have been passed 
long before. The problem was with the government's buddies in the 
official opposition who were objecting to the legislation being 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke is absolutely correct. We are accused by the 
government of holding up legislation.
<P>
	This is a place of debate for the people of Canada. This is not an 
institution that runs on efficiency. The Minister of Labour accuses 
us of filibustering a bill, holding up the proceedings. He gave us 
approximately an hour and a half to debate the bill at third reading. 
It is preposterous. With an hour and a half or maybe two hours to 
debate  third reading of the bill it is unimaginable we would be 
accused of holding it up.
<P>
	We could look at the way the Liberals treat this place with 
contempt. I ask, Mr. Speaker, for a quorum count of the number of 
people in the House at this point to see the contempt. I only see 
three Liberals in this place at this time.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes, the member is correct. We will ring 
the bells.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is now a quorum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was talking about the contempt 
with which government members hold this venerable institution. 
They were sitting in the back lobby enjoying the comforts of this 
institution with their feet up. Maybe they were wining and dining 
with Mr. Weatherill. Perhaps. Perhaps not.
<P>
	We in opposition are entitled to a reasonable amount of time to 
debate the issue. For us to be accused of filibustering is 
preposterous. The Liberals made this place sit over the weekend 
because they did not have their act together and the Labour 
Relations Board could not resolve disputes regarding strikes. They 
had to bring in emergency legislation and spend more money for us 
to sit all weekend. Perhaps it is because they do not have any 
confidence in the chairman of the Labour Relations Board. We do 
not know but we sure know the guy was not too competent in doing 
his job. Maybe that is why we had to end up spending more money 
to sit all weekend.
<P>
	The member is perfectly correct and the government should take 
heed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
sitting in my place when the member called for a quorum count. In 
defence of my colleagues who are also doing duty here, the 
member well knows that members have an opportunity to follow 
the debate.
<P>
	The premise of the member's remarks is that members have not 
been allowed enough time. Anyone who has followed the debate 
would clearly know the gist of the intervention of the member has 
been complaining that there is no time rather than addressing the 
substance of the bill.
<P>
	If the member feels it is important enough for us to move 
forward with legislation, possibly he would rise now to indicate 
that the Reform Party is prepared to close the debate now. Let us 
move to the vote on this important bill. The member should tell the 
House now whether it is his intent to support Bill C-66.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not whether or not I support the 
bill. This is a House of debate where opinions and views are heard. 
We are being accused by the government of filibustering. Yet we 
are given an hour  and a half at third reading. We extended the 
hours to facilitate its agenda. Yet we get accused of filibustering. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9498"> 9498 </A></B>
<P>
rejects our amendments. It does not listen to us in any way, shape 
or form because it uses its majority to say no. The whip cracks the 
whip and whatever we propose they oppose.
<P>
	We have supported some of its legislation because we think it is 
good. When we make what we think are intelligent and good 
amendments to its legislation, because it comes from this side of 
the House they are automatically shut down. That is an abuse of the 
trust and the power the government has been given. The Liberals 
will have to explain that to the people at election time.
<P>
	Almost 40 times they have introduced closure in the House in the 
time I have been in Parliament. It has now become a common 
occurrence. It is not even reported in the media any more.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	When it was first introduced in the House it almost brought 
down the government. Then it sat latent for a number of years and 
was picked up again in the fifties and used on very rare occasions. 
Mr. Trudeau used it, I believe, about 10 or 15 times. Mr. Mulroney 
used it a few more times. This government has surpassed every 
record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> The cumulative total of all past governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> We heard the member. This government in three 
and a half years has exceeded the cumulative total since 1917 when 
it was first introduced.
<P>
	This is no longer a House of debate. This is no longer a House of 
the people. The government has abused the trust and privileges of 
the House. The government does not want to hear what the 
representatives of Canadians have to say. It does not want to listen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will again ask the member whether it 
is his intention to support the bill. If it is, I will assume it is on the 
basis that he has already made a full assessment of all the relevant 
factors to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for St. Albert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hate to create suspense, but I know 
that we are going to vote on this later today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Bourassa, 
Immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to be on the record with respect to Bill C-66, which is proposed by 
the Minister of Labour. This is the  third reading of an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code, Part I, and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act, and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts.
<P>
	Being a member of the government and having followed the 
debate this afternoon I thought it important to address one of the 
issues raised by the previous speaker. The issue has to do with the 
process used by the government to pass this legislation.
<P>
	Earlier this day, during Routine Proceedings, the government 
was forced into the position of putting forward a motion to ensure 
that this bill came to the floor of the House for debate. This is one 
of the subtleties of the operation of the House which the Canadian 
public does not recognize. It is very likely that we would not be 
debating this bill today if the government had not put forward the 
motion to move from Routine Proceedings to Government Orders.
<P>
	The daily routine of business includes matters such as the tabling 
of documents, statements by ministers, presenting reports from 
inter-parliamentary delegations and reports from committees. I 
recall that on a number of occasions members of the Reform Party 
rose in their places during Routine Proceedings to move frivolous 
motions which were debatable by the rules of this place, which 
meant that the House would continue to debate frivolous motions 
and frustrate debate on government bills and private members' 
bills.
<P>
	It is important that Canadians know about the committee work 
which has been done, as well as the work which has been done by 
the Minister of Labour. The preparatory notes contained excellent 
background material. In fact, Canadians will see when the vote is 
taken later this day that the House will support this very important 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Therefore I want to congratulate the Minister of Labour who has 
earned the respect and admiration of the different parties who 
played a role in this process.
<P>
	It is encouraging to see management and unions agreeing on this 
matter. That is a very significant point that should be noted. We 
have to underline that management and labour are now in 
agreement on the principles brought forward in the bill.
<P>
	A tremendous amount of work has been invested in producing 
this agreement. Bill C-66, first and foremost, is fair and balanced 
legislation, as members have now discovered from the debate in 
this place and through the work in the committee. It is the product 
of consultation on the whole process.
<P>
	Members from every party fully appreciate the importance of 
that consultation process. These consultations included a task force 
of labour relations experts, a working group of management and 
labour  organizations and a series of meetings involving the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9499"> 9499 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of Labour and representatives of labour and management 
as well as other interested parties which is a very important aspect 
of any legislation before this place.
<P>
	The task force was chaired by Mr. Andrew Sims, an Edmonton 
labour lawyer specializing in arbitration and dispute resolution. He 
was admirably supported by two experienced colleagues: Toronto 
based labour arbiter, mediator and fact finder, Paula Knopf, and 
Quebec labour arbiter and professor at Laval University, Rodrigue 
Blouin.
<P>
	The task force received numerous written submissions and met 
with labour and management delegations and with members of the 
academic and legal communities in the various locations across the 
country over this overall consultative process. It also invited labour 
and management organizations whose members are subject to the 
Canada Labour Code to set up a working group to discuss and 
endeavour to reach consensus on many important issues.
<P>
	When the task force submitted its report entitled ``Seeking a 
Balance,'' it reflected the consensus reached by that 
labour-management working group in a number of important areas.
<P>
	In addition to its findings and those of the working group, the 
Sims task force also took into account the recommendations made 
by the west coast ports industrial inquiry commission which had 
issued its own report in December 1995.
<P>
	It is quite an accomplishment that both labour and management 
have expressed support for the overall balance of the task force's 
recommendations. The consensus reached is an illustration of what 
can be accomplished by working together in the spirit of good faith 
and mutual respect. Members, even of the Reform Party, 
acknowledged that with regard to Bill C-66.
<P>
	On several key issues, Bill C-66 reflects the consensus reached 
by labour and management. With these amendments, the 
government has acted as a pro-active catalyst for change. We are 
proposing strategies that will modernize the code and we are 
encouraging parties to suffer their differences in a less adversarial 
fashion.
<P>
	The amendments proposed include, first, the establishment of a 
new representational Canada industrial relations board composed 
of a neutral chairperson and vice-chairpersons and equal numbers 
of members representing employers and employees. This board 
will replace the current non-representational Canada Labour 
Relations Board.
<P>
	Second, the new board will be given greater flexibility to deal 
quickly with routine or urgent matters.
<P>
	Third, the board's powers will be clarified or extended to ensure 
that complex industrial relations issues such as those arising from 
the review of bargaining units or sales  of business can be fully 
addressed and to provide appropriate remedies in the case of unfair 
labour practices such as failure to bargain in good faith.
<P>
	The next point is that the bill will bring in the federal mediation 
and conciliation service, which will continue to be part of the 
labour program of Human Resources Development Canada. It will 
have its third party neutrality enhanced by defining its role by 
statute. Defining the role of the FMCS underlines that the dispute 
resolution and prevention programs are a vital component of 
Canada's collective bargaining policies.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	A further point is that there will be a replacement of the current 
two-stage conciliation process by a single stage with a choice of 
procedures to take no more than 60 days. The right to strike or 
lockout will be subject to the holding of a secret ballot vote within 
the previous 60 days and giving a 72-hour advanced notice.
<P>
	Parties involved in work stoppage will be required to maintain 
services necessary to protect public health and safety. All members 
of the House certainly recognize the importance of that issue.
<P>
	Services affecting grain shipments will be continued in the event 
of legal work stoppages by any third parties in the ports.
<P>
	There will be no general prohibition on the use of replacement 
workers. However, if they are used for the purposes of undermining 
the union's representative capacity, the board may declare their use 
as an unfair labour practice and order the employer to stop using 
them for the duration of the dispute.
<P>
	Finally, the employees will be entitled to insurance and benefit 
programs during work stoppages.
<P>
	As members can appreciate and see from this variety of points, 
some very important issues have been addressed and dealt with by 
Bill C-66 as a result of the excellent work that has been done by the 
Minister of Labour and his department officials.
<P>
	The amendments will also confirm the rights of employees in the 
bargaining unit who were on strike or locked out to resume 
employment following the end of a work stoppage instead of any 
persons hired to replace them. The list I have just recited is quite 
long yet it only begins to outline what Bill C-66 will accomplish.
<P>
	It is fitting that the government is moving forward with these 
amendments at this time. After all, the Canada Labour Code has 
not been subject to this kind of comprehensive review since the 
early 1970s. As members know very well, the world has changed 
since then. Trade liberalization, globalization, privatization, 
deregulation, and corporate and economic restructuring have 
placed significant pressures on employers and employees and 
hence the industrial relations system as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9500"> 9500 </A></B>
<P>
	The new global economy in an increasingly competitive 
marketplace dictates change in the existing industrial relations 
environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As the hon. 
member who is now speaking was very diligent in asking questions 
earlier, I wonder if he would agree to yield the floor so that 
questions may be put to him before time runs out.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Mississauga South 
has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> As I was saying, the new global economy in an 
increasingly competitive marketplace dictates change in the 
existing industrial relations environment. Measures that help 
resolve labour disputes in a more positive environment are good for 
employers and workers. Hence, co-operation will lead to improved 
productivity, better job security and increased worker participation 
in the workplace decisions.
<P>
	The proposals we are debating today represent a fair and 
balanced approach that will reduce conflict and lead to quick 
resolutions of differences. At the same time, the legislation 
responds to the changing needs of many workers and workplaces, 
including the increasing number of people working in the home.
<P>
	In closing, I would like the House to remember that the Sims 
task group report was entitled ``Seeking a Balance''. In my opinion, 
Bill C-66 strikes the appropriate balance between the rights and 
responsibilities of employers and unions and underlines the 
important role that government plays as a facilitator and catalyst 
for positive change.
<P>
	I know I have taken some time to deal with a very important bill 
but Canadians will realize, even from touching very briefly on 
some of the many issues that I have raised and listed in this speech, 
that there are many points that have been dealt with 
comprehensively throughout the process. I am very pleased to have 
had the chance to rise in my place and speak on behalf of the 
Minister of Labour and Bill C-66.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are 20 seconds left. The hon. 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> That is a 
real challenge, Mr. Speaker, a 20 second question.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would make a comment simply on 
the question of final offer selection arbitration as an alternate 
dispute settlement mechanism.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired, unfortunately. It 
being 5.15 p.m., pursuant to order made Monday, March 17, it is 
my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every 
question necessary to dispose of the third reading stage of the bill 
now before the House.
<P>
	The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House 
to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-247, an act to amend the Criminal Code (trespass) be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is definitely a privilege to begin the 
debate on my private member's Bill C-247 dealing with amending 
the Criminal Code with respect to trespassing. This is a time when 
the average Canadian gets to speak, for my measure comes from 
them.
<P>
	In my three and a half years as a member of Parliament I have 
had only two bills drawn for debate. Unfortunately this is the way 
the old system works. I think every member will agree with me that 
it is difficult to bring a concern from the riding and change a statute 
based on that concern.
<P>
	As the member for New Westminster-Burnaby, I have done 
much to bring concerns forward in order to make a difference in 
our community. After all, this is a large part of the job. Canadians 
count on each and every one of us to be fully accountable to their 
concerns. There is no question that Reform has been the most 
significant party that truly puts the constituent first. And while 
Reformers may be able to pat themselves on the back for this 
achievement, it is also sad to see in contrast how many Liberal and 
NDP MPs have treated their constituents.
<P>
	In British Columbia the issue which seems to be on everyone's 
mind is criminal justice. British Columbians are completely fed up 
with the many loopholes in our statutes and what they provide.
<P>
	Last month thousands protested in Vancouver when Clifford 
Olson issued a notice that he would seek parole through a section 
745 hearing, probably one of the most significant loopholes in the 
Criminal Code. The Minister of Justice and local Vancouver 
Liberal MPs sloughed it off by saying ``do not worry, Olson will 
not get paroled''.
<P>
	It is impossible for these bleeding heart Liberals to say he will 
not get out on parole because statistics clearly show that the 
accused usually has an excellent chance of being released early. 
The issue here is the symbolism of that offender. The symbolism 
that this offender can mock a community through our justice 
system is unacceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9505"> 9505 </A></B>
<P>
	Reformers are not going to give up the fight on section 745 and 
we are definitely not going to give up the fight in trying to cure 
the loophole disease, as I call it, that is plaguing the way justice 
is administered in this country.
<P>
	I mentioned at the outset that I have had two private member's 
bills drawn in this Parliament. The other bill was Bill C-323 which 
dealt with amending the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
<P>
	Approximately two years ago a constituent approached me with 
a concern that a loophole in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
was enabling violent offenders to be released from their 
commitment to pay civil court judgments. It was a loophole that 
was causing innocent victims unnecessary suffering.
<P>
	Last year I saw an article in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> about a 
woman who was awarded $200,000 in damages for sexual abuse by 
her stepfather. Her stepfather was ordered after a civil court trial to 
make payments of $500 a month. According to the article, he made 
one full payment of $500, four payments of $100 and then filed for 
bankruptcy. He got off. It was easy. That was the end of it.
<P>
	It was clear from my research and from speaking with 
constituents that a simple amendment to the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act would eliminate the possibility for a person to use 
personal bankruptcy to escape from any owed damages awarded in 
civil court.
<P>
	If we look at the way the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads, a 
bankrupt person cannot be relieved of paying, for example, any 
traffic fines, alimony or child maintenance payments, yet they can 
be relieved of paying damages for something like sexual assault, a 
great inconsistency. I found it amazing that no government had 
ever changed such a very simple clause.
<P>
	After I introduced Bill C-323, the Minister of Industry 
introduced Bill C-5 which amended the section that my bill did. 
However, their amendment was fairly weak in content. What 
ensued were negotiations to have my private member's bill 
included in Bill C-5, which is now close to receiving royal assent.
<P>
	The exercise proved not only that an individual MP can have a 
direct influence on how legislation is drafted, but it proved that 
MPs should be open to all concerns and suggestions brought 
forward to them by their constituents. In this rare instance the 
government listened and I also found a sympathetic minister.
<P>
	That brings me to the discussion surrounding Bill C-247, what 
we are debating today. In coming up with my bankruptcy and 
insolvency bill one constituent contacted me to get me going down 
the road of investigation.
<P>
	Now on the issue of trespassing I have received numerous 
complaints from police officers, regular patrons of shopping malls 
and public library workers. The complaint was the sheer frustration 
that persons are  trespassing on property, causing a public 
disturbance and destroying a sense of community and livability for 
children and yet are unable to be removed for any significant 
amount of time.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	We all know malls are popular places for youth to hang out. If 
members have teenage sons or daughters as I do, they will know 
that one of their favourite congregation points is the mall, usually 
the food court. Perhaps it is because there is food around or perhaps 
it is because there are tables to lounge on and places to sit.
<P>
	The security personnel in the malls consistently have a difficult 
time in maintaining civility and the chief reason is that they have 
little if any authoritative jurisdiction. If the security staff of a mall 
is forced to remove a problem person, that individual can simply 
re-enter the mall within minutes and start the whole scenario all 
over again.
<P>
	There is no place in the Criminal Code that states that the 
trespasser must stay off the property for any amount of time. The 
only way the person can be charged is by resisting removal from 
the property. Therefore, if the person never resists, the act could 
continue over and over, which in some cases it does as a specific 
plan.
<P>
	Federal government officials too often forget that teenagers are 
extremely street smart. I served on the House Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs when we dealt with the Young 
Offenders Act. A witness wanted me to believe that most young 
offenders have no idea of the penalties they will receive if they 
commit a certain crime. At the time Reformers were calling for the 
YOA to be strengthened in order to deter young offenders from 
committing crime. Offenders seem all too aware of how soft the 
system is.
<P>
	Before I became a member of Parliament I served as a court 
officer in the attorney general's ministry in British Columbia. I 
spent a great amount of time dealing on a one to one basis with 
young offenders. After a while one understands very clearly what 
they are thinking. Many offenders know exactly what they are 
doing when they calculate committing an offence. Many know 
exactly how to beat the system. If there is a loophole in the system 
a teenager will find it, and the word quickly travels the streets.
<P>
	For the past three and a half years, Reformers have been 
attempting to amend the justice system by closing these loopholes 
one loophole at a time. I recently went on the Internet to see what I 
could find if I typed in the words ``trespassing in Canada''. Several 
items came up and most were of no use. One site did appear in the 
search, a CBC site for the television show ``Street Cents,'' a show 
geared toward teenagers interested in consumer-based issues. The 
title of the site was ``How does the law affect you in common, legal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9506"> 9506 </A></B>
<P>
situations, if  arrested, kicked out of a mall, asked for ID or if 
someone is threatening to search a locker''.
<P>
	Whoever was doing the research for this question interviewed 
the Public Legal Education Society of Nova Scotia, the Nova 
Scotia Human Rights Commission and a Halifax lawyer. This is 
what was said at this site about trespassing in a mall or hangin' at 
the mall: ``Provincial laws like the Protection of Property Act give 
mall owners and store owners the power to post signs like no 
loitering or only two persons at a time allowed in the store. The 
signs are a restriction on people's freedom of movement as defined 
by the charter of rights, but so far the charter's rules only apply to 
the federal government and federal institutions like the CBC.
<P>
	``The Protection of Property Act gives property owners the 
power to control how their property may be used so long as they 
publicly post these conditions. No smoking rules are an example of 
how this power may be used.
<P>
	``Provincial health and safety laws are responsible for a bunch of 
other sign restrictions like no bare feet, no pets you often see in 
malls. If you break any of these rules posted on signs it means mall 
security can simply usher you out of the mall and they don't need to 
give a reason. You're ushered and you're toast. It's a powerful 
statute.
<P>
	``Some malls do not post signs forbidding loitering so hangin' 
out indefinitely may be just fine where you live, it depends. 
However, most provincial protection property laws, the dreaded P 
of P, do empower mall security to move on or forcibly remove 
persons who are in a mall and causing a disturbance. In the 
province of Nova Scotia the guard can even ban you from the mall 
or store from which you've been hurled for up to six months. It has 
happened. If you break the ban police can be called and you can be 
charged with trespassing. Heavy.
<P>
	``In the case of young people swearing or physical horseplay, 
wrestling or hackie sac might be interpreted by some as causing a 
disturbance. There is a range of behaviour by individuals malls will 
tolerate. When it is groups of teens the range seems to narrow 
down. Some malls might even argue a large group of exuberant 
young people cause a disturbance to other customers or merchants 
just by their very presence. This is an area of common 
misunderstanding''.
<P>
	Every province seems to have a different way of dealing with 
trespassers. In British Columbia the trespassing laws are weak. 
Something has to be done with this most serious issue. With the 
provinces doing very little to remedy this situation, something 
should be done to amend the Criminal Code to provide a reasonable 
national standard of peace and order.
<P>
	The amendments I have made in Bill C-247 would strengthen 
section 41 of the Criminal Code. Subsection 41(1) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every one who is in peaceable possession of a dwelling-house or real property, 
and every one lawfully assisting him or acting under his authority, is justified in 
using force to prevent any person from trespassing on the dwelling-house or real 
property, or to remove a trespasser therefrom, if he uses no more force than is 
necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	That is the law the way it is now.
<P>
	I am proposing an amendment to section 41 of the Criminal 
Code, making it a mere summary conviction for a person who has 
already been lawfully removed from real property or a dwelling 
house not to be able to lawfully return for 24 hours. The reason for 
the 24 hours is to provide adequate time for the person to cool off. 
It is amazing how attitudes change in 24 hours.
<P>
	Perhaps I could put my proposed legislation into a hypothetical 
situation. A teenager is removed from a shopping mall for 
offensive, rude, loud conduct. The teenager must then stay out of 
that shopping mall for a total of 24 hours. If that teenager decides 
to re-enter the mall within that 24 hours, he or she can be charged 
with trespassing on entrance and may be guilty of an offence 
punishable on summary conviction. They would be issued a ticket, 
a summons to appear in court.
<P>
	Additionally, as the section in the Criminal Code deals with a 
dwelling house, my amendment also deals with it. As a family 
court counsellor I was often made aware of domestic situations 
wherein disrupting behaviour which disturbed the peace for 
children in the household was a problematic situation.
<P>
	For example, sometimes police are called to a residence to assist 
in the removal of a drunk, unwanted, former boyfriend of a young 
mother. Perhaps in this situation the matter is dealt with 
successfully by the officer on the scene, assisting in the removal of 
the person from the dwelling house. Subsequently, at the curb, the 
policeman may decide to release the individual, being that the 
temporary co-operation of the person appeared to have solved the 
situation. However, the offender may return some time later after 
having consumed more alcohol and start the process all over again.
<P>
	In this case the perpetrator could temporarily co-operate in view 
of the officer. However, an hour later he might reappear at the door 
and start conversations or hassle again and again.
<P>
	Legally the second or third appearance on the property is a 
separate event which would have to be dealt with by an attending 
officer as a legal, separate incident on a new complaint being made. 
My bill would solve that special set of circumstances and perhaps 
bring much peace into estranged domestic situations where 
restraining orders or no contact orders are not available or not 
workable.
<P>
	General community order would more likely be provided if the 
perpetrator knew that he or she could be  charged summarily if he 
or she reappeared on the property with 24 hours of being lawfully 
removed. The deterrent effect would be great and would likely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9507"> 9507 </A></B>
<P>
result in more non-justice system solutions with voluntary 
co-operation.
<P>
	My amendment makes common sense, but of course I do not 
expect to get much help on that score from the House when the 
committee did not make my bill votable. I spoke yesterday, albeit 
briefly, on the general reputation of the government on the 
administration of justice. It just does not represent mainstream 
Canadian values on protecting the public.
<P>
	I know that in this Parliament my bill will not see the light of day 
past this one hour. However, I hope that my Criminal Code 
amendment will be drawn to the attention of government lawyers 
in the Department of Justice whose jobs it is to make the criminal 
justice system more loophole free. I have personally drawn my 
private member's bill to the attention of the justice minister and so 
far I have had no response.
<P>
	The bill is straightforward common sense. Its practical 
consequence is prevention at the street level, rather than enlarging 
the net. I hope this reasonable measure will find support in the 
House.
<P>
	With the unanimous consent of the House, I would now like to 
move a motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That my private member's bill be made a votable item.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Will the House accept my motion?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to propose the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-247, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code with respect to trespass.
<P>
	The bill proposes to amend section 41 of the Criminal Code by 
adding a new subsection (3), which would carry a summary 
conviction offence in the case of subsequent trespass.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The bill would therefore create a specific offence that would 
apply whenever a person trespasses on any property after having 
already been lawfully asked to leave or prevented from entering 
less than 24 hours before. This subsequent trespass would occur 
with respect to residential property or any other kind of property.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby is 
trying with this bill to stem a problem that occurs in his 
constituency and which may be taking place in a number of urban 
areas across the  country. The problem is essentially one of people, 
particularly young persons, who may hang out at shopping centres 
and at times to some degree make a nuisance of themselves. These 
young people are often asked to leave by a security guard or a shop 
owner but they keep coming back, sometimes day after day.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that sometimes such behaviour can 
be annoying. However, I have problems with the remedies 
proposed by the hon. member. I believe that the proposed remedy is 
not in line with the principles that govern the current trespass 
provisions in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 41 of the Criminal Code provides that a person who is in 
peaceable possession of a dwelling house or real property is 
justified in using reasonable force to prevent a person from 
trespassing on the property or to remove the person from the 
property. Trespassing itself does not constitute a criminal offence. 
A criminal offence would be committed only if there were physical 
resistance of one sort or another to the removal that could be 
considered an assault.
<P>
	Under the current law no offence is committed when one leaves a 
place without resistance when asked to do so. The change that the 
hon. member is proposing is to make it an offence to return after 
one has been asked to leave once and has left the place peacefully.
<P>
	My first comment is that the bill appears to create a somewhat 
odd situation. The oddity would come from the face of the bill that 
makes it an offence to trespass in a certain place when one does it 
for the second or subsequent time but when the same act done for 
the first time is not an offence. I find that a little odd.
<P>
	Another concern is that the bill would make it an offence to 
trespass on not only private property but even in a public place. The 
bill would apply not only to persons doing subsequent trespassing 
on a dwelling house but also to persons doing subsequent 
trespassing on any real property, including places considered 
generally open to the public.
<P>
	There are some instances where trespassing is a criminal offence 
under the Criminal Code provisions. For instance, trespassing at 
night is an offence. Section 177 of the Criminal Code makes it an 
offence to loiter or prowl at night on the property of another person 
near a dwelling house situated on that property. Trespassing at 
night is an offence punishable by summary conviction.
<P>
	Clearly there is a big difference between trespassing at night, 
which has sinister connotations, and the kind of trespassing that 
Bill C-237 is aiming at.
<P>
	While I agree that teenagers hanging out at the mall can annoy 
some shop owners and clients, this behaviour does not in general 
have a sinister characteristic that trespassing at night could have. 
The behaviour considered in Bill C-237 is nowhere near as serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9508"> 9508 </A></B>
<P>
as  what is considered to constitute a trespassing offence under the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	What we are talking about here is more like what is referred in 
common parlance as loitering. I would like to point out that 
loitering in a public place and obstructing persons who are in that 
place is already a summary conviction under section 175(1)(c) of 
the Criminal Code. A person or group of persons hanging out at a 
shopping centre may fall within the ambit of 175(1)(c) if they 
obstruct persons such as shoppers or shopkeepers who are in that 
place.
<P>
	I believe that the offence of loitering in section 175(1)(c) would 
make sense precisely because of the conduct of obstruction, that 
which causes inconvenience or harm to other people. However, 
young people who simply hang out at their local shopping mall are 
not causing any obstruction and are not committing any actual 
misconduct, nor are they doing any direct physical harm to anyone.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Creating a Criminal Code provision aimed at alleviating this 
type of situation is like swatting a fly with the proverbial sledge 
hammer. The hon. member indicated that in many areas these 
situations can be remedied by either municipal bylaws or 
provincial law. It seems a long stretch to use the most severe 
legislative sanction that can be drawn, that is the Criminal Code, 
the criminal law of the land.
<P>
	The hon. member wants to make it an offence just to be in a 
place that is not necessarily a private residential property or some 
place of a private nature. He wants to make it an offence to be in a 
public place such as a local shopping mall. I am concerned about 
the potential for abuse by the owners or tenants of these public 
places and perhaps by security guards or law enforcement 
authorities.
<P>
	I strongly believe it is not appropriate to create a Criminal Code 
offence that would criminalize acts that can be seen as trivial in 
comparison with what is normally the domain of the code, more so 
since these acts often involve young people.
<P>
	In addition, I do not believe it is necessary since there are 
already provisions in the Criminal Code that would allow 
authorities to deal with cases that do constitute a nuisance. As I 
indicated previously, when serious actual acts which harm or could 
harm either shopkeepers or clients to public places are taking place, 
the Criminal Code already has sanction for these more serious 
activities.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill because the type of problem the bill is 
dealing with is not the type of problem that would appropriately be 
dealt with in the Criminal Code. This is a type of problem, as I 
indicated, that could very easily be dealt with by municipal bylaws 
and provincial statutes and regulations.
<P>
	Unless we are dealing with serious matters we should allow our 
provincial municipal authorities, those closer to the scene of the 
problem, to make legislation that fits in their circumstances.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to speak to a bill introduced by a 
member who has taken the time to move amendments to the 
Criminal Code. The bill clearly reflects the concern of the hon. 
member for a problem he has encountered in his riding or a 
problem experienced by his constituents.
<P>
	However, I will say right away that I cannot support this bill. I 
cannot support the bill introduced by the hon. member of the 
Reform Party, and I will explain why, very briefly.
<P>
	First of all, I will quote the text of this amendment to section 41 
of the Criminal Code:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every person is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction,</BLOCKQUOTE>
This indicates right away the intent to criminalize a certain 
activity.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>who (a) trespasses on a dwelling house or real property; and (b) has, within the 
previous twenty-four hours, been lawfully removed from, or prevented from 
entering, that dwelling-house or real property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This section might have two different applications. We have to 
look at the context. The hon. member on the government side gave 
a good example, the one about young people loitering in a shopping 
mall or on the sidewalk, and the owner of the mall or the merchants 
want them to leave. There is also the somewhat more serious case 
of quarrels between neighbours or members of the same group, 
when the court is asked, because such procedures exist in the 
Criminal Code, to prohibit this man or this woman from entering 
certain premises. In such cases, the judge will make the following 
order: he will prohibit a person, because he had previously uttered 
threats or been otherwise troublesome, from being on the other 
person's property.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	The Criminal Code already contains provisions to deal with any 
breach of such orders. This aspect that may be affected by this 
amendment is already covered by the Criminal Code. So something 
else would be added, since when an order is breached, the person is 
brought before the court and then has to suffer the consequences of 
his actions.
<P>
	In the other case, someone mentioned earlier the example of 
loitering in commercial buildings or even in front of a private 
residence or elsewhere. I think I agree with the government on that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9509"> 9509 </A></B>
<P>
score. This kind of behaviour should not be criminalized, and as a 
member of the Bloc, I think we should look at the broader  context. 
I think it is more a municipal problem than anything else. It is a 
problem that local authorities, in other words, municipal 
councillors and mayors of municipalities, can deal with by passing 
appropriate bylaws on loitering.
<P>
	As far as I know, many municipalities in Quebec and across 
Canada have already passed bylaws in their municipalities to 
prevent young people from making a nuisance of themselves one 
way or another in public places or in front of private residences.
<P>
	My point is that the hon. member was probably well intentioned 
when he decided to propose this amendment to the Criminal Code, 
but an amendment has to add something new, it has to fill a void. At 
the present time, I think that our municipal bylaws, the Criminal 
Code and other appropriate legislation already deal with this 
problem and that it is unnecessary to amend the Criminal Code by 
adding an additional paragraph as proposed by the member of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	This is why we in the Bloc Quebecois are not in favour of Bill 
C-247.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
add a few words of what I hope will be considered common sense 
to the debate. The bill which my hon. colleague has put forward has 
a lot of common sense at a very elementary level.
<P>
	The bill simply deals with refusing to allow a person re-entry 
who has been already illegally evicted from a premise. Let us stop 
to think about it from a very practical point of view. There is not a 
merchant in the country who will kick his customers out if the 
customers are good for business. It also makes a lot of sense to 
consider if he or she is encountering interference by people on the 
premises who are preventing other people from coming in or even 
making them uncomfortable because of their antics. If there is 
adequate reason to remove that person lawfully, which is the first 
part of the bill, why should there not also be a simple provision that 
says the person may not come back? Perhaps 24 hours is not 
enough.
<P>
	That is what the motion is stating. A person can be kicked out of 
a place, walk right back in, do the same thing, be kicked back out, 
come back in, do the same thing and on it goes. There is no remedy 
to that situation. It can be repeated over and over.
<P>
	My hon. colleague is simply saying that we should give that 
individual a chance to stop and think about it and give the involved 
security people or the police staff the opportunity to say to the 
person: ``You are out of here for 24 hours. Stop to think about what 
you are doing. Maybe you will correct yourself''.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	At the time of the initial eviction, especially with young people, 
very often there is a little element of peer pressure. They just want 
to prove a point and maybe have a bit of fun. That would break this 
up and solve the problem. We in the Reform Party are very 
interested in preserving the rights of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	In this instance we are taking people who are pushing to the limit 
the rights and the privileges of others. We are saying that for a short 
time their right to enter the premise will be suspended. It is just a 
very gentle way of correcting them instead of digging them into a 
big hole.
<P>
	There is always the debate on whether this is a provincial matter. 
We have heard that a lot this week in the debates on justice issues. I 
suppose one could argue that almost everything is provincial in the 
sense that almost everything is given in the Criminal Code to the 
provinces to administer. There is a national Criminal Code, the 
Criminal Code of Canada. Within that code are these articles of 
trespass and other provisions. Why not strengthen it so that it could 
be made to work more smoothly?
<P>
	One of the last things I would like to see happen is our security 
people or those working on police forces wasting their time 
frivolously putting people out and allowing them back in because 
they have to under the present provisions without there being a 
remedy.
<P>
	Now it is suggested that every municipality could have a 
regulation in this regard. Why should we ask the thousands of 
municipalities to deal with the issue and to include it in their own 
provisions? That would result in a lack of uniformity and an 
inefficiency in terms of the use of legislators' time when we could 
have a national law in the form of a change to our national 
provisions which would solve the problem?
<P>
	In conclusion, it is unfortunate the way this place works. The 
member from the Bloc who spoke said: ``I and the members of my 
party will not be supporting this provision''. In other words he is 
the justice critic. He comes in here. He looks at it and says: ``That 
is the end of it. Our guys will not be supporting it''.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary already made the decision on behalf 
of the Liberal Party. This is a private member's bill. Of course we 
have free votes. Instead of a carte blanche that says we will not 
support it and thereby have everybody jump into line, perhaps it 
would be better if the leaders in their respective caucuses would 
challenge their people to think about the matter and to make their 
decision individually.
<P>
	They should talk to the people in their ridings as my hon. 
colleague has done. His motion is a direct result of representations 
to him by people involved in these kinds of things. He has talked to 
the police who actually have a suboffice in the shopping mall. They 
have a problem where their time is being wasted by having to 
repeatedly  put people out. They have no legal provision to tell 
them not to come back.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9510"> 9510 </A></B>
<P>
	That is all that is being asked here. It makes a great deal of 
common sense. As I said in the beginning, it is perhaps a little too 
elementary for members opposite to realize, but I plead with them 
to consider the matter carefully. Let us allow the legislative process 
and the Liberal red book commitment to more free votes to apply. 
Let us deal with the issue rather than simply have one person say: 
``We will not support it because it is a Reform motion'' or for 
whatever other reason.
<P>
	I am thankful for the opportunity to participate. I hope I have 
added value to the debate this evening.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated as a 
votable item, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Member's Business has now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
February 11, I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration a 
question about unacceptable delays in processing files at the IRB.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition, they often criticized these 
delays. Now, they are in power and the problem has become worse. 
Right now, there are over 30,000 files awaiting a hearing or a 
decision, over half of them in Montreal. Even the IRB thinks there 
should be no more than 15,000 files to process at any given time. 
On average, refugee status claimants must wait 15 months for a 
decision, and often two, three or four years.
<P>
	These delays are extremely costly for the federal government, to 
which the IRB reports, and for the provinces, which must pay the 
cost of welfare, and of health and other social services. These 
delays also have serious consequences for an individual seeking 
asylum, who lives in uncertainty and alone, separated from his 
family. Only if there is a decision in his favour can a refugee bring 
his wife and children over.
<P>
	When I asked my question, I also denounced the government's 
systematic patronage in its appointment of IRB commissioners. 
During the election campaign we will be criticizing the government 
for adopting the same patronage practices that it itself denounced 
in the past.
<P>
	Amnesty International recently criticized the Canadian 
government for being more or less indifferent to the fate  of 
refugees and for imposing new restrictions on their entry. Last 
March, this organization launched a campaign in Montreal in 
support of refugees that is being held simultaneously in all 
countries in which Amnesty International is present.
<P>
	Only 10 per cent of refugees have access to industrialized 
countries. Only those who can afford the trip, by plane or ship, are 
able to take refuge in the West.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that relatively few people seek asylum 
here. Canada ranks 17th in absolute terms and 46th, if the number 
of refugees is compared to the GNP. In addition, Canada is the only 
country in the world to charge refugees and their dependants a 
settlement tax of $1,475 per adult and $100 per child.
<P>
	Last April 3 in Montreal, I met with a group of leaders from 
Quebec's Zairian community headed by Tshibuy Mulay Dyany, a 
constituent in my riding. The group included a number of people 
seeking asylum who complained about the IRB's lengthy delays. 
They thanked the Bloc Quebecois and particularly the critic for 
citizenship and immigration for their efforts to help Zairian 
refugees.
<P>
	Today, we learn that there is widespread chaos in this country 
with the advance of Kabila's troops. I think that the dictator 
Mobutu should step down and leave the country immediately in 
order to facilitate a peaceful return to democracy. For 35 years now, 
the Mobutu regime has systematically violated the most 
elementary human rights.
<P>
	At my nomination meeting last Sunday, which was attended by 
Gilles Duceppe, Bernard Landry, Henri Massé, Bernard Daoust, a 
number of MPs and MNAs and 300 Montrealers, I appealed to the 
Government of Canada to come to the assistance of tens of 
thousands of Zairian refugees. Many are dying there daily through 
illness or starvation. Today, I repeat this request to the government 
to be sensitive to the needs of Zairian refugees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, the daily management of Canada's refugee status 
determination system is the responsibility of the chairperson of the 
immigration and refugee board.
<P>
	It seems to me the hon. member is suggesting that we rush cases 
through in order to do away with this backlog. This is a reckless 
and irresponsible suggestion. There needs to be proper attention 
given to each and every case.
<P>
	Every aspect of the board's work touches on the lives and 
liberties of the people who appear before it. We need to take the 
time required to ensure that people receive a fair and equitable 
hearing. Often people's safety and security depend on it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9511"> 9511 </A></B>
<P>
	This does not mean to say that the government is not dealing 
with this backlog. Measures have been taken to address the 
increase in workload and to improve the board's efficiency and 
speed. Both the IRB and citizenship and immigration have been 
working hard to improve the system.
<P>
	Last December, for example, the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration signed an administrative framework agreement with 
the board. This agreement is designed to increase co-operation and 
information sharing, which should assist greatly in the process. It 
also commits the two bodies to find ways to introduce and share 
advanced technologies which will enhance operational efficiency.
<P>
	Bill C-49 is another example. The bill is currently before 
Parliament and contains two provisions which will reduce the 
refugee division panel from two members to one. This legislative 
change will improve the efficiency of the IRB while reducing the 
processing time required to identify refugees needing our 
protection.
<P>
	There is a great deal being done. I appeal to hon. members of the 
House to support this bill. Its swift passage will help alleviate the 
backlog.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)
