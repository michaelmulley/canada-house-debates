</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-497, an act to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act (prevention of private 
hospitals). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce this bill 
on the prevention of private hospitals for first reading.  The 
bill is in response to growing health care privatization and, in 
particular, to the threats posed to universal public health care 
by Alberta's bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific purpose of the bill is to control the entry of 
private for profit hospitals into our public system.  It amends 
the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act to provide that 
provinces be financially penalized if they allow public funds to 
be used for the provision of insured services in private for 
profit hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill ensures that the principles of medicare and the spirit 
of the Canada Health Act are absolutely and unequivocally 
reflected in the letter of the law and that the federal 
government is equipped to respond immediately and effectively to 
any attempt by a provincial government to permit private for 
profit hospitals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to present yet another petition from 
constituents about the critical state in our health care system 
in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of a series of petitions whereby thousands and 
thousands of Canadians have called upon the government to take 
immediate action to ensure the complete, not partial, 
restoration of transfer payments for health care, and to take 
strict, serious and definite measures to prevent further 
privatization of our health care services to ensure that the 
principles of medicare and the spirit of the Canada Health Act 
are alive and well and guide us for the future.

the honour today to present two petitions.  The first one deals 
with the gathering of organs at death for transplant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners make a very important point that the 
unavailability of organs for transplant and the long wait needed 
for transplant results in long periods of suffering and 
compromised recoveries for transplant recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon the House to enact legislation to 
allow for the automatic gathering of organs at death for

second petition relates to our health care system.  The 
petitioners are concerned about the state of our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon the government to stop the for profit hospitals, 
the privatization of our health care system, to restore, as has 
been indicated already, the complete restoration of funding 
necessary for a good health care system, to implement a national 
home care program and a program for prescription drugs.  This is 
something that seriously affects many of our seniors and many 
people on low and fixed incomes.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK34">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-14, an act respecting 
an agreement with the Norway House Cree Nation for the 
settlement of matters arising from the flooding of land, and 
respecting the establishment of certain reserves in the province 
of Manitoba, as reported (without amendment) from the committee;

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure today to speak to the bill concerning the Norway 
House Cree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was debated at length in committee. 
The motions we are considering today were suggested by a number 
of aboriginal groups who would very much like to see the word 
“right” included in the bill, and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one person says to another “I have the right to do that”, 
there is undoubtedly a law somewhere to back him up.  There may 
be a law, but there may also be court decisions.  People before 
me decided to clarify certain matters with the various courts. 
Only then can anyone claim to have a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much talk of legal issues nowadays.  Canada is facing 
tremendous problems where its aboriginal peoples are concerned, 
particularly with respect to the issue of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those most frequently criticizing the government for 
its lack of political courage.  In other words, in managing the 
native question, the government draws on legislation that is 
over one hundred years old.  The only way the government has 
come up with to resolve the native issue is to cling to this law 
and try to speed up negotiations on land claims and 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some native people feel things are not moving fast enough. 
Naturally, there are grey areas in this legislation.  It is 
really not surprising that a law dating back over one hundred 
years is no longer up to date or applicable or is at least hard 
to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native people were not satisfied with this law. 
They launched appeals in the various courts.  Naturally, a 
number of these went as far as the supreme court, and this is 
the subject of my remarks today.  I know I have only ten 
minutes, but there are a number of motions, and perhaps I will 
be able to return to finish up on the legal course all of that 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, things are happening at Burnt Church specifically 
as the result of a decision by the supreme court, which 
recognized certain native rights.  It also recognized certain 
government rights over resource protection and so on.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is often a problem when it comes to interpreting 
supreme court decisions. Unfortunately, except for Bloc 
Quebecois members, there are not many people who are siding with 
the aboriginals and recognizing that they have certain rights. 
This is why, when aboriginal groups appear before the standing 
committee on aboriginal affairs to discuss a bill such as the 
one before us, one of the first points they raise, one of their 
primary concerns is precisely the respect for their rights, 
including aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why these motions are before us today. 
As I said earlier, we must understand the whole legal process 
and how aboriginal titles and aboriginal rights have changed. A 
number of decisions deal with aboriginal rights, but a pioneer 
in this area is definitely a Nisga'a named Frank Calder. 
Incidentally, I take this opportunity to salute my Nisga'a 
friends who may be listening to us, although it is rather early 
in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week, I travelled to the home of the Nisga'a people 
for the inauguration of the new Nisga'a government building. It 
was nice to see how proud the Nisga'a were to finally have a 
building in which they will now be able to exercise a number of 
rights which, until now, were not recognized as theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been pioneers, not only regarding that building and 
not just Frank Calder. 
Frank Calder was not only the inspiration for the building but 
also a landmark figure in creating a more precise 
definition of what a native right is.  He deserves credit for 
this.  The Calder decision dates back to 1973, when the courts 
for the first time recognized the existence of aboriginal title 
for the occupation, possession and use of ancestral lands.  At 
the time, I know that the government lawyers were saying “Hold 
on now, there is another thing, the royal proclamation of 1763 
in which His Majesty sent out the word direct from England that 
the lands could not be taken possession of without agreements 
with the aboriginal people”.  The court went further than that, 
however.  It said that what was involved was something other 
than the royal proclamation, something other than the treaties. 
Even if there had been treaties, there were some rights that 
perhaps were not included in them.  This went beyond the Indian 
Act, as I have already touched on briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statute dates back close to 120 years.  Its application 
today cannot be described as perfect.  That is normal. 
Societies change.  In the last 120 years, both white and 
aboriginal societies have changed.  Imagine if we insisted here 
in parliament on hanging on to 120-year old legislation in all of 
the areas we deal with.  This would, I think, be extremely 
awkward and it would be very difficult to apply legislation now 
that dates back 120 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision said that the royal proclamation of 1763 was not 
the basis for a decision and that it was not a treaty matter. 
It must be kept in mind that not all crown lands are covered by 
treaties.  The Indian Act was not the basis for a decision 
either.  The supreme court therefore found a concept: long-term 
occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A native nation had to be able to prove long-term occupation. 
This is when discussion of an ancestral right from time 
immemorial began.  Indeed, the court also recognized that these 
people were here before us and accordingly enjoyed specific 
rights.  The Calder decision started opening things up in this 
regard, even though the supreme court did not define title as 
such.  It said proof had to be established of long-term 
occupation, but that title certainly did exist. However, the 
court did not define it more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matters had to wait until 1984 with the decision in Guerin. 
This decision established that the government had a fiduciary 
duty, that the native peoples enjoyed a special land entitlement 
and that it was inalienable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in another instance, the court recognized the 
government's fiduciary right and its fiduciary duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has caused many problems since then.  I give as an example 
the decision in Marshall and Burnt Church with all that is 
happening there as a result at the moment.  The government is 
caught in a dichotomy, in a state of incoherence, where it is 
obliged to defend Canada's interests.  But it is a trustee and 
must protect the interests of the native people.  This situation 
is causing some pretty significant problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, what we have seen in recent years is the 
government focusing less on its fiduciary obligation and more 
on its other obligations.  This is one reason why the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans is now seizing lobster traps, taking the 
view that the aboriginal fishers are completely in the wrong. 
One day, we will have to find a way to reconcile the legal 
concept and philosophy of the rights of whites with the rights 
of aboriginals.  This will take time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see you indicating that I have one minute left.  I had 
intended to speak a little longer, but as I said, I will come 
back to this for the second group of motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, I hope that members will support the inclusion of the 
issue of rights in the bill.  This is important to aboriginals 
and it costs nothing. 
We will be told that it is included in section 35 of the 
constitution—this is an argument the government often uses, and 
it may be true—but what does it cost the government to include 
this motion which the aboriginals really want to have?  It 
costs absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be pleased to speak to this issue again for the 
second group of motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be here today.  We will be supporting the amendments 
as noted in the order paper. The member from the Bloc and myself 
both put in similar amendments to the bill with similar concerns 
being the reasoning behind the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member from the Bloc indicated, these amendments do not 
cause any greater cost to the Government of Canada, except maybe 
the cost of honest to goodness intent to see whether or not the 
government is truly committed to acknowledging the treaty rights 
of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments were suggested by Chief Matthew Coon Come at 
committee.  At that time he was grand chief of the council of 
Crees in Quebec.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate 
Chief Coon Come on his election to grand chief of the Assembly of 
First Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at the stage of implementing the northern flood agreement 
because the government has, for decades and decades, failed to 
follow through on agreements reached with aboriginal people, 
whether it be treaty agreements or otherwise.  As a result we 
have another piece of legislation before us to ease things along 
and get things moving.  There was never any intent from the 
Norway House first nation or any other supporters of the bill 
from the first nations side to abrogate any of their treaty 
rights.  That is why I think it is extremely important that we 
ensure those rights are in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses are common in many kinds of legislation.  Section 35 of 
the Constitution Act guarantees aboriginal and treaty rights. 
Legally, no bill passed by parliament can violate these rights. 
However, just to make sure there is no doubt, it is common to 
include clauses like these to explicitly guarantee the status of 
aboriginal and treaty rights.  When we think about it, it is 
common sense. 
It avoids the costly legal fees that could be involved if first 
nations or their members have to go to court to uphold section 35 
rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen in the past is that the action of the 
government is to constantly take different groups to court to 
fight for rights they already have.  We are dealing with scarce 
taxpayers' dollars, and for the government not to make an effort 
to settle these disputes out of court and not to be serious in 
their negotiations is quite unconscionable.  Certainly in first 
nations communities money can be better spent.  I do not 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Including these amendments shows a commitment by the government 
that it will make an effort to settle these if there is no intent 
to take aboriginal people to court to uphold their treaty rights. 
It is better to be clear that the aboriginal and treaty rights 
are absolute rather than leave any possible doubt and have the 
courts sort it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments have broad support from the people who 
supported Bill C-14, or as it was previously introduced, Bill 
C-56, as well as from those who opposed it.  One of the major 
concerns raised by the opponents of the bill was that it might 
undermine treaty rights conferred in the northern flood 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I want to acknowledge that many people out there, 
including a former Indian affairs minister, saw the northern 
flood agreement as a modern treaty.  As a result, there is real 
concern that any change to that flood agreement will change those 
treaty rights.  It is extremely important that we ensure this is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to consultations with representatives from the Norway 
House Cree Nation, the first nation this directly affects, the 
government of Norway House does not intend that this bill will 
change their treaty rights in any way, shape or form.  Ensuring 
that these amendments are in the bill solidifies that. 
Those who worry that this bill might unintentionally affect 
treaty rights also support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people from Cross Lake First Nation, those most closely 
related to the Norway House First Nation, certainly in an area 
with a lot of familial ties over the years, do not support this 
bill. They do not want this.  They want to adhere to the northern 
flood agreement as it was signed a number of years ago but never 
adhered to.  The people of Cross Lake First Nation have the right 
to make that decision for themselves, just as the people of 
Norway House have the right to make this decision for their first 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the members of the Liberal government to support these 
amendments and make this bill acceptable to the people of Cross 
Lake and others who are concerned about the treaty implications. 
As parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the constitution of 
Canada and that includes aboriginal treaties under section 35.  I 
truly hope that the government will not vote against these 
amendments because it will be a signal to aboriginal people that 
the Liberal government does not respect their treaty rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state again that our party will be supporting these 
amendments and this bill.  We have concerns.  I was at committee 
and listened to a number of concerns raised within the first 
nations over the vote on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I too have concerns over the conduct of some 
officials of the department of Indian affairs.  It left a 
perception out there that things were not being done up front.  I 
was upset with the evasiveness of some of those officials who 
spoke to the committee about this bill.  At points I almost felt 
like I was being misled as a member of the committee of the 
House.  I do not think this is appropriate for government 
officials, but that is a problem with the department of Indian 
affairs.  It is not the problem with this bill and it does not 
affect our support of the bill in any way.  We can deal with 
those things through other areas.  I hope we will start to deal 
with all first nations people in an upfront way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to me too that the majority of the people of Norway 
House support this agreement.  There were questions.  In most 
agreements and discussions you have opposing sides.  There were 
those who did not support it, but the chief and council who were 
representative of this bill and getting the message out there 
were pretty much the same chief and council who were elected 
after the vote had been taken.  I accept that as an indication 
that the majority of people of the Norway House Cree Nation 
support the decision of the chief and council and support this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been a long time in reaching this stage.  It has 
been popping up since the time I came to the House of Commons in 
1997. 
It is time that we put this issue to rest for the people of 
Norway House, but in doing so we must ensure that we do not risk 
the treaty rights of first nations people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to comment on one point from the committee, when I 
think the House certainly failed first nations people and in 
doing so failed all Canadians.  There was an opportunity to take 
this issue, the whole discussion on the bill and these concerns, 
to the people most directly affected, the people of Cross Lake 
and Norway House.  The committee failed to take the committee 
hearings to that area.  As a result, there will always be some 
misunderstanding and some feeling that they were not fairly 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a small thing that committees of the House can do, to 
take the issue to those most affected, and it is something we 
should do.  I want to voice my displeasure at the government, 
quite frankly, because let us face it, the government controls 
the committees.  Let me point out that in the future maybe we can 
avoid some of the situations we see ourselves in if the 
government makes an effort to actually go to the people of Canada 
to get their feelings.  It should go to the first nations and let 
them have a say on what is going to be affecting their lives. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to address the amendments to Bill C-14, an 
act respecting an agreement with the Norway House Cree Nation 
for the settlement of matters arising from the flooding of land, 
and respecting the establishment of certain reserves in the 
province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill includes two parts. The first one deals with the 
Norway House Cree Nation, while the second one seeks to 
facilitate the implementation of the land claim agreements in 
Manitoba, including the ones on future land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aboriginals affected by this legislation were concerned 
about their aboriginal and treaty rights. 
The Manitoba northern flood agreement was signed in 1977 by 
Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and five first nations of the province. 
That agreement was reached following the flooding of land used 
by first nations. It listed the conditions for compensating 
first nations affected by the flooding of their traditional 
land. It is not for me to say whether this agreement is 
considered to be a treaty, or if it will be in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment seeks to protect treaty rights, should the 
Manitoba northern flood agreement be considered to be a treaty 
some day. The problem I see in supporting this amendment is that 
it would protect any right or claim resulting from the 
agreement. The key word here is the term right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word right is not defined in the Manitoba northern flood 
agreement. 
In this bill, this is not a problem, because there is a 
definition of right or claim in the Manitoba northern flood 
agreement.  If we introduce the definition of this term, I 
believe that would allow some new interpretations and would 
broaden the scope of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment, the second one, also includes the terms 
right and claim.  Primarily, its intent is to ensure that 
the Manitoba northern flood agreement continues to be the 
document that takes precedence in compensating the Cree of 
Norway House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, the comprehensive implementation agreement would 
also take precedence over claims by the Norway House Cree.  With 
the amendment, the Manitoba northern flood agreement would be 
amended as far as rights and claims are concerned. 
This therefore reinforces the protection of treaty rights and 
the original conditions of the Manitoba northern flood 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the reasons for demanding protection of treaty 
rights, as in the case of the first amendment, but I do have 
difficulty with the idea of introducing a term that is not 
defined.  As I have said, the term right is not defined in the 
Manitoba northern flood agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the people of Norway House Cree Nation voted in a 
referendum to accept the terms of the master implementation 
agreement.  While we heard from a number of concerned Norway 
House members about the process used in the referendum and their 
fears that they will lose rights afforded to them by the northern 
flood agreement, the fact remains that treaty rights are 
constitutionally protected. 
Discussions about the accuracy of the referendum were never 
completely explained, which means that one has to accept that the 
people chose to accept a resolution to a claim that is more than 
20 years old.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Norway House Cree Nation that should ultimately make 
decisions regarding compensation for their flooded land.  They 
chose to accept the terms of the master implementation agreement 
and, with the constitutionally protected treaty rights, they 
should be in a position to finally realize the compensatory 
benefits afforded to them by the northern flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment No. 3 would add another clause to the legislation dealing 
with the Norway House Cree Nation and the master implementation 
agreement they signed in December 1997.  This amendment would 
provide a security feature to the legislation to ensure that 
nothing in the act or the master implementation agreement is 
meant to “abrogate or derogate from the existing aboriginal 
rights or treaty rights of the first nation”.  That is a quote 
from the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this amendment has some merit since it is meant to protect 
aboriginal rights, these rights are already protected in the 
Canadian constitution.  This legislation should be a positive 
move for the Norway House Cree Nation.  Their members voted to 
accept the terms of the agreement and the chief has recognized 
the benefits of the agreement for the band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party supports legislation that allows first nations to 
become more self-reliant and financially independent.  This 
legislation does exactly that.  It will provide funds to be 
managed by a trust fund on behalf of the first nations.  We 
support the legislation because of the positive advantage it 
provides to first nations in Manitoba but we do have reservations 
regarding the amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to speak to Bill C-14, the Manitoba claim 
settlements implementation act.  I was in Manitoba when the dams 
were being built.  I was a surveyor and flew many miles over that 
country in a helicopter on my way to and from work.  It is an 
interesting country and it was an interesting job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aboriginal people in that area were deprived of some pretty 
nice land, particularly along the river.  It is good land, but 
farther back it contains a lot of muskeg, so the land they lost 
was among the best.  This bill will bring some finality to the 
issue and will put some money in their pockets so that they can 
get on with their lives.  It is important.  Not only is it some 
money, it is some land to make up for what they lost.  It is land 
of equal value.  I see from the bill that it will take about four 
times as much land to equal the value of what they did lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many questions raised by many people about the 
process used to get approval for the flood agreement.  Most of 
those questions were never adequately answered.  They were not 
answered in the community or in committee.  It seemed to me that 
the Liberals spent a lot of time trying to hush up the issue and 
hurry this bill through.  They spent a lot more time on 
procedural matters and objections to the list of witnesses that 
many of us in the official opposition and other opposition 
parties wanted to hear from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had more correspondence on this than anything I have seen 
since I came to the House.  Members of the committee received a 
binder that is probably four inches thick and is filled with 
letters, briefs and presentations that have been made on this 
issue over the years.  In the length of time we had to look at 
this bill, it was impossible to do a proper assessment and 
analysis of the entire situation.  Also, the people most affected 
by this legislation were never really heard from when it was 
brought to parliament.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first agreement that was signed was so loose and open-ended 
that it gave rise to absolutely every kind of interpretation.  It 
was not capable of being implemented due to its open-ended 
nature.  Simply to bring some closure to the matter, the 
government trampled on the rights of a lot of people and 
overlooked due process.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should not be deprived of their land without due process, 
and once deprived through legislative means they need to be 
adequately compensated.  Those rights are available to all 
Canadians under expropriation acts, whether provincial or 
municipal.  Certainly that right has to be there as well for 
Canada's aboriginals.  They simply cannot be deprived of land and 
rights just because it happens to suit the political agenda of 
the party in power at the time.  We are not overly happy about 
many of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We notice the insertion of the word right.  I am not sure, 
given recent court decisions, that the insertion of this word 
adds anything or that leaving it out will detract from anything. 
To that extent I agree with my colleague from Churchill.  She had 
it about right there.  The courts seem to be playing more and 
more of a role.  It seems the Canadian public, the Canadian 
government and the Canadian taxpayer are being governed by our 
courts, much more than by the people who were elected, not 
appointed, to make the laws.  We need to look after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the questions I have about the transfer of land in fee 
simple to the band concern private ownership.  Let us remember 
the bill has two parts.  There is also a treaty land entitlement 
part to the bill.  I and my colleagues doubt 
that any individuals will be able to exercise private property 
rights over any of that land.  It will have to be always dealt 
with in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have appeared before our committee have said the lack 
of private property rights by natives over aboriginal land is one 
of the biggest barriers to economic development for those people, 
not just as a group but as individuals.  The head of the First 
Nations Bank is one of those people.  The head of the Business 
Development Bank of Canada is another individual who believes 
there need to be private property rights for individuals to make 
any headway in society, and that the communal style of owning 
property, which means lending institutions have no way to take 
collateral, is one of the biggest drawbacks to economic 
development for aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things were never addressed in the legislation.  The 
government had an opportunity to get to work on these types of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty land entitlement process does make up for shortfalls 
in Indian reserves that were established and surveyed at the 
times the treaties were signed, and it is a fairly generous 
settlement at that.  Individuals will not benefit from it; simply 
bands will benefit.  Many times that means the leadership gets 
most of the benefit, not the band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had aboriginal people come to my office in the riding of 
Prince Albert, I have had people telephone me at home, and I have 
had people contacting me by phone, letter, e-mail, fax, or 
whatever in my office in Ottawa, saying they want to be able to 
exercise private property rights.  They would love to get a 
square mile of land somewhere, anywhere, maybe with some lumber 
on it so that they could do some logging, build a home, start to 
farm, or something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can they do that under the bill? Nothing doing.  They are 
absolutely kept out of the mainstream of the Canadian economy 
because of legislation such as this and attitudes such as those 
on the other side, which deny Indian people the same rights that 
are available to every person in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be a process to allow native people to take 
possession of their hopes.  I recently spoke to a man on a 
reserve who had been given six months to get off the reserve and 
out of the house he lived in.  He had been married to an Indian 
woman.  The band said “We need this house for band members. You 
are not a band member”.  His wife had just died and he got a 
letter from the band saying “You are out of here”.  Is that the 
way to treat Canadians, aboriginal or otherwise?  I do not think 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of rights available to people living on reserve is a 
scandal and needs to be addressed. 
While the bill does some good things locally for the people in 
making redress for land taken from them, it is a far cry from the 
kind of legislation we need to introduce to ensure that 
aboriginal women have the protections they need.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that woman would not have been happy to know her 
husband was told “You are out of here”.  Fortunately he had 
daughters who were willing to look after him and took him in, but 
here was a man who was capable of living independently.  He was 
not that old.  He was forced to live with his children or else 
leave his home and his friends.  That just does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation the federal government will fund Indian 
bands to undertake land selection studies.  In Saskatchewan, 
where the treaty land entitlement process has been in business 
for some time, too many bands have been spending too much money 
doing studies and not enough buying.  If any farmer were to spend 
that kind of money on studies, he long since would have been 
into bankruptcy, out of business, and working for a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be some accountability for the money that is 
transferred and held for these people.  Certainly we will be 
watching that.  I am sure we will be taking phone calls on that 
same issue over the years.  We intend to form the government, and 
we will be making certain that this money is well spent on behalf of 
Canada's Indian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have listened with great interest to my colleagues' comments. 
Having worked with most of them on the aboriginal committee, I 
know from whence they come and I know they are genuine in their 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are dealing with a separate piece of legislation that 
has the purpose of making an agreement with the Norway House Cree 
so that they can get on with the business of running their 
community, of getting the land they are entitled to and the 
compensation they have been denied by a long and cumbersome 
process that started in 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, in miniature, what my colleague from Saint-Jean talked 
about regarding the Nass Valley.  I too was there the week before 
last to honour the opening of the new legislative building of the 
Nisga'a, who worked for 120 years to get to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with an agreement made with the fourth of five 
first nations affected by the Manitoba northern flood agreement. 
The reason we have this agreement is that the other one does not 
work very well, because it allows for the kind of thing my 
colleagues across the hall have deplored.  It allows for 
confrontations in court.  It is costly and inefficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to get around this stumbling block, the parties, 
including Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro, Canada and the northern flood 
committee, have come up with a way of negotiating an 
implementation agreement with each first nation individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of the bill deals with compensation for the 
Norway House Cree Nation, which it is situated 450 kilometres north of 
Winnipeg.  There are over 5,000 members, and nearly 4,000 of them 
reside on reserve.  As my colleague from Prince Albert has said, 
and he was involved in the surveying, the best land along the 
rivers was flooded.  These people are in need of land to 
compensate for that loss at about four to one.  As my colleague 
from Churchill said, the chief and council have agreed with the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons rights are not mentioned is to get around the 
very problem of making this a treaty, which it is not, and 
maintaining it as an agreement, which it is.  This, in line with 
“Gathering Strength”, our aboriginal action plan, moves the agenda 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we accept this motion to add that word then we are back to 
square one.  We are back to pre-Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples days.  We are back to Chief Justice Hamilton's comments 
about certainty in inalienable rights and aboriginal rights.  If 
they are not clearly defined we get into trouble.  We are not 
trying to define them in the bill. We are saying there is a 
problem.  These people deserve compensation.  We will compensate 
them according to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill affects more first nations, 
particularly Manitoba first nations, potentially all Manitoba 
first nations, in that it aims to facilitate the addition to 
reserve commitments under a variety of existing and future 
Manitoba claims settlements.  While the most significant of these 
commitments at present are to the 20 Manitoba first nations 
covered by the 1997 Manitoba treaty land entitlement framework 
agreement, other first nations in Manitoba will also derive 
benefits under part 2, relative to other existing and future 
settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative, in order to move the agenda on, in order that 
the first nations of Manitoba can get the support and the freedom 
to act they need, that these amendments be defeated. If they are 
not we will go back into a very murky situation that existed 22 
years ago.  That is not progress for the native people.  It is 
not progress for the government.  It is not progress for the 
country.  It is a lack of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no danger in this act to any first nations treaty 
rights, aboriginal rights, inherent rights or any other rights. 
The bill rights a wrong, an overdue delay in settlement with the 
Norway House Cree.  It makes further settlements with the other 
bands in Manitoba much easier to accomplish because people have 
to sit down and agree on what they need, how much they can have, 
where the land is, add it to the reserve, et cetera.  As Chief 
Gosnell said in the Nass Valley, confrontation is not the way to 
go.  Consultation, agreements and negotiation are the way to go. 
That is when everybody gets the most value for their efforts, the 
government and the first nations.  I urge the House to deny these 
motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak 
to Bill C-14.  I was involved earlier in the agreements that 
derived from the Manitoba flooding of the 1970s.  In the last 
parliament we had Bill C-36 dealing with the Split Lake Band, 
Bill C-39 dealing with the York Factory Band, and Bill C-40 
dealing with the Nelson House Band.  This is now the fourth bill 
dealing with five bands.  We only have the Cross Lake Band that 
is currently not addressed by new legislation and is still 
subject to the Manitoba northern flood agreement of 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically Bill C-14 deals with Norway House.  I had the 
experience of going to Norway House in the summer of 1995 as part 
of my party's task force on aboriginal affairs. 
We were trying to develop policy at that time.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I well remember the charter flight from Winnipeg to the 
airport at Norway House.  We had made arrangements previously 
with some women from the Norway House community to meet us at the 
airport.  There were several members of parliament from my 
caucus.  The first words that came out of one of their mouths was 
“Congratulations, you have now been at Norway House one more 
time than our chief has this year”.  That was actually the 
forerunner and the first clear example in my mind of the way in 
which aboriginal women were making decisions.  When they are 
dissatisfied with the way their community is being run, they will 
do something about it.  That is one memory that is etched in my 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1977 Manitoba flood agreement was laced with problems. It 
did not become a very good document to implement a lot of the 
necessary things to address the huge displacement of community 
lands.  There were new hazards for residents of the communities 
because of the change in the waters and water levels. Resources 
were displaced.  A whole new way of life had to be put in place 
because the flooded lands had changed the way the water oriented 
communities had operated up until that time.  Clearly no one 
could reasonably argue that compensation is not an important part 
of this whole agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have supported all of the compensation agreements.  We have 
been very consistent in doing that in Bill C-36, Bill C-39, Bill 
C-40 and once again today we are supporting Bill C-14. We have 
actually debated this since June 1994.  That was the first set of 
debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just give an idea of what happened when the flooding 
occurred on the Nelson and Churchill rivers along with the Lake 
Winnipeg regulations project.  Almost 5,000 hectares of reserve 
land belonging to these five first nations were flooded as well 
as over 200,000 hectares of non-reserve land that was 
traditionally used for hunting and trapping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s when the flood agreement was put together, it was 
very loosely worded.  With these agreements now, not only is 
implementation better served, but we have clearer questions of 
how liability will be addressed.  The project proponent, Manitoba 
Hydro, now essentially has the ongoing and unanticipated future 
liability.  I think everyone would agree that is just and proper 
as it is the major proponent for the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some interesting elements to these agreements.  In 
many ways we should be looking at these as enlightened things 
that we can build into future agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fee simple lands that are being transferred are not 
necessarily being transferred into typical reserve status. 
This will give the bands a lot more flexibility and opportunity 
to deal with those lands in a way that will not necessarily 
involve all the bureaucracy of the department of Indian affairs.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the transfer of moneys, the compensation package, the moneys 
are going into a trust arrangement that will necessarily have an 
accountability function built in which I think is highly 
appropriate.  We know for example that under the Liberal 
government the accumulated deficit of native bands across Canada 
has gone from $130 million to over $300 million.  That lack of 
accountability is something to be avoided.  This arrangement 
avoids that lack of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the main points I wanted to get across.  A couple of 
other things are worth pointing out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fee simple lands held by the respective native corporations 
are held outside the normal encumbrances of the Indian Act.  They 
are also subject to property taxation. Any business originating 
from these lands is also taxable. In addition, individual band 
members may appeal under the Manitoba arbitration act if they are 
unsatisfied with band decisions which affect them personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some new thinking here that is worth putting under a 
microscope a few years down the road to see what real changes 
it has brought about.  My suspicion is that this will lead to 
some good changes in the way governance is applied within these 
communities.

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved that 
Bill C-17, an act to amend the criminal code (cruelty to animals, 
disarming a peace officer and other amendments) and the Firearms 
Act (technical amendments), be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-17 which is an omnibus 
package that proposes amendments in a number of areas of the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, these amendments will improve the criminal law in 
a number of areas, such as tougher laws to protect animals from 
cruelty, better protection for peace officers acting in the line 
of duty, and improvements to respond to concerns from firearms 
businesses with respect to the administration of the firearms 
system.  Other amendments will provide greater procedural 
safeguards to persons with disabilities who are victims of sexual 
exploitation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to focus on the parts of the bill amending 
certain current provisions of the criminal code having to do 
with cruelty to animals.  These amendments have attracted 
considerable public interest and I will start with them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 10 years humane societies have been asking ministers of 
justice to improve and strengthen the law on cruelty to animals. 
Humane societies are established by provincial legislation and 
have the statutory mandate to prevent cruelty to animals, to 
relieve animals in distress and to educate the public about 
animal cruelty and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many humane society officers are designated as peace officers 
and have the power to investigate and lay charges of cruelty 
under the criminal code.  These are the organizations that are 
largely responsible for administering the criminal law and 
provincial laws in this area.  These are the people who know when 
the system is not working and they in fact told ministers of 
justice for over 10 years that the system was not working as well 
as it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear from the start about what cruelty is.  Cruelty is 
about the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering on animals. 
It is the causing of avoidable pain, the causing of pain for no 
reason or through extreme neglect.  Society rightly abhors such 
conduct.  Who would choose to harm an animal if they did not have 
to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cruelty to animals is not about the appropriate standard for 
animal care in various specific contexts such as farming 
practices or slaughter methods.  These activities are directly 
regulated by specific laws and regulations both provincially and 
federally and are understood to fall outside the criminal law. 
Our law recognizes that animals can be used for a variety of 
purposes to satisfy certain human needs if they are treated 
humanely and with respect at every stage.  That is what Canadians 
expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reviewing this area of law, the minister and her 
department consulted with the public and interested groups in 
September 1998.  We sought their views on the modernization and 
strengthening of the current laws.  The response was really quite 
significant and took us all by surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of Canadians wrote in and signed petitions telling us 
that they wanted animal abuse treated more seriously.  To this 
day the Department of Justice continues to receive many letters 
every week, sometimes hundreds, applauding the government 
for introducing this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to note that support for modernization and 
tougher penalties came from national and provincial veterinary 
associations and from many provincial attorneys general.  Members 
of the House may be interested to know that last November, just 
weeks before the bill was introduced, the Ontario legislature 
passed a resolution with all party support that urged this 
government to strengthen our laws on animal cruelty, to do the 
very thing that Bill C-17 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario government continues to be very interested in 
stronger animal cruelty laws.  As recently as last week Solicitor 
General Tsubouchi, who had previously written to the minister and 
urged the government to strengthen the animal cruelty laws, 
continued to emphasize the need for stronger penalties against 
cruelty to animals at the launch of the Ontario Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Violence Prevention Week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has all these organizations and individuals concerned?  If 
I may, I will remind members of the House what cruelty is and how 
it happens all too frequently in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country dogs have been beaten with hockey sticks and 
golf clubs, thrown off balconies and dragged behind cars. 
Cats have been mutilated, burned, tied to railroad tracks and 
left for oncoming trains.  Animals have been trained to be 
aggressive and forced to fight each other to the death for 
entertainment and economic profit.  I need not horrify members 
with further gory details. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some but by no means all cases, charges are laid.  Even 
where charges are laid, prosecutors often choose not to proceed 
in all but the most extreme circumstances.  In the rare cases 
where a conviction is obtained, the penalties range from a small 
fine to, on rare occasions, a brief stint in prison, typically a 
few days or weeks.  Canadians think we can do better than this, 
that we can prevent some of these acts with stronger deterrents 
and tougher penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, all members should know that it is not only the animals 
that will benefit from such measures.  Canadians are perceptive 
and they realize a society that cares for its animals also shows 
more respect and compassion for its people.  They know already 
that the people who abuse animals may already be doing the same 
or worse to the people in their lives.  It is common sense, if 
people are never made to account for their violence, that 
violence may be more likely to escalate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, violence is violence.  A person determined to cause 
pain and suffering often does not care who or what the victim is. 
Animal cruelty is another form of violence in our society.  If we 
do not treat it seriously then we fail to tackle the problem of 
violence in all its aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, there is also a particular correlation between 
animal cruelty and domestic violence.  This is supported by a 
growing number of studies involving battered women which show 
that a clear majority of their batterers also abuse pets in their 
home.  They also show, sadly, that around half these women report 
that they stayed in the abusive household longer than they 
otherwise would have out of fear for the safety of the pet. 
Animal abuse clearly figures into a larger pattern of violence 
and abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Animal abuse in the home can also have a devastating impact on 
children.  We all know of the natural bond that children form 
with animals.  A child that witnesses its beloved pet being 
beaten by a parent will be psychologically traumatized.  That 
child may well be more likely to be abused if a parent is abusing 
a pet.  There is also data that suggests that children could be 
more likely to grow up committing violent offences themselves, 
imitating what they witnessed their parents do at home.  If a 
child manages to avoid a life of crime, he or she may suffer from 
learning problems and social and developmental difficulties. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take the issue of animal abuse seriously, if we make a 
reasonable effort to identify and punish it, we will stand a 
better chance of preventing violence and other forms of 
mistreatment with respect to human beings. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that background I will briefly outline the main features of 
the amendments relating to cruelty to animals.  One thing the 
amendments do is modernize and simplify the law.  The law right 
now is confusing and incoherently organized.  The basic structure 
is a result of piecemeal amendments to 100 year old provisions. 
There is overlap between sections and outdated distinctions are built 
into the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 will modernize the language of existing offences, 
eliminate archaic distinctions and provide uniform protection for 
all animals.  It also proposes a rational and coherent set of 
offences, for the first time distinguishing between intentional 
cruelty and cruelty by criminal neglect.  The person who loves 
his or her animals but has too many to keep well fed commits a 
different kind of crime his or her than the person who senselessly 
brutalizes an animal.  In short, the amendments will make the law 
more logical and easier to use by law enforcement, prosecutors 
and judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of the amendment is penalty enhancement.  Even 
the most heinous and barbarous act today carries a maximum six 
months in prison or a $2,000 fine.  It is little wonder that the 
police do not often expand their limited resources on cruelty 
charges.  I have heard time and time again from Canadians that 
penalties must be higher to deter this behaviour and to denounce 
and punish those who simply will not abide by societal standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would give prosecutors more choice on how to proceed, 
based on the seriousness of the circumstances.  In really serious 
cases the prosecution can proceed by indictment and the maximum 
penalty will be five years in prison.  It takes a strong 
statement from parliament to get some people to understand that 
cruelty will not be tolerated and to get cases brought before the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year maximum penalty is appropriate for this offence. 
It is important to remember that the maximum penalty is reserved 
for the most serious crimes committed by the worst offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite members to compare this penalty with that for assault, 
which also has a maximum penalty of five years.  Assault can be 
committed simply by spitting on someone or pushing someone who 
did not consent to be touched.  If bodily harm is caused in the 
course of an assault then the maximum penalty jumps to 10 years. 
I certainly think it is appropriate to have the same maximum 
sentence for torturing and mutilating an animal as that which 
exists for simple assault.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another sentencing measure in the bill relates to the court's 
power to prohibit an offender from owning or having care and 
control of an animal subsequent to a conviction.  Right now the 
courts can order a convicted offender not to own or possess 
animals for up to two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is commonly felt, including by some judges, that the two year 
maximum is too short.  Prohibition orders can be very effective 
by preventing future harm without being overly punitive.  Even 
some provincial animal welfare statutes are stronger than the 
criminal code and let the court decide what time is appropriate. 
The bill will therefore give courts the much needed discretion to 
fix the appropriate time limit on prohibition orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another new sentencing feature is the power of the court to 
order the convicted animal abuser to repay reasonable costs 
to the humane society that cared for the animal in question. 
Restitution orders have the potential to greatly assist humane 
societies in fulfilling their statutory mandates to care for 
abused animals.  These organizations receive little public 
funding but they play a vital role in taking in and caring for 
animals.  Humane societies should be reimbursed the reasonable 
costs they expend in performing this valuable function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Restitution orders are also a valuable sentencing mechanism 
because they help instil a sense of responsibility in an offender 
by holding him or her accountable for the damage or injury the 
crimes have caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to what kinds of acts constitute crimes, the bill 
carries over existing offences and actually eliminates a few 
offences that overlap with others.  Bill C-17 strengthens the law 
in many respects but actually creates only two new offences.  It 
will be an offence to brutally or viciously kill an animal. 
Assuming that a person has a legitimate reason to kill an animal, 
right now the law places no limits on the way in which animals 
can be killed.  The law only requires that unnecessary pain or 
suffering not be caused in the course of a killing, but a quick 
and painless killing is not necessarily synonymous with a humane 
or acceptable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, it is not acceptable to kill an animal with 
explosives or to leave it to be run over by a train, even though 
the animal may die instantly.  These things actually happen. 
Killing an animal in a particularly brutal or vicious way is a 
special kind of crime which may in fact be just the sort of 
conduct that causes the greatest risk to society.  It reveals 
the most depraved and sadistic intent.  Evidence shows that many 
serial killers acquired their taste for killing by practising on 
animals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House should support this measure, which is 
aimed squarely at brutality and which gives the police and the 
courts the tools they need to arrest and punish these 
individuals, who may be extremely dangerous. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also introduces a new offence of training an animal to 
fight other animals.  Certain acts related to animal fighting are 
already crimes in Canada but are very hard to prosecute.  Humane 
society investigators rarely come across a fight actually taking 
place.  The training of fighting animals, dogs and cocks in 
particular, is cruel to those animals and sometimes to other 
animals such as kittens which may be used to train dogs to attack 
and kill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who engage in this activity train dogs to be 
aggressive and deadly.  Although it is not seen by most of us, 
there does seem to be evidence of active cock fighting and dog 
fighting rings in Ontario and British Columbia.  This new offence 
will provide investigators with a new tool in their efforts to 
identify and shut down this insidious practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the main features of Bill C-17 as it relates to animal 
cruelty.  The bill responds to what can only be called 
overwhelming public support and interest in better legal 
protection for animals from unnecessary pain and suffering.  The 
government is pleased to make these amendments to recognize that 
animal cruelty is a crime of violence and should be taken more 
seriously than it has been for the sake of the animals and for 
our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may not know that the government has 
heard a number of concerns from certain groups representing 
farmers, hunters and animal researchers.  They are concerned that 
these proposals, the way they are currently drafted, are vague 
and imprecise and could therefore impinge upon their businesses 
or livelihoods.  I take this opportunity to thank these groups 
for having shared their concerns and their ideas with members of 
the minister's staff and Department of Justice officials at 
numerous meetings over the course of the spring.  Such 
interventions are a helpful part of the law reform process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I point out that hunters and farmers are in fact 
vocal supporters of strong animal cruelty laws.  The overwhelming 
majority of farmers, hunters and others who use animals do so 
responsibly and humanely and in accordance with the law.  They 
are among the first to denounce those who fall below acceptable 
standards.  The concerns heard relate to uncertainty about the 
interpretation of certain words and the application of the 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view some of these concerns are based on a number of 
misunderstandings about the legal impact of the amendments and 
fail to recognize the existence of fundamental criminal laws, 
rules and principles which are not written in the criminal code. 
It is not difficult to understand, if lawyers and judges can 
disagree about the interpretation of some laws, that other 
Canadians may also be reasonably uncertain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for members of the House and for those concerned 
to remember that there are already laws against cruelty to 
animals, laws which our courts have interpreted and applied time 
and time again.  The bill does not create a new regime where none 
existed before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from changing penalties the bill makes only very slight 
changes to the law we already have.  The criminal law has never 
been used inappropriately to target the humane treatment of 
animals in normal human activities.  This is because the law and 
the courts already recognize that there are many valid reasons 
for the use of animals and that those reasons sometimes require 
the animals to suffer or be killed.  The bill does not change 
that.  In short, what is lawful today will be lawful the day 
after the bill becomes law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is determined that the criminal law be 
clear and accessible to everyone, not just to criminal lawyers 
and judges.  It has been said before that our criminal laws 
already recognize the humane treatment of animals in the course 
of legitimate and normal activities such as farming, hunting, 
fishing and animal research.  As parliamentary secretary I would 
like to assure those involved in such activities that the 
government will include a statement in the bill to that effect 
when it is before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee all concerns can be discussed in greater detail. We 
are prepared to make sure that if further clarification or 
modifications to the principles of Bill C-17 are required so as 
to improve the law and more clearly set out its objectives, we 
will make them.  We can work together to produce a law that 
everyone is happy with and can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have devoted the bulk of my remarks to the cruelty of 
animals component of Bill C-17, I want to speak to another 
proposal in the bill which responds to concerns related to police 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will create a new offence of disarming a peace officer. 
Every member should support this measure.  Police officers are 
required as part of their duties in investigating crime to enter 
situations that are potentially dangerous.  That danger can be 
suddenly increased tenfold if a suspect grabs the officer's 
weapon.  Suddenly there is a life threatening situation.  In fact 
we are told by the Canadian Police Association that the taking of 
an officer's firearm has sometimes resulted in the murder of the 
officer.  We are pleased to report to the Canadian Police 
Association that the government has responded to its concerns on 
this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The names Scott Rossiter, Michael O'Leary and Aurele Bourgeois 
may not be familiar to members of the House.  They were all shot 
with their own police weapons.  Rossiter, a constable from 
Ingersoll, Ontario, was shot by a suspect in 1991.  Constable 
O'Leary and Corporal Bourgeois were disarmed in the course of 
trying to arrest two kidnappers in 1974.  The offender then shot 
the two policemen.  I will not comment further at this time 
except to say that if proof of the need for a specific offence of 
disarming a police officer is needed, these three examples 
provide that proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the highlights of this omnibus package.  The 
government is committed to ongoing review of the criminal law and 
to the maintenance of effective legislative measures to protect 
society and its members.  As part of this effort the legislation 
contains a series of other measures to address concerns about the 
legislation, adjust offences and punishments, modernize the 
statute and correct oversights enacted in previous legislative 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to monitor the legislation and bring forward 
further changes as the need for them becomes apparent.  I look 
forward to the support of all members of the House for this 
important criminal code omnibus legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in the House to speak to 
Bill C-17.  I have several concerns with the bill which as the 
official opposition we are obligated to bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues facing us in this bill, among other bills 
brought into the House of Commons, is the fact that it is 
basically an omnibus bill.  It contains many changes.  Some are 
technical amendments. Some affect the Firearms Act.  Some affect 
the criminal code, and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about this numerous times in the House of 
Commons.  Once again I advise the government that when bills are 
brought into the House it would be far better if they were 
simpler, more understandable bills, each dealing with an issue that 
can be tackled as an issue isolated unto itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The items directed for change are good changes.  I will go 
through what I agree with and what I do not. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague opposite indicated, there is obviously reason 
for concern among some groups.  He also indicated that those 
concerns were not that serious and that there may be some 
misunderstandings about the bill.  The fact is, if the 
changes and aspects of the bill are unclear, he knows full well 
what will happen.  The lawyers and the legal industry will get it 
and once again our legislation will be developed in the 
courtroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that we have to make changes to 
the legislation in that area.  We will be looking for these 
changes in committee. If we do not receive those changes or at 
least clarifications so that the legal industry does not play 
with this in the courtrooms, then my opinion on the bill may very 
well change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point there are three main provisions in the bill. The 
first is that it amends the criminal code by consolidating animal 
cruelty offences for brutally or viciously killing an animal or 
abandoning one.  It will no longer be a property crime.  I do not 
think there is much disagreement in the House as to whether or 
not that is necessary.  It certainly is in this day and age.  We 
have seen time and time again where cruelty to animals seems to 
go unattended to by the courts. It has been basically a misdemeanour 
up until now.  I commend the government for that action.  I agree 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also creates the offence of disarming or attempting to 
disarm a peace officer.  I wish this would have been a subject 
unto itself in legislation because there is more to this than 
just that aspect of it.  However, I commend the government for 
that aspect of the legislation, as it is truly necessary. I know 
the police forces and peace officers appreciate this kind of 
action coming from the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Firearms Act are incorporated by expanding 
the class of prohibited handguns that are grandfathered and 
modifying the employee licensing requirements.  I think that as 
well has been accepted and taken with a fair bit of understanding 
and appreciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is really new in the bill under those three 
categories.  The bill raises the penalty for intentional cruelty 
to animals from the current six months to five years.  That is an 
upward limit.  There is no minimum penalty, which in a way is too 
bad.  I think minimum penalties also enhance legislation, not just 
maximums.  When we go into the courts of this land, maximum 
penalties are seldom applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add, however, that in my long time spent looking at issues 
such as conditional sentences, I have seen many cases where women 
have been sexually assaulted and their attackers have received 
conditional sentences, sentences of much less than the current 
sentence the government is proposing for cruelty to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say to the government that when we look at it from that 
perspective, I would suggest that the government should go back 
and look at conditional sentences.  It should try to take the 
action whereby violent offenders cannot get conditional 
sentences.  When we look at it in perspective, with cruelty to 
animal bills everyone will understand and appreciate that there 
has to be some kind of comparison for the time and the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation lifts the cap on the fine, which is 
currently at $2,000.  I do not think the legislation as I 
understand it identifies whether or not there is an upward limit 
to that or whether the dollar values of the fines are open. 
We will be asking the following question when it comes to 
committee:  is the level of fine open-ended or designated?  I 
would like the parliamentary secretary's comments on that.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a potential for a lifetime ban from owning an animal 
for those convicted of cruelty to animals.  I like that.  I think 
it is about time that we set some standard in this country.  I 
can recall case after case in British Columbia where people have 
mistreated animals.  In fact sometimes many animals have been 
mistreated in one place not just one animal.  These people have 
had more animals within their care shortly afterward. That was 
wrong.  In one case that I recall, it was the second time around 
for an individual in British Columbia when he was again caught by 
the SPCA for brutality to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those found guilty of cruelty to an animal now have to pay the 
bill for the vet services to treat the animal.  This is a great 
move.  However, I want to put some relevance back into this and 
into other legislation.  In this case we are holding responsible 
an individual who has been convicted of being cruel to animals 
for the cost, for the responsibility of trying to fix the 
situation by fixing the animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the Young Offenders Act, for instance, we say 
“Where it is applicable, why not hold parents accountable for 
the damages caused by the young offender?”  The government 
virtually panics when we talk about this.  Yet if an animal has 
been hurt, the government turns around and says that it will hold 
the people responsible for its injuries. Consistency in the House 
in government legislation would be more appropriate, and the 
government should look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill acknowledges that animals have feelings and are 
deserving of legal protection from negligence or abuse, which I 
think we can agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a separate criminal offence to take away or to attempt to 
take away a police officer's weapon and it is punishable by 
imprisonment, to a maximum of five years.  I agree with that, but I 
think minimum sentencing should be put into the legislation.  I 
know that historically in our courtrooms the minimum sentences 
come out of those kinds of convictions. I would not like to see 
legislation like this go to waste. If such a situation does 
occur, and it does occur, as my colleagues across the way said, 
it should not go to waste on a conditional sentence, on a 
suspended sentence or on a one year sentence.  I would suggest to 
the government that it put a minimum in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will adjust employee licensing requirements in 
order to better reflect appropriate firearms safety training for 
employees who handle restricted and prohibited firearms as 
opposed to non-restricted firearms.  I think that is good as 
well.  I do not think there would be much argument with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who likes the bill?  It would be difficult to find any pet owner 
who would disagree with it.  The SPCA and organizations like that 
have been long awaiting such legislation. I am sure the police 
will be happy.  Cruelty to animals should have been a crime some 
time ago.  It is good to bring in this legislation on the eve of 
an election, but I doubt very much if it will receive royal assent 
before the election.  Let us just hope that when the government 
brings in a useful bill like this we go all the way with it 
before an election takes place.  The police will get more 
protection, which they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does not like the bill and why?  It is the job of the 
official opposition to find out who does not like the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groups that have approached us and said they do not 
like this bill include:  Fur Institute of Canada, the 
Canadian Outdoor Heritage Alliance, Ontario Federation of Anglers 
and Hunters, Western Stock Growers Association, Ontario Farm 
Animal Council and Canadian Property Rights Research 
Institute.  Why do they not like the bill?  My colleague across 
the way has alluded to the fact that some groups are unhappy.  I 
think that is the case in this situation, where we have to 
register wider unhappiness, go to committee and 
give these groups some assurance that they will 
be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the parliamentary secretary did say “Yes, they are 
protected.  There have never been any problems before so there 
will not be any problems in the future”, he has already said 
that there are some misunderstandings about the bill.  I know 
from past and personal experience that when this gets into a 
courtroom the legal industry will have a field day with it unless 
it is made clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the concerns.  The genesis of the changes to the 
cruelty to animals legislation is to no longer treat cruelty to 
animals as a property crime.  The new provision would move 
cruelty to animals to part V of the criminal code under sexual 
offences, which would be renamed sexual offences, public morals, 
disorderly conduct and cruelty to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Animal cruelty provisions are currently contained in sections 444 
to 446 of part XI of the criminal code.  This section of the 
criminal code protects a person from being convicted of an 
offence if he acted with legal justification of excuse, colour or 
right.  Agricultural groups, anglers' and hunters' groups, and the 
Fur Council of Canada want cruelty to animals to remain in 
sections 444 to 446.  They fear that by moving the cruelty section 
to sexual offences it will make it easier for them to be 
prosecuted. They argue that those who lawfully and legitimately 
harvest animals for business will not be protected if the cruelty 
section is changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am no expert on that aspect of the criminal code and, 
thankfully, I am not a lawyer, but as a layperson in the House of 
Commons and as opposition justice critic, I know that when those 
issues go before the courts it will one day be the case of an 
individual harvesting animals who will say “I told you so way 
back when. Why did you not make it clear?” Therefore, we will be 
moving an amendment at committee stage to have animal cruelty 
provisions maintained in sections 444 to 446 or to make the 
necessary changes to section 182(1) to comply with the concerns 
of farmers, hunters, agricultural groups, the fur trade and 
others who harvest animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary to take note of that. I 
would appreciate the parliamentary secretary getting back to us 
to determine whether or not he feels the scenario I have laid out 
in the House of Commons is applicable and accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point on the cruelty to animals section of Bill C-17 
that causes concern is the amendment to the bill that proposes to 
take out the words wilful and wilfully as a defence if a 
person is charged. 
This would make prosecution easier but not proper in many 
instances where one is involved in the legitimate slaughter of 
animals or the raising of animals for legitimate use or 
harvesting.  If the words wilful and wilfully are 
removed, this would leave the requisite of criminal intent for 
animal cruelty undefined and thus would leave legitimate animal 
harvesters in jeopardy.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I almost sound like a lawyer.  Heaven forbid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be moving an amendment at committee stage to ensure 
legitimate individuals involved in animal operations are not 
unduly subject to criminal intent.  In all seriousness I would 
suggest again to the parliamentary secretary that the issue be 
looked at, because unless we are satisfied that this issue is not 
a legitimate concern, and at this point we are not, we will not 
be moving ahead with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third part of the bill that causes legitimate animal 
operations concern is the amendment which proposes that criminal 
intent for animal cruelty can be simply civil negligence. 
Agricultural groups would like to see the terms wilful 
neglect or marked departure from the exercise of reasonable 
care maintained, not something like civil negligence, which 
could be used to prosecute farmers trying to carry out normal 
farming operations and cattle management, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will hear more today about that aspect from 
people who are farmers. They can put much more practical 
conversation into the bill because they live with these concerns 
day in and day out.  These are not concerns of just one or two 
farmers; these are concerns of farmers within associations and 
of the associations themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will introduce an amendment at committee stage to ensure 
there is recognition of the need to protect legitimate farm 
operators from prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth part of Bill C-17 is of concern.  Under what is 
called animal care provisions, the bill proposes convictions when 
there is any pain, suffering or injury to an animal.  Currently 
the criminal code prohibits unnecessary pain.  It is only common 
sense that removing the word unnecessary could open up a 
whole area for conviction.  As some have pointed out, putting a 
worm on a hook could become a problem for fishermen.  This is 
unrealistic and too open to interpretation to prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has only to look at one's own interpretation of what is 
realistic and unrealistic.  When we talk about unnecessary pain, 
animals cannot really identify unnecessary pain. That is 
determined by individual people.  The concern, and rightfully so, 
of these groups is whether or not their operations will be 
questioned by many others about what is unnecessary pain. Will it 
next be that farmers, hunters and anglers are in courtrooms 
defending themselves, at very large expense, on the question of 
unnecessary pain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee we will move an amendment to re-establish the word 
unnecessary to protect anglers and others who are conducting 
a sporting activity.  I know the government will want to avoid 
this by saying “Do not worry, trust us, this has never happened 
before”.  However, when the government opens up a new bill for 
amending legislation, the slate is basically clean and we start 
off at a new day. 
When such words as unnecessary pain are removed or 
reintroduced, the question comes up in the courtroom.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth area of concern is the provision in Bill C-17 which 
states that anyone who kills an animal or, being the owner, 
permits an animal to be killed brutally or viciously, regardless 
of whether the animal dies immediately, is guilty of a criminal 
offence.  This part is very subjective and is open to too much 
latitude.  This part is ambiguous and must be defined more 
clearly.  We will move an amendment in committee to remove any 
ambiguity in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this in any way, shape or form is paranoia on 
behalf of any group.  These are legitimate concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I opened with is the difficulties and complexities 
with omnibus bills.  There are many things in the bill we 
support, but because of the ambiguity and the size of the bill, 
rather than us right up front saying great job, good job, there 
are some complexities in the bill that some groups are concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the same thing as my colleague the parliamentary 
secretary asked, that all members of the House work together in 
committee to make sure that these concerns are taken care of. 
Let us not leave it to the courtrooms of our country.  It has 
never been an acceptable way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There you have it, Mr. Speaker, some suggestions and comments, 
some ideas on legislation that goes a long way in my mind to 
helping with a serious problem in any country, and that is 
cruelty to animals, and with another problem, that of protecting our 
police.  One area that has to be looked after is the area of insecurities 
and concerns of those who feel this legislation may draw 
them into a nightmare in the courtroom.  I am sure the government 
does not want that.  I am sure my colleagues want 
reassurance that it will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one way I would like to say to the government, not a bad job 
after seven years in office.  It is not a bad job considering 
that an election will probably be called before this bill gets 
royal assent.  Perhaps we can bring this bill in after the 
election without the complexities the government has put into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On two fronts of the bill I commend the government.  However, I 
do insist that the insecurities of those who have legitimate 
concerns be dealt with in committee.  There will be a very tight 
scrutiny of the bill there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the 
outset I ask for the consent of the House to split my time with 
the hon. member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent for 
the hon. member to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address 
Bill C-17.  The bill amends the criminal code with respect to 
cruelty to animals, disarming a peace officer and other 
amendments and makes technical amendments to the Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would say generally that the NDP is opposed to 
omnibus legislation.  The matters contained in the bill have been 
lumped together and have very little in common. They deserve to 
be dealt with as separate pieces of legislation. Having said 
that, 
however, the bill deals with very important issues and we will be 
supporting the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been indicated, the bill amends the criminal code by 
consolidating animal cruelty offences into one section and 
introducing new offences for brutally or viciously killing an 
animal or abandoning one.  It creates an offence for disarming or 
attempting to disarm a peace officer.  It also makes a number of 
technical amendments.  The bill also amends the Firearms Act by 
expanding the class of prohibited handguns that are grandfathered 
and modifying the employee licensing requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to dwell upon a couple of very important points in the 
bill.  I will leave some of the other points to my hon. 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cruelty to animals is certainly a topic of concern for a lot of 
people.  The changes to the criminal code dealing with cruelty to 
animals stem from a public outcry over a large number of highly 
publicized cases involving animal abuse over the past few years. 
The hon. member opposite mentioned a number of these incidents in 
alarming detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, animal welfare groups, humane societies and the 
public have been calling for tougher measures to protect animals 
and punish abusers.  The justice department issued a discussion 
paper entitled “Crimes Against Animals” in 1998 and received 
thousands of responses from the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some might view cruelty to animal provisions as a low 
priority, we are fully aware that studies have shown an alarming 
connection between animal abuse and other forms of serious 
violent offences, in particular domestic violence.  A significant 
percentage of those who are violent toward animals later 
perpetuate violence against people.  It does not take a lot of 
in-depth knowledge to understand why that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see a lack of appreciation for life, no matter what the 
level of that life may be, it certainly has an impact upon 
society.  Children who are used to, who become used to, or who 
are not admonished for cruelty to animals will certainly grow up 
with an attitude that it does not matter if they hurt a living 
entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to see in our world today a lot of desensitizing as to 
how we relate to fellow human beings.  We see so much violence on 
television.  We watch some of the TV programs. It is amazing the 
degree of violence we can see being perpetuated through TV, 
through movies, and even now through a lot of the video games 
that children play.  There are games played where people shoot, 
kill or harm individuals.  One may say it is just a game, but I 
think it is slowly creating an atmosphere where children become 
insensitive to harming one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what is happening in wartorn countries around the world. 
We see situations such as Sierra Leone, where children's arms 
and legs are amputated.  I often ask myself how one human being 
can be so cruel to another human being.  I am afraid that people 
who harm animals and who are insensitive to the pain that animals 
feel are capable of doing the same thing to fellow human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that the issue be addressed.  The proposed 
amendments on animal cruelty will raise the maximum penalty for 
intentional cruelty to five years in prison and will not set 
limits on fines.  It is important to have a serious penalty for 
such an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will give judges the authority to order anyone convicted of 
cruelty to animals to pay restitution such as veterinary bills 
and shelter costs to the animal welfare organization that cared 
for the animal.  It will prohibit anyone convicted of cruelty to 
animals from owning an animal for however long the judge 
considers appropriate.  There are some very serious penalties for 
a very serious offence. 
Another very important aspect of the legislation that merits some 
comment is the disarming of a police officer.  We know that the 
job of a police officer is a very important one.  It is a job 
that a lot of people would not want, yet we look for our 
police officers when we need them.  These people often put their 
lives on the line in the course of duty.  A police officer may 
have to stop a car on a busy highway.  When the officer moves up 
to the car he or she may end up facing death because the driver 
has a firearm and is out to harm them.  There are many 
situations of domestic violence where police walk into a 
situation and their lives are literally put at risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation concerning the disarming of a police officer is 
very important and significant to the well-being of our police 
officers.  It will create a new offence for disarming or 
attempting to disarm a police officer and will set the maximum 
penalty for that at five years imprisonment.  This is intended to 
highlight the seriousness of the offence and is supported by many 
policing organizations across the country, including the Canadian 
Police Association, which lobbied strenuously for this particular 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports this provision.  We feel it is important to 
support those who put their lives on the line for society, 
including police officers, firefighters and people in our armed 
services.  These people are not appreciated in the way they 
should be and this legislation goes one step in moving toward the 
proper appreciation for this kind of function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to stand and support the legislation and the 
underlying principles that are involved in the kinds of amendments 
that have been proposed. Those principles underscore our 
respect for life and for living entities, whether they be animals 
or human beings.  The respect for the role of the police officer 
is necessary if we are going to make this the kind of society in 
which we want to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When police officers perform their duties, their side arm is a 
very important tool.  It is not necessarily one that they would 
use on every occasion, but it is something that they have been 
trained to respect and have been given proper instructions on how 
to use it.  It is a necessary part of their equipment in law 
enforcement.  When someone attempts to disarm a police officer, 
it puts them at a very serious disadvantage.  They cannot deal 
properly with the situation they are faced with because they are 
busy worrying about trying to keep that firearm out of the hands 
of someone who is probably going to use it to the disadvantage of 
the police officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles are very important.  The NDP stands in support 
of this legislation and urges all hon. members in the House give 
their support to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague for Halifax West made a point of addressing specific 
areas of the bill.  When we discussed how to proceed with 
bringing forward our thoughts and concerns on the bill, it was 
interesting to note that we had to look for a way to tie all of 
the different aspects of the bill together.  One of the things 
that has been stated by many members is the concern about all of 
the different issues that have been brought together in this one 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For parliamentarians and Canadians who want to address an issue, 
who want to see where it is and what legislation is there, it is 
much easier to go to a bill or legislation that applies 
specifically to the issue.  This bill combines an act to amend 
the criminal code, cruelty to animals, disarming a police officer 
and technical amendments to the Firearms Act.  This reminds me of 
the old <I>Sesame Street</I> rhyme “Which of these things belongs 
together, which one is not the same”.  I tried to see how we 
tied them all together.  I guess we can in the fact that they 
deal with the Firearms Act.  We talk about disarming a 
police officer, and we might use a firearm to shoot the animal. 
This is the point we are at with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has failed to be open with Canadians, 
simply by mushing a lot of things together when each of these 
areas warrants discussion in its own right.  Disarming of a 
police officer certainly warrants legislation which specifically 
deals with that area, to make sure that it gets dealt with 
properly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question the amendments to the Firearms Act, because of 
all the other things that have happened out there and the bad 
feelings over the firearms certification and registration 
program, give an uncomfortable feeling to the people who were 
not totally satisfied with that piece of legislation.  Concerning 
the issue of cruelty to animals, there is concern that this 
legislation is going to impact on areas that it is not intended 
to.  I hope that is clarified when it goes to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it goes to committee, it is important that the committee 
and this House ensure that Canadians have the opportunity to be 
involved in the discussion that happens.  If that means going into 
areas of the country where there is a major concern about the 
issues we are dealing with in the bill, then we have to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was previously mentioned that there is concern that the bill 
will apply to areas of legitimate hunting and trapping practices. 
Hunters, trappers and those in the fur trading industry are 
concerned.  They are in an area that has been targeted for years 
by animal rights protesters.  There is concern that this bill 
will have an underlying motive of attacking their livelihood.  They need to 
know for sure that such is not the case.  To do that 
means allowing them to have a say at committee.  If 
that is not the intent of the bill they need to have that concern 
alleviated.  If it is the intent of the bill, then it needs to 
come out in an upfront manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding it is not the intent of the bill at this 
point.  When it goes to committee, as I said, we will weed things 
out to find out exactly where it is at.  However, it is important 
that Canadians and the ones affected specifically by this bill 
get the opportunity to have their say and have their fears 
alleviated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the bill can leave no misunderstanding as to its 
intention because it has a grave impact on the fur industry, on 
the hunters and trappers and also on the farming industry. 
Although we know that the practices are done in the most humane 
way possible, there are always those out there who do not believe 
that animals should be killed in any way, shape or form for food 
or whatever other uses there may be.  If there is any risk that 
their livelihood is going to be threatened, they need to be able 
to have a say in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area—because this is mushed together—that is 
extremely important to comment on. My colleague mentioned it. 
I know there are small changes taking place under sexual 
offences, public morals and disorderly conduct and small changes 
that define the terms child and illegitimate child.  Once again, 
would it not have been more forthright to have these listed 
separately so that they would be recognized? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it disrespectful in all areas of this bill to mush 
everything together.  I believe when we spend time in this 
House we want to be forthright with Canadians, we want to make 
sure things are clear and we want Canadians to understand the law 
and respect it.  By introducing omnibus bills like this Canadians 
have less and less respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the changes to the heading of Part V of the criminal code 
which are being replaced by the following and by having all of 
these sections fall underneath it is not representing the 
legislation as it truly is and is misleading to Canadians.  The 
one thing that we can surely do is be clear with our legislation 
and be clear with the laws so that Canadians can respect the 
justice and the laws in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and take part in this debate on 
behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party.  I must say I have 
listened intently to all speakers on this bill.  It has been a 
useful exercise to hear the various perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would find almost to a person that the legislation 
will receive a great deal of support.  However, one overriding 
issue in the government's decision to bring in this legislation 
is the fashion in which it has chosen to do so.  As the previous 
speaker, my colleague from the New Democratic Party, indicated, 
this is really a cross-threaded bill.  It is a bill that mixes 
issues that really do not belong together.  Not to diminish at 
all the importance of this, I cite, as an example, that the only 
way in my mind that I can tie this bill together would be to 
suggest that somehow a person wrestled an unlicensed gun away 
from a police officer and used it to dispose of an animal in a 
cruel fashion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues do not fit together in any semblance.  Therefore, 
the bill should be divided and put into a more proper 
perspective, one Canadians would understand and appreciate in a 
more real way.  In my submission it diminishes the importance of 
these individual issues to try to force them together and to 
force Canadians and parliamentarians to contemplate them at the 
same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consolidation of the current criminal code with respect to 
the cruelty to animals provisions, which are put in place by 
the bill, are certainly those that are needed.  They are needed 
to modernize the current law as it pertains to this aspect of 
justice.  It is something that has emotional and visceral 
reactions from those in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there are concerns, which have been touched upon, 
that the bill might go too far in its definition of cruelty.  I 
hope to touch on those issues with respect to a balance and the 
counter-arguments that have been brought forward by those in the 
hunting, fishing, angling and farming vocations.  It may go too 
far in the responsibility that is attached, for example, to 
property owners.  However, that is not to say that these issues 
cannot be addressed and ironed out at the committee, which is the 
proper and just fashion in which to do so.  I say that, somewhat tongue in 
cheek, on the understanding that the committee will be 
given an opportunity to really debate and to put forward reasonable 
amendments that the government will be amenable to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that has not been the case most recently.  We saw an 
example of a bill, perhaps the most important bill in this 
session, being jammed through the committee without any 
discussion whatsoever or without any opportunity by opposition 
members to bring forward amendments.  It will leave this place on 
a rocket.  It will be pushed through with closure.  While the 
government House leader used to stand on his desk and rail like a 
banshee against the prior government, he is now using these same 
tools, which were so offensive to him when he was in opposition, 
to do the same thing, only worse.  The only real examination of 
the youth criminal justice bill will occur in the other place. 
It is encouraging to see that members of the reform alliance and 
the Bloc are so appreciative of the work that will be done in the 
other place and I look forward to their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning our attention to Bill C-17, the amendments to the 
criminal code will remove the reference to “illegitimate child” and 
ensure that the evidentiary protection afforded to other victims 
who testify at trials is also provided by some of the changes. 
Amendments with respect to persons with disabilities who have 
been victims of sexual exploitation are very important and 
practical changes.  The Conservative Party is entirely supportive 
of these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Firearms Act, the expansion of the class of 
recently prohibited handguns that are grandfathered and the changes 
to clarify the licensing requirements of employees in the firearms 
business are practical changes that are necessary and that 
arguably should have been in place in the first instance.  Again, 
I hearken back to my earlier comments on what that has to do with 
cruelty to animals.  What does it have to do with respect to 
changes to definitions in the criminal code?  There is real 
confusion in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An omnibus bill is a hybrid that brings in several aspects of 
legislation that have no tie-in.  What it does, in effect, is 
force divisions among all parties with respect to their 
ability to support certain issues, because there is no relation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cruelty to animals aspect is perhaps what is most prevalent 
and most controversial about the legislation.  The Department of 
Justice reviewed provisions in 1998, and a consultation paper 
entitled “Crimes Against Animals” was distributed to allow 
groups and individuals to suggest modifications that would be 
required to deal effectively with cruelty to animals.  No one in 
his or her right mind would oppose or in any way try to delay 
provisions that would protect harmless animals, in most 
instances, animals that are either in the wild or in captivity. 
These provisions in essence bring about a greater recognition, 
through the criminal code by sanctions, that this is something 
that society will not tolerate. 
This is an action that is abhorred and is certainly not 
acceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, as was alluded to, something that changes the attitudes 
with respect to animals being deemed as property. The reasoning 
is of course that it is now recognized as a common symptom of a 
deeper mental illness.  Individuals who involve themselves in 
cruelty to animals, as hon. members know, very often go on to 
involve themselves in other types of crime perpetrated against 
humans and property.  It is seen as an escalation when a young 
person who is abusive to animals later goes on to commit 
crimes against other children and adults. There is an escalation 
of criminal behaviour when people start by abusing animals. There 
is mounting scientific evidence that verifies this link between 
animal abuse and, often, domestic violence and violence against 
other humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public, the police and many interest groups have been 
calling for more effective federal legislation and federal law to 
deal with cases of animal abuse.  There are numerous examples, 
too numerous to cite and often too heinous in their description, 
that verify and justify a change in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently in cases such as we have seen, under the old 
provisions an offender could receive only six months in jail or a 
$2,000 fine.  I would suggest that this is an inadequate response 
given the gravity and sometimes the symptoms and specific facts 
of a case.  The old provisions did not truly express denunciation 
of and deterrence for those involving themselves with cruelty to 
animals.  There was also a provision to have a ban on the 
ownership and possession of certain animals.  That as well could 
be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country we know there are still a lot of instances of 
animal fighting taking place.  There are instances of animals 
such as racehorses and greyhounds used for racing being treated 
poorly in their confines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as a person who has followed criminal law, you well 
know that having legislation here sends an important message that 
raising the ceiling of the reaction of the criminal justice 
system will in fact change the attitude.  It expresses the 
government's and the public's non-acceptance of cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has explicitly linked animal abuse to 
rape and to child abuse, citing U.S. studies which pointed out 
that those who torture animals are more likely to involve 
themselves in similar cruel activities.  I agree with the 
minister.  There is mounting evidence that this type of mindset 
has to be disavowed.  Serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, who 
brutally dismembered humans and even practised cannibalism, 
abused animals as a child, so again there is some suggestion that 
this type of mindset develops very early.  Increased sentences 
with an increased response from the criminal justice system is 
something that the Progressive Conservative Party would support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentencing changes, depending on the charge, are anywhere 
from two years' imprisonment to a maximum of five years when the 
crown proceeds by indictment, or six to eighteen months or a fine 
of not more than $2,000 when it is a summary charge.  This is 
certainly more representative of a deterrent type of response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further changes also involve payment of additional costs 
incurred for the care and convalescence of an animal.  Payment 
would be made to any individual or organization that cared for 
the animal and would include such things as veterinarian's bills 
and shelter.  Again, this is a direct correlation between the 
harm done and the person who perpetrated the offence.  It brings 
about greater accountability and greater direct responsibility 
and, I would suggest, is more demonstrative of condemning the 
action.  It gives the person a greater understanding of the harm 
done.  The same principle is behind restorative 
justice. It is a more personal connection between the offender 
and the unlawful act.  These are positive steps, which our party 
supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to study the bill closely at committee so that 
we do not in some instances potentially criminalize farmers, 
hunters, trappers or fishermen engaged in their normal way of 
life.  Presently the bill is loosely worded in some of the 
provisions. Some of the amendments that will be required would 
tighten this up and would make it more operable in a practical 
sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation farmers feel that they could be 
prosecuted for common practices such as branding or dehorning of 
cattle.  Castration of cattle would be another element we will 
have to discuss at the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some anglers are convinced that fishermen could be charged with 
regard to tactics including baiting.  This proposed legislation 
would surely be a real impediment to fishermen who need to bait 
hooks in order to catch fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed worry that Bill C-17 
might interfere with Jewish ritual slaughter methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biomedical researchers are worried that their work might also 
lead to criminal prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are instances that we have to turn our minds to.  That 
discussion should properly take place at the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the groups have requested that the language in the 
legislation be clarified, particularly with interpretations of 
phrases such as these I am quoting from the bill:  “unnecessary 
pain, suffering or injury” and “brutally or viciously” killing 
an animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want some protection from other practices.  I am quoting 
some examples from the correspondence that I received, such as: 
identification, medical treatment, spaying or neutering; 
provision of food or other animal products; hunting, trapping, 
fishing and other sporting activities conducted in accordance 
with the lawful rules relating to them; pest, predator or disease 
control; protection of persons or property; scientific research 
unless the risk of injury or serious physical pain is 
disproportionate to the benefit expected from the research; and 
finally, training and disciplining of an animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There certainly is a great deal to contemplate when we are 
considering this legislation.  Poisoning of an animal or using a 
mousetrap, potentially, not to put too fine a point on it, is 
something we have to consider when putting provisions into a 
criminal code that could cause serious ramifications for an 
individual.  It is the same sort of thing as creating any kind of 
new offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to the point with respect to changes to the 
Firearms Act.  We know now that as of December 1 law-abiding 
citizens who have properly licensed themselves, who have properly 
licensed handguns in the past, who have been through training 
sessions and who have done everything in accordance with the law, 
would become criminals simply not by licensing a long gun.  We 
have to be very careful when we go down the path of criminalizing 
ordinary citizens.  That is without getting into all the other 
ludicrous aspects of this long gun registry, which is costing 
hundreds of millions of dollars and will not affect dangerous 
crime at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing legislation touches as well on some traditional 
practices of hunting, fishing and farming.  Yet they do not fit 
into the category of mean-spirited violence.  It is imperative 
that animal cruelty legislation be clearly designed to target 
only those who engage in brutal practices against animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister has been contemplating an amendment that 
would exempt farmers, hunters and animal researchers from the 
bill.  A change is certainly needed to provide legal security for 
lawful practices of animal related professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must consider the genuine need for clarity and progressive 
legislation in this area.  It is careless legislation that 
endangers individuals and that is something that I think most 
Canadians find very disheartening.  It is obvious that little 
consideration was given to the broad effect of this bill and the 
impact it may have on certain professions.  Discouraging as well 
is the lack of foresight, in that this bill was brought forward 
in an omnibus fashion and it deals with many other issues that 
confuse these important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elements of the bill that touch upon disarming of a police 
officer have also been given a fair bit of discussion and 
contemplation.  I would suggest that this is one aspect that is 
very straightforward.  It is one that has the enthusiastic and 
overriding support of police across the country and of many 
groups.  I know that Grant Obst, the president of the Canadian 
Police Association, Dave Griffen, the executive director, and 
supporters of the association, who were here on the Hill this 
past weekend participating in the police memorial service, are 
very enthused that the government has chosen to bring this 
legislation forward.  It is something they have lobbied for. 
It is something that they feel will have an immediate impact.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that it is very important to give 
specific recognition in the criminal code with regard to a person 
in an agitated state trying to take a weapon from a police 
officer.  Any time there is a firearm or a weapon involved there 
is the imminent chance of bodily harm; there is the imminent 
chance that a person could lose his or her life.  If a person chooses 
to try to disarm a police officer, for whatever reason, there is 
grave danger afoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that oftentimes a police officer using a weapon is doing 
so in the gravest circumstances, in order to try to de-escalate 
or control a situation.  There is grave danger and harm when a 
person tries to interfere with a police officer, either by taking 
his weapon or by interfering in the use of a weapon by a police 
officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is very supportive of this 
particular legislation.  It is something that we feel is 
necessary to send a strong message to the public and a strong 
message to those who would engage in that type of serious, 
dangerous conduct.  Police officers themselves, I think, will 
receive some comfort in knowing that it is a bill that will give 
specific recognition to that offence in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If officers are deprived of their weapons or are unable to carry 
out arrests effectively, it very much interferes with their 
important work.  This new section does define weapon for the 
purposes of subsection (1) as “any thing that is designed to be 
used to cause injury or death to, or to temporarily incapacitate, 
a person”, and would include such things as firearms, obviously, 
and pepper spray and batons.  It is deemed a hybrid offence.  It 
has a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and the crown of 
course can elect to proceed by indictment or by summary 
conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I alluded to, the president of the Canadian Police 
Association, Grant Obst, and his organization initiated this 
process and have been leading the proposed movement to bring 
about this specific offence.  They “welcome the introduction of 
this new law and encourage its speedy passage by parliament”. 
Those are very supportive sentiments.  Those sentiments are 
shared by the Progressive Conservative Party.  We will be 
supporting this aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government could certainly do more for police, 
particularly in the areas of funding, speedy passage of 
legislation as it pertains to criminal gangs and organizations, 
and the seizing of stolen property, I would suggest that this is 
an important, practical response to a need that exists, a 
response to a void that exists in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other amendments that I spoke of earlier with respect 
to the definition of child.  Removing the negative and 
unnecessary connotations that stem from the term illegitimate 
child is something that I think is certainly politically 
correct but it is also something that is important to those 
individuals born out of wedlock who have carried this unfortunate 
moniker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to sexual exploitation of persons with a disability, 
adding this to the criminal code is a specific recognition in 
language.  Again, it is something that I feel is important not 
only to the legal community but to those who for reasons not 
brought about by themselves find themselves deemed persons with 
disabilities who are in the court system and are faced with these 
types of designations.  I feel that victims of sexual 
exploitation will receive and should receive the same evidentiary 
protections that are afforded to others.  Again, this is a very 
practical and common sense amendment that takes place in the 
criminal code, one we are completely supportive of and embrace in 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technical amendments for the firearms are straightforward. 
They deal with licensing requirements.  I think the employees and 
businesses that deal with these regulated items are supportive of 
this for the most part.  It is legislation that should have and 
could have been included in the original bill, as unpopular as 
that bill was.  This aspect was left out.  For employees who 
handle or could handle firearms or prohibited or restricted 
weapons or prohibited devices of any kind, it brings about, in 
the course of duty, requirements for being authorized and 
licensed with respect to restricted weapons.  These proposed 
amendments set out similar licensing requirements that pertain to 
others who handle firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would suggest that although it is necessary, it is 
certainly an indication that the government was somewhat 
negligent in its initial drafting and that it is backpedalling on 
other aspects of the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen now that the government is extending the dates with 
respect to the fees associated with licensing.  The legislation 
is something that will continue to be contentious and could well 
wind up as an election issue in the coming days or weeks when the 
Prime Minister and his spouse decide to pull the plug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall we are supportive of most aspects of the legislation 
singularly.  However, we are forced to deal with them jointly in 
the legislation because of the manner in which it has been 
brought forward.  As I have indicated in my remarks, there are 
very positive and very practical elements to all of this.  It is 
just unfortunate that the government has chosen to bring about 
legislation in this way and to do so in such a fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might also question the priority given to the bill.  This is 
not to diminish the importance of any element of the legislation, 
but we also have important legislation that would offer tax 
relief and legislation aimed at bringing about or trying to 
fulfil a promise the government made seven and a half years ago 
to redraft and rework the youth criminal justice act.  That 
simply has not come about because the government does not like to 
compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not like to work with the opposition even 
when there are reasonable requests and reasonable efforts made to 
improve government bills, or ideas that originate on the 
opposition side as we have seen in many instances.  The 
government's response is usually not to embrace those ideas but 
to reject them in the first instance, and then in a very Janus 
faced fashion turn around and call them its own.  We have seen 
that happen on many occasions.  That is the Janus-like persona of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it on free trade.  We have seen it on the GST, 
privatization, helicopters, and the Pearson airport.  The 
government said one thing in opposition.  Then, lo and behold, 
when it was rewarded by the electorate for making these 
statements it crossed the floor, formed the government and 
reversed itself, swallowed itself whole and condemned the very 
ideas it purported to support when in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something for contemplation by the electorate, something 
that no doubt will be discussed and debated during the course of 
a campaign.  Although I do not hear much hue and cry from the 
opposition to rush headlong to the polls, it is quite obvious 
that the Prime Minister feels it is to his optimum advantage at 
this time.  Therefore, with his persona, he is very quick to use 
that advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will have to assess whether it was necessary.  They 
will have to assess the timing of it.  They will also want to 
assess his record.  They will want to assess what accomplishments 
he can point to in his government's mandate in the short time it 
has been here, just over three years since the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has provided the impetus for Canadians to hear from 
members of the opposition what they think of the legislation. 
Also it is an opportunity to talk generally about the government, 
its mandate, its priorities, and to assess whether those 
priorities are in line with those of Canadians who are suffering 
at this time because of problems with health care and in the 
education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche talks often about 
student debt, individuals with seasonal employment situations who 
are struggling to get by and to feed their families, and 
individuals across the country who find themselves mired in the 
justice system because the wheels of justice turn so slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there will be more time on other occasions to discuss 
these greater issues, but at this time the Progressive 
Conservative Party looks forward to dealing with the bill at 
committee level and dealing with the other issues in a more 
comprehensive fashion at some time in the near future.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-17, an act to amend 
the criminal code regarding cruelty to animals, disarming a peace 
officer and other amendments, and technical amendments to the 
Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a number of people in various parties talk about 
this omnibus bill.  We have had this before.  The government will 
introduce a bill with some good points, some points that require 
discussion, and some points that we do not agree with. 
Then people have difficulty understanding what is the issue since 
there is such a grab bag of different subjects.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill disarming a police officer is lumped in with 
cruelty to animals.  It would be far easier if we could get a 
very straightforward bill dealing with one issue.  We could then 
discuss it, deal with it and get it through the House.  When it 
is such an omnibus bill containing a grab bag of different issues 
it is extremely difficult because there are some good and bad 
points and it is either yea or nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the Firearms Act refinements.  We agree with the 
disarming of police officers issue.  They are good points.  The 
government should be commended for putting them in the bill. 
These are issues that people have been crying for for years to be 
dealt with.  Police officers particularly have been wanting the 
legislation in place.  I agree with it.  However, by lumping 
cruelty to animals into the bill the waters get muddy because 
there are no clear definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope we can get the bill into committee where we can discuss 
it.  Most of us agree that cruelty to animals is simply not on. 
We have read the stories of the puppy mills.  We have heard of 50 
or 100 cats being in one house.  Obviously we disagree with that. 
I have seen horses and cows in some barns where they are slowly 
growing up to the roof because the manure gets two and three feet 
high and people do not clean the barns.  We clearly do not want 
to put up with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty occurs when it gets into ordinary agriculture 
practices like branding, dehorning and hunting.  The definitions 
in the bill have to be laid out specifically for hunters and 
fishermen.  What about aquaculture?  The legislation is so loose 
that we need to step forward in committee to bring forth some 
clear and solid definitions.  We need some tight legislation that 
lays it all out.  Let me take trapping, for example.  Leghold 
traps were banned.  We have humane trapping.  Perhaps that is in 
the bill; perhaps it is not.  We need to have that cleared up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people abuse animals is it the start of a chain of events? 
Do they start by kicking a dog?  Five years later are they 
kicking a person?  Fifteen years later are they kicking their 
wives?  Psychologists say this progression exists.  We need to 
look at it.  If cruelty to animals is the beginning of a long 
chain of events, it has to be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked many times about wording in legislation.  Often 
the government will leave it very loose.  This is extremely 
dangerous because we are leaving our laws open to interpretation 
by the courts.  We have an option as parliamentarians.  We can 
leave it loose to be interpreted by the courts, or we can tighten 
it up and say what we mean.  In that way we as the elected people 
in the House would say the way it should be.  We are the elected 
officials.  We should deal with the legislation, make it concise 
and make it tight so there is not a lot of room for the judicial 
system and it knows exactly what parliament means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we need.  The bill is fuzzy in terms of 
agriculture.  What is abuse?  What is cruelty?  What is a regular 
practice?  Unless it is clearly defined we will leave it up to 
the courts again.

push it off to the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we agree with a number of parts of the bill such as 
the firearms aspects, but there are a number of concerns in the 
cruelty to animals area we wish to discuss.  We would like to get 
the bill into committee, call witnesses, hear from the experts, 
see how tight is the legislation, and deal with it at that time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague speak about the cruelty to 
animals aspect of the legislation.  Certainly I agree with his 
assessment that those who inflict cruelty on innocent, defenceless 
animals should be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am wondering about the definition of what causes pain 
and suffering.  Would my colleague like to comment on the 
concern I hear from people in the agricultural community I 
represent that common practices with livestock, such as dehorning 
and castration of bulls and branding for identification, may be 
construed as cruelty to a defenceless animal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to carry out these operations on farm animals, we have 
to restrain them in such a way that the operation can be done and 
the brand is readable.  In the part of the country I come from 
the hot iron brand is still very much a legal way of identifying 
our livestock.  It is the one permanent method that works.   Ear 
tags and such things are ways of identifying cattle as well, but 
even the application of an ear tag on an animal may be construed 
as cruelty to animals under the bill.  I am extremely concerned 
about that and would like to voice the concerns of constituents 
that have talked with me in this regard.  Would my colleague like 
to comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague has had 
representation from people in his riding.  I suspect most members 
in the House have heard the same representations as well as 
different concerns about different aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague made an excellent point.  This matter has to be 
dealt with in committee.  We need to hear from the agricultural 
groups.  Different representations need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in the past?  Let us look at the Inuit.  Let us 
look at what we have done to their livelihood by the change in 
the fur industry.  It changed a whole way of life.  If we act in 
a knee-jerk fashion in terms of this legislation, if we act 
without knowing the full impact of the legislation, we can change 
the lives of our agriculture people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague that we have to get the experts and 
all worker groups together.  If a common practice for farmers 
sounds nice to people living in Toronto or Vancouver, we may want 
to have a second look at it since people in the cities tend not 
to understand what goes on in rural areas.  A knee-jerk reaction 
may end up doing great harm to the hunting, farming, trapping and 
fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress more that the bill has to go to committee to 
be well analyzed.  Experts will appear before the committee to 
describe the ramifications of the different parts of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to stand in the House of Commons to speak to Bill 
C-17.  I echo some of the comments made by previous speakers who 
decry the system of having an omnibus bill that covers a whole 
bunch of things.  It always reminds me of being offered a bowl of 
pudding that has a little gravel in it.  It is nice eating the 
pudding, but when one chews on a piece of gravel it hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things in Bill C-17 that quite obviously 
need substantial change, substantial improvement.  In the end, as 
is the process in this parliament and by this Liberal government, 
we will have the task of voting yes or no on a bill containing a 
number of things.  It will then be thrown back at us in a very 
negative way, because we voted against the bill for a completely 
different reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an election coming up, one cannot help but think the worst 
twist will be put on some of the things people do in the House in 
order to try to discredit them.  That is very unfortunate.  The 
Canadian public, the people who vote for us, should certainly 
have the right to know about these issues and should know our 
stand on them.  We should not have accusations thrown at us.  If 
I vote against the bill for such-and-such a reason, it is not 
fair of my critics to turn around and say “Well, here is a 
person who voted against this” and then name one of the really 
good things in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I do not think one should normally be opposed to 
provisions that prevent a peace officer from having his firearm 
taken from him or her.  If, in doing his or her job in 
maintaining the peace, a policeman or policewoman gets into a 
scuffle with and is disarmed by an individual who is committing 
an offensive act, the particular individual should be eligible 
for a charge of disarming a police officer.  Yet if I vote 
against the bill because of other offensive clauses then in the 
next election campaign probably one of my critics will say the 
RCMP should not vote for those guys because they do not support 
their keeping their firearms.  That really clouds the issue and 
unfortunately does not serve the Canadian public well.  Nor does 
it serve parliament well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that we could have a greater clarity, or at least that 
the government would have some openness to accepting some 
amendments to fix things up.  It is our party's intention to 
propose a number of amendments to the bill in order to correct 
some of the anomalies in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, speaking of firearms and officers being deprived of 
them, I wonder whether the federal government would be guilty of a 
crime if the bill is passed.  The bill says it will be unlawful 
to separate a police officer from the weapon the police officer 
has in order to do his or her job of protecting the peace and 
maybe arresting a person. It just so happens that the attorney 
general's department is already disarming these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens that very close to my riding, just about a mile or so 
outside the boundary of my riding, is a federal institution, the 
Edmonton institution.  I have had some representation from people 
who work as guards at the Edmonton institution.  They are being 
disarmed while they take dangerous offenders out on day parole. 
They are not permitted to take their arms with them while they 
are trying to protect the public from harm by a dangerous 
offender. 
The offence an ordinary citizen could be found guilty of with 
this law, which we support, is an offence that is already being 
committed by the attorney general's department in our maximum 
security prisons.  That is just not acceptable. We would all 
agree that our peace officers should be allowed to use arms in 
their work, especially if they are trying to control a convicted 
offender who is dangerous to the public.  To say that somehow the 
public safety is increased by disarming the police officer just 
does not make sense to me at all.  The bill does not address that 
question.  I am just using it as an example.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill there is a very great curiosity with respect to 
cruelty to animals.  There are already provisions with respect to 
wilful cruelty to animals, but the bill proposes to move the 
section that covers cruelty to animals to the same section of the 
criminal code that deals with sexual offences, public morals and 
disorderly conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just so happens that nowadays sexual offences, public morals, 
and disorderly conduct are areas in which, statistically 
speaking, it is easier to make charges stick than it is in some 
of the other areas.  There is a concern that by just having this in 
this section perhaps Canadians who are charged under these 
offences would have greater difficulty defending against unfair 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective in our justice system should be, but I am not sure 
that it is under this government, to make sure that those who are 
in fact guilty of a crime are so found and that an adequate 
deterrent punishment is meted out to them.  If a person is not 
guilty of the crime with which he or she is charged, if our 
justice system is working correctly the charges should be 
dropped or the person should be found not guilty.  Hopefully that 
person could go on with his or her life, having established his 
or her innocence.  That would be the objective in an ideal world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that in the give and take in a court trial sometimes 
the truth is actually somewhat muddied in order to make a point 
as, I might venture to say, is sometimes done in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that a word is being taken out, a very 
important word.  Words are so important in giving definitions. In 
the old code one would be guilty if one wilfully caused cruelty 
to animals.  The word wilfully is being withdrawn.  That raises 
many questions that we need to have answers to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing for an Archie Bunker type of guy to come into 
the house and kick his dog as he opens the door.  That is wilful. 
However, what happens if he walks in and does not see the dog and 
accidentally hits it?  Is he still charged with having kicked the 
dog?  No longer was it wilful according to the act, but he did 
kick the dog.  That is true.  He cannot say truthfully “No, I 
did not kick the dog”, but the fact of the matter is, he did not 
see the dog so it was an accident.  I know that should be a 
valid defence and hopefully it would be kicked out. The fact of 
the matter is that with the word wilful having been removed all 
of that is put into doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should go down that road.  It is a dangerous 
road because it makes it more difficult for an innocent person to 
defend himself or herself against a charge for an act that in 
fact was accidental. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting also that other definitions are changed in 
subtle ways.  It used to be that persons could be held 
responsible if they owned an animal or if they had charge of it, 
as in when they were transporting it.  It seems to me that 
according to the bill it could apply now to any animal at all 
that crossed a person's path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a very interesting occurrence in my riding earlier this 
spring.  I was driving along a major highway and there was a big 
truck behind me.  It was not a semi; I think it was probably a 
farm truck.  As I was driving along, lo and behold I saw ahead of 
me a mother duck with six or eight of her little ducklings start 
to cross the road.  I faced a real dilemma right there, because I 
am one who would not in any way wilfully harm any animal.  Of 
course these little ducklings were so cute besides. It is always 
difficult when one looks at a mother and her little children.  I 
faced a dilemma.  Do I jam on the brakes and risk having the 
truck run into the back of me, or do I just carry on and run over 
this mother duck and her little ducklings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story has a happy ending.  I was able to slow down.  I 
flashed my lights so that the truck behind me had fair warning. I 
gauged it so that I would not slow down so rapidly that the truck 
behind me had no capability of stopping before he was into my 
back end.  I just judged it as well as I could and slowed down as 
much as I could, giving the trucker as much warning and as much 
distance as possible.  Fortunately mother duck, seeing us bearing 
down on her and her family— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mother Goose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  No, it was mother duck.  She said to her 
children “We had better wiggle our tails and get out of here”. 
With that they put it in hypergear and away they went.  I was 
able to move over to the shoulder to give them a little space. 
The truck behind me did not have to do that.  All their little 
lives were spared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That of course is the object.  What we are dealing with in the 
criminal code is people who do not have a built-in care and 
compassion for life, whether it is animal life or human 
life.  That is what the criminal code is about.  If all of us 
cared about each other, we would not need the criminal code.  We 
would not need a codification of what happens if a person beats 
someone up, if someone is brutally assaulted or killed.  We would 
not need those codes because people would not do it. Obviously 
the purpose of the law is to restrain those who do not have that 
built-in moral code and who would act on their own accord 
wilfully against other forms of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress for a second.  One of the definitions is that an 
animal is, according to these amendments, to be defined as a 
vertebrate or any animal that can feel pain.  I guess we have a 
bit of a question there. One of the things I remember doing when 
I was a youngster is going fishing with my dad.  I do not do it 
any more now.  I do not have any time and I have lost interest in 
it.  Many people either make their livelihood by fishing or do 
sport fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was a youngster we went down to a little lake 
south of the place where we lived.  Every once in a while my dad 
would reward us for working hard on the farm.  He would say 
“Tomorrow we will take a day off and go fishing”.  The first 
thing we did was go out to the garden and dig up some worms.  I 
remember it well.  The object was to have a little pail of live 
worms in dirt, and off we went to the lake.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope you do not mind my relating this story, Madam Speaker. It 
is rather gruesome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we got to the lake, we put those poor little live worms on 
the hook.  We impaled them on the hook.  I do now know whether 
the poor little worms are animals capable of feeling pain.  I did 
not hear any of them scream, but I have never heard a worm scream 
in any case.  I do remember that the tail wiggled when we impaled 
the head end on the hook so maybe there was a response to pain. 
We know that a worm is not a vertebrate, but it is an animal that 
can probably feel pain.  According to the definitions in the 
bill, the question is, should a person who goes fishing be charged 
with cruelty to earthworms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of earthworms, I remember that when I was a biology student 
in high school and university we dissected worms and frogs.  We 
all did that.  It is part of learning how the physiology works. 
We took them apart to see their different parts and to learn 
about the different bodily functions. We all know that medical 
students do this extensively in order to become good at what they 
are to do, which is to help us when we have an illness or injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that a cruelty?  I can imagine some people saying it is 
pretty cruel to anesthetize a frog into oblivion so that it can 
be used as a research tool. Let us go one step further. How about 
the animals that are used in live research?  Monkeys are used to 
duplicate some of the illnesses that befall human beings to see 
whether various treatments work on them.  Rats and guinea pigs 
are used, as are other animals. Is that cruel or is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we do not support being wilfully cruel to an animal, 
but to use an animal for legitimate scientific and medical 
research surely cannot be wrong.  It is an advantage to us in the 
human realm. By taking out the word wilfully we have opened 
up a large question.  Even with the word wilfully one 
could have argued that perhaps this was cruelty but now it makes 
it worse.  We should not be getting into the area of making it 
more difficult for people to do legitimate scientific research 
even though there are arguments to be made for treating these 
animals very humanely, as humanely as possible.  I agree with 
that because it is not always humane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the phrase that the animal is one that can perceive 
pain, I am reluctant to give this example, but I think I must. We 
have that very sad case in Canada that a human is not considered 
a human until it is fully born.  One really needs to ask whether 
in late term abortions of human beings, that unborn human, one 
minute before it is naturally born, is capable of perceiving 
pain.  In my opinion, there is no cover in our criminal code 
against that criminal offence any longer. That is perhaps an 
error that is of considerable consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you have given me the signal that my time is up. 
I am certainly not finished talking about this topic.  There are 
many other areas to discuss but I close by appealing to the 
Liberal government to change the way it works in committees. 
I appeal to the government to give careful thought to and 
actually assent to the amendments we will be bringing forward to 
correct some of these anomalies.  Doing that would make the 
legislative process work so much better on behalf of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was very interested in my neighbour's speech.  Our 
constituencies share a boundary so I know that his constituents 
and background are somewhat similar to mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested to hear him say that the words wilful 
and wilfully have been removed from the bill. Anyone who 
wilfully inflicts pain or suffering on animals, whether it is 
wilful or whether it is through negligence, should suffer some 
sort of punishment because they ought to know better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to other members today who talked about the 
possibility that those who abuse animals and treat them badly are 
also likely to be the sort of people who abuse and treat 
human beings badly.  I agree. I think there is a correlation 
between the two.  I also think that wilful neglect, damage, or 
even neglect because a person did not know any better, should be 
penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to expound on how he feels about 
livestock producers who fail to adequately care for and feed 
their livestock and therefore cause them to emaciate and die of 
starvation.  I would like him to comment on another practice. 
Where he and I come from rodeos are a big thing in the 
summertime.  Does the use of animals in a rodeo constitute 
neglect or wilful harm? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague raises a number 
of important questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I would concur with him 100% that if a person wilfully 
causes discomfort and pain to an animal just for the sake of 
causing the pain, it is very serious.  I would suggest that 
the person needs not only punishment from our criminal justice system 
but we should also arrange for that person to get psychological 
and perhaps even psychiatric help.  There is something wrong with 
a person who gets his or her jollies by inflicting pain on an 
animal or another human being.  There is a deep psychological 
problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to what I call the normal use of animals, and I am 
talking about farmers and, to a certain degree, animals that are 
used in entertainment, in circuses and rodeos and so on, I do not 
think the animals in those contests endure any greater pain than 
do our athletes in the Olympics in most instances.  They run, 
jump, kick and do whatever they have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having grown up on a farm, I have seen horses without a rider 
engage in races.  They love doing it, especially the little 
colts.  Many of us have seen that.  They will take off and run to 
the other fence to see which one can get there first, just like 
kids do. There is nothing wrong with our getting enjoyment out of 
that, certainly within the context of humane treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of years ago I spoke to one of my friends who owned a 
very large pork operation.  He owned little piglets.  The 
building had several wings; it was like a hospital or a factory. 
There was a breeding section and a maternity section.  The little 
guys moved through the different wings in the building, down to 
the end where they came to the finishing wing, after which they 
were hauled into the truck and taken off to market.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One critic said it was a cruel way to treat those animals.  He 
responded by saying “These animals are treated better than a lot 
of humans.  I give them total care. Their house has air 
conditioning, mine does not.  It has temperature and humidity 
controls.  They have balanced and very healthy diets.  If they 
have an illness, at great expense to myself, I have a 
veterinarian on call 24 hours a day who gives them better care 
than does the health care system in Saskatchewan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that this is part of the food cycle.  It has 
always been thus.  I do not think we can turn it around. 
Certainly, as my friend does we can provide for those animals, treat 
them humanely, and cause them absolutely no unnecessary 
suffering.  It was the first time ever that I had actually seen a 
guy pet his little pigs. He took good care of them.  As I say, it 
is part of the reality, and from thence comes the bacon to go 
with our eggs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Elk Island is a veteran member 
of the House.  He has given a very interesting speech with very 
interesting answers to the questions, but a question still 
remains in my mind. I would like him to clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we define cruelty?  It is a relative term. For some 
people some things are not cruel whereas for others they are. 
There are cattle farmers whose livelihood depends upon killing 
animals for meat and other purposes.  There are other activities 
such as sports, the circus or rodeo, which are simply for the 
sake of fun but which cause pain, suffering and injury to 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the member define cruelty?  Would he agree that it is 
a relative term and that it is not defined in the bill at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, again it is a question that 
is almost impossible to answer.  What is cruelty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not into this at all but I understand there are some people 
who experience pleasure in pain.  There are special names for 
them, sadists and masochists.  The line between pain and pleasure 
is really blurred there.  Like I said, I am not into that at all 
but I can see where there would be a pretty lively debate on 
whether or not something is painful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan.  Dad used to get us up 
early in the morning.  When the sun came up, he would say “The 
Lord put the sun in the sky as a light for us to work. It would 
be a shame for us to waste it”.  We got up early in the morning 
and worked until late at night.  We were hot and sweaty and had 
chaff all over us.  Someone who has never worked under those 
conditions just does not value a shower at all.  There is nothing 
compared to the pleasure of a shower at the end of a day like 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way it was painful.  It was hard work.  Sometimes we hurt 
at the end of the day from the physical exertion we had put out. 
Nowadays there is a lot more mechanization in farming.  It was 
painful, yet it was pleasurable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the courts are going to have to rule on whether 
something is cruel to animals.  As I said before, I have actually 
only been to a few rodeos in my life.  The only one I wonder 
about is the calf roping.  Sometimes it looks like they get 
jerked pretty good, yet I have never ever seen one having to be 
taken off in a truck.  They always survive.  They seem to be 
built for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own opinion would be that most rodeos and circuses are well 
within the bounds of treating animals humanely.  That is my own 
opinion. 
We need to keep it all in balance.  As I said before, in all 
cases wilfully causing an animal pain is not permitted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in passing, one more example is the training of animals, 
whether it be dogs or horses.  Anyone who has ever done this 
knows it is done by a combination of reward and punishment.  A 
small amount of pain is inflicted on the little dog who does his 
doody-doo where he is not supposed to do his doody-doo. 
Eventually he learns and becomes a trained dog, and we like him. 
As long as he does his thing all over the house, we do not like 
him.  We all experience a bit of pain in that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as usual, my colleague from Elk Island has been very 
insightful and rather entertaining.  I expected when he was 
telling us about coming down the road and seeing the mother duck 
that he could actually hear her say to her little ones “duck”, 
but I guess he left that part out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I was driving home in broad daylight on a country 
road that was not very wide.  There was some extremely tall grass 
in the ditch.  A deer jumped out of the ditch and I collided with 
it.  It was totally an accident.  I am sure I inflicted some pain 
and suffering on that deer.  I am also convinced that the deer 
inflicted some pain and suffering on me, because I had to repair 
the automobile afterwards.  I had to do it quickly before my wife 
inflicted pain and suffering on me, because it was her car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at the bill and I am wondering if I might be guilty 
of inflicting pain.  If someone had come along they would have 
seen me strike that deer.  I frankly did not see the deer leave, 
because it rode up over the front end of my wife's car and landed 
behind the back door.  By the time I got the vehicle stopped and 
got out of the car, the deer had vanished.  Although I was not 
going very fast, it does take a few seconds to get the car 
stopped.  I was not able to assess whether it limped away or 
whether it bounded off, but I am quite sure that at 60 kilometres 
an hour, which was about the speed I was travelling, striking a 
deer with a car that weighs 4,000 pounds would certainly inflict 
some harm on it and some pain, maybe even break some bones.  I do 
not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, would I be guilty of inflicting pain on that 
animal?  That is one of the reasons it is so important that we 
keep the words wilful or wilfully in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other aspects to the bill.  It also deals with 
the disarming of a police officer and technical amendments to the 
Firearms Act.  I frankly do not have any argument with that.  I 
think that the disarming of a police officer, if it has not been in the 
code all these years as a specific crime, certainly should have 
been.  We have to give our police officers the tools to do their 
job.  We must respect our police officers for the job they do. 
Anyone who attacks a police officer should suffer the full wrath 
of the law.  I am also talking about trying to disarm the police 
officer, take away his firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with the technical amendments to the Firearms 
Act.  They seem fairly reasoned and commonsensical.  On the other 
hand, other aspects of the bill lack that elusive quality of 
common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from a farming community, I see all sorts of things. 
Normally our livestock producers take the very best care of their 
livestock.  It is in their best interest to do so because this is 
their livelihood.  This is their living.  Occasionally we hear 
reports on the radio or on the television stating that in 
such-and-such an area several head of cattle, hogs or whatever had to 
be humanely disposed of because they were in such a bad state of 
emaciation from lack of feed or they had been hauled in a truck 
that was so cold they had frozen spots on their carcasses.  That 
is an offence that absolutely should be punished.  There is no 
rationale whatsoever for causing undue suffering to defenceless 
animals.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am making the case that wilful negligence should be 
taken into consideration, whether it is inflicting wilful 
suffering and pain or whether it is done through lack of 
knowledge or lack of attention.  If someone knew or should have 
known those conditions would bring suffering and pain to an 
animal, livestock, pet, cat, dog or whatever, it would be very 
difficult for them to defend their position in a court of law. 
Those individuals should in all instances be found guilty of 
cruelty to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier agriculture and rodeos.  I certainly do not 
support blood sports such as dog fighting, rooster fighting, or 
bear baiting, the old idea of putting a bear in the ring to kill 
dogs or turning dogs on the bear simply to entertain people who 
watch the fight.  None of that makes any sense to me whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to differentiate that from a common practice in the 
agricultural industry that is absolutely necessary. Farmers do 
not neuter their bull calves simply because they want to inflict 
pain and suffering on them.  They do it for a very practical 
reason, which is that the animals fatten better and it makes them 
more docile.  It also plays a large role in the genetics of the 
cattle herd.  Farmers select the bulls they want to add to the 
gene pool of their livestock and simply neuter all the ones that 
do not measure up to a certain standard.  That is a common 
practice, as is the practice of hot iron branding of cattle for 
identification purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of one instance where a friend of mine who is a cattle 
buyer bought a load of cattle or two.  He was marshalling them at 
a custom feedlot.  He continued to buy cattle until he had a 
certain number and then find a buyer.  He also put together 
orders for people who had asked him to pick out a certain amount 
of a certain type of cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbeknownst to him, this feedlot was suffering from real 
economic stress.  One day he went there and found the sheriff had 
actually seized the feedlot and all of the contents therein, 
including the cattle my friend had bought.  I do not know whether 
my friend had a premonition or what, but he had undergone the old 
western practice of putting a brand on these cattle before he put 
them into the feedlot.  When the sheriff asked, “How can you 
prove you actually have cattle in here that belong to you?”  He 
said “They have my brand on them”.  The sheriff released his 
cattle to him immediately.  Cattle could be identified perhaps 
with a tattoo and it might stand up, but an ear tag would not.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about tattoos and ear tags, do they inflict 
pain and suffering on the livestock?  If they do, would putting 
an ear tag or a tattoo in the ear of an animal, which is a very 
common practice for purebred animals, inflict pain and suffering 
and make one guilty of a crime under this act?  Those are all 
questions we have to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the bill go to committee.  I would like to 
see it amended to reflect some of the common sense and some of 
the practices that are common and have been acceptable for 
hundreds of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At every auction market in the country and at every rodeo there 
are representatives from the humane society who are there to 
supervise.  Those people would be great witnesses before the 
committee because they have seen what is acceptable and what is 
not.  They have a very good idea of an acceptable practice and a 
practice that would constitute cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see all the amendments we have put forward 
adopted by the committee.  They would answer some of the concerns 
of farmers, hunters, agricultural groups, those in the fur trade, 
people in the rodeo and the circus business, and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year the Calgary Stampede takes place.  There is usually a 
protest following or during the stampede that says the roping of 
cattle is unnecessary cruelty and all the rest of it.  There is a 
long way between the catching of a calf at the end of a lariat 
rope and cock fighting.  Cock fighting is a brutal sport in which 
two roosters fight until one of them is dead.  To me that is a 
senseless and cruel sport that has no place in modern society.  I 
agree with those people who oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wilful neglect is certainly deserving of harsh punishment.  It 
is absolutely unacceptable.  From an agricultural point of view 
it just does not make any economic sense not to take care of 
livestock.  Neglect of farm animals, where they are not properly 
fed or not properly bedded, is not only against the law and 
should be against the law but is also a very stupid economic 
move.  If one is with the condition that one does not have the 
feed or the bedding to properly look after livestock, then they 
should be sold.  There is a ready market for any livestock and 
they should be sold to someone who will take care of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still in the livestock and farming vein, there is one clause of 
the bill I would like to quote from.  It says anyone who “kills 
an animal or, being the owner, permits an animal to be killed, 
brutally or viciously”.  I wonder what brutally or viciously 
killing means.  Does it mean if one shoots them it is brutal and 
vicious and if one tickles them to death it is okay?  I do not 
understand that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one kills a human being, is it brutal and vicious?  I think 
so.  Gophers, which are properly known as the Richardson's ground 
squirrel, dig up meadows and generally cause havoc with the turf. 
One could shoot them with a .22 or, worse yet, use a leghold 
trap.  As we kids used to do in school days at recess, one could 
go out and drown them by pouring water down their holes. 
Perhaps we were guilty of cruel and unusual punishment with those 
poor little ground squirrels, but are those things all considered 
to be “brutally or viciously” killing the animals?

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes on to say that anyone who “kills an animal, or 
being the owner, permits the animal to be killed, brutally or 
viciously, regardless of whether the animal dies immediately”, 
is guilty of a criminal offence.  My concern is that I own 
livestock.  The whole purpose of the livestock is to create 
protein, meat, for customers.  To do that, since we have yet to 
discover a way to eat animals alive, animals have to be killed in 
some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the animal dies immediately, we are guilty of a criminal 
offence, and even though we did not do it.  I guess we hire 
professional hit men to kill our steers so we are still guilty of 
consulting with and getting somebody else to carry out our foul 
deeds.  Even though the animal dies immediately, we are guilty of 
a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shudder to think of how many times I have been guilty of that, 
because we have sent literally thousands of animals to the 
slaughterhouse.  The animals die immediately, I think.  I am not 
sure, but I am pretty sure that they do.  They are immobilized, 
the butcher opens the carotid veins in the neck, the animal is 
bled and dies almost immediately.  As soon as the carotid 
arteries are opened the blood pressure goes to zero and the 
animal is for all intents and purposes dead immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not matter.  I am still guilty under this 
legislation.  That is a terrible deficiency in the bill.  I hope 
that the committee will move to amend this or to remove any 
ambiguity in this area so that the person who raises chickens for 
a living will be able to have the chickens killed and processed. 
We had chicken for lunch today.  I wonder how that got here.  It 
got here because somebody killed the chicken, I hope not brutally 
or viciously, and I hope immediately.  I hope somebody did not 
have to go to jail because we had chicken for lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of common sense I am talking about, which is 
absent in the bill and which is absolutely vital to the bill.  We 
cannot stand to have this kind of ambiguity.  We must have more 
clarity.  The bill as it is now will cause a tremendous amount of 
anxiety in the agricultural community.  It has already, in my 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill is not in the form that I would like to see, I 
want it to be on the record that I am a pet owner and a livestock 
producer and I pride myself on taking good care of my livestock. 
My animals are well fed, with good access to a good water supply. 
In cold weather I keep them bedded.  We give them the very best 
obstetrics we can if they have difficulty calving; we do 
everything we can to assist them, including giving them Caesarean 
operations if need be, to save the life of one or the other and 
sometimes both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as our pets are concerned, we have a little white Maltese 
dog that we keep in the house.  She is our pride and joy.  Our 
children grew up and left and we needed something to mother, so 
we got a puppy.  I would not do anything whatsoever to make life 
uncomfortable for that little dog. 
Frankly, anyone who would is an abuser and should be dealt with 
as an abuser, whether he does it through neglect or wilful harm. 
I want to be extremely clear about that.

Pets have a different purpose than farm animals, obviously, but a 
lot of pets on the farm are also working pets, like stock dogs. 
We have had stock dogs on our farm that were an absolutely 
essential part of our operation and saved us many steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am not pleased with the bill in its present form, I am 
prepared to give it tentative support to get it into committee in 
the hope that it will be amended to reflect the common sense 
suggestions I have put forward today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member for 
his speech. He addressed many concerns that many of us feel and 
that many of us of us have heard about from a number of 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of questions I would like to ask the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns about how far this is going to go.  We know that 
we use mice and rats in experiments in regard to health issues. 
Should that be looked at with regard to this bill?  That is of 
some concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also of great concern to me is the fact that there are two parts 
to this bill, one with regard to cruelty to animals and the other 
with regard to the disarming of a peace officer.  Why would the 
government bring in legislation that mixes those two together? 
That has created a lot of concern.  If someone were to disagree 
with part of the bill, the opportunity is there for somebody else 
to say that they disagreed with the legislation on the penalty 
for disarming a peace officer.  It worries me.  I do not know if 
we can call it cagey or crafty that a government would try to 
introduce a bill that has to do with cruelty to animals and throw 
the disarming of peace officers into the same piece of 
legislation. I can see no sense in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member address this as to whether or not he has 
heard any of these same concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the questions 
from my colleague from Okanagan—Shuswap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be my hope that the use of medical or laboratory 
animals would be an acceptable practice, provided of course that 
they are treated humanely in the course of the experiment.  We 
all know that because of laboratory animals there have been huge 
advancements in medical science.  I would think that the benefits 
would vastly outweigh the fact that these animals have to undergo 
experiments.  Would I support having that covered and clarified 
in the bill?  Absolutely I would.  I think it would be of the 
utmost importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question my colleague asked is why there is this 
omnibus sort of bill, why they are mixing apples and oranges. It 
is not my place to impugn motives to the government, but if I 
were the suspicious type I would say that perhaps it has been 
done this way in order to set a bit of a minefield for the 
opposition, such that if the opposition finds something 
insupportable in the act and votes against it, all of the above 
simply become fine points.  What will be kept on the record on 
the government side is that a certain party or a certain 
individual did not support strengthening the cruelty to animals

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are having this debate this 
afternoon without the participation of the government side 
because I would dearly love to put some of my questions to 
government members.  Unfortunately we cannot do that because they 
do not seem to be responding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discussion we are having on what constitutes cruelty to 
animals is very curious.  I cannot help thinking that given the 
government's access to the best legal minds in the country, the 
government could, if it wished, solve some of what appear to be 
inconsistencies in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly one of the inconsistencies I note is that even under 
the existing act we seem to be wilfully participating in acts of 
cruelty to animals.  We have heard of a number of instances.  I 
think rodeos were mentioned.  I can think of many more.  A number 
that I have witnessed come to mind.  For example, traditionally, 
for hundreds of years, in Atlantic Canada we have prepared 
lobsters by dumping them in a pot of boiling water.  That seems 
to me, in my prairie vision, to have some degree of cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also witnessed a religious process of slaughtering 
animals that has existed in this world since biblical times and 
before.  In my view, it certainly constituted wilful cruelty to 
that animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet under the existing act, these things are never prosecuted. 
There never seems to be a willingness to prosecute.  The only 
thing I can see that the original act contained was a necessity 
of criminal intent, which protected those groups or those people 
participating in these things.  That criminal intent is removed 
in this new act, which in my view lays open to prosecution all of 
those groups that participate in these things we talked about.  I 
would like the member to respond to that comment, if he would, 
please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am quite concerned 
that we are not hearing from speakers on the opposite side. 
Members opposite drafted the bill and should be here to defend 
it.  Their non-participation and indeed their ambivalence to this 
whole thing perhaps could be interpreted in a couple of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe they think the legislation is so great that there is 
absolutely no way it could be improved upon, although I do not 
know how they could get that idea, because every one in the House 
who has spoken on it so far today has suggested improvements to 
the bill.  Perhaps they are so ashamed of it that they just want 
it to slip through the House like a dose of salts, with nobody 
noticing it.  Otherwise why is someone from that side not 
responding from time to time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question my colleague raises is the one about wilful 
intent.  I spoke to that at some length during my remarks but I 
would not mind actually expanding on that just a little.  He 
talks about the ritual slaughter of animals by certain religious 
groups, which absolutely does date back to the time when history 
began to be recorded.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have customs whereby the native people are still allowed to 
carry out their whale hunt.  The Inuit are allowed to kill a 
certain amount of whales by harpooning them.  I wonder if that 
has been considered in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep going back to two points.  We have to consider what has 
been accepted practice for literally hundreds of years.  We also 
have to be very cognizant that whatever we put into the statutes 
has to be tempered with copious amounts of common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps common sense is not something that is very easily 
divined.  We can argue that what is common sense to my knowledge is not 
necessarily common sense to others and vice versa, but the 
generally accepted term of common sense should be applied in 
liberal doses to this particular act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate today, and I 
am pleased for a couple of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is that it gives me an opportunity to explain 
to the people out there in television land—I do not have to 
explain it to people in the House as they pretty well understand 
the strategy behind all these things—that we are once again 
seeing a bill that deals with some very questionable issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with that, some of the legislation that has been put forth 
does truly answer the need of our law enforcement people, which 
in turn answers the need for public safety.  This has been 
combined with some much needed regulations in the gun 
legislation, 
which has been flawed for quite a while.  This has been mixed all 
together and called an omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like good children who take their medicine, if we sprinkle a 
little sugar on it they are supposed to swallow it and like it. I 
have risen in the House too many times to count to address a 
number of bills that come with a whole pile of things in them, 
some that make perfectly good sense as to why they are there and 
others that make no sense to me at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand for the slightest moment what the disarming 
of a policeman has to do with cruelty to animals.  Why are these 
two issues combined in the legislation?  I want to support the 
particular part of the legislation which says that trying to 
disarm a policeman will be a criminal offence, and it should be a 
serious one.  That is a good part of the bill.  However, we also 
have to deal with another section of the bill regarding cruelty 
to animals.  There are so many questions that need to be answered 
it is not even funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no definition with regard to what is meant by so many 
statements.  Am I supposed to warn my five year old grandson when 
he goes fishing that somebody might be watching him as he puts a 
worm on his hook?  According to the legislation that possibility 
exists.  There is nothing in there that says a chicken farmer who 
raises chickens for the purpose of harvesting them for food for 
the public is allowed to trap or harm a weasel that might be 
trying to destroy some of his chickens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the legislation explains what is considered to be 
cruel.  Believe me, I certainly do not condone the abuse of a pet 
in any form or fashion. 
That should never be allowed and, as far as I understand, it is 
not allowed today.  Charges can be brought against an individual 
who exercises these kinds of abuses.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill clearly does not set out what is an 
intentional, unreasonable act of abuse upon an animal for no 
other reason than maliciousness.  There is nothing in the bill 
that says that the chicken farmer or my grandson will not be 
responsible for hurting or causing pain to an animal that is 
being used for the purpose for which they use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are those things mixed up?  I am really surprised there is 
nothing here to seriously address child pornography.  Why not mix 
that in with all this?  Why not take some other issue that the 
government slides around and stick it in there to make it look 
good?  Is that the reason we have this particular section stating 
that it is a criminal offence if someone tries to disarm a peace 
officer?  Is it to make the other sections of this flawed bill 
look good?  Or, is it to make me look bad for not supporting a 
bill because of certain aspects of it, even though I want to 
support it because of other aspects of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense to me that grown men and women who are 
supposed to have at the heart of the reason for being here, one 
of their most elemental duties being to provide protection and 
safety for the citizens of our country, would put together an 
omnibus bill of this nature that has good little aspects, silly 
little aspects and unexplainable little aspects in it.  It makes 
no sense to me at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grown men and women have put together a document that is all 
over the map, so we will be asking for some amendments.  We want 
some things in here that will clearly define animal cruelty for 
the farmers and harvesters of animals who earn a living doing 
what they do.  According to what I see as written, it could be 
very dangerous to these people in their activities and could 
cause a lot of grief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some really good reasons why someone would brand an 
animal but it is painful.  If members do not believe me they 
should come out to Alberta sometime.  I will take them to a 
branding party and show them that it is painful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether you go fishing, but if you 
catch one on your little hook and you plan to take it home to eat 
because it is good for your diet, do you let it flop to death or 
use a stick to club it on the head?  You would probably club it 
on the head.  Wait a minute, Mr. Speaker, the way the bill is 
written it could be construed as cruelty to animals.  I would be 
the last one in this place, Mr. Speaker, to want to see you toted 
off to court so a judge could decide, on behalf of all these 
brilliant ladies and gentlemen who put these documents together, 
whether or not it was against the law because these people cannot 
put something together that clearly defines what it is they mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the intent of the bill, particularly the intent on 
cruelty to animals, is good.  I think it is well-intended. 
However, surely most of the people in here have a brain bigger 
than the fish that I was talking about.  Surely their brain ought 
to operate a little bit to know that the bill needs some 
clarification. 
Surely the government members would not want a group of people 
hauled off to a court so a judge could decide for these wonderful 
people what it is they are trying to say in a bill.  Why can they 
not say what they mean?  Why can they not clarify the bill? What 
does it mean?  I read it and the meaning is not there.  It does 
not clarify whether a farmer will be charged because he dehorns. 
Dehorning is painful.  Clarity in the definitions is not there. 
It will take some amendments to do it.  It will be tested in 
committee when amendments are brought forward to make it a better 
bill, to make it a bill with a little common sense and allow 
people to understand what the intent of the government is.

expect from a Liberal government except unclarity?  What would we 
expect from a Liberal government except high hopes that a 
document will be placed before a judge some day so the judge can 
once again decide for Canadians what the law will be and what it 
will not be.  The Liberals do not have the courage or the 
intestinal fortitude to make the kind of laws that say what they 
mean.

them all up so no one can point the finger in their direction and 
say that they are not doing their job very well.  They are not.

with justice and they do not like it. I can understand why.

to protect aboriginal rights on the east coast.  In Alberta, the 
Lubicon struggle to resolve their longstanding claim.  In Quebec, 
Domtar logs on unceded land.  In the Yukon, fees are imposed on 
permits and licences, even though 16.4.10 of the claims 
agreement clearly prohibits this.  From coast to coast to coast 
the divide between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians is 
widening.

of the most difficult issues facing Canadian society is the

aboriginal complainants into the courtrooms of the nations to 
settle one of the most vexatious issues of our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts, however well-meaning, are among the least qualified 
forums for settlement and reconciliation.  At the end of the day, 
if it ever comes, a lot of money will change hands, a small

the churches will be bankrupt and our society diminished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no healing in the lives of the complainants.  The

necessary in the lives of litigants will happen outside the

</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 14 the finance minister, when talking to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been recorded by the World Economic Council on 
Competitiveness that interestingly over the last year the United 
States has moved from second to first place in terms of

change his high tax policies which continue to be a drag on our 
economy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

There were some measures two years ago and some last year.  Some 
came into force in July.  We have also reduced the capital gains 
tax.  We are doing it step by step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what one person said about the most recent federal 
budget:  “I am saying this live and on television: We give 
credit to the Minister of Finance and the federal government for 
some of the good things in that budget.  I give them full credit 
for some of the good things they did in terms of reducing income 
taxes for all Canadians.  Good for them”.   The Leader of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going through a period of time where we have asked the

child care spaces.  Even in this recent agreement there is no 
binding commitment that will guarantee child care spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is that at the end of the day the government is 
prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on political

not one child care space has been created.  How does the minister 
justify that?  Where is the celebration?

coming through with more money, not just for broader health care 
but for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to do across the country, and particularly in 
British Columbia, is essentially build a better future for our

in Ottawa this week is a very good beginning for doing the 
further work that needs to be done in this area.  In British 
Columbia the money will be used for child care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-17, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code (cruelty to animals, disarming a 
peace officer and other amendments) and the Firearms Act 
(technical amendments), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I sat and listened to my colleague make his speech on 
the cruelty to animals act.  He raised what I think was a very 
legitimate concern of cattle owners about protecting the age old 
practice of branding, dehorning and vaccinating cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the midst of his speech we heard the backbench heckling on 
the other side of the House, in particular the member for 
Bruce—Grey.  That was interesting because Bruce—Grey is one of 
the greatest cattle producing areas of Canada.  It is well 
renowned for feedlots and for the raising and producing of 
cattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is curious the member would not come forward to debate the 
issue in front of the microphone.  Far enough from the microphone 
he insisted that the act provides protection for cattle producers 
against prosecution for cruelty and pain inflicted upon animals 
during the dehorning process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my colleague made the presentation I obtained a copy of 
the act and reread it once again.  I have read it several times, 
but I read it again in an effort to find where, even in the 
vaguest sense, there was some protection provided for the 
agricultural producer as the member suggested.  I have not been 
able to find even the slightest or vaguest reference.  I do not 
believe that reference is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on that and elaborate further on his 
concerns for the farmer and the cattle producer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, in the midst of all 
the efforts of the Liberals to jumble bills together and bring in 
different things the way they do, it is a bill that contains some 
really good stuff and some really confusing stuff.  I have spoken 
about this in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are doing is moving cruelty to animals out of civil 
law where it really belongs and into the criminal code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would protect harvesters, cattlemen and other 
people who make a living raising animals.  If these changes are 
not made, every law-abiding cattle owner and every law-abiding 
chicken farmer will be subjected to becoming a criminal under 
this act.  That is the way it is.  That is the way it exists in 
its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should do a little more thinking about what they have done 
by taking this out of the civil code and putting it into the 
criminal code.  They should think a little more about the 
predicament in which they will put a lot of people.  Instead of 
heckling so much, they should listen to what is being said. Then 
maybe they would not make the silly mistakes they constantly 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am beginning to think they are not mistakes.  When one starts 
to jumble up an omnibus bill like this one, is there a purpose 
behind it?  Is there a strategy?  Or, is it just plain Liberal 
nonsense?  I tend to believe the latter.

question of the hon. member for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing that he studied the legislation, I am wondering if there 
is any protection for the farmer who gets kicked by a milk cow or 
kicked in the teeth by a horse.  Who is looking after the 
interest of the farmer and the protection of these poor people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, apparently, as I see 
it, humans are totally excluded from the bill.  Having received 
the back hoof of a milk cow once or twice in my life, I know it 
is pretty painful.  It could be classified as pretty cruel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what my hon. colleague is thinking. The people in the 
business of raising cattle, sheep and livestock and dealing with 
other animals know the difference between cruelty and what is 
proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be so quick to draw up criminal code 
legislation that gives us the idea that farmers and ranchers do 
not know anything and therefore it is up to politicians in Ottawa 
to do the protecting.  My goodness, with all the lawyers from Bay 
Street we are facing a real problem.  I am not sure they know 
which end of a cow the milk comes out of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to the speech of the 
hon. member for Wild Rose.  He raised a very interesting point 
with regard to what happens in the House when the government 
decides to bring in a piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the habit of introducing a part of the bill, which really 
has nothing to do with the rest of the bill, for the House to 
vote upon.  When we try to separate a bill it absolutely refuses 
to do it.  This bill is another example of what happens.  I would 
like the hon. member to comment on that if he could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation deals with cruelty to animals. Another 
part of the same bill deals with disarming peace officers.  In no 
way can I make sense of this at all.  It seems that we are trying 
to lump the disarming of a peace officer with cruelty to animals. 
It makes no sense to me or to a number of people with whom I 
have talked.  If the hon. member could comment on that I would 
appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is only one 
person who could possibly explain it.  I would like to hear a 
simple explanation as to why a bill dealing with cruelty to 
animals would be incorporated with a bill that says it is against 
the law to disarm a peace officer.  I fail to see the connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be some reason.  For the life of me, I cannot 
possibly think of what the reason would be.  It makes no sense to 
me at all.  I am sure the question being asked by millions of 
Canadians across the country is:  Why would the Liberal 
government do this kind of a thing? 
There must be a political reason for it.

when they go into Edmonton on escorted leave with some of the 
very dangerous criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is curious to me that the same government that would take 
weapons away from the guards would make a law which makes it 
against the law for anyone else to take a weapon away from a 
police officer.  I wonder if the member could comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, it will not take long 
to comment on that.  That is a very, very good point. The 
government has taken away the weapons from peace officers who are 
escorting criminals from one penitentiary to another and at the 
same time we are making a law that says it is illegal to disarm a

describe as complex, because it is fairly straightforward, but 
rather as a bit of a mixture, since it addresses several 
different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, of course, an omnibus bill but, with these, we are more 
used to having changes to a number of things that are somewhat 
interconnected.  Here we have different things.  This is not a 
bill that strikes me as problematic; I would say it is an 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly go over the range of points addressed by this 
bill. I am going to focus on one point in particular, the one I 
find rather more important, requiring more reflection and 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have been hearing since this morning, Bill C-17 addresses 
a variety of issues, the main and most important of which as far 
as changes are concerned relates to cruelty to animals.  Its main 
aim is to group together the present provisions of the Criminal 
Code under one new section.  I believe that it is a worthwhile 
step forward in dealing with animal cruelty.  Just reading the 
amendments, we can see that this government is attempting to make 
some innovations in this field and to update the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, there are some weaknesses or flaws in the bill. 
Improvements would have to be made.  I believe that careful 
attention needs to be paid to the innovations the minister wishes 
to make by introducing this bill. 
It gathers into a single bill the various offences to be found 
here and there.  The government now wants to concentrate them, 
and that is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the whole issue of disarming officers of the peace 
is contained in the bill.  On September 1, I met in Halifax the 
Canadian Police Association.  Naturally, this subject came up for 
discussion, and statistics were provided to me, but I had 
gathered a few of my own as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Ontario alone, over the past 25 years, some 
22 police officers have been gunned down with their own weapon. 
At the moment, the measures in the Criminal Code do not satisfy 
the police community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police support these amendments, I can tell you honestly 
that I will not do battle, because in the end we will no doubt 
support the way they are drafted.  In any case, we support the 
aim, which is to make disarming an officer of the peace an 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is section 214 of the criminal code on illegitimate 
children.  I could not believe that in the year 2000 we would 
find this in the Canadian criminal code.  In my view, children 
have not been illegitimate for a long time.  I would go so far as 
to say that there is no such thing as illegitimate children, 
since the child is the product of the mother and the father, and 
that is the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I fully support the amendment in this omnibus bill to 
delete the expression illegitimate child which, in any case, 
should never have appeared in the criminal code. But at one time 
that expression reflected the moral standards of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus bill seeks to increase the protection granted to 
extremely vulnerable people in society, namely the disabled, 
against sexual exploitation by adding a new category to the list 
of offences targeted by special evidence rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must salute and, more importantly, support these amendments, 
which seek to help crown attorneys, among others, collect 
evidence to build solid cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the political will was there to amend some legislative 
tools to help collect evidence under certain circumstances, to 
help crown attorneys build solid cases, the Minister of Justice 
found a way—and I congratulate her—of bringing in amendments to 
the criminal code to facilitate the work of crown attorneys in 
the collection of evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that, in her department, and I am sending this 
message, there are public servants who could find an effective 
way to fight organized crime, to help crown attorneys collect 
evidence to build their cases and to provide them with all the 
necessary legislative tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, the minister shows her interest for a group we 
must protect, namely disabled people and those who are more at 
risk of being abused, people who may be less able to communicate 
evidence for reasons of accessibility and other reasons. It was 
therefore important and appropriate for the minister to include 
these changes in her omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I do not intend to revisit an old issue here, but Bill 
C-17 proposes significant changes to the Firearms Act regarding 
the issuance of licences for handguns to employees and 
storekeepers. These amendments in the omnibus bill are very 
understandable. This is not very complicated. The purposes and 
the objectives of these amendments are understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot get too fired up about Bill C-17 because basically these 
are acceptable provisions that we must look at carefully. 
However, I do not give my blessing to all these amendments. 
Some serious work will have to be done, and that is how we have 
always proceeded in the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights.  We will have to examine each of these amendments to the 
criminal code closely, because I think that they will very 
definitely have repercussions. The part of Bill C-17 which has 
perhaps got people talking the most, which has captured their 
interest, is the first part, which deals with offences under the 
heading of “Cruelty to Animals”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon reading the bill, I immediately had certain questions and 
concerns.  I listened carefully to the explanations from the 
government side.  I can say that, on the face of it, my many 
questions have not been answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor are the minister and the government members answering the 
questions that legal specialists, farmers or industries that 
work with animals have with respect to this part of the bill. 
This entire section will have to gone over very closely in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the bill's provisions relating to cruelty to animals 
are concerned, there are some arguments on both sides.  I will 
try to summarize them, and to reach a conclusion at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legally speaking, there is recognition of the importance of 
readjusting the provisions of the criminal code, but it seems 
the legislator has yielded to pressure from the animal defence 
people, imposing penalties that are judged too severe.  This is 
a legitimate objection, looking at the penalties imposed on 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Barreau du Québec has issued an opinion on this part of the 
bill. It finds it shocking and inappropriate that these new 
provisions are to come under part V of the criminal code, 
“Sexual Offences, Public Morals, Disorderly Conduct and Cruelty 
to Animals”, because there is a risk of reducing the importance 
of offences toward people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Barreau du Québec calls for the creation of a specific 
statute apart from the criminal code, or at the very least that 
these offences be grouped together in a specific section of the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the objective of the Barreau du Québec is to 
ensure that the criminal code, which is relatively easily 
followed by an informed reader at the present time, does not 
become any more complex than it already is.  Hon. members will 
note that I have said “an informed reader”.  This is certainly 
not as easy a read as a novel, but there is a certain logic in 
the criminal code, in its structure and in the sentences, the 
way sentences are determined and so on.  Adjustments would have 
to be made, but that logic would have to be retained.  I think I 
am echoing the Barreau du Québec's position by saying that 
perhaps these offences ought to be grouped together in a 
specific section of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reading of the bill will show that a definition of “animal” is 
given. 
I heard a member of the Canadian Alliance answer another 
member's question as to whether or not humans were covered by 
this law. This was not covered in the definition of animal, at 
least I hope so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition satisfies the legal world.  It is fairly clear. 
One wonders why the legislator put it in subclause (8) at the 
very end of the definitions.  The definition of an animal should 
be put at the very start, ahead of the consequences of cruelty 
to an animal.  This is normally the way it works; the 
definitions are at the start of a bill.  I see no reason why it 
should be otherwise in a specific section of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section should start with the definition of the word 
“animal” before proceeding to the heart of the matter, that is, 
who commits an offence, how it is committed and what are the 
offences involved, as in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Barreau du Québec also said that the important point with 
this bill is the one concerning the means of defence made 
available to offenders. Lawful excuse, as provided in paragraphs 
182.1(1)(<I>c</I>) and 182.1(1)(<I>d</I>), addresses concerns expressed by the 
animal industry, namely the context of an experiment or an 
accepted industry, be it for profit such as a slaughter house or 
recreational such as hunting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, having heard certain comments by the animal industry, 
we do not think this bill addresses their concerns. 
And rightly so.  I will come back to this a little later on in 
my speech.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new provision regarding the offence of failing to 
provide adequate care.  Even the legal experts think that this 
offence should be dropped from the bill, because it is not based 
on any tangible evidence and thus runs counter to the spirit of 
the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With no material evidence to go on, it will be very difficult to 
prove this offence beyond all reasonable doubt. Given the legal 
principle that there must always be a point to what lawmakers 
say—when I refer to lawmakers, I am of course not referring to 
the Minister of Justice—this means that if we include in the 
criminal code a provision for which it will never be possible to 
produce tangible evidence, we will never be able to use this 
provision, and lawmakers' work would be pointless, which goes 
against a basic legal principle.  The House knows what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the reception of the legal community, it is quite 
favourable.  The animal industry, however, has some serious 
questions.  It feels that the earlier provisions in the criminal 
code have not really been reproduced, and that there are 
loopholes.  Amendments should be made to the legislation to 
better serve this industry, whether it be lucrative or 
recreational in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members have referred to the farmers in their ridings. 
There are farmers in my riding also, and even wild animals in 
captivity.  There are, of course, questions to be raised with 
regard to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill could easily be improved, if there were a certain 
political will.  It is not a bill, at least as far as the Bloc 
Quebecois MPs are concerned, that will have us tearing out our 
hair if the wording is not the same as in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to improve and to update the approach 
being taken to animals, compared to the practice a few years ago. 
Hon. members will understand that the minister cannot be asked 
to reproduce word for word what was in the criminal code. It is 
being changed precisely because it did not correspond to everyday 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, there were certain things in the sections they 
want to do away with, including subsection 429(2) which refers to legal 
justification or colour of right to justify certain actions by 
the owner of an animal.  These are not carried over into Bill 
C-17; there is nothing like them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reference to “lawful excuse”, but this is very broad. 
How are the courts going to interpret “lawful excuse”?  As 
legislators, we must provide the courts with as much guidance for 
their interpretation as possible.  We are not doing our job 
properly if we leave things the way they are.  I believe what we 
mean by “lawful excuse” needs to be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some of the major questions raised by owners. 
Is the practice common among farmers with horned animals of 
removing the horns of the beasts considered to Cause an animal 
“pain, suffering or injury”?  Would the courts interpret it this 
way?  This is not clear.  The government should be clearer in 
its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, those who raise animals of prey trim their beaks, 
others cut the tails of certain animals.  Does this come under 
the offence of causing “pain, suffering or injury?” Doubtless 
it does not.  I think we should not give the courts any room for 
interpretation.  Owners and farmers are quite right to have 
reservations, doubts and questions about these problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole issue of researchers who use animals. 
People may oppose this, but medicines have been developed as the 
result of testing, in a prescribed manner, I concede. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have a code, which could perhaps be better 
structured, be better tracked to see what is done in the industry. 
Nor can animal research be completely prohibited and certain 
possible justifications for the people who are going to use 
animals not included in the bill. Thought should also be given 
to all the organizations for the defence of animal rights.  I 
think that everyone is aware of their perhaps extreme position, 
but on the other hand, there are researchers who use animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of criminal intent.  I believe very 
sincerely that there should be more clarification on this in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that we support the spirit of the bill, but a 
fair balance must be found between the purpose of the 
legislation and its usefulness. 
This is not the first bill the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights will be considering in order to find the fairest 
possible solution.  Once again, it is not a very controversial 
bill as far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I think it is important that I rise today to speak to 
Bill C-17.  First I will talk a bit about what the bill includes. 
It is one of those omnibus bills which includes things that 
should never be grouped together.  I encourage the government to 
decouple the issues in the bill so that we are dealing with like 
issues only in one particular piece of legislation instead of 
such wide ranging issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill we have issues ranging from cruelty to animals to 
disarming a police officer, to a whole group of miscellaneous 
issues including those under the Firearms Act.  They are 
completely unrelated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When many of us came here in 1993, particularly those of us in 
the Reform Party which is now the Canadian Alliance, we expressed 
concern, and we have expressed it many times since, about omnibus 
bills and the need for decoupling unrelated issues so that we 
could have debate on the particular issues before the House and 
could vote on a bill without having to vote against a bill 
because we could not support one part of it when there may be 
other sections that we fully support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government uses this tactic.  The intent is to make it 
difficult for opposition members to vote against a bill because 
parts of it are difficult to vote against.  This tactic is not 
reasonable for the government to use.  I request that it break 
the bill down into three or more bills so that we could deal with 
it in a reasonable fashion and have debate on related issues. The 
most important part is that we could vote on issues that are at 
least in some way related.  Unfortunately that is not the case 
with this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Bill C-17 it is hard to disagree with its stated 
intent, the main part of the bill, cruelty to animals.  How many 
people would not support a piece of legislation which in a 
reasonable fashion protects animals against abuse? 
I do not think we would find one member of any political party in 
the House who would not support that.  That is not the issue when 
we are dealing with this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some areas of concern in the legislation.  One part of 
the bill is the disarming of a police officer.  I think we would 
find very wide support in the House for that portion of it. With 
some changes I think we would find that almost everyone in the 
House would support that portion of the bill.  I cannot speak for 
everyone else, but that is what I have heard from the debate so 
far and from speaking to some people from other parties regarding 
the legislation.  I think there is pretty wide support for that 
part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue in the miscellaneous section which I think has 
been overlooked and to which we must pay attention and speak on 
today.  I am referring to the issue of once again having the 
government expropriate property from Canadian citizens with no 
compensation.  There is a section in the bill which does exactly 
that.  It will expropriate property and cause people to destroy 
property so that it is worthless, with no compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That stems from a deep rooted problem in the country that 
Canadians do not have the right to own property.  There is 
nothing in the constitution that says Canadian citizens have a 
right to own property.  It is an issue to which we have spoken 
many times since we have been here.  I think it is an important 
issue to raise again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all wrong.  It is part of what is wrong with the species 
at risk act.  In that piece of legislation property can be 
expropriated from citizens.  The use of property could be denied. 
There may or may not be any compensation, but certainly the 
minister has made clear that under that piece of legislation 
there is no guarantee of fair market value compensation.  It has 
been made very clear that there just will not be fair market 
value compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the species at risk act the problem arises from the fact that 
we do not have the right to own property enshrined in the 
constitution.  It comes to the forefront.  That is a big part of 
the problem in that piece of legislation, as it is in this one. I 
certainly cannot support that part of the legislation.  I just do 
not believe it is proper for a government to expropriate property 
from individuals without fair market value compensation. That is 
exactly what would be done in the miscellaneous section of Bill 
C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a Bloc member of parliament speak to the disarming 
of a police officer to some extent.  Others will speak and have 
spoken to that issue, but I want to focus on the part of the bill 
that deals with protecting against animal cruelty.  It is very 
clear that probably there is not one member in the House who 
would not agree that we want to protect animals against abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us have pets.  I am in Ottawa almost half the year. When 
I came here in 1993 my family replaced me with a miniature 
schnauzer named Lady.  My family figured it was a pretty good 
deal, which kind of concerns me.  The Liberals think it is a 
pretty good deal too.  She is just such a sweet little dog, 
sometimes.  Our family loves her dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have pets they feel that kind of attachment to.  Who 
would not want legislation to protect against abuse of our pets 
and of animals we feel are very important to us.  That is not the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that in this piece of legislation there are flaws 
which have led to a concern expressed by hunters, anglers, 
farmers and ranchers in particular.  I will refer to legal 
opinions which people from all these groups have obtained from 
their lawyers on this issue.  They are concerned that as the 
legislation is written now it could harm farmers, ranchers, 
hunters and anglers in their activities.  I will refer to that 
real concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I read from the first letter which mainly concerns farm 
animals, I would like to talk about the care farmers and ranchers 
take with their animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had neighbours on the farm who have complained that their 
wife or husband, the person who looks after the animals, cares 
more for the animals than they do for their spouse.  That is kind 
of a farm joke.  At calving time farmers are out there watching 
to make sure their animals give birth safely.  They are out there 
in the middle of the night checking to make sure that calves are 
not lost, frozen or harmed in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and ranchers take good care of their animals.  Of course 
that is how they earn their living and there is a monetary reward 
for doing a good job, but also it is just because they care for 
their animals.  They genuinely care for their animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must express concern when we have a piece of legislation that 
seems to ignore that fact and does not seem to recognize that a 
vast majority of farmers and ranchers do an absolutely wonderful 
job. The last thing they would want to do is to inflict any kind 
of pain on their animals or to allow pain to be inflicted on 
them.  Yet farmers and ranchers once again have to defend 
themselves against a piece of legislation put forth by the 
government.  Bill C-17 could interfere in the way they look after 
their animals.  That is a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read from some documents.  The first is from the 
county of Vermilion River No. 24.  That county is very close to 
where I live in east central Alberta.  The area has a very large 
number of cattle and other farm animals. Enough farmers and 
others have talked to the councillors about this legislation that 
they have taken the time to write to the minister about this 
issue.  I was at meetings with the council on a couple of 
occasions where this issue was brought to my attention. I brought 
it to the attention of our caucus and members of other parties as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read the short letter from the county of Vermilion 
River to explain where it is coming from on this issue.  It 
reads: “The County of Vermilion River No. 24 Agriculture Service 
Board recently reviewed the proposed changes to Bill C-17, under 
section 182 animal cruelty provisions.  The Agriculture Service 
Board understands that the intent of the changes of Bill C-17 is 
not to alter the animal care practices currently being used by 
livestock producers throughout Canada.  Presently livestock 
producers operate lawfully under a vast array of federal and 
provincial laws, regulations and voluntary codes of conduct.  The 
County of Vermilion River No. 24 Agriculture Service Board does 
not condone the mistreatment of animals.  However, the current 
wording of C-17 could put livestock producers involved in 
legitimate and lawful livestock production at serious risk of 
criminal prosecution.  The County of Vermilion River No. 24 
Agriculture Service Board would ask that amendments be made to 
Bill C-17 which would ensure the protection of law-abiding 
livestock producers from unfair criminal prosecution.  The 
livelihoods of Canadian livestock producers are at stake”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter is signed by the reeve of the county, Peter Green. 
He also includes a legal opinion on Bill C-17, particularly 
dealing with the livestock cruelty provisions.  It is an overview 
of their concerns.  The briefing document, which includes 
comments from the legal opinion, was sent to the Minister of 
Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risks of the bill are listed.  It states “leaving aside the 
government's best intentions, if Bill C-17 is left as it is”, 
and therefore they acknowledge that the government has the best 
of intentions in this regard. 
They believe that, as do I.  Leaving that aside, they said they 
have concerns about the risk to farmers, hunters, anglers and 
other people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers risk criminal prosecution for such common practices as 
dehorning, beak and tail trimming, castrating and hot iron 
branding given in the wording of 182.1(1)(a). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meat plants which engage in religious slaughter risk criminal 
prosecution for not stunning livestock prior to killing, 
according to the wording.  The second concern is slaughter for 
religious purposes and the process that must be followed to 
respect those religious beliefs.  They have a real concern about 
those not being upheld as a result of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biomedical researchers in food, cosmetics, medicine and 
chemicals risk criminal prosecution from procedures which result 
in any pain or suffering according to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anglers risk criminal prosecution for even putting a worm on the 
hook as a result of the changes in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hunters risk criminal prosecution for wounding or using a bow. 
Likewise trappers risk criminal prosecution for using live 
holding traps as a result of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the risks listed in the legal opinion. It is a long 
list.  Practices which are considered to be perfectly normal 
could be altered and could be forced to be set aside as a result 
of the legislation.  I do not think that is the intent the 
government had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to look at these concerns and to fix 
the legislation.  We will be more than co-operative in that 
regard.  These concerns have been sent to the minister.  We sent 
proposals to the minister.  Several people have sent proposals to 
us which have also been sent to the minister.  We do not want to 
make a political issue out of this.  We want it fixed. That is 
why I am taking this very co-operative approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go through all the other concerns that are 
listed.  I believe that the concerns of farmers and ranchers 
certainly in our part of the country as expressed are legitimate. 
I think they have accurately identified real problems with the 
way the legislation is written.  The legislation has to be either 
set aside or amended so that the hardship that could be forced on 
ranchers, farmers, hunters, fishermen and other people can be 
taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the letter from the county of Vermilion River.  I will 
not read through all of these documents, but I want to read 
portions of a letter and a background document including a legal 
opinion sent to me by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and 
Hunters.  This is not just a western Canadian problem; it is a 
problem right across the country.  Farmers farm and ranchers 
ranch right across the country, but people also like to hunt, 
fish and take part in other activities which have been generally 
considered to be acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a lot of Liberals would find those activities to be 
acceptable.  If they do not, then they should state that.  They 
should say no, they do not agree that people should be allowed to 
hunt.  They should say no, they do not agree that people should 
be allowed to trap.  They should say no, they do not believe that 
farmers should be allowed to do things with their animals which 
they normally have done in the interests of good animal 
husbandry.  If they do not believe that, they should come out and 
say it.  If they do not believe it is right for certain religious 
groups to kill livestock in a way that is laid out by the 
religion of those groups, then they should come out and say that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not the Liberals' intention to interfere in normally 
accepted processes, then they should say, “Okay.  We have made a 
mistake. We have a bad piece of legislation here, so let us fix 
it up”. That is all I am asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not think this should become a political ball that 
we throw back and forth. There should be co-operation on this 
issue.  There is certainly co-operation from me and members of my 
caucus.  I think members of the governing party will show the 
same kind of co-operation in this case.  This issue is not one 
which would favour one political party over another. We are 
trying to protect the very people who could be harmed by the 
legislation should it pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer briefly to a couple of the things the Ontario 
Federation of Anglers and Hunters put forth in its letter.  The 
letter states in part:  “Make no mistake, an outspoken national 
animal rights organization has labelled Bill C-17 revolutionary 
and as such, Canada is poised to elevate the interests of animals 
in the law. The justice department officials themselves have 
recently made remarkable claims that the current law recognizes 
animals' interests.  Let us repeat some of our major concerns on 
C-17”. There are three concerns listed in the letter.  “There 
is absolutely no need to move cruelty and care provisions from 
part XI to part V of the criminal code”.  I agree. It is 
important to note that moving those from part XI to part V gives 
animals a status that somewhat equates to people.  I do not think 
that is generally accepted by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I see you are indicating that my time is up. In 
summary, my family and I love our little dog Lady, and many times 
when we watch her play and interact with us we wonder just what 
she does know, but we do not believe that she equates to a human. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern when a piece of legislation appears to somehow 
equate a pet or other animal to a human.  I agree with so many 
groups that have written to me saying that we must change that, 
put it back to the way it was.  Let us work in a co-operative way 
to fix this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to speak at second reading of Bill C-17, the government's 
proposed changes to the criminal code and Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan issue.  I have only heard Canadian 
Alliance members one after the other address the issue.  Not a 
single member from the government stood to address this important 
issue.  Perhaps they are not concerned about it and that is the 
way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event the bill has three parts.  The bill will first of 
all make it a criminal offence for anyone to disarm or attempt to 
disarm a peace officer without that officer's consent. Our 
nation's police associations have been calling for this. We in 
the official opposition commend the government whenever it 
listens to Canadians, which of course is a very rare event.  In 
this case we in the Canadian Alliance are proud to support 
Canada's front line police officers.  We will support this part 
of the bill and will work with the government to have it passed 
into law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of Bill C-17 amends the Firearms Act by 
expanding the class of prohibited handguns that are grandfathered 
and modifies the employee licensing requirements.  The 
refinements to the Firearms Act are pure and simple tinkering. 
They are only cosmetic changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance calls for a complete overhaul of the 
Firearms Act.  We support the two amendments to the Firearms Act. 
However, if the government really wants to fix the Firearms Act, 
it will have to implement the over 200 amendments proposed by 
this side of the House at report stage and implement all of the 
amendments proposed by the standing committee on justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third part of Bill C-17 is the Liberal government's proposed 
amendments to the criminal code, which will consolidate cruelty 
to animal offences.  The Canadian Alliance is anxious to support 
measures that will protect animals in Canada.  We Canadians love 
our animals, be they wildlife, pets, or birds, all of the little 
creatures that get cold and hungry in our winters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Surrey we have squirrels, alley cats, groundhogs, coyotes and 
birds in our neighbourhoods, co-existing with us.  They make us 
and our children laugh.  They tear at our hearts on a rainy day. 
We all feel sad, very badly indeed, whenever we hear about an 
innocent animal harmed by a human being.  If it is an 
unintentional harm to an animal, we share the sadness felt by the 
person who caused the hurt to the creature, for that person feels 
very bad as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person is cruel to an animal, that person invites the 
wrath of the House and of all the powers we have in this place 
to come to the aid, the defence and the protection of our 
brethren in the animal kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people of Surrey Central, I am proud to 
participate in this debate to pass the part of this legislation 
that will fight cruelty to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak Liberal government is proposing to place brutality to 
an animal, viciously killing an animal and abandoning an animal 
in one section of our criminal code.  This bill proposes to no 
longer treat cruelty to animals as a property crime.  The new 
provision will move cruelty to animals to part V of the criminal 
code, under sexual offences, which would be renamed “Sexual 
Offences, Public Morals, Disorderly Conduct and Cruelty to 
Animals”.  Animal cruelty provisions are currently contained in 
part XI of the criminal code.  These sections protect a person 
from being convicted of an offence if that person acts with the 
legal justification of excuse or colour of right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agricultural groups, anglers, hunters' groups and the Fur 
Council of Canada oppose moving the offence.  These groups fear 
that by moving the cruelty section to sexual offences, they may 
be wrongly prosecuted.  They argue that those who lawfully and 
legitimately harvest animals for businesses will not be protected 
if the cruelty section is changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will be moving an amendment at committee 
stage to have animal cruelty provisions maintained in part V or 
to make the necessary changes to the criminal code to comply with 
the concerns of farmers, hunters, anglers, agricultural groups, 
the fur trade and others who harvest animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice contends that individuals who conduct an 
agricultural business or one involved with animals are not 
affected by this legislation.  The Liberals say that if one is 
not violating the criminal code as it currently reads in 
conducting their agriculture business, Bill C-17 does not change 
the way they conduct their business, whereas agricultural groups, 
the anglers, the hunters' federation and the Fur Council of Canada 
do not agree.  They do not buy that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are mistrustful of the Liberal government that has 
delivered so many broken promises such as the GST.  A government 
is not judged by the promises it makes.  Rather, a government is 
judged by the promises it keeps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians, these fur traders, farmers and hunters, feel 
the bill goes much further than reflecting society's disgust with 
those who would abuse pets.  They feel that this legislation is 
the precursor to further attempts to alter the way they currently 
operate their respective businesses.  These three groups of 
Canadians have raised legitimate concerns about the impact the 
bill could have on their operations now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did my first degree, a B.Sc. in agriculture, with honours in 
animal sciences.  From that point of view, I can understand their 
concerns.  There is no reason why the Liberals cannot accommodate 
the interests of the stakeholders and the industry affected by 
the legislation.  Why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should say what it means in its legislation. 
Canadians cannot accept that words in a media scrum or in 
regulations will take care of things.  I have gone through a copy 
of the bill. It is only a few pages long but the regulations 
after the bill come as a big pile of papers.  It is the 
regulations that control the intent of the bill.  Sometimes the 
intent of the bill is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want clarity.  Because these groups are concerned, the 
government should spell out for them in its legislation exactly 
what the government means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about penalties described in the bill.  The bill 
raises the penalty for intentional cruelty to an animal from the 
current six months to five years.  Also, the bill will lift the 
cap off the fine, which is currently $2,000.  There is potential 
for a lifetime ban from owning an animal.  Those found guilty of 
cruelty to animals would be forced to pay for veterinarian 
services to treat the animal.  The bill acknowledges that animals 
have feelings and are deserving of legal protection from 
negligence or abuse.  We hope that the new maximum five year 
penalty will be imposed.  As in other instances, the minister has 
failed to put teeth in our law and propose minimum penalties. 
Hopefully the Canadian Alliance can have the Liberals fix this 
matter at the committee stage of the bill's progress through the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more work for the government to do.  Like so many of 
their attempts to legislate, this is only half a job.  They are 
botching the job.  We want to support this legislation and at the 
same time we want it to be right.  It is a good thing that we are 
here to hold the flashlight for this weak Liberal government that 
lacks vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms mentioned in the bill are not defined.  The 
government, in one bill, is mixing various issues that do not 
have much correlation.  The bill is like mixing apples and 
oranges.  The bill is half cooked.  It is like a bitter medicine 
mixed with a little sugar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will propose amendments during the committee stage that will 
attempt to clarify and bring consensus to the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for his 
comments.  We have concerns, but what about actual cruelty to 
animals?  Could the member elaborate on where he stands with 
respect to animal cruelty?  When animals are being injured in 
very inhumane ways, what does he think we should be doing in 
those cases? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  It gives me the opportunity to express 
how I feel about cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a person with a very soft heart.  At home when I have some 
insects such as spiders or flies in the house, I take five or ten 
minutes to catch them, put them in a container, carry them 
outside and let them enjoy nature's freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite tough on the issue of those people who are injuring 
animals or inflicting pain on animals.  It is fun for some people 
but that is not the way we in the civilized world should behave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in this bill the definition of cruelty is not mentioned 
anywhere.  For example, with respect to those people who fish, 
probably in the view of other people they are causing pain and 
suffering to the fish they catch, as a fish is a living animal, 
but those people enjoy it.  Other people are complete vegetarians 
who do not eat meat at all.  Another extreme is those who butcher 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe cruelty is a relative term.  For some people something 
is cruel and for others it is not, but if there were a Liberal 
member speaking on this bill I would stand up and ask what the 
definition of cruelty is in this bill.  Also, there are so many 
other terms that should be included in this bill.  The sad part 
is that the government members are not giving any interest to 
this.  At this time there is only one member listening to this 
debate.  I wonder why the members are not showing an interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
hon. member that we do not comment on the presence or absence of 
members in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for his views, 
because it is extremely difficult to find a line, on what we are 
going to have to do as legislators, between someone who is 
obviously cruel with a puppy mill or something, which most 
Canadians would clearly say is over the line, and the other side. 
On the other side, it may be a mousetrap, rat poison or an 
agricultural issue like the branding of cattle, which is a 
standard practice in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member see us finding that legislative balance so 
that we end up with legislation that is firm and shows the legal 
system where we stand?  If we leave it loose and open we know we 
are going to end up having the judiciary set the rules instead of 
Parliament.  Perhaps the member could give us his views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member's 
question is one that pertains to many other bills as well. 
Sometimes in the House we get one page or two pages of a bill. In 
this case, for example, we have only two pages of the bill, or if 
I may say so, maybe about eight pages of the bill.  Certain 
things, which become very important, are not defined at all in 
the bill.  No line has been drawn as to what means what, as to 
what the terms and conditions are.  The government leaves it for 
interpretation either by the judiciary or in the realm of 
regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am chair of the scrutiny of regulations committee and I can 
tell the House that the regulations put forward by the government 
are a big mess.  Some of the regulations that should not exist 
today have been in the pipeline for 25 years.  Those regulations 
violate the terms and conditions of many issues.  They should not 
exist. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1615

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, those regulations continue because from time to time we 
and the committees have been stonewalled by the ministers, the 
departments and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadians expect much more clarity and precision 
from the government so that when a bill comes before the House it 
shows that there is something really concrete in it. It cannot 
mix apples and oranges as it has done in this one and it has not 
defined many terms, conditions and definitions in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that that is the way this is going.  It is very 
unclear and very unprofessional.  It shows that the government 
really does not care about fixing things.  Sometimes it just 
wants to get political brownie points and that is not fair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to 
take this chance to comment on this because in my riding the 
issue of cruelty to animals is the one which I have received the 
most mail on in my three and a half years as a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is significant to mention that the letters are from trappers 
and hunters who support the legislation against cruelty to 
animals.  These are people who have been targeted over the years 
and have been accused of cruelty and inhumanity.  In fact, they 
are people who make their living in the most humane way that they 
know how and carry out their jobs in that manner.  It is a very 
difficult living to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also received letters of support for this legislation from 
other people.  The thoughts that came through most clearly were 
people's true concerns that we use animals and take their lives 
so that we can live and eat, particularly in communities that 
live on a subsistence of hunting, fishing and trapping and when 
we do it that it be done with the regard for other lives in this 
world, not just our own and that people who live that way not do 
it cruelly and do it for reason.  They also wanted people to know 
that they did not look at it as inhumane or cruel to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wanted to bring it up because it is important to note 
that the support has come from young people, from old people, 
from first nations and from the conservation and humane societies 
in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a concern which 
is very near and dear to our hearts.  We believe that humanity is 
one aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been getting letters from my constituents as well.  One 
was from a person who had been driving on a freeway behind a 
truck loaded with poultry.  Some of the birds fell out of the 
truck, some had been put in small cages and it was hot.  That was 
inhumane.  We believe that is why we have this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly believe in and support the intent of the government, 
but we are not comfortable with the way it has put things 
together in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is not one single Canadian who likes to see 
cruelty to animals.  We all want the same thing.  We want the 
objective to be achieved, but in a professional way so that we do 
not compromise the interests of our agricultural community, the 
animal husbandry community, the poultry farmers and other people 
who deal with animals on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should come up with a middle of the road approach 
whereby cruelty to animals is prevented while at the same time 
taking care of the interests of farmers, the agricultural 
community, hunters and others. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to talk about Bill C-17, the cruelty 
to animals legislation.  As stated before, there are three 
sections of this act which I will touch on briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One section would make it a very serious criminal offence to 
attempt to disarm a police officer.  I think all members in the 
House will support that.  It is a very positive concern.  There 
are some technical amendments with respect to the Firearms Act. 
Again, we have no problem with that.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very supportive of legislation that makes it tougher for 
people who are cruel to animals.  I will raise a few concerns in 
a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look back at an incident that happened in Victoria when I was 
elected as an MP.  It outraged the entire community.  My riding 
is Saanich—Gulf Islands which is very close to Victoria.  In 
this case, a person had been following a vehicle that stopped at 
a red light.  They say it was road rage, but for no reason he 
took a golf club and almost killed the dog in the back seat of 
the vehicle which was in front of him because the vehicle was not 
moving.  It was tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was charged under the current criminal code section 445.  I 
remember the public was up in arms.  To the credit of Judge 
Higinbotham of the Victoria provincial court, I thought he dealt 
with the matter quite appropriately.  It was quite a severe 
sentence.  I believe, if my memory serves me correctly, it was 
something in the order of 18 months because that was not 
acceptable behaviour within our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge that in the current sections with respect to 
cruelty to animals under the criminal code, I believe there is 
lots of room for improvement.  Section 445 is the relevant 
section where if somebody does injure dogs, birds and other 
animals that person is guilty of an offence punishable upon 
summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has recognized that we can improve these.  I 
question whether it is appropriate to move this cruelty to 
animals section from property offences over to the sexual 
offences section in the criminal code.  I personally do not 
believe that is an appropriate move although it is not the end of 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A sexual offence is one of the most intrusive invasions into 
one's privacy that one could ever imagine.  That section should 
be left as a very serious section.  I am not minimizing this at 
all but probably a better way to have gone would have been to 
tighten up these sections on cruelty to animals in the property 
sections of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has selected to go this way.  We have heard the 
concerns of some people.  They are worried about people who are 
in the ranching and cattle industry.  We have trappers, 
especially those people in the aboriginal and Inuit communities 
who live in the far north.  A large part of their livelihoods is 
based on fishing.  It is open for broad interpretation.  I do not 
think anybody's intentions are misguided but there are some 
concerns as to how it will be interpreted at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an opportunity, we will be putting amendments 
forward to hopefully tighten these up.  I think it is in the 
interest of all Canadians.  Quite often we see legislation that 
is left open and loose and is not defined as well as it could be. 
It ends in lengthy court trials, appeals which then go to higher 
courts to interpret the legislation.  If we can do anything to 
rectify that before the legislation is passed that would be a 
positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is the sealing industry.  It has been open to 
debate for years.  For sealers it has been their livelihood.  It 
has been a way of life, both economically and culturally for a 
lot of people in Atlantic Canada.  They use what is called a 
hackpic to club the adult seals over the head.  Some might argue 
that would be a violation under this section of the act and some 
people would probably believe that it is, but there is lots of 
evidence to support that it is the most humane way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Yukon stated, there are people from where she 
is from who are in the trapping industry. 
She stated that they try in the most humane way possible to carry 
out their livelihood and they have been doing it for years.  We 
have to be cognizant of those situations.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is room in the bill to make some of these improvements.  I 
would have rather seen the sections that we are dealing with 
amending sections 444 to 446 in the criminal code, but that is 
not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to impress upon people following this debate that it is 
an important piece of legislation.  I am absolutely opposed to 
people who are unnecessarily cruel to animals.  It is just not 
acceptable.   It should be a criminal offence and people should 
be dealt with accordingly by the courts.  That is not something 
that society is going to tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly the concerns that we have will be addressed when we 
vote.  To get some of these amendments through which we think 
will improve the legislation will be a positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased that the section on disarming a police 
officer is in the bill.  I know some argue whether the two should 
be combined in one bill.  I understand that.  It probably would 
make some sense not try to combine everything in one bill rather 
we could have separate bills.  I would have rather seen that 
section on disarming police officers with a lot of other sections 
in the criminal code which need improvement and which Canadians 
are waiting for, for example, property offences.  There are many 
suggestions where we can improve on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for changes to our criminal code where we 
put the rights of victims ahead of that of the criminals. There 
are many instances that suggest that we are not.  I know the 
victims are very frustrated, threatened and feel they do not have 
a voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we are taking steps to make sure that 
interests of animals are taken into account and that we are 
bringing in tougher measures against people who are inhumane to 
animals.  Again, that is a positive step subject to some of the 
concerns that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been much more acceptable had the government, 
since its election three years ago, chosen to deal with some of 
these other issues.  We are in the process of debating the 
changes to the Young Offenders Act and will be voting on them 
very shortly.  We are debating the Group No. 1 amendments at 
report stage.  The government has done little more than tinker 
with the Young Offenders Act.  It has done very little as opposed 
to its major overhaul of the section in the criminal code dealing 
with cruelty to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question the wisdom of the government on its priorities, which 
may be somewhat skewed, when it will not address these other 
concerns.  We have put amendments forward to deal with these 
concerns.  We think it will strengthen the bill.  All members of 
the House, all 301 of us, are all opposed to cruelty to animals. 
All of us have heard horror stories.  Society is not going to 
accept that type of behaviour and such people need to be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to the government's credit that it has brought in the 
section with respect to the disarming of police officers.  That 
is a very positive clause in the bill.  Some may question whether 
this is the bill that it should be in, but regardless of that it 
has been brought in and I think that is a positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there are a few other areas that some of my 
colleagues have mentioned. 
They have done things such as imposing a lifetime ban on owning 
an animal.  I guess that is subject to the interpretation of the 
courts.  Some would question whether that is an appropriate use.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say in the broadest terms that bringing in legislation 
that will let society and our courts be a lot tougher with people 
who are abusive of animals is a move in the right direction. 
There are some concerns.  Hopefully they will be addressed and we 
can move forward, as we have some very positive amendments that 
will strengthen the bill, and not have to leave it to the 
interpretation of the courts at a later date. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, CHST. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, immediately prior to coming to the House I was on 
the telephone with some people in my constituency and I was 
rather surprised by their lack of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has come forward at the will of the justice minister. 
It is a bill that has been before the Commons for a period of 
time.  I have attempted to get some information out to people in 
my constituency about it.  However it is probably indicative of 
the kind of process the government gets involved in quite 
frequently.  It takes a look at its idea of what is required in 
terms of legislation and then proceeds to do it.  It does not 
take the time or make any effort to make people who will be 
affected by the legislation aware of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with the cruelty to animals provisions of the 
bill primarily, but I would also like to comment on the fact 
that, as has already been said in the House, this is an omnibus 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was Prime Minister Trudeau who, at least in my 
time, was the first Prime Minister noted by journalists as 
treating the House of Commons in a perverse way, rather 
disrespectfully.  To his mind, the House of Commons was a rubber 
stamp that was required in order for him to be able to come 
forward with the kind of legislation he wanted for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, following Prime Minister Trudeau and then through 
Prime Minister Turner, the new member for Kings—Hants, the 
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and now the current Prime 
Minister, we have a continuation of the process.  The 
bureaucracy, perhaps pushed by its perception of public opinion, 
and the cabinet, perhaps pushed by its perception of public 
opinion, although mostly rounded out and buffeted by the concept 
of political correctness, end up coming forward with pieces of 
legislation that in their judgment are essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, as I have stated, an omnibus bill.  An omnibus bill 
basically combines all sorts of unrelated provisions.  The only 
relationship the provisions in the bill have to one another is 
that they happen to come under the control of the justice 
department, hence the justice minister.  That is the only 
connection between any of the matters in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us presume we have some serious concerns about the 
provisions of the cruelty to animals portion of the bill, I in 
particular, representing a dominantly rural constituency.  We 
have agricultural producers who are involved in raising cattle 
and all sorts of other livestock.  We have poultry farms and 
dairy operations.  In addition, as it happens, I have probably 
the best big game hunting, certainly in North America if not in 
the world, in my constituency, it being right in the core of the 
Canadian Rockies.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of concern on the part of people in my 
constituency, whether they are directly involved in the business 
of agriculture, where they are directly dealing with domestic 
animals, or whether they are hunting and fishing guides and 
people involved with animals in that way.  With that as a 
background, let us presume that there are some concerns.  I will 
be relating some of them in just a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult enough for a member representing a rural 
community such as I do, Kootenay—Columbia, to try to send a 
message to the Canadian people.  I have given up long since 
trying to send a message to cabinet, because it does not listen 
anyway.  I will try to send a message to the Canadian people, 
either through the broadcast of this debate or to those people 
taking the time to read <I>Hansard</I>, about the difficulties 
there are from an urban-rural perspective.  That is difficult 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the complete disregard of the parliamentary 
process, which was started by Prime Minister Trudeau and 
continued through the successive prime ministers.  We have the 
situation where governments then bring forward pieces of 
legislation such as the business about the removal of a peace 
officer's firearm and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in the world could not support that?  We look at that 
provision of the bill and say to ourselves “Are there not an 
awful lot of other provisions with respect to firearms and peace 
officers that we could be addressing in a more substantive way 
than the tinkering that is going on in this bill?”  The 
provisions in the bill with respect to the firearms of peace 
officers are certainly supportable.  It is just regrettable that 
the bill does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as there is the disregard of the government for the 
opposition and for the parliamentary process, as long as there is 
a continuation of this attitude on the part of the present 
Liberal government that treats the House of Commons as a rubber 
stamp, basically a situation is created of it being exceptionally 
difficult for an official opposition that is attempting to be 
responsible in bringing representations and concerns of their 
constituents, and indeed all Canadians, to the Chamber.  It is 
exceptionally difficult for us to be able to make any separation 
or distinction between these two parts of this omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not picking fly droppings out of the pepper.  This is 
not trying to get down to the minutiae.  This indeed is a 
fundamental problem with the government, in continuing the policy 
of treating the House as a rubber stamp for legislation that they 
in their wisdom have crowned and anointed and that has come from 
the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, let us look at the provisions with 
respect to the criminal sanctions for actions against animals 
under the cruelty to animals part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a summary from some people in my constituency who have 
looked at the bill.  They have, for example, a concern about the 
definition of animal.  The department argues that providing a 
definition where one does not currently exist will provide a 
narrower definition and at the same time provide added clarity. 
The new definition would include non-human vertebrates and all 
animals having the capacity to experience pain.  The concern of 
some of the people in my constituency is that this marks a 
significant change by adding animals not traditionally considered 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarification could cause enormous problems by extending 
criminal law to animals, including but not limited to free 
ranging wildlife, invertebrates, and cold blooded animals such as 
fish.  Coupled with the move out of the property section, 
including a definition will serve as a first step in elevating 
the status of animals and giving all animals a standing in law. 
This indeed is new ground.  This indeed is new territory for us 
to be going into.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken a look at this piece of legislation, and as with 
virtually all the pieces of legislation the Liberals have brought 
forward in this parliament, there is one egregious flaw.  The 
egregious flaw in virtually every piece of legislation the 
government brings forward is that there is not a sufficient 
preamble.  If there were a sufficient preamble we could then work 
on the issue of parliament defining for the courts what is 
actually intended before this gets into a court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many other concerns with the bill.  I look forward to the 
bill going to committee where I hope many of the concerns of 
people such as my constituents can be brought forward.  I hope 
the bill, which presently is just too broad-brush, will be able 
to be refined and defined.  I also hope the government will take 
the time, energy and effort to see that people who will be 
affected by it are given more information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we have heard quite a bit today, but I would like to ask 
my colleague from Kootenay—Columbia to elaborate a little more 
on one of the issues he touched on, the issue of the rural-urban 
split that seems to be part of the cruelty to animals 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parts of the legislation that deal with the disarming of a 
police officer and some amendments to the gun registry are things 
we can all support, but the fear that there is a rural-urban 
split, even if that does exist, should not be there.  We must 
realize that there are codes of practice by which our livestock 
producers live and have lived. There are no better tenders of 
animals than they are because their livelihood depends on taking 
good care of the animals they raise for food for the rest of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we went through this process, quite a few letters supporting 
the bill came in from the SPCA organizations in different cities. 
We were also drawn to the other side by people in the 
agricultural community who were concerned about some of the 
aspects of the bill that could harm their practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel there is a way the bill can be adjusted 
that would appease the concerns of the people on both sides of 
the issue?  Certainly anybody who harms an animal should face 
full consequences, but is there any way we can make this work to 
keep both sides of the argument onside on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to deal with 
the member's question in two parts.  First, with respect to the 
rural-urban split, hard to believe though it may be, there are 
three, four, five, and six year old children in Canada who have 
never walked in a garden, have never seen carrots grow and have 
no idea where they come from, have never seen tomatoes grow and 
have no idea where they come from.  All they know is when they 
sit down at a table with the food in front of them, there is a 
hot dog and there are buns or whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is there is a lack of understanding.  I do not 
believe at all that it is an intentional lack of understanding, 
but there is nonetheless a lack of understanding by people who 
have not been involved in any way, shape, or form with the 
agricultural industry, whether it is fruit and vegetables or 
animals.  There is a complete lack of understanding, a 
disconnectedness, in society.  People simply do not understand 
where the food on their plate comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the vast majority of farms, farmers clearly understand the 
animals.  The animals are not only their livelihood.  They are 
the protectors.  They are the people who are working with humane 
practices.  It is those people who are most concerned about the 
bill because it has such a pet implication as opposed to a 
domestic animal implication or connection.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the second part of my colleague's question, that is 
indeed what we are involved with in parliament and within the 
parliamentary process.  When we get into committee we will have 
an opportunity to hear that.  I would hope that the committee 
looking at this will take every opportunity to have input so that 
we make sure that the people who know and respect the 
agricultural animals they are tending will have an opportunity to 
have input into this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that it would not be the intention of the government 
or any other government to see criminal sanctions against people 
who are in the business of rearing and slaughtering livestock so 
that we can indeed have food on our tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, I am looking forward to hearing about the committee 
process.  Certainly I am hoping the government is going to have a 
very broad brush so that we do not end up with a pet mentality 
applied to farmers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in the introduction to my speech, I would like to read 
the title of this bill so that everybody who is listening 
recognizes exactly what we are up to here.  Second, I will look 
at exactly what the implications are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is entitled “An Act to amend the Criminal Code (cruelty 
to animals, disarming a peace officer and other amendments) and 
the Firearms Act (technical amendments)”.  Here we have a bill 
with very far-reaching implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the summary of the bill, we will recognize that 
the bill has indeed moved into areas that are very far-reaching 
and have implications not only for the present generation but 
also for generations to come.  For instance, it amends the 
criminal code by: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) consolidating animal cruelty offences into one section and 
introducing new offences for brutally or viciously killing an 
animal or abandoning one; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) creating an offence of disarming, or attempting to disarm, a 
peace officer; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) making a number of technical amendments. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent being envisioned by the summary and also by the title 
of the bill clearly invokes and evokes a certain empathy.  There 
is not one of us in the House who would not find ourselves very 
much in sympathy with and in support of what the bill is 
purporting to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the introduction, I would suggest that the bill is rather 
far-reaching.  In fact, many people would label a bill of this 
type an omnibus bill.  An omnibus bill suffers from two kinds of 
characteristics.  First, there is too much in it for people to 
really understand it all.  Second, it is too general in some of 
its indications, so not enough attention has been given to 
clearly define or to give clear direction to what is intended. 
My hon. colleague talked about a preamble; in a bill like this 
one, a preamble is doubly important.  Third, in certain other 
areas the bill is a little too specific in that it does not allow 
flexibility, which might otherwise be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, the bill is sound.  Who in his right mind would 
not want to live in a society that is peaceful and orderly?  Who 
in his right mind would not take offence that anybody should even 
dare to disarm a peace officer?  Clearly we would not want that 
to take place.  This bill brings that particular thing into focus 
by saying that it is a criminal offence and should not be 
tolerated in society.  I think we would all agree with that.  I 
certainly do.  That principle is sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of this legislation goes to the punishment of 
those who would cruelly use or abuse animals, both pets and other 
animals.  I do not think any one of us would say that we are for 
being cruel to animals.  Of course we are not.  We do not want to 
be.  It is ridiculous to even suggest that there are other 
creatures on the face of the earth and one of our purposes is to 
be cruel to them.  We do not want to do that.  This bill makes 
that a criminal offence.  That is good.  We can support those 
kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to the business of saying that disarming a peace 
officer becomes an indictable offence and if that is the case 
then under certain conditions there will be an imprisonment of up 
to five years. 
When it is a summary conviction, which in technical jargon is 
slightly different, the maximum punishment is 18 months.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big issue here is that it is a punishable offence and people 
who do these kinds of things ought to be treated with that kind 
of awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another principle involved here.  If we as a society 
want to live a peaceful, ordered life we must have people who 
from time to time protect us against those who want to disturb 
the peace, who do not want to have a decent lifestyle and want to 
interfere with ours.  We need to equip these people.  We need to 
protect these people.  We need to give them the background and 
the information so that they can indeed provide for the peace, 
order and good government that we all want so much.  I think we 
would all support this provision in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the other part, the amendments to the firearms 
legislation, we ask ourselves, what is all this?  When we analyze 
what the amendments are we discover that they are all very 
technical and could almost be interpreted as being cosmetic in 
nature.  There is not much to offend there.  However, the 
question then becomes, how will that actually change anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it is necessary in certain cases because there is a 
grandfathering of certain things here.  There is the training of 
employees who sell handguns.  I think that is all very good.  One 
could argue that it is just plain common sense.  I guess the 
Liberal government thinks that common sense is so rare that it 
has to write it into legislation.  If that is the case, then it 
is a good thing it is in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of this, though, leads to something that I cannot 
resist.  I must refer to the Liberals' Firearms Act, which they 
introduced here some time ago.  It came in the form of Bill C-68. 
That particular piece of legislation is so badly flawed that if 
they really want to make a difference what they should do, at the 
minimum, is to take our 200 amendments that we proposed at report 
stage and implement them.  That would help make the legislation a 
little more meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you know, the Minister of Justice knows, the Prime 
Minister knows, the RCMP knows and all the police officers know 
that particular piece of legislation is not working. It has not 
reduced violent crime.  It has not come even close to being a 
reasonable implementation scheme.  Already $328 million has been 
spent.  We were told it was going to cost less than $100 million. 
It is well over three times that number now.  We have to take a 
very caustic look at that particular piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that we really have not given the firearms 
legislation appropriate attention in the provisions of this bill. 
In fact, we could go even one step further.  Police associations 
in Canada are considering withdrawing their support for the 
legislation.  So with regard to this piece of legislation and 
putting this little cosmetic change in there, while it does not 
cause us any problem, it does not deal with the more serious case 
of the firearms legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn my attention to the provisions in the bill with 
respect to cruelty to animals.  I want to focus on two particular 
aspects of this part of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want it clearly understood by all persons in the House 
listening to me now that we really want to support the idea that 
people who are wilfully cruel to animals should be punished 
severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what the bill proposes is that it should delete from 
existing legislation the words “wilful neglect” and “marked 
departure from the exercise of reasonable care”.  When a person 
wilfully neglects an animal, that is being cruel to that animal. 
If that individual does not take reasonable care of an animal and 
departs from reasonable care, and does so in a very marked and 
obvious way, such a person should, in my opinion, be very 
severely chastised.  No, they should be punished.  This bill does 
that, but by removing words like “wilful” and “marked 
departure” it creates ambiguity and lack of clarity and allows 
for interpretations that really give inadequate direction to the 
people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one has to do with “wilful” and wilfully being cruel 
to animals, directly.  I know some young people who do terribly 
cruel things.  I once saw this happen and it was awful.  They 
wanted to kill this kitten.  They put a string around its neck 
and threw it from the top of a barn and let it hang there.  That 
is wilful cruelty and that should be punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are penalties in this act, and I think the penalties show 
the severity with which we will consider these particular acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are really going to get serious about this, we have to 
recognize that certain amendments are necessary.  As this bill 
now goes to committee, there are certain amendments that I would 
certainly encourage the Liberals to consider at that time.  We 
will be moving an amendment, for example, to have animal cruelty 
provisions maintained in sections 444 to 446 or to make the 
necessary changes to proposed section 182.1 to comply with the 
concerns of farmers, hunters, agriculture groups, the fur trade 
and others who harvest animals.  This falls outside the things 
that we talked about just now.  We need to bring those things in 
so that it is clear and specific and all people understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in another example of an amendment, we will be moving an 
amendment at committee stage to ensure legitimate individuals 
involved in animal operations are not unduly subject to criminal 
intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments, and there will be others, quite a few of them, 
are necessary to make this bill do what it is intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Liberal government for the intention of its bill, 
but I would also remind it that we all agree on what should be 
happening here, and with the best of intentions, even a good bill 
can be improved by bringing certain amendments to it, which the 
official opposition will present.  I would encourage the Liberals 
to please consider those amendments so that we can all live 
together in greater peace and harmony and have legislation that 
is even better than that which they have presented to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the comments of my 
colleague.  Of course we are coming at it from very much the same 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that seemed to be of greatest concern to the 
people in my constituency was the issue of the potential for 
there to be nuisance prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I have never been to a branding, where you bring in 
all of the calves from the range around May or so.  There is 
really quite a wild event that goes on there.  There is not only 
branding of the cattle, but the male species of the animal also 
undergoes another process that they probably are not all that 
crazy about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all of these things that go on.  In taking a look at 
some of the irresponsible actions that have been perpetrated 
against the people who are involved in responsible resource 
extraction and management, such as people in forestry and logging 
and that kind of thing in the province of British Columbia and 
indeed all across Canada, and some of the nuisance prosecutions 
that have actually occurred, whereby people who have been 
protesting have used every possible means to put over their 
particular point of view and perspective, I wonder if there is 
not the very real possibility that because of the apparent lack 
of definition within this bill we could end up with these kinds 
of nuisance prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could end up with that in regard to people who are deriving 
their income from providing an exceptionally valuable service to 
the people of Canada by providing us with the livestock that 
becomes the bacon, the roasts of beef, the hamburgers, whatever 
the case may be.  As we take a look at that process and at there 
being some nuisance people, might that not in fact be a concern 
that we really should be focusing on, particularly when this goes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
raising that very valid issue.  I did not raise it in my major 
remarks because I did not have time to do it.  It gives me the 
opportunity to address the point of bringing together the 
urban-rural split to which the member alluded in his earlier 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of pet owners say that they fixed their cat or dog.  We 
know exactly what that means.  This is precisely the same thing 
the member alluded to in his remarks.  There is a distinct 
possibility of nuisance lawsuits, criticisms or whatever to be 
fostered.  The act should be clear enough so that those nuisance 
assaults on the freedom of an individual, or whatever we might 
call them, are addressed and clearly taken outside the cruelty to 
animals provisions within the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what our amendments will try to do.  It would 
bring those kinds of issues to the attention of the government so 
that it could create legislation with which we can all live and 
actually make society better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Kelowna raised an very interesting 
point.  Someone was telling me a couple of days ago when we were 
discussing this issue that people could not believe that calves 
would be castrated without an anaesthetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand people who are in the business very clearly 
and specifically understand how totally ludicrous it would be to 
administer a form of anaesthetic in the situation they are in, 
what would happen, and the havoc it would wreak in terms of the 
management of livestock.  Clearly we are dealing with an 
egregious urban-rural split in understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague would agree with me that it puts all the 
more emphasis on the committee process to ensure that people who 
are at the committee have an opportunity to present both sides of 
the story.  In addition, the government should undertake a very 
strong communication policy so that people understand what it is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again I find myself 
agreeing with my colleague.  I would add one other dimension to 
it.  I am referring to the process that is being used by the 
government to almost make the committee non-significant.  The 
legislation has drawn to the attention of the House the real 
significance of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be proposing some very substantive amendments to the 
legislation to uplift the importance of committees in the House 
and parliament.  As a consequence, if the government will take 
that advice, the committees will feel good.  Members in those 
committees will not have to whine like they did in the 
<I>National Post</I> this morning, and we will be able to live in 
a better world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will stick pretty close to my text so it will not be 
as entertaining as some of my speeches.  We are speaking to Bill 
C-17.  It is an omnibus bill, basically a bill encompassing many 
acts in the one bill.  That is obviously problematic for many 
members because if we disagree with one aspect of the bill we are 
labelled as disagreeing with all of it.  That is not our position 
as a party and I will be able to lay that out in some of my 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 is an act to amend the criminal code, cruelty to 
animals, disarming a peace officer, other amendments, and some 
technical amendments to the Firearms Act.  It is very far ranging 
and there is no linkage between any aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the justice department review of 1998 a consultation paper 
entitled Crimes Against Animals was distributed to allow groups 
and individuals to suggest modifications that would be required 
to deal effectively with cruelty to animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasoning was that animal abuse is now recognized as a 
common symptom of a deeper mental illness.  Mounting scientific 
evidence links animal abuse, domestic violence and violence 
against people. 
The public has been calling for more effective federal 
legislation to deal with cases of cruelty to animals.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples of cruelty to animals.  Several high 
profile cases, some of which have been mentioned already in the 
House and in the newspapers, happened this year.  A year old 
rottweiler dog was dragged on a chain behind a pickup truck until 
its paws were torn off and bloodied.  Also in May there was a 
case of a little pet pomeranian which was locked in a room.  This 
small dog was kicked, punched, thrown against a wall and placed 
on a gas barbeque possibly while it was still alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the types of horrific crimes we are hearing about more 
frequently.  The perpetrators were young offenders, identities 
protected unfortunately.  Currently in such cases an offender 
would receive only six months in jail or a $2,000 fine and a two 
year ban on having animals.  Who would know what young offenders 
would get?  Maybe a slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still hear many cases of animal fighting, competitions for 
gambling purposes and greyhound dogs that are bred for racing but 
killed once they become too old.  Questions are being asked.  Is 
there any protection for those animals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister has explicitly linked animal abuse to rape 
or child abuse citing U.S. studies which point out that those who 
torture animals were more likely to do the same to humans.  The 
case we have often heard is that of Jeffrey Dahmer who brutally 
dismembered and even practised cannibalism on his many victims. 
He abused animals as a young boy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these people increased sentences and fines are a good idea. 
We have to send a message.  Depending on the charge, the sentence 
could be anywhere from two years to a maximum of five years 
imprisonment when the crown proceeded by indictment, or six to 
eighteen months imprisonment and a fine of not more than $2,000 
when the crown proceeded by way of summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the court could order prohibiting the accused from 
owning an animal or having custody or control of an animal.  In 
Bill C-17 the court could also prohibit the accused from residing 
in the same premises as an animal.  The maximum length of 
prohibition would also be changed from a maximum of two years to 
any period the court felt appropriate.  In the case of second and 
subsequent offences it would be a minimum of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a further change the accused would pay reasonable costs 
incurred to take care of the animal.  Payment could be made to 
any individual or organization that cared for the animal.  It 
would include such costs as veterinarian bills and other shelter 
costs if they were obtainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other positive steps in the bill.  We need to study 
the bill very closely at committee stage.  We will be doing that 
through our justice critic to be sure that we do not criminalize, 
and this is important to remember, farmers, hunters, trappers and 
fishermen engaging in their way of life.  Presently the bill is 
too loosely worded and our party cannot support that aspect of 
it.  We have to tighten up the wording in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation farmers feel they could be 
prosecuted for common practices such as branding or dehorning 
cattle, an accepted practice in the beef industry.  This is very 
problematic.  Some anglers are convinced that fishermen could be 
charged for simply hooking a fish under the proposed federal 
legislation.  This problem has to be addressed and hopefully will 
be addressed at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed worry that Bill C-17 
might interfere with ritual Jewish slaughter methods.  Biomedical 
researchers are worried that their work may lead to criminal 
prosecution as well.  Some of these groups have requested that 
the language in the legislation be clarified.  They are concerned 
with possible interpretation of phrases such as unnecessary pain, 
suffering or injury and brutally or viciously killing an animal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want protection for practices such as identification, 
medical treatment, spaying or neutering; provision of food or 
other animal products; hunting, trapping, fishing and other 
sporting activities conducted in accordance with the lawful rules 
relating to them; pest, predator or disease control as we would 
not want to throw someone in jail for shooting a rat; protection 
of persons or property; scientific research unless the risk of 
injury or serious physical pain is disproportionate to the 
benefit expected from the research; and disciplining or training 
of an animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party position is clear that legislation is needed to punish 
those who intentionally abuse and neglect animals.  Let us be 
sure of that.  However, in targeting those who intentionally 
cause animal suffering, the legislation also leaves at risk those 
who practise traditional occupations such as farming, hunting, 
fishing and trapping.  Those of us representing rural areas of 
the country can certainly relate to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support other aspects of the bill.  We recognize that the 
legislative section to protect against cruelty to animals is 
noble in its intention.  This oversight makes Bill C-17 
ineffective and dangerous to law-abiding citizens.  Therefore the 
bill, if it remains in its current form, will not be supported by 
our party.  We want some tightening of the wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been scrambling to assure hunters and farmers 
that the bill is not intended to target them and that they need 
not worry about being jailed for their standard practices. 
However the current wording of the bill is too loose and criminal 
prosecution of members of virtually all animal related 
professions is a very real legal possibility under the provisions 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing legislation forbids the wilful causing of 
unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal.  The proposed 
bill would remove the word wilful.  This change would make 
prosecution easier, putting livestock farmers at risk for 
carrying out their normal business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the criminal code currently prohibits unnecessary 
pain, suffering or injury of animals.  With one of the new animal 
care provisions, however, conviction is called for when there is 
any pain, suffering or injury.  The proposed change reveals 
unreasonable expectations.  It is impossible for farmers, or 
animal producers more generally speaking, to protect their 
animals from any pain or injury.  Additionally it is unacceptable 
to place farmers, hunters or trappers at risk of prosecution if 
any pain or injury occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe legislation is needed to prevent needless animal pain 
and suffering.  The graphic illustrations of animal cruelty I 
mentioned earlier should not be tolerated.  The law should 
explicitly protect animals from this senseless violence.  The 
traditional practices of hunting, fishing, farming, et cetera, do 
not fit into the category of meanspirited violence.  It is 
imperative that animal cruelty legislation be clearly designed to 
target only those who would engage in brutal actions against 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister has been contemplating an amendment that 
would exempt farmers, hunters and animal researchers from the 
bill.  A change is certainly needed to provide legal security to 
lawful practitioners of animal related professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one considers a genuine need for clear progressive 
legislation in this area, the carelessness of the Liberal 
government is dismaying.  It is disheartening.  It is obvious 
that little consideration was given to the effect the bill would 
have on many honest hardworking people who depend on farming and 
similar occupations for their livelihood.  It is reminiscent of 
many pieces of legislation the government has put through.  Not 
much foresight, work or consultation with the community has gone 
into it.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also discouraging that the government's lack of foresight 
could cause this bill which deals with many other issues to be 
opposed due to loose wording in the part dealing with cruelty to 
animals, hence our opposition to these omnibus bills. They are 
very problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of contemplating its actions fully from the start the 
government chose to proceed with a sloppy piece of legislation. 
Now as it is exceedingly clear that the original plan was 
inadequate, the government wants to retrace its steps.  Had it 
been more conscientious at the beginning, this repetition would 
have been avoided.  Time and money have been squandered as a 
result of the failure of the government to consider the needs and 
wants of Canadians on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having grown up on a farm in New Brunswick has given me a great 
respect for animals but also a respect for farmers, hunters and 
trappers.  For that reason I am anxious to see the bill go to 
committee where our justice critic will have a chance to force 
the government to redraft the cruelty to animals part to ensure 
that it will be an effective deterrent to those who would be 
unnecessarily cruel to an animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form the loose wording of the bill could make 
unwitting criminals out of hunters, fishermen and farmers. We 
will not support this part of the bill because of this loose 
wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disarming a police officer is another part of the bill of which 
we are very supportive.  The offence of disarming or attempting 
to disarm a police officer is a proposal initiated by suggestions 
by the Canadian Police Association at its annual general meeting 
a year ago. We need to send a strong message to the public. 
Serious danger to police officers will not be tolerated when they 
are deprived of their weapons as they carry out investigations to 
make arrests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new section would define “weapon” for the purposes of 
subsection (1) as any thing that is designed to be used to cause 
injury or death to, or to temporarily incapacitate a person, 
including firearms, pepper spray, et cetera.  For a hybrid 
offence, there is a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment 
when the crown proceeds by indictment or a minimum of 18 months 
imprisonment when the crown proceeds by summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Canadian Police Association, the 
organization that initiated the process leading to the proposed 
offence of disarming a police officer, has stated that the 
members of the association “welcome the introduction of this new 
law and encourage its speedy passage by parliament”.  We are 
very supportive of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could do more for police, including providing 
funding and the resources they need to do their job. However, 
this is a step in the right direction at very little cost to the 
government to help protect the police so they can protect us, the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other amendments to the criminal code.  The definition 
of “child” in the criminal code section dealing with offences 
against the person and reputation is repealed.  The current 
definition defines child as including an adopted child and an 
illegitimate child.  The amendment would remove the negative and 
unnecessary reference to “illegitimate child” in the criminal 
code.  We support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sexual exploitation of a person with a disability is added to 
the list of other criminal code sexual offences for which there 
are special evidentiary rules.  A person with a disability who 
was the victim of sexual exploitation would receive the same 
evidentiary protection as afforded to other victims who testify 
at a trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are technical amendments to the Firearms Act. I think the 
government is backpedalling on this.  Our position is very clear. 
The government botched the firearms legislation from the very 
beginning in basically attempting to make criminals out of 
law-abiding Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party would certainly repeal Bill C-68, the unnecessary 
licensing and registration of firearms which again relates to 
those very sectors we talked about earlier.  Our position on that 
is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it is a case of the government bringing in very sloppy 
legislation, not knowing what it was doing.  Instead of 
addressing the criminal element, which it could by putting 
resources into the RCMP and other police forces to help them do 
their jobs well and effectively, it has targeted the innocent 
law-abiding Canadian.  Therefore we are opposed to that 
legislation.  We were opposed to it in 1997.  We still have huge 
reservations on the firearms legislation and we would repeal 
that.  We would kill it or change it and revert to what we used 
to have. I think our position on that is pretty clear.  We would 
repeal that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments to the Firearms Act are being called 
technical amendments.  These amendments are being brought in 
because the government is attempting to backpedal on that very 
onerous piece of legislation which was called Bill C-68 in the 
last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is clear on Bill C-17. Our justice critic has led 
the charge for our party on this very issue.  Our party looks 
forward to making interventions at the committee stage.  We hope 
that the government will listen and bring in changes that will 
allow the legislation to be fixed up so we will not be putting an 
unnecessary burden on our hunters, fishermen and farmers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I wonder if the member from the 
maritimes could indicate specifically how the bill would impact 
his riding and the people throughout his riding, particularly in 
the area of the amendment regarding cruelty to animals.  I ask 
the hon. member to give us some examples of its impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, we could let our 
imaginations run wild.  For example, when anyone in the beef 
industry processes an animal or slaughters an animal, it could be 
interpreted under the bill as being cruel to the animal. Not all 
of us are vegetarians, and I mean no disrespect to those who are, 
but certainly the harvesting of meat, if you will, either by 
hunting or raising beef, is big in my riding.  It is a rural 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mention fishermen.  When we did our research on that 
legislation, the example of baiting a hook was used.  The worm 
will be subjected to a lot of cruel punishment by keeping it on 
the hook.  What is the correct method of pulling a fish out of 
the water?  Obviously this could be interpreted as unreasonable 
punishment or cruelty to the fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are extreme examples, but the truth is that the wording in 
the legislation is not tight enough or correct in terms of 
interpretation.  People could have a lot to worry about unless 
the bill is changed.  Those are very specific examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are mink ranchers in my riding as well.  That is something 
that industry has had to watch very carefully over the years. 
Even though it is not fashionable in some circles, it is still an 
industry.  We all wear leather shoes for the most part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all examples where legitimate businesses could be 
threatened under the legislation as it is now proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to our justice critic driving home some of those 
points at the committee.  We hope the government will listen and 
change those specific areas of the bill where it could impede on 
citizens' rights to make a living, whether they are fishermen, 
farmers, trappers, et cetera.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like the member to comment on the same question 
I asked of someone earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with this issue is that a bit of a 
rural-urban split has been created.  Certainly we all believe 
that anyone who is cruel to an animal should face the full force 
of the law.  Possibly anyone who does should never be in control 
of another animal in his or her entire life. However we have been 
talking a bit today about the balance between the agricultural 
sector and the food producers, the need to protect animals, and 
the outlook that people who live in urban centres have toward 
some of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a lot of what we need to do is in educating the two 
sectors so that people understand where their food comes from, 
how it is raised, the code of practices that people who work in 
the livestock and food industries work under and how careful they 
are with their animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment on what angle he would take 
on the education that needs to take place in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a very good 
point. 
Some of us are so accustomed to going to the grocery store that 
we think beef is raised in the store and comes in nice, neat 
little packages.  Education is a big part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I am amazed at some of the animal rights people.  One 
example which always comes to mind is when Brigitte Bardot shows 
up on the ice floes of Newfoundland trying to kill the seal 
industry.  She is always wearing a fur coat and $5,000 alligator 
shoes.  I often ask is that not a double standard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, part of this is educating our young people 
about our custodial relationship with animals and the beauty of 
taking care of them, how important they are and how important 
some of these industries are.  Good practices are taking place on 
our ranches and farms to ensure that animals, God's creatures, 
are being treated in a very humane fashion, but it must be 
understood that they are a food source as well and do serve a 
purpose on this earth of ours. In almost a spiritual sense, it 
very much is that education should take place and it has not up 
to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for the question.  It is a very good point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I asked this question earlier of another member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty we as legislators have is in trying to find the 
balance.  Under this legislation we could have one side, for 
example puppy mills which I think most Canadians would say is 
certainly not on, however we go to the other extreme which is a 
mousetrap. How do we as legislators find that balance in this 
legislation so that we protect one side but do push the 
legislation too far in the other direction?  How does the member 
see us striking that balance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is an old fashioned 
word.  Mark Twain often said there is nothing wrong with using a 
10 cent word when there is no need to use a 25 cent word. It is 
common sense and practical solutions where we engage the public 
in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the shortcomings of the present government is it has not 
engaged the public in this. There is a balance between what we 
want to see done and limits on the other side.  In all practical 
terms, most Canadians know where that line is.  I think we as 
legislators do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are not seeing from the government is the practical 
reality that this has to be something we can all live with at the 
end of the day.  The term I used in my remarks earlier was 
carelessness.  It is just an example of the government waking up 
one morning, getting out of bed and saying “Listen, let us bring 
in some legislation that will deal with this” but it is not 
applying a common sense approach to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say they probably have too many people penning this 
legislation in their ivory towers, people who have never been on 
a farm, have never fished and have no understanding of what it is 
like to live in some parts of the country where that is done for 
a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unlike a lot of the legislation that has come to this 
place from time to time as a result of acting in haste and acting 
in a way not consistent with good government, and certainly not 
consulting with the people.  Again, it is a good question, but it 
is that balance that governments have to strike, and it is 
usually done in consultation and in working with the opposition 
parties, which obviously the government has not done on this 
piece of legislation.  It has basically left it to the 
bureaucrats to craft it, and this is what we are left with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to engage in this debate today 
on Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some real concerns about the bill and what the bill is 
proposing to do in a number of areas.  Of course it has been said 
time and time again that it is an omnibus bill and it covers a 
lot of territory.  I have also heard a number of people express 
the opinion that the intent of the bill is honourable and that 
they support the intent of the bill.  However, in the seven years 
I have been in the House and been an elected member, I have 
become perhaps somewhat cynical about the intentions or the 
motives behind some of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me if the government were serious about dealing with 
some of the issues in the bill, it would have certainly separated 
out the issues and brought them forth in individual bills.  Many 
of them could have proceeded through the House without 
controversy and probably have been supported by all parties. 
Instead, the government lumps it all together with issues that 
are very controversial and others that are not as controversial, 
and what we get is a bill such as this one, which in my opinion 
is absolutely full of holes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am suspect of the government's motives on the issue.  For 
example, the government expresses great concern about dealing 
with the sadistic perverts who would impose horrendous cruelty on 
animals.  Yet this same government that is so offended by the 
possibility that people do that.  They do that, and I find it 
extremely offensive, along with probably everybody else.  It is 
the same Liberal government that gave somebody something like a 
$15,000 Canada Council grant to produce a piece of art with dead 
bunnies hanging on it to display in our National Gallery.  Does 
that not fit with this concern for the welfare of animals and the 
needless cruelty to animals?  One immediately becomes suspect of 
the intention of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even regarding the clause in the bill on toughening up the 
penalty for disarming a police officer, one thinks that is a good 
idea.  We could support that idea, but when we look at history, 
disarming a police officer has for some time been a criminal 
offence.  The government in its wisdom thought the penalty needed 
to be greater for disarming a police officer. Instead of imposing 
the law that exists by imposing upon the courts a minimum 
sentence of three years, which is the current maximum sentence, 
apparently, and forcing the courts to treat it as a more serious 
offence, the government introduces a bill that places a maximum 
penalty of five years for disarming a police officer. 
Rarely, if ever, do the courts impose a maximum sentence on 
anybody for any offence, and it is very unlikely that the courts 
will impose the maximum sentence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government achieve by raising the penalty from 
three years to five years and making it a maximum penalty?  I do 
not think it has achieved anything except some political rhetoric 
and some smoke and mirrors to convince the public that it is 
concerned with the offence and to respond to the police 
association's call for stiffer penalties.  If it were really 
serious, it simply would have imposed a minimum sentence of three 
or five years for that offence, but it did not.  I am suspect of 
the government's motives in terms of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go to the other clause of the bill concerning firearms 
regulations and the cosmetic changes being made there, again I 
become suspect, simply because the regulations that accompanied 
Bill C-68, which never came through the House, never saw the 
light of public debate in the House of Commons, are far more 
onerous than the changes that are part of the legislation being 
introduced to the House.  I ask myself what motivated the 
government to bring this in as legislation rather than simply 
changing the regulations around Bill C-68 and solving whatever 
the problem was that it intended to solve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I become suspect of the government's motives in introducing an 
omnibus bill.  Certainly I see all kinds of loopholes that could 
and probably will at some point be in the courts dealing with the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some real conflict in a couple of places with the 
provincial wildlife act.  The bill specifically includes the 
practice of baiting as a criminal offence.  In many provinces in 
Canada, including my own, the practice of bear baiting both in 
the spring and in the fall is a common practice and one that is 
legal under the provincial wildlife act.  Now the bill is in 
conflict with the provincial legislation and no doubt will take 
precedence over the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another clause that in my opinion contravenes the provincial 
wildlife act is the clause dealing with subparagraph 446(1)(c) of 
the criminal code, which says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>being the owner or the person having the custody or control of a 
domestic animal or a bird or an animal or a bird wild by nature 
that is in captivity, abandons it in distress or wilfully 
neglects or fails to provide suitable and adequate food, water, 
shelter and care for it; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Alberta, under the wildlife act it is against 
the law to keep a wild animal in captivity, injured or otherwise, 
and to provide food for that animal.  That is an offence under 
provincial law.  I know that because I am married to a woman with 
a heart as big as all outdoors when it comes to animals.  On 
occasion she receives from many people wild animals that have 
been injured and hurt.  Her heart goes out to them and she spends 
a great deal of time and care nursing them back to health, trying 
to help them regain strength to go back into the wild.  On more 
than one occasion provincial wildlife officers have threatened to 
prosecute her for doing that, because that is not a legal 
practice.  Bill C-17 is in direct conflict with the provincial 
wildlife act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was listening to members making their speeches and reading 
the bill, something came to my mind about the definition of the 
animal the bill is in fact meant to protect, animal meaning a 
vertebrate other than a human being and any other animal that has 
the capacity to feel pain. 
It struck me that it is just a matter of time until the pro-life 
movement looks at that clause.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been determined by the courts on more than one occasion 
that a fetus or an unborn baby is in fact not a human.  It is 
something else, something other than human.  I would argue that 
it would be pretty hard to say that a fetus is not a vertebrate. 
Certainly the practice of aborting that fetus could be considered 
cruelty to that animal and that issue could be taken to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure most of us realize a raging debate is ongoing in the 
country now about the practice of abortion and whether or not the 
fetus feels pain from that process.  People are saying 
precautions should be taken to mitigate that pain. The bill would 
lay open anybody performing an abortion to prosecution.  That 
seems to me a serious loophole and certainly beyond, I am sure, 
what the government intended to do with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to the whole clause on cruelty to animals, we have 
heard over and over again of some real problems, loopholes and 
concerns among a number of groups.  Having been in the business 
of animal husbandry all my life, it concerns me.  I cannot 
believe that the government, with the resources at its disposal, 
the best legal minds in the country, could not draft a bill that 
would be able to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those 
who would wilfully and criminally be cruel to animals and at the 
same time would provide wording that would protect livestock 
producers, trappers, and harvesters of animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing act says no one shall wilfully be cruel to animals. 
I suggest probably everybody in the House at one time or another 
wilfully did something that caused pain or was cruel to an 
animal, a vertebrate.  We have heard discussions all day about 
the various ways in which that is done. Unfortunately in my years 
of raising livestock I have on many occasions had to wilfully 
inflict pain upon my animals in the business I was in.  I took no 
pleasure from that.  In fact it was very difficult and 
heart-wrenching sometimes to have to do some of the things that 
have to be done when one is in the business of raising livestock, 
but it is a necessary part of that business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard discussion about baiting a mousetrap and catching a 
mouse in one's house, cabin, barn, or wherever.  I defy anybody 
who has ever seen a mouse caught in a trap to say that animal 
does not suffer and that is not cruel.  I raised this point 
earlier today in questions and answers.  I defy anybody in the 
House to tell me that taking a live lobster and dropping it into 
a pot of boiling water does not cause pain and is not cruel.  We 
could go on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a number of members raise the concern of the religious 
and cultural communities that since biblical times have engaged 
in the practice of ritual slaughter of animals.  It is quite 
common.  I have seen it performed, and I can certainly assure 
everyone that no one could deny it inflicts pain and cruelty on 
that animal. 
We have not prosecuted, and I hope it is not the government's 
intention to prosecute, those people who do those things.  It has 
not been the practice of courts nor law enforcement officers to 
enforce the letter of the law when it comes to that.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This generally goes back to one phrase, the phrase that protects 
people who wilfully and knowingly inflict pain:  that they did 
not have criminal intent.  Removal of that clause no longer 
requires there to be criminal intent to be prosecuted and is 
extremely dangerous.  It lays open to prosecution anybody who 
engages in any of those activities that I mentioned.  I cannot 
believe that the lawyers involved in the drafting of the bill 
could not have achieved the intent without laying open to 
prosecution legitimate livestock producers and everyday, average 
citizens in the course of their lives.  The bill is extremely 
offensive and dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inconsistencies in the bill blow me away.  I cannot, for the 
life of me, figure out why cruelty to animals would have been put 
in the sexual offences section of the criminal code.  Why would 
we put it there?  That does not make any sense to me.  What 
connection is there between cruelty to animals and sexual 
offences?  It is as incomprehensible as throwing the disarming of 
a police officer into a bill designed to prevent cruelty to 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have made more sense to me, having had a number of 
representations over the last year and a half, for the government 
to have provided an extraordinary penalty in the cruelty to 
animals legislation for someone who would deliberately and 
wilfully kill a police dog in the line of duty.  It would make 
much more sense to me to have an extraordinary penalty put in the 
legislation to deal with the killing of a police dog than the 
disarming of the police dog's master.  It does not fit there and 
it does not belong there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very confusing. I hope we will have adequate 
opportunity in committee to get answers to those questions.  The 
debate has been going on all day in the House and the government 
has not been responding to any of our questions and has not 
provided any insight into the intent of any particular clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area that I want to raise.  We have heard a lot 
of discussion today about the rural-urban split.  That is where 
the bill runs into trouble because urban people do not understand 
the raising and slaughter of livestock for food and all the rest 
of it.  I am not sure the rural-urban split really applies here 
nearly as much as what we have been led to believe simply because 
the concept of being cruel to animals is not restricted to people 
on the farm.  Certainly people in the city engage in activities 
that are just as liable for prosecuted as people raising 
livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The animal rights movement has been working for some years to 
portray animals as something other than what we, in the livestock 
industry, would consider them to be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an article recently about the need for a bill of rights 
for primates and how that would protect the rights of primates. 
We then get into the rights of animals, how distasteful it is to 
raise animals in confinement, how they should be running free and 
all the rest of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that perhaps urban people would not understand what 
that is all about but we have a Hollywood version of animals.  My 
grandson and I recently watched a movie about a pig raised on a 
farm.  The pig's father was sent off to the slaughterhouse to be 
slaughtered and become bacon on the table. The poor family was 
left behind and the young pig had to take responsibility for his 
family.  It was terrible, sad and it went on and on.  Needless to 
say, the young pig eventually rescued his father from the 
slaughterhouse and saved the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of seeing animals in that context is 
ludicrous.  Some years ago I saw a movie with Chevy Chase where 
he tied his dog to the bumper and dragged it until it was no 
more. That was supposed to be a comedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I have run out of time so I will save the rest of my 
remarks for another day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I listened to the member's 
speech many things came to the forefront, the first being the 
many scopes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this piece of legislation that the government is trying to 
put through, why would it put under cruelty to animals, penalties 
for disarming police officers?  It almost seems like the 
government is putting part of a bill through so it can use it to 
campaign on.  If we have a problem with the cruelty to animals 
aspect of it and do not vote for the total package it could be 
said that we were not standing up for penalties being imposed on 
people who disarm peace officers, which is not the case at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has come before the House and the Canadian public 
with a bill that is half rotten and half good.  What we are being 
told from the government side, I would say to the hon. member who 
just spoke, is that we should hold our noses for the smell on the 
front end and hope that the rose at the back end will outweigh 
it.  That is one of the problems I have with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation does not exactly define what cruelty 
to animals is.  When some of us from rural areas happen to go 
into large cities we often see people walking around with large 
dogs.  Many of these people live in apartments.  When we see a 
dog that weighs 140 or 160 pounds being kept inside a small 
apartment, some of us see that as a cruel act.  What is the 
definition and how far is the government willing to carry it? Who 
will lay the charges?  Does the bill lay it open to anybody to 
lay charges against a person?  If that is the case, will they 
come forward and identify themselves or can it be just used as a 
malicious act upon somebody who is no longer liked? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has no beginning and no end.  We are leaving it again 
to the courts and judges to decide the law when that should be 
our job here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the hon. member has answers to these 
questions.  I cannot seem to find the answers anywhere.  I have 
not heard any of the government members stand up to speak on this 
issue today so that I could ask them questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad to see that 
I am not the only one to become cynical in our time here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises some good points.  Again, I am being cynical, 
but if the government really were serious about addressing the 
problems outlined in the bill, it could have done so far more 
effectively than it did with this bill.  I believe that by making 
this an omnibus bill and by leaving it so wide open to 
interpretation, part of the intent was to simply confound the 
opposition, as the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It works to some degree.  As an opposition party, we look at 
each bill, we listen to the critic, and we debate whether or not 
we support the legislation.  This bill has provided a conundrum 
to the opposition in that we generally support some aspects of 
the bill but not others.  I think it is intentional by the 
government to create that environment within the opposition.  The 
intention is not as honourable as perhaps we would like it to be. 
The desire to solve the problem that exists is not nearly as 
strong as it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other aspect of the member's comments dealing with the 
rural-urban split, I would agree with him that the concept of a 
rottweiler or a great dane living in an apartment building in the 
city is no less distasteful than a pig or a chicken being raised 
in a pen or a cage without adequate room to exercise and to enjoy 
the freedom and the light that perhaps it should be allowed to 
enjoy.  The concept of a rural-urban split is less than what we 
are suggesting it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government allows us the time in committee to have a 
thorough discussion, and that the government will be open to the 
suggestions in committee to change the bill to actually achieve 
some good things that are honourable and should be achieved.  If 
the government would allow that to happen, then I think we could 
turn this into a bill that has merit and that we could support. 
Certainly in its existing form it is unsupportable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I heard my hon. colleague suggest that not one member 
from the Liberal side of the House has spoken to the bill today. 
That arouses in me probably the greatest cynicism I have ever had 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me we have some intelligent human beings sitting on 
the Liberal side of House who put the bill together.  One begins 
to wonder that they have absolutely nothing to say about the 
bill.  Are they so ashamed of the bill that they would not dare 
say anything in opposition to what we have suggested here as 
serious questions or flaws in the bill?  Do they just want to 
bury their heads, so to speak, and just let the bill go?  Or, 
could it be that the real intention of the bill is to once again 
appear to be doing something but in fact not be doing anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there is an insidious, deep seriousness with the bill that 
could have an impact on a whole host of things.  It could destroy 
certain individuals who are trying to make an honest living 
through hunting or through the raising of animals for food.  Just 
what is going on here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes significant that we answer some of these questions. 
As the hon. member has said and as my hon. colleague over on the 
other side of the fence has said very clearly, we must get clear 
definitions of what is meant in the bill and of what cruelty to 
animals actually is.  Let us be clear about this.  We are not 
hearing anything from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some of the members who are sitting in the House right at 
the moment, and I know some of their capabilities.  They are not 
rising.  What is it?  Is it because it is the way we have it here 
and they are ashamed of their legislation?  Or, is it because 
they do not want to create the impression or tell us the truth 
about what they actually want the bill to do?  Could the hon. 
member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague makes a 
good point.  I mentioned in the question and comment section 
earlier that during one of the presentations I overheard from the 
backbenches the hon. member for Simcoe—Grey suggesting this 
provides protection for livestock producers.  That should be a 
big issue in his riding, simply because it is one of the largest 
cattle producing areas in the country. 
I am really concerned that the particular member is going back to 
Simcoe—Grey and telling his constituents that this bill in fact 
provides protection for his cattle producers because it simply is 
not so.  That would concern me.  I could understand that from 
some of the urban members who perhaps do not have an interest in 
the bill, however they should.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I really would have enjoyed hearing the member for

to our concerns today.  I understand he is a livestock producer 
and many of these concerns— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Chicken farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  He says he is not a livestock 
producer, he is a chicken farmer.  That is okay by me, but as a 
chicken farmer he should have some of the same concerns that we 
have raised about the bill.  I would be fascinated to hear him 
explain to us why he is not concerned about legislation to 
provide some protection, not only to himself as a producer, but 
to the other livestock producers in his constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The silence is deafening over there.  It is really worrisome to 
those of us on this side who represent cattle producers.  I think 
the only answer is an election.  It will be another issue on 
which we can fight the election in our ridings.  We will come 
back after the election as government and we will reintroduce the 
bill in a form that will provide that protection.  That is the 
answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, for the sake of our viewers who are 
tuning in across the country, those who are arriving home from 
work, getting that channel zapper and tuning in to hear the 
debate in the House of Commons today or those who are just 
getting up from the supper table, putting their feet up or 
getting their slippers on, we are discussing Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a Liberal bill that is before us.  It is an act to amend 
the criminal code, cruelty to animals, disarming a peace officer 
and other amendments and the Firearms Act, technical amendments. 
That is the title, and as it suggests, it is an omnibus bill, 
which is to say that this often odious method of government mixes 
some good with other unrelated problematic legislation, which is what is 
before us this hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no objection to the latter two other aspects of this 
bill which are the disarming a peace officer, which is a good and 
necessary thing, and the technical amendments to the Firearms 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 would make it a criminal offence for everyone who, 
without the consent of the peace officer, takes or attempts to 
take a weapon that is in the possession of that peace officer 
when the peace officer is engaged in the execution of his or her 
duty.  Everyone who commits this offence is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding five years, or is guilty of an offence punishable on 
summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding 18 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I previously stated, we support this particular amendment. 
In fact, in my constituency, a place called Warman, Saskatchewan 
just north of Saskatoon in the Saskatoon—Wanuskewin 
constituency, there is a large recreational centre that was put 
together by the good folk of that community and possibly with 
some government money.  It is called the Brian King Centre and 
was named in memory of a wonderfully dedicated member of the 
Saskatoon police force who was killed in the line of duty when he 
was jumped by two individuals who took his gun.  In commando 
style, they had him kneel on the banks of the river in 
Saskatchewan shot him through the head and killed him.  He left a 
young widow and children.  It was a very tragic story.  This 
would be one particular address to that kind of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need respect for authority.  We need respect for RCMP 
officers and for city and municipal police.  The Canadian 
Alliance supports our police officers across the country and 
respects this particular part of Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note this past Sunday on Parliament Hill there were numbers of 
dignitaries and police officers. 
It is an important event that occurs on an annual basis where we 
recognize our police officers, those who have lost their lives in 
the line of duty.  I referred to just one, but there have been 
other police officers who have been jumped, assaulted and shot 
with their own guns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question we want to give this kind of a tool to the 
judiciary with respect to justice officials so that they can 
prosecute in a very serious way those who have disarmed a police 
officer.  Of course, in these other cases there were murder 
charges for the criminals who killed the individual from my 
constituency, Brian King. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section in Bill C-17 concerning the amendment to the 
Firearms Act is simply a technical amendment.  It is a cosmetic 
thing.  It simply grandfathers the inventories of prohibited 
handguns held by businesses in mid-February 1995 so they can sell 
to individuals eligible under the act.  A further amendment 
adjusts employee licensing requirements so that it better 
reflects appropriate firearms safety training for employees as 
opposed to some of the non-restrictive firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problem with those two parts of Bill C-17.  However, 
as we said before, omnibus bills are quite objectionable.  It 
includes excellent and very necessary legislation combined with 
flawed legislation, using good legislation to slip through flawed 
and problematic legislation.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's side will say, as it is already setting up to 
do, that the official opposition does not support making it a 
criminal offence for disarming a police officer.  That will be 
the spin and its approach to this.  Members can mark my words on 
that.  That is the approach that will be taken, especially if 
past history is an accurate judge of this.  That is how it 
handles the omnibus bills.  It slips through these nefarious, 
unpopular and sometimes not good pieces of legislation by way of 
something that is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genesis of changes to cruelty to animals is to no longer 
treat cruelty to animals as a property crime.  We have some basic 
agreement with the intent of this part of the bill.  What the 
government is doing though is making a new provision, moving the 
cruelty to animals to section 4 of the criminal code under sexual 
offences, which would be renamed sexual offences, public morals, 
disorderly conduct and cruelty to animals.  That is currently 
contained in sections 444 to 446, part XI of the criminal code. 
This section of the criminal code protects a person from being 
convicted of an offence if that person acted with legal 
justification.  That is the way it stands now.  It is adequate. 
It serves us quite properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, agricultural groups, anglers, hunter groups, and the 
Fur Council of Canada want cruelty to animals to remain in 
section 444 to 446.  They fear that by moving the cruelty section 
to sexual offences it will make it easier for them to be 
prosecuted.  They argue quite rightly that those who lawfully and 
legitimately harvest animals for business will not be protected 
if the cruelty section is changed.  They are not reassured by the 
minister's words.  She has said that it does not pertain to them 
or apply to them and that it is not an issue, yet for some 
strange reason they are not at all reassured by the her words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, as has been indicated by members before, we are going 
to be moving an amendment at committee stage to have the animal 
cruelty provisions back under sections 444 to 446, or make those 
necessary changes to section 182.1 to comply with and allay the 
concerns of these farmers, hunters and agricultural groups and 
others who harvest animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point of the cruelty to animals section of Bill C-17 
that causes concern is the amendment in the bill which proposes 
to take out the words wilfully or wilful as a defence if a person 
has been charged.  That has been mentioned before.  The removal 
of those words would make prosecution easier but not proper in 
many instances where one is involved in the legitimate slaughter 
of animals or the raising of animals for legitimate use or 
harvesting.  We all appreciate that when we eat meat at mealtime 
it is because we have animals that can be killed humanely, 
quickly and prepared for our tables.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there is reason to add the terms wilful and 
wilfully back into Bill C-17 to assuage or allay the concerns 
of various individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will be moving an amendment at committee 
stage to ensure that legitimate individuals involved in animal 
operations are not unduly subject to criminal intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another part of the bill which was referred to before, 
but it bears repeating because many people have tuned in since 
those features were given.  The amendment that proposes that 
criminal intent for animal cruelty can be simply civil negligence 
is a part of the bill which causes concern for legitimate animal 
operations.  It lowers the burden of proof, if you will. 
Agriculture groups would like to see “wilful neglect” or 
“marked departure from the exercise of reasonable care” put 
back in and maintained.  It should be reinstated.  It should not 
be something like a civil negligence which is a lower burden of 
proof and could possibly be used to prosecute farmers trying to 
carry out normal farming operations and cattle management, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as well will introduce an amendment at committee stage to 
ensure there is the proper recognition of that need to protect 
legitimate farm operators from prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth area of concern in Bill C-17 is what is called animal 
care provisions.  The bill proposes convictions when there is any 
pain or suffering or injury to an animal.  In other words, 
animals have feelings too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the criminal code prohibits unnecessary pain. It is 
only common sense and one does not have to be a legal beagle or a 
lawyer to know that removing the word “unnecessary” could open 
up a whole area for conviction.  As someone pointed out, putting 
a worm on a hook could become a problem for a fisherman if 
somebody was a little overzealous and got on that case. That is 
unrealistic and it is too loose and open for interpretation and 
prosecution.  We will move an amendment to re-establish the word 
“unnecessary” to protect anglers and others who are conducting 
a sporting activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth area of concern is where Bill C-17 states that anyone 
who kills an animal or being the owner permits an animal to be 
killed brutally or viciously, regardless of whether the animal 
dies immediately, is guilty of a criminal offence.  Again that 
part is very subjective and is open to a lot of latitude.  It is 
very ambiguous and must be defined more clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill raises the penalty for intentional cruelty to an animal 
from the current penalty of six months to five years and lifts 
the cap on the fine which is currently $2,000.  This is 
appropriate in the area of cruelty to pets and where cruelty can 
be established in other practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifetime ban on owning an animal without doubt is 
appropriate in cases of pet abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill on the whole is legitimate.  No one wants 
to see animals abused in any way, but there is a need to clarify 
the language surrounding some of the parts that we have cited 
here so as to ensure that legitimate individuals involved in the 
raising and harvesting of animals are not subject to unnecessary 
and unfair indictment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the bill at second reading, but we warn the 
government that it needs to amend the bill to meet the legitimate 
concerns that have been outlined.  If it does not, we will oppose 
it at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, I want to draw attention to a very cruel 
irony which has been alluded to before. It is the cruel irony 
that we take the kind of steps included in this bill to protect 
animals from any pain, but we have no protection for vulnerable 
preborn children right through the entire nine months of a 
pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can use a saline solution and burn the skin off a tiny, 
vulnerable pre-born child.  We can violently suction a baby's 
arms or legs or other body parts.  We can tear them violently 
apart, no problem, from limb to limb, but the speedy branding of 
livestock may bring criminal sanctions.  To be consistent, we 
need to have some basic protection for a preborn child.  We have 
got the order of importance mixed up here to some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to show respect for human life, the sanctity of 
life.  All life must be returned—

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, a number of weeks ago, in fact in June before we 
recessed for the summer, I asked a question of the Minister of 
Finance regarding the CHST, the Canadian health and social 
transfer, the moneys going to the provinces mainly for education 
and health care among other things.  It is the moneys that come 
from the federal government in support of health care 
provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we are not satisfied with the arrangements. 
In response to the minister's reply, there is no question that 
there is an election coming.  We are having a bit of fun on the 
other benches, I can see, but the federal government has just 
announced that about $4 billion is going to the CHST.  I remind 
the Canadian public that this will bring us back to the same 
levels of spending that we had in 1994.  We will almost 10 years 
behind the eight ball.  Of course, that money will not kick in 
for another 18 months.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is money that the provinces and the federal government agreed 
to, but basically the provinces did it with no guarantees at all 
coming from the federal government in terms of national 
standards.  The provinces simply bought in with the money, with 
no guarantees for national standards in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking a lot of credit for having done this, 
for putting money back into health care.  However, the House will 
remember that the government created this problem.  The 
government has not fixed it.  It has no plan for the future. 
Basically the government makes it up, fixes it up and rolls along 
without any consideration for what it will do down the road. 
Canadians are not satisfied with that approach of stumble along 
and make it up as we go along.  It is an approach that the 
government has taken for the last seven years and I think the 
Canadian public is getting wise to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I say this is that with this injection of money basically on 
the eve of an election, we can see how quickly the provinces came 
to an agreement with the federal government.  Knowing full well 
that an election is coming, the government wanted it off the 
table.  Basically the Prime Minister said “Here is the cash. 
Take it and run.  Get out of my way.  Incidentally, there is an 
election coming, so just get out of my hair.  Here is the money. 
Take the cash and run”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a plan.  That is just political opportunism for the 
wrong reasons.  Basically the Liberals are hoping for a deathbed 
reprieve, which the government got in 1997.  The House will 
remember that on the eve of the 1997 election the Liberals threw 
in a billion dollars to appease the provinces and in the middle 
of a campaign came up with a promise for pharmacare, a 
pharmaceutical program and a home care program, a promise that 
they had no intention of keeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was simply to appease the people, to get them on side, and it 
was “By the way, an election is coming”.  They have not 
honoured those promises.  They have no plans for the future nor 
do they have a plan going into this election other than “Here is 
the cash.  Take it and run”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old expression “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me 
twice, shame on me”.  The Canadian public will not fall for this 
trick, the same trick that the Liberals used in the 1997 
election.  They fooled us twice.  They are not going to do it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for New Brunswick 
Southwest seems to have the numbers mixed up.  In fact, the Prime 
Minister recently concluded an agreement with the provinces and 
territories which will invest $23.5 billion in the health care 
system through the Canada health and social transfer.  That is in 
addition to the $14 billion that was put into the CHST in the two 
previous budgets.  That is a total of $37.5 billion, which is 
significantly more than the figure of $4.5 billion the member 
quoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the original question from the member to the 
minister had to do with the CHST as a block fund.  I would like 
to say that the CHST gives provinces greater flexibility to 
allocate resources according to their own priorities.  As a block 
fund, the CHST also allows provinces to design programs and 
reflect their unique circumstances and needs.  Maintaining 
artificial boundaries between social programs is not good social 
policy.  Health, education and social assistance are all 
interrelated.  Furthermore, these programs fall under provincial 
jurisdiction.  Provinces know how to best tailor programs to meet 
the needs of their own residents.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said this, I should note that maintaining the CHST as a 
block fund does not preclude agreements on targeted investments. 
Indeed, at the last first ministers meeting, as I just pointed 
out, first ministers agreed that of the additional $21 billion 
invested in the CHST over five years, $2.2 billion would be 
earmarked for early childhood development.  In 1999 all premiers 
made a commitment to spend the $11.5 billion in new CHST cash 
provided in that year's budget on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the agreement reached at the first ministers 
meeting and the 1999 budget clearly demonstrate that the CHST is 
an effective instrument for achieving national policy objectives 
while at the same time providing provinces and territories with
