AFFAIRS-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker: </B>I am now ready to rule on a point of order raised 
by the hon. member for Fraser Valley East on Monday, October 28, 
1966 concerning the status of the hon. member for Wild Rose as a 
substitute member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley East for raising this 
matter and the chief government whip for his contribution to the 
discussion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This matter was first brought to my attention on Tuesday, 
October 22, 1996 by the hon. member for Wild Rose. At that time 
he described to the Chair how he had been selected as a substitute 
from the Reform Party's list of associate members for the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs and in that capacity 
attended the meeting of the committee on Monday, October 21, 
1996. The hon. member claimed that he had attempted to give 
notice of a motion but was ruled out of order by the chair on the 
basis that he was not a regular member of the committee. The 
member indicated that he had sought a resolution to this matter 
within the committee and had not been successful.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The matter was raised a second time, on October 28, by the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East. In his presentation, he argued that, 
as a duly selected substitute pursuant to Standing Order 114, the 
member for Wild Rose should have been permitted to give notice 
of his motion notwithstanding the committee's internal rule 
requiring 48-hour notice for consideration of new business.
<P>
	Having examined the arguments put forward, I find it 
appropriate in this instance to offer some clarification.
<P>
	The Standing Orders provide a mechanism whereby members 
who are associate members of a committee can become substitutes 
for regular members of the committee at a particular meeting. I 
have looked carefully at the wording of the relevant Standing 
Orders and in the case before us, it is clear that the requirements 
were met and the member for Wild Rose was acting as a bona fide 
substitute member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs for the meeting on October 28, 1996.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no doubt in the Chair's mind that substitute members 
should be considered on an equal footing with permanent members 
for the period of substitution. This status must remain unaffected 
by any internal rules adopted by a committee for its own 
convenience, otherwise committees risk having two classes of 
members at the committee table.
<P>
	In my ruling on June 20, 1994 at page 5,583 of the <I>Debates</I>, to 
which the hon. member for Fraser Valley East also made reference, 
I pointed out that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it is a tradition of this House that committees are masters of their own 
proceedings, they cannot establish procedures which go beyond the powers 
conferred upon them by the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Committees have found it efficient to establish their own 
internal procedures such as the 48-hour notice requirement 
concerning new items of business that was adopted by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs at its organization meeting 
on March 12, 1996. I would encourage members involved in 
committee work to bear in mind that such internal rules and 
procedures should not be crafted in such a way as to diminish the 
role of substitute members whose ability to fully function in the 
committee is a status conferred on them by the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There have been difficulties with the understanding of rules and 
practices regarding substitute members of committees and this is 
why I found this a suitable opportunity to give my views on the 
matter.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past I have referred to the longstanding practice of the 
House that the Speaker will not intervene in  procedural matters 
arising in committee. Bearing in mind what I have said, I trust that 
the members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs and the hon. member for Fraser Valley East can reach some 
accommodation in this particular matter. I hope that my statement 
<P>

today will be of assistance to members and everyone concerned 
with the work of committees.

	The House resumed from November 1, 1996 consideration of the 
motion for an Address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his Speech at the opening of the session.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all I wish to inform you that I will share my time with the hon. 
member for Bourassa.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity today to respond to the speech from 
the throne pronounced by the governor general last February, on 
behalf of the government. How time flies: it has already been eight 
months since the speech was pronounced.
<P>
	Nevertheless, today's debate is useful in that with the passing of 
time, we have a better picture of how the government has acted on 
its commitments.
<P>
	As we read the speech from the throne, we notice, for instance, 
that the government officially set the scene for its post-referendum 
strategy in dealing with the Quebec government. This strategy, 
known by everyone as plan B, basically consists in a hardening of 
the government's position on the freedom of Quebecers to decide 
on their political future.
<P>
	In this respect, the governor general said the following, and I 
quote: ``But as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum 
exists, the government will exercise its responsibility to ensure that 
the debate is conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules 
of the process are fair, that the consequences are clear, and that 
Canadians, no matter where they live, will have their say in the 
future of their country''.
<P>
	Considering last year's quasi-victory of the sovereignists in the 
referendum on October 30 and the way every part of English 
Canada criticized the role played by the government during the 
referendum, the latter felt it would be politically more effective to 
take a hard line. But in fact, the government's strategy of resorting 
to plan B merely confirms the chronic inability of Canadian 
federalism to renew itself and to find durable solutions for dealing 
with Quebec's traditional demands.
<P>
	A few days before the referendum, when the polls were leaning 
increasingly to the yes side, the Prime Minister had the fright of his 
life. He then shook himself out of his legendary torpor in Verdun 
and went so far as to promise to entrench the distinct identity of 
Quebec in the Constitution and to give Quebec a veto.
<P>
	In an article entitled ``The Secret Summit'', published in the 
October 21 issue of <I>Macleans</I> and excerpted from the forthcoming 
book <I>Double Vision</I> by two journalists, we read that a few days 
after the referendum, the Prime Minister had become obsessed by 
the promise he had made in Verdun to have Quebec recognized as a 
distinct society.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	In an attempt to trap Jacques Parizeau's successor, Lucien 
Bouchard, the Prime Minister developed an ultimately 
unsuccessful scenario that would allow him to enshrine the distinct 
society concept in the Constitution. He needed the support of 7 
provinces representing at least 50 per cent of the population. In this 
regard, according to the article in <I>Maclean's</I>, the Prime Minister 
could count on the support of the premiers of Prince Edward Island, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, but not 
of course, that of the then premier of Newfoundland, Clyde Wells.
<P>
	Knowing that the Prime Minister could not count either on the 
premiers of Alberta and British Columbia, he had to get Ontario's 
Mike Harris on side.
<P>
	<I>Maclean's</I> also tells us that, three days after the referendum, the 
Prime Minister had a secret meeting with Mike Harris so he could 
explain to him his plan for entrenching the notion of distinct 
society in the Constitution.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, Mike Harris refused to 
support his post-referendum strategy. Make no mistake: the Prime 
Minister's main concern was to save the little credibility he had left 
in Quebec and force our hand so we would accept a meaningless 
concept.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister's strategy had worked, that is to say, if 
Mike Harris had decided to support him, the blame would, of 
course, have been laid at Lucien Bouchard's door.
<P>
	When his strategy failed, the Prime Minister tried to save face 
with regard to his last-minute referendum commitments in Verdun 
by passing, in December 1995, a simple parliamentary resolution 
stating-it was more like wishful thinking-that Quebec is a 
distinct society, and a bill giving Quebec and Canada's four other 
regions the right of veto with the effect of further reducing the 
likelihood that the Constitution will ever be amended.
<P>
	Since then, the Prime Minister has repeated at every opportunity 
that he would like to enshrine these two measures in the 
Constitution, but is prevented from doing so by Quebec's 
sovereignist 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6228"> 6228 </A></B>
<P>
government. We have since come to realize that the argument 
raised by the Prime Minister is nothing but a smoke screen.
<P>
	In fact, two weeks ago, the Prime Minister, exasperated by all 
this, said on the French-language all-news channel that he had done 
enough in this area and now wanted to focus his efforts on 
economic issues.
<P>
	After inflaming the situation, the Prime Minister would rather 
bury the whole constitutional issue, knowing full well that any 
amendment to the Constitution that would deal specifically with 
Quebec would not received the necessary support from the other 
provinces.
<P>
	Consequently, this week, the Minister of Justice told us he was 
contemplating asking that the Supreme Court to define what would 
be involved if Quebec were considered a distinct society, if the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs cannot achieve a consensus 
on this issue in the next few months.
<P>
	It is as though this government cannot make a move without 
seeking the opinion of the Supreme Court. In September, the matter 
of the legality of Quebec's sovereignty was referred to the Supreme 
Court. Now, they are considering asking the Supreme Court to 
define the concept of distinct society.
<P>
	This going to the Supreme Court all the time to settle what are 
essentially political issues is cause for concern. By constantly 
referring matters to the Supreme Court, the government is simply 
shirking its responsibilities.
<P>
	Need I remind the House that Confederation as we know it was a 
compromise between two founding peoples, the French speaking 
one being found mainly in Quebec. These two peoples entered into 
a confederal agreement where the various political entities, that is 
to say the provinces, have delegated certain powers to the central 
government.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	This solemn agreement between the two peoples has always 
been perceived, at least in Quebec, as something that cannot be 
changed without the consent of both parties. This agreement was 
breached at the time of the patriation of the Constitution by the 
federal government in 1982.
<P>
	On May 15, 1980, before the Quebec referendum on 
sovereignty-association, the Prime Minister of the day, Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, had made it clear that voting no in the referendum 
would be interpreted as voting yes to renewing Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	Instead, two years later, the Constitution was patriated and a 
charter of rights incorporated in the Constitution, all without the 
consent of Quebec. The principle whereby all Canadians from 
coast to coast are equal, a right guaranteed under the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, precludes the specific recognition 
of Quebec as a society in the Constitution. Similarly, the principle 
of  multiculturalism has been entrenched in the Constitution, while 
Canada's duality and Quebec's distinctiveness were not. The 1982 
constitutional changes, which were implemented despite Quebec's 
persistent opposition, reflect the contempt in which the 
government of the day held Quebec.
<P>
	It is obvious from the constitutional debates over the past three 
decades, and more recently, the failure of Meech and 
Charlottetown, that there is no hope of the renewal of federalism 
being in line with the best interests of Quebec. The five conditions 
set out in the Meech Lake accord, the least ever requested by a 
Quebec government, were already enough to make English Canada 
shudder, and there is every indication that Ottawa-Quebec City 
relations are going nowhere.
<P>
	Whether we like it or not, Quebec is still in a catch 22 situation 
in the federation. Will we realize once and for all that it would be a 
sheer waste of time, energy and public funds to go down the road of 
constitutional negotiations again, when these are doomed to fail?
<P>
	Under the circumstances, it is in the interests of the peoples of 
Quebec and Canada that all these issues be resolved once and for 
all. The only solution that will allow our two peoples to thrive is for 
Quebec to achieve independence. As equal and sovereign partners, 
they will be able to move on and develop side by side in the best 
interests of both.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to reply to the throne speech by raising, among other issues, 
Canada's relations with Latin America and the upcoming visit of 
the Chilean president.
<P>
	Before dealing with the main topic, I want to say that I am very 
sensitive to and concerned by the tragic situation and the 
humanitarian disaster taking place in Africa's great lakes region. 
The international community must immediately take action to help 
the more than one million refugees in Zaire.
<P>
	A summit was held in Nairobi two days ago, and eight countries 
asked for a neutral multinational force to be sent to the region to 
establish temporary humanitarian corridors and safe havens for 
refugees. Unfortunately, Rwanda has so far opposed the idea. I urge 
the federal government to do its utmost to ensure that this 
humanitarian assistance is sent as soon as possible, and I wish the 
best of luck to the mission headed by Raymond Chrétien.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne, we are told that Canada will do 
everything possible to extend the scope of NAFTA, the North 
American treaty that includes Canada, the United States and 
Mexico. We are also told that Canada is committed to establishing 
priority relations with Latin America.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6229"> 6229 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	However, efforts to extend NAFTA have so far failed. The heads 
of state of our continent met in Miami, in December 1994. They 
decided to invite Chile to join NAFTA. This was two years ago, and 
no new country has acceded to the treaty.
<P>
	This past January, Canada and Chile decided to began 
negotiations on an interim bilateral agreement, to make it easier for 
Chile to join NAFTA. I expected these negotiations to be very 
quickly brought to a successful conclusion, but it is still not the 
case. Chilean president Eduardo Frei was supposed to visit Canada 
from October 1st to 4th, but the visit was postponed to November 
17, 18 and 19, because of the failure to reach an agreement during 
these negotiations.
<P>
	As you know, I come from Chile and I attach a great deal of 
importance to the visit of the Chilean president in the coming days. 
The president will come to Ottawa and Toronto. I must express my 
great regret, in this House, that he and his delegation will not be 
going to Quebec, in spite of the invitation sent by the Quebec 
premier and his government. I hope the federal government has 
nothing to do with this decision. At times, I have personally noticed 
federal interference in Quebec's relations with other countries.
<P>
	I am pleased that Chile returned to democracy in 1990, after 17 
years of dictatorship and systematic violations of human rights. I 
myself came to Quebec in 1974 because of the hard line 
dictatorship that had ruled in Chile for 17 years. Today, Chile is a 
country with a very high rate of growth and has resumed its place 
within the international community.
<P>
	Santiago is the headquarters for ECLAC, the prestigious 
economic commission for Latin America. It has an annual growth 
of approximately 7 per cent and a population of 14 million. It is the 
site for an increasing number of international meetings. In the 
coming days, 21 countries will be meeting in Santiago for the 
Ibero-American Summit, which includes not just Latin American 
countries but also Spain and Portugal. This summit will look at 
economic problems, as well as social and political problems, and 
the issue of democracy and human rights.
<P>
	In March of 1977, Chile will also host the summit of heads of 
state and heads of government of the Americas, which will be 
attended by approximately 44 countries and in which the Prime 
Minister of Canada will participate. Chile also belongs to APEC, 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, which will be 
meeting in Manila in a few weeks and in which the Prime Minister 
of Canada, the President of Chile and other heads of state and heads 
of government will take part.
<P>
	I am also glad to see that relations between Chile and Canada 
and Quebec are very good. They are at the highest level in all areas 
of the economy and trade. Last  year, the Prime Minister of Canada 
visited Chile and other Latin American countries. Fortunately, 
Canada finally decided to join OAS, the Organization of American 
States, in 1990.
<P>
	Quebec has very close ties with Latin America. We share many 
fraternal ties of friendship based on our common Latin heritage. 
Relations are intensifying.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Former Liberal minister, Charles Caccia, went to Chile. Bernard 
Landry also visited that country in late August and early 
September. The Canadian Chilean community, which numbers 
35,000 throughout the country, with concentrations in Montreal, 
Toronto and Vancouver, is very pleased and satisfied with this visit, 
a first. No Chilean head of state or head of government has visited 
Canada for at least 50 years.
<P>
	We were expecting this bilateral trade agreement to be signed. 
However, all signs so far are that it will not be, because 
negotiations have been more difficult than foreseen. There are still 
a few details to be worked out. I do not think these problems will be 
resolved in the next ten days.
<P>
	However, a social security agreement will be signed during this 
visit between Chile and Canada, providing benefits in the form of 
disability pensions for the surviving spouses of individuals who 
have worked in both countries, Chileans who worked in Chile and 
who are now here, or Canadians who are now working in Chile. 
This is an agreement I have been pushing for since Chile's return to 
democracy. It is an agreement that also, in my view, meets the 
aspirations of the Chilean community in Canada. I hope that 
Canada will sign other such agreements with other countries, such 
as El Salvador and Guatemala, which have sent many of their 
nationals here.
<P>
	But I also regret that, since the president is not coming to 
Quebec, the social security agreement between Quebec and Chile 
will not be signed this time, although there are 10,000 Chileans, 
10,000 Quebecers of Chilean origin, living in that province who 
would like to see it signed as soon as possible.
<P>
	Today the exchange of goods and services is being liberalized on 
this continent. Canadian investments in Latin America are 
increasing daily, eight billion dollars in Chile alone, primarily in 
the area of mines, forestry and communications.
<P>
	There are still problems to be resolved, however. Many Latin 
American countries complain about how complicated it is to get a 
visitor's visa to come here. This is the case for Central America. 
The problem is greater there because Canada does not have 
ambassadorial representation in some Central American countries, 
such as Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6230"> 6230 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a problem, because people have to travel to apply for 
a visa. I hope that, some day, the Canadian government will be 
represented by ambassadors in some Latin American countries, 
because there is a principle of reciprocity in international law 
which ought to be respected. These are countries, Bolivia for 
example, which have embassies in Ottawa.
<P>
	I have said that I was in favour of these efforts toward 
continental economic integration, but I do have a couple of 
reservations, because a process of integration should be able to 
benefit all of the population in the countries concerned, which is 
not the case at the present time. In Latin America, there is still 
extreme poverty in many countries, with immense differences 
between social classes. The great majority of people do not have 
essential services, sometimes lack housing, do not have access to 
education, face some very serious problems.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	What I would like to see in meetings and discussions between 
Latin America and Canada is for us to also be able to address the 
problems of poverty, unemployment, underemployment, exclusion 
and human rights issues. During the Chilean president's visit, I 
hope that the agenda will include, not only economic questions, 
investment, exchange of goods and services, but also social, 
cultural and political questions of concern to the entire Chilean and 
Canadian population.
<P>
	I would also like to see this Parliament make more effort to link 
Canadian and Latin American parliamentarians. Since I was 
elected to Parliament in 1993, I personally, with the support of my 
party, the Bloc Quebecois, have made every effort to intensify and 
strengthen parliamentary relations between Canada and Latin 
America. I have personally visited Chile and Argentina, Cuba and 
Central America. I have met many parliamentarians.
<P>
	I think we have the resources, the capacity to do more. With 
Mexico, for instance, we have a parliamentary friendship group but 
we should have a recognized parliamentary association. We have 
other associations, especially with Europe, the United States and 
Japan. The parliamentary groups do not have the resources to do 
anything effective.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament of Chilean origin, I welcome this 
visit by President Frei. I hope it will be a successful one. Meetings 
will take place here in Ottawa between the two governments. I 
previously noted visits by the Argentine President Carlos Menem, 
by President Zedillo of Mexico and Central American presidents. I 
hope the Canadian government will invite other heads of state and 
government leaders. We share the same continent. We have 
common problems, and we should have more extensive relations.
<P>
	Here in Ottawa, I often met the ambassadors from Latin 
America. We speak the same language. Sometimes they do not 
have a very good understanding of the political, legal and 
constitutional structure of this country, because in Latin America, 
generally speaking, all states are centralized. For instance, they do 
not realize that if they want to conclude an agreement on social 
security, they also have to negotiate with Quebec, separately from 
Canada, because social security is a shared jurisdiction. The 
provinces in Canada have a great deal of autonomy. We have to 
make the effort, and whenever I have a chance, I try to explain the 
situation in Canada to them. I also explain the situation in Quebec.
<P>
	I think the federal government has sent the wrong message to 
Latin America by saying that Canada is a united and homogeneous 
country. It has emphasized Canadian unity without ever informing 
the international community that Quebec has legitimate 
aspirations, that it wants to use democratic means to become a 
sovereign country, and that this is legitimate. The United Nations 
have recognized more than 25 countries during the past ten years. 
There is nothing anti-democratic about what Quebec and 
Quebecers are doing.
<P>
	Again, I hope this visit by the Chilean president will help expand 
relations that are already very good between Canada and Chile, and 
between Chile and Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Bourassa for 
his lesson. His presentation was very precise, and he did a very 
good job of explaining the new North American trade context as 
well as the importance of relations with Chile.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question in a different vein. According 
to the throne speech, which we are debating today, the Canada 
Labour Code was to be reviewed so as to meet the demands of 
Canadian workers and employers. This week, in my opinion, the 
Minister of Labour gave birth to a mouse when, in the document he 
tabled, he refused to include real antiscab regulations in the revised 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	I know about the hon. member for Bourassa's past experience in 
the area of labour relations. I would like him to explain what was 
the impact in Quebec of this antiscab legislation that regularized 
labour relations and helped reduce the number of days lost to 
conflicts. Is there a way of making the federal government 
understand how relevant such a measure is by looking at Quebec's 
experience? I know there is similar legislation in British Columbia.
<P>
	Are we then not justified in saying that the federal government's 
actions show it is not fulfilling the mandate it gave itself in the 
throne speech? In the final analysis, in this area as in many others, 
all it did was engage in wishful thinking. Could the hon. member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6231"> 6231 </A></B>
<P>
for Bourassa comment on this to try to convince the members  
opposite that the bill that was introduced in this House does not go 
far enough?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question of my friend 
and colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup as it deals with an extremely 
important issue.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne, the government promised a 
complete overhaul of the Canada Labour Code. It was long in 
coming, but just a few days ago, a bill was finally introduced. 
Unfortunately, it does not contain any real anti-strikebreaking 
provisions.
<P>
	Parliament has been looking at this for many years. Across 
Canada, there are more than 700,000 workers under federal 
jurisdiction, subject to the Canada Labour Code, who are not 
protected by anti-strikebreaking provisions like workers in Quebec, 
British Columbia and, until just a few months ago, Ontario. The 
Conservative government of Ontario abolished this protection.
<P>
	In Quebec, since the anti-strikebreaking legislation was 
introduced in 1977, labour disputes are no longer as violent and 
tend to get settled more quickly. Today, we enjoy unprecedented 
social peace in Quebec.
<P>
	Having been involved in the labour movement for 19 years, I 
know this area pretty well. I even introduced a bill of my own 
containing very specific anti-strikebreaking provisions. I hope that, 
when the time comes, we can count on the support and co-operation 
of this government. While many Liberal members are quite 
sensitive to this issue, all the Minister of Labour actually told us is 
that anti-strikebreaking provisions may be included, but would 
apply only when an employer tries to break the union.
<P>
	This would be extremely hard to prove. How can one tell that the 
employer intends to break the union? You cannot prove that. This 
provision will have no immediate, concrete impact on labour 
relations.
<P>
	This is a most unfortunate shortcoming, which will hopefully be 
remedied through amendments to this bill, when it is considered at 
committee stage. I do hope the government will reconsider and 
include real anti-strikebreaking provisions in the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
those watching the debates in the House of Commons this morning 
I would like to once again say that this morning we are engaging in 
debate and comment on the government's speech from the throne 
which was presented nearly a year ago but which comes up on the 
Order Paper from time to time.
<P>
	The speech from the throne was about 13 pages and dealt with a 
number of areas where the government made representations to
<P>
Canadian citizens that it would deal with those areas and how it 
would deal, what measures it would put into place.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to use my time this morning to address the area of 
justice and public safety and how it was dealt with in the speech 
from the throne. I would also like to make some comments where I 
believe and we believe this country needs to be going in this 
important area.
<P>
	The speech from the throne dealt with the area of justice with 
one short paragraph of 7 lines in a 13 page document. I hope that 
does not indicate to Canadians the emphasis, importance and 
priority this government places on public safety.
<P>
	However, in those seven lines we find very little substance and 
no specifics at all. These seven lines deal with the non-violent 
character of our country, stating that because our country is 
non-violent citizens are secure. I guess the government has not 
been looking at some of the recent trends in crime. In fact, violent 
crime has tripled since 1962. Crimes against property have 
skyrocketed during the same period. Violent crimes, most 
disturbingly, by young offenders have increased 244 per cent from 
1980 to 1993 alone.
<P>
	Statistics Canada, which is an arm of the government itself, 
estimates that fully 90 per cent of sexual assaults are not reported, 
that 68 per cent of other assaults are not reported and 53 per cent of 
robberies are not reported.
<P>
	When we talk to Canadians across the country as elected 
representatives it becomes increasingly clear that Canadians no 
longer feel secure in what the government is pleased to term the 
non-violent character of our country.
<P>
	We do need to get serious and take a serious look at measures 
that can provide safe homes and safe streets for the citizens of this 
country.
<P>
	The government is trying to find ways to keep people out of 
prison and out of contact with the justice system. I would suggest 
that whatever measures are being put in place are not effective. It 
talks about reforming criminal procedures to better serve the 
victims of crimes. That is a goal I think all Canadians would agree 
with. Unfortunately, the Liberal record does not square with that 
very laudable goal.
<P>
	In fact, if we look at the major bills that have been introduced by 
this government we see some very disturbing trends that continue 
to emphasize the rights and considerations being given to criminals 
and law breakers instead of really looking at how victims can be 
given a greater standing and consideration in the justice system.
<P>
	If we look at five of the major bills that have been put forward in 
the justice area by the justice minister, I think we need to very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6232"> 6232 </A></B>
<P>
quickly assess the efficiency and  effectiveness with which 
government has kept promises to Canadians made in the throne 
speech.
<P>
	First there was Bill C-41 which purported to deal with hate 
crimes and put more emphasis on what was in the mind of the 
perpetrator of a crime, the criminal, rather than the effect on the 
victim. We say that assault is equally wrong regardless of who was 
assaulted or for what reason. If someone beats a person up it hurts. 
They need to have redress. There needs to be protection. This 
emphasis on what was in the mind of the criminal surely is of no 
comfort or help to Canadians whose rights and safety have been 
breached.
<P>
	We then have Bill C-45 which again continued to leave in place a 
provision of the Criminal Code which allows a cold blooded 
murderer to be let back out on the streets after serving only 15 
years of his or her sentence. In fact, the sentence that is handed 
down for premeditated, cold blooded murder is life in prison. 
However, after only 15 years murderers can apply to have early 
parole and are very often successful when they do apply. Again we 
see that victims of crime, their families and friends come second to 
the extra considerations that are given to murderers.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-53 dealt with temporary passes from prison. It quadrupled 
the time that criminals could be absent from prison. One person 
described the bill as giving criminals an opportunity to apply for a 
two month vacation from prison for whatever reason, for example 
shopping trips. In some cases individuals who are out of custody 
have committed further crimes.
<P>
	Bill C-55 is the government's centrepiece legislation to deal with 
violent offenders and to get tougher with them. Unfortunately there 
are many flaws in the bill which have been debated in the House at 
some length. Violent offenders will still be released back into 
society with only minimal supervision.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-55 includes a rather bizarre and very 
troubling provision. Citizens who have been neither charged nor 
convicted of any criminal offence can be monitored electronically. 
Once again we have a government that shies away from strong 
measures to protect society while it allows for more government 
intrusiveness into the lives of law-abiding citizens who have not 
been convicted of any law breaking activities.
<P>
	We had the same problem with Bill C-68, the so-called gun 
control bill. It controls law-abiding citizens while it does little or 
nothing to stem the tide and the growing use of illegally obtained 
firearms.
<P>
	In spite of the nice words in the seven lines of the throne speech 
about public safety, the government's record is dismal.
<P>
	It is not right to criticize measures unless good alternatives can 
be proposed, which is why I am pleased  to put before the House the 
Reform Party's measures to increase public safety, to ensure the 
safety of our families and communities in this country.
<P>
	We would first enact a victims bill of rights. We have provisions 
for such a bill which have already been put before the House. We 
have urged the government to enact those provisions. Victims, 
innocent citizens, law-abiding citizens of this country should get 
the top consideration. However, the Liberal government has quite a 
different philosophy on public safety.
<P>
	In 1971 the Liberal solicitor general stood up in this very House 
and said: ``We are going to put the rehabilitation of individuals 
ahead of the protection of society''. That philosophy is continued in 
present Liberal bills. Victims are second and criminal rights and 
considerations are first. Canadians are tired of that. They want a 
whole shift. They want the justice system changed so that the 
protection of society, the protection of law-abiding innocent 
citizens, is number one. That is exactly what should be done.
<P>
	We would repeal the universal firearms registry enacted by this 
government and replace it with meaningful laws to control guns 
and to fight the criminal use of firearms.
<P>
	We would replace the Young Offenders Act. As we are all aware, 
in the past 20 to 25 years youth crime has shyrocketed. It is a very 
troubling aspect of our society. Young people themselves are the 
greatest victims of this increase in youth crime. Many young 
Canadians do not feel safe in our schools and communities. We can 
see examples of this over and over again. Something needs to be 
done about this. We need to deal with this issue seriously and the 
Reform Party is proposing measures to do that. We believe that 
young criminals must be held accountable for their actions in this 
society.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	We would also reform the parole system and abolish the early 
release of first degree murderers. We would also pave the way for a 
national referendum on the return of capital punishment. Many 
citizens are concerned that there is not a strong enough signal being 
sent to law breakers in this country, particularly to cold blooded 
murderers, that we will not tolerate that kind of victimization of 
innocent members of our society.
<P>
	We need to look at the specifics of how the past approaches to 
justice measures have been ineffective in protecting our society. In 
1991 Brian Mulroney's Conservative government introduced new 
gun control measures. At that time the auditor general criticized 
those measures because they lacked the necessary background data 
or evaluation process to really show whether there would be any 
potential benefits for such legislation. In other words, when 
measures are put into place by governments, they should have 
some objective criteria to measure how effective those measures 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6233"> 6233 </A></B>
<P>
are going to be in light of the cost and in light of the fact that we are 
dealing with the lives, property and freedoms of our citizens.
<P>
	To compound what was already a flawed process, in 1995 this 
Liberal justice minister introduced Bill C-68. This bill put into 
place a universal firearms registry that included shotguns and 
rifles. Of course the registration of handguns has been in place for 
over 60 years.
<P>
	The majority of the federal Tory senators who had put the 1991 
measures into place supported Bill C-68. Their leader, the member 
for Sherbrooke, did not show up for the vote on this measure in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party were the only ones who actively opposed 
the registration of shotguns and rifles. We have done so 
consistently. It is very clear to us that this universal firearms 
registry will squander already scarce law enforcement resources, 
time and money. Our law enforcement officers will now spend 
incredibly more time shuffling paper instead of fighting real crime.
<P>
	Our opposition to this registry should not be interpreted as being 
anti-gun control. Every citizen in this country and certainly myself 
and other members of my caucus believe we must control the 
criminal use of firearms which threaten the safety of our streets and 
of our citizens. We have a very tough zero tolerance policy for 
criminal offences involving firearms.
<P>
	The waste of money and resources involved in a universal 
registry for law-abiding citizens is something we oppose. We 
believe in the long term it will only hurt our goal of public safety 
which is the goal of our citizens. We want to see that goal reached 
in effective ways, not in the ways this government has brought in.
<P>
	The prison system as well needs to be looked at. We have some 
proposals to make it a more effective instrument of both 
rehabilitation and deterrence. In most Canadian prisons for 
example inmates are not required to work. They are also provided 
with taxpayer funded amenities which many of our citizens cannot 
hope to enjoy.
<P>
	This week my colleague from Fraser Valley West mentioned an 
older couple in his riding. The wife is in dire need of dental 
treatment. They were unable to save the amount necessary for the 
wife to get that treatment. Yet criminals are given such treatment 
routinely at no cost to them. Something is wrong with that picture.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	At some correctional facilities inmates even have access to golf 
courses, pool tables, cable television and extensive workout 
equipment. They qualify for free counselling, full medical and 
dental coverage, free university education and legal aid.
<P>
	Many young people in our country are worried about whether 
they will be able to afford the necessary training and university 
education in order to have secure jobs and  a good future. Tuition 
fees are rising and student loan burdens for graduates are growing. 
We therefore have to look at the priorities of a government which 
provides those kinds of free services to law breakers.
<P>
	In Canada inmates even have the right to vote. These people 
have flouted the law. They have victimized law-abiding innocent 
people in our society. They still have all the rights and privileges of 
citizenship. They even have amenities and services which 
taxpaying law-abiding citizens cannot afford. Something needs to 
be done about this.
<P>
	With respect to the Young Offenders Act, youth account for more 
robberies than those in the next two older age groups. In 1991 
youth were charged with a full 18,000 violent offences, twice as 
much as five years ago. In fact, violent crime by young offenders 
increased in all categories between 1986 and 1994. Homicide was 
up 36 per cent. Sexual assault was up 16 per cent. Aggravated 
assault was up 78 per cent. Robbery was up a whopping 131 per 
cent. We need to seriously address this problem.
<P>
	The Reform Party would replace the ineffective Young 
Offenders Act with measures which would truly hold young people 
accountable for crime. It is a small minority of youth. Most of the 
youth are upstanding citizens working hard to build a future for 
themselves and to gain the skills necessary to have a strong future. 
They should not be put to shame by the small minority which flouts 
the law virtually without consequence.
<P>
	The key to crime prevention is to strengthen families and 
communities rather than to rely exclusively on the judicial, parole 
and prison systems. When it comes to young offenders this means 
supporting the introduction of programs for the early detection and 
prevention of youth crime and the introduction of more effective 
rehabilitation measures and measures to support education and 
literacy, skills training, discipline and community service.
<P>
	We would also shift the balance from the rights of the accused to 
the rights of the victim and law-abiding citizens. As I said, we 
would replace the Young Offenders Act. We would redefine young 
offenders as 10 to 15 years of age. We would also permit the 
publication of names of all convicted violent young offenders. 
Serious offenders 14 to 15 years of age or any offender over 16 
would be tried in adult court.
<P>
	A Reform government would repeal section 745 of the Criminal 
Code which allows for the early release of first degree murderers. 
We would also ensure that violent offenders served their entire 
sentence, that repeat violent offenders would be declared 
dangerous offenders and that all parole would be tightly monitored 
and earned.
<P>
	These are measures which Canadians are asking for. They are 
common sense measures. They are designed to send a clear signal 
to law breakers that we will not tolerate the violation of the rights 
of innocent citizens. I urge the government to replace the vague 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6234"> 6234 </A></B>
<P>
seven line paragraph in the throne speech with some of these real 
effective measures which the Reform Party is proposing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments made by the hon. member from the 
Reform Party. A debate on the throne speech provides ample 
opportunity to find flaws in the way the government is following up 
on the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The Reform member spoke at length about crime-related issues. 
However, two things must be considered when dealing with the 
issue of crime. It seems to me that the hon. member overlooked one 
of these aspects, and I am going to ask her, in a few minutes, to give 
me her thoughts and beliefs regarding this aspect.
<P>
	The hon. member focused primarily on what happens once a 
crime has been committed, including the resulting problems for 
victims. However, she was silent on how to ensure that some 
crimes are not committed, and thus avoid having victims. As you 
know, for some time now and increasingly so, the federal 
government has been withdrawing its financial support to the 
provinces in the fields of education, health and welfare, with the 
result that some young people no longer have the support they need 
to start off on the right foot in life.
<P>
	It goes without saying that, later on, if these young people turn to 
crime, and some may even commit sordid acts, there are going to 
be victims. These victims deserve our compassion, and so do their 
families and friends.
<P>
	However, it would have been better to prevent the offender from 
turning to crime and thus avoid having victims. Until recently, the 
federal government assumed major responsibilities in terms of 
financial support to the provinces in the areas of education, health 
and welfare. By withdrawing its support, it has left the provinces in 
a tight situation and some are hard hit. Think of Ontario. And these 
provinces must now make major cuts, leaving segments of the 
population disadvantaged or in need of assistance. However, there 
will no longer be any help for these people.
<P>
	We know that, in certain cases, not all, most of the poor are 
honest folk, but this does not help young people get off to a good 
start, and the statistics are there to prove it. In certain cases, 
unfortunately, these people are drawn into a life of crime. The 
federal government therefore has a role to play here when 
taxpayers' money is involved. We are talking about prevention. 
The federal government no longer assumes this role, or is doing so 
less and less, to the great detriment of the provinces.
<P>
	Would not my hon. colleague from the Reform Party agree with 
me that this federal disinvestment also impacts on the crime rate,
<P>
and that the federal government  should therefore not focus solely 
on resolving problems after the fact, but should take greater action 
before the fact, which would be much safer for the people of 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed that my colleague was 
actually listening to my speech, which was very pleasing to me. I 
appreciate that. I know how busy members are sometimes and we 
are not able to pay attention to every intervention, but I appreciate 
the fact that you did and you raise excellent points.
<P>
	In my speech I did touch on the whole area of prevention. I agree 
with you that it is something we need to look at.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the hon. member please pretend 
the remarks are going through the Chair?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I do not know how I 
could have left you out of this equation, it was most improper. 
Please accept my apologizes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I did touch in my intervention on the whole matter 
of prevention. I agree with my colleague that it is most important. I 
had a discussion with some police officers in Calgary a few months 
ago and they told me they can tell as early as five years of age if an 
individual may be predisposed to a life of crime and law breaking. I 
found that very interesting. When my colleague suggests there can 
be early detection and prevention of a tendency toward criminal 
activity, that is borne out by some of the things I have heard and 
read.
<P>
	Reform members believe there should be support for the 
introduction of programs for the early detection and prevention of 
youth crime. There needs to be more effective rehabilitation 
programs, not just to put people away or put them in a closed 
facility for a period of time, but to have that time spent in activities 
that emphasize education, literacy and skills training. These people 
would then have a better opportunity to become productive 
members of society rather than otherwise. There should be an 
emphasis on discipline and community service.
<P>
	Reform believes that the key to crime prevention is to strengthen 
families and communities rather just relying exclusively on the 
judicial parole and prison systems.
<P>
	I would say two things in reply to my colleague's concern with 
regard to the decreased funding for the support of these kinds of 
activities. The Reform Party opposes such measures as a universal 
registry of every law-abiding citizen's firearms. This is a very 
ineffective deployment of scarce resources when every dollar is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6235"> 6235 </A></B>
<P>
needed for the kinds of programs that will help to give us safety. 
However, those dollars are going to activities that simply cause 
problems for law-abiding citizens and take  away law prevention 
and enforcement time. Reform opposes that.
<P>
	Second, this is why the Reform Party has kept saying that 
governments cannot continue to borrow. The government's interest 
bill when it took office three years ago was only $38 billion-I 
should not say only, that is a lot of money-and today it is $48 
billion. In three short years we have lost $10 billion to interest to 
lenders. That could have gone toward the kinds of programs that 
my colleague and I have been speaking about: to prevent crime, to 
detect crime early and to seriously assist people to become 
law-abiding citizens rather than lawbreakers. We have to get 
government spending under control so we do not continually have 
the resources that we need for these important programs eroded.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the enlightened words 
of my colleague on helping get young people off on the right track 
and on prevention. This is a topic dear to my own heart as well.
<P>
	For every dollar we invest, the government invests, in 
prevention, scores of dollars would not have to be invested in the 
administration of justice, and in incarceration, further down the 
road.
<P>
	It costs about $100,000 a year to keep someone in a federal 
penitentiary--an astronomical sum. Helping a young person in 
difficulty, however, costs only a few thousand. What extraordinary 
savings could be realized, then, by putting our money in the right 
place.
<P>
	I would like to know whether my colleague from the Reform 
Party shares my point of view.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member makes a very 
important point, a point to which we need to listen. We talk a lot 
about dealing with crime after the fact. We do not talk enough 
about prevention and assistance to our young people especially. I 
am in complete agreement with the hon. member.
<P>
	We need to more seriously focus on that area of the justice 
system. I thank him for bringing forward those points.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to continue the debate today on the subject of 
the government's throne speech some months ago. I can tell from 
the enthusiasm in the House today that it is still a topic of interest 
and that members are looking at lots of issues.
<P>
	I would like to touch on four separate elements of the throne 
speech and the government's current program that arose from or 
were referred to in the throne speech.
<P>
	The first area is that of economic opportunity and jobs. This has 
been a theme of governments for many years  and it will probably 
always be so. The government had mapped out a game plan on 
being elected in 1993 and the economic opportunity program 
continued with this throne speech.
<P>
	Everyone in the House will agree that the issue of jobs is a 
function of economics. Governments simply cannot go out with a 
bucket of money, pour it into a particular city or region and hope 
that jobs will accrue. That is not what happens. The creation of jobs 
is something that happens when the rubber hits the road, when the 
business person decides to hire, decides to invest in a new 
production facility and sells more product. Where all of those 
business functions are positive that is when jobs are created.
<P>
	What is the government doing to foster the economic conditions 
that give rise to those jobs? There are several indicators. In fact 
there are hundreds of indicators. Of the most important ones I have 
selected four where the indicators are showing very positive 
economic progress, the kind that gives rise to job creation. They are 
not in any particular order.
<P>
	Canada's current account, the balance of moneys moving in and 
out of the country, has entered positive territory for the first time in 
many years. That was tough to turn around. When the government 
was elected in 1993 there were many who thought the circumstance 
was desperate. I am very pleased to see that we now have current 
account surpluses in existence. In the most recent quarter and in 
future economic quarters and years we project a continuing current 
account surplus.
<P>
	This of course has a very positive effect on the Canadian dollar 
which has moved recently over the 75 cent U.S. mark and which 
economists predict is going to continue to appreciate. While that 
sounds great, I know there are exporters in Canada who are not 
always comfortable as the dollar appreciates because that means 
their Canadian goods and services are more expensive for outside 
Canadian purchasers.
<P>
	The second area is a prominent one. It is the battle to eliminate 
the deficit. I do not think there is anyone in the House who could 
deny the substantial progress that the government under the 
leadership of the finance minister has made toward the elimination 
of the deficit. We are now in 2 per cent of GDP territory. The 
objective for the following fiscal period is now targeted at 1 per 
cent of GDP.
<P>
	In approximately the second quarter of 1998 the government will 
have zero cash borrowing requirements. We simply will not have 
any new borrowing needs for current operations. We will have to 
continue to recycle the government debt, but that is a very 
significant point. Perhaps I should not be projecting, but the 
economic models are showing no new borrowing in approximately 
the second quarter of 1998.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6236"> 6236 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	If we were in one of the other G7 countries, France, U.S.A., 
Germany and Great Britain, the government accounts are measured 
differently from the way we do it in Canada. If we measured our 
public accounts the way they measure theirs I could stand here and 
say we would have no deficit in the second quarter of 1998. 
However, we measure our government finances differently.
<P>
	We cannot change it now because we will all get the sense that 
we are cooking the books and changing the rules. Therefore, we 
will keep our unique Canadian way and aim for the elimination of 
the deficit based on the Canadian measuring sticks. I think we are 
headed toward approximately 1999 or 2000. These issues are up to 
Canadians who spend money, Canadians who pay taxes and the 
finance minister who has his hands on the purse strings.
<P>
	The last indicator of economic prosperity has to be interest rates. 
It was only yesterday that I noted that mortgage interest rates were 
publicly advertised now at 5.4 per cent. We have not seen interest 
rates like that since roughly the end of the last war.
<P>
	I can recall in my previous incarnation, prior to being an elected 
member of the House, meeting people who had one of these old 
30-year, CMHC mortgages with interest rates of around 5 per cent, 
6 per cent and 7 per cent. Those mortgages would have been 
amortized and maturing approximately at the end of the 1970s and 
beginning of the 1980s. I remember people saying: ``We will never 
see those kinds of interest rates again, never. Those are part of 
history''. Here we are in 1996 looking at those kinds of interest 
rates again.
<P>
	The point I would make is that, as Canadians, we can be seen to 
actually be in control of interest rates. We are able to do things in 
government that directly affect interest rates. Maybe we never 
believed we could to that before but now we see that we can do it 
because we did it. I think we can take credit for all that we have 
done. It was not just a decision of the finance minister. It was not 
just a decision of a bank. It was a whole constellation of political 
decisions and acceptance by Canadians of a fiscal program that 
would enable these interest rates to reduce.
<P>
	I want to leave economics now and go into the area of trust of 
government. I served in the 34th Parliament and I know that my 
first two weeks in this place the House had to deal with a matter 
involving trust. It was my first intervention in this place in 1989. I 
think it is fair to say that in the last two, three or four years there 
has been a lot fewer incidents where material issues of public trust 
have been taken up in this House. I do not want to suggest that there 
are never any. There are always some.
<P>
	However, in terms of material issues of public trust, I am very 
confident that the Prime Minister has shown us a standard which 
we can comfortably follow, hopefully for  many years. I know I am 
proud to follow that standard and I think Canadians believe that.
<P>
	I think public polls, where various types of questions are asked, 
indicate that Canadians are beginning to have a sense of trust in 
government, not in the sense that government can do everything, it 
never could and just cannot, but in their sense of confidence in the 
integrity at least of this Prime Minister and this government's high 
standards. I know, the cabinet knows and I think members opposite 
know what those standards are. I think we are doing a much better 
job of meeting those standards.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	One way which we show that we are meeting the standards falls 
under the rubric of accountability. Journalists write about, 
politicians speak about, Canadians ask about it. This government 
has made a very real attempt to be directly accountable. It is a very 
big manifestation.
<P>
	When I sought election to the House as a Liberal member I ran 
on the policies in the red book. I used it in my campaign and in 
much of what I do and what I vote on here and sometimes what I 
speak about. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are following 
what is in the red book and proof of that was the decision of the 
Prime Minister a couple of week ago to publish what he and his 
cabinet and the government have accomplished in delivering on the 
red book promises.
<P>
	Some people viewed that as political grandstanding. To be sure, 
it was political. However, it was an attempt to account to Canadians 
for what the government had accomplished vis-a-vis the red book. 
Individuals may disagree with the score card and may say we have 
done 8 out of the 10 things but there are still two remaining. That is 
fair. This was intended to say that by our account we have fulfilled 
78 per cent of the commitments of the red book and we still have 
approximately another year left in our mandate. Every week, every 
month there are announcements and decisions by the government 
which continue to improve the record of accountability. I am proud 
of that.
<P>
	I realize that at some time I will have to account to my electors in 
Scarborough-Rouge River for only scoring 86 per cent of 87 per 
cent. In this modern complex world I challenge any institution, any 
government or corporation, whether it be a hospital, a school or a 
commercial entity, to deliver 100 per cent on anything as the years 
unfold. Do not forget, we are dealing with government which is 
very complex and very broad. I am very comfortable with the 
process of accounting.
<P>
	Another little element of this, one little snapshot of where I 
believe the Prime Minister and the government have shown they 
are more accountable is in the innovation of the government's 
decision to put in place a commissioner to oversee the activities of 
the  Communications Security Establishment, a signals intelligence 
agency with a high degree of capability of eavesdropping. This 
agencies has carried on since the second world war with out any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6237"> 6237 </A></B>
<P>
legislative mandate and without any accountability mechanism, as 
far as I have been able to determine. There certainly was a minister 
in the House, but rarely if ever were there any question put in the 
House on this subject. Even more rarely were answers given.
<P>
	Now a former judge has been appointed, and the accountability 
mechanism there to assist Parliament, sharing accountability, was 
an innovation which was not there before. I am very proud to be 
part of a government that was bold enough to address that issue.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Third, what has happened in the region I represent in terms of the 
throne speech? What has the government delivered? What has the 
throne speech done? My riding of Scarborough-Rouge River is 
part of the greater Toronto area. It is difficult to look at a particular 
riding in that area in isolation.
<P>
	However, I know that the financial community on Bay Street 
likes what this government has done, what it has delivered. I know 
that for the second year in a row, Canada's exports are hitting 
record highs. Never before have we exported as much as we have 
recently, which means jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Never before have I as a Canadian felt so plugged into the world. 
From my riding and from the GTA I see goods and services being 
exported from Canada to all parts of the world. Now there is no part 
of the world in which Canadians are not marketing, selling, 
building, advising. It is really a treat to see this happening. We have 
a lot of Canadians with a lot of abilities who are working in that 
area.
<P>
	Rouge Valley Park is a unique 5,000 acre green preserve within 
metropolitan Toronto. The federal government has done its part. It 
has delivered on its funding commitment. We are very proud that 
the Rouge Valley Park alliance is moving ahead with the 
co-operation of all the other levels of government, provincial, 
municipal, metro and the regional conservation authority, to 
accomplish its objectives.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the Minister of National Defence and the 
GTA caucus are dedicated to taking a piece of the Downsview air 
base and turning it into green space and other positive 
infrastructure for the GTA.
<P>
	The commercialization of the Toronto airport is now proceeding. 
The carpet has been ripped up; the doors at the entrance to terminal 
II, which never worked, have finally been replaced; a new tower is 
being constructed; a new runway is being constructed; the other 
runways have been repaired. Millions of dollars in investment are 
going into the Pearson airport which is a huge economic  entity. It 
is the gateway to central Canada and for many people around the 
world it is the gateway to Canada.
<P>
	One of the things visitors to Toronto will see is the new trade 
centre which is being constructed on the Canadian National 
Exhibition grounds. The centre is a product of the 
federal-provincial infrastructure program, a federal program 
contained in the red book. This huge attractive trade centre will be 
open shortly. Canadians will market our goods and services to the 
entire world through this trade centre. We will compete with trade 
centres globally. There are some great centres out there, just as the 
GTA trade centre will be.
<P>
	I cannot talk about the throne speech without mentioning 
national unity. The government has a program which has been 
debated in the House. We want to modernize the federation in little 
bites because we have found the big bite is too much for Canadians, 
too much for this House. We have not been able to do it in big 
chunks. We are working on that in many areas, co-operation 
federally and provincially, avoiding duplication, job training, 
environmental protection, a national securities commission, which 
I think is an excellent objective, and dealing with partitionists in 
Quebec who would partition Canada. Some are called separatists, 
some are called secessionists.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	This is a matter that has to be addressed and will continue to be 
addressed maybe for another 100 years. However, I believe that 
Canadians and Quebecers are going to be able to deal with this 
issue, as tough as it is. We have to give a lot of elbow room to all 
the provinces, including Quebec, so that each of the groupings 
across the country can achieve their goals as a region or as a 
province. I am confident that this government, under this Prime 
Minister, will be able to accomplish this objective and all others.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know where to begin. We are having a lively debate on the throne 
speech which was presented nine months ago. The government 
must have pretty thin legislation to offer this up for debate today. It 
should be an embarrassment to the government.
<P>
	The hon. member painted a rosy picture about all the great and 
wonderful things that are happening in this country. He tied them 
into trust. I would like to talk about trust a bit. I believe that 
looking at some of the truths is also important.
<P>
	It is true that when the Liberals were in opposition they opposed 
the NAFTA and free trade itself. In fact they had a leader who ran 
on a platform against free trade. There was a red book promise that 
the NAFTA would not be approved until the dispute settlement 
mechanism was revisited. That would have avoided the unneces-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6238"> 6238 </A></B>
<P>
sary nasty deal that was recently negotiated on softwood lumber. 
That is not good news.
<P>
	In opposition the Liberals complained incessantly about the 
philosophy of the governor of the Bank of Canada, Crow, and his 
anti-inflation policy. When the Liberals were in opposition they 
were against that. Now they are taking the credit. It was that policy 
of the Bank of Canada which toed the tough line when it was 
necessary and it was the right thing to do. Canadians knew it, but 
the Liberals did not know it in opposition. They were against it.
<P>
	Now they are taking credit for low interest rates. Now they are 
taking credit for the expansion of exports. That is what is 
expanding the economy. Domestic growth is nil. When interest 
rates are really low, that is a sign of failure. That means that the 
economy has stalled. They should not be patting themselves on 
their backs.
<P>
	The banks and all lenders want to lower their rates to induce 
people to borrow. Why? Because they are not borrowing. We 
should talk about the other side of the story.
<P>
	The Liberals are saying that in two years from now, when our 
deficit is only $9 billion, there will be no new borrowing. We will 
have a balanced budget because of the way in which the countries 
which belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development measure their deficits.
<P>
	Consider this logic. We will have a $9 billion deficit. The hon. 
member said that when we hit that single digit level we will have a 
balanced budget. There will be no new borrowing. Where are they 
going to get $9 billion? They are going to borrow it from the civil 
service pension fund. That is a loan. That is a debt. They should not 
be telling Canadians that there will no longer be deficit financing or 
borrowing. That is a distortion of the truth. I am embarrassed that 
the finance minister is talking that way and letting the Prime 
Minister get away with things like that. It is cooking the books. It is 
saying that they broke the back of the deficit when they are not 
coming clean with the Canadian public.
<P>
	Let us do that. Let us say that we have a $9 billion deficit. We are 
going to borrow it from the civil service pension fund, but we will 
have a balanced budget. That is not true.
<P>
	This government brags about the steps it took and the spending 
cuts it made. It will be sad when the member goes back to his riding 
to seek re-election. I am going to submit that it is his government 
which is responsible for the nurses who are losing their jobs and for 
the teachers who are losing their jobs. Who reduced spending for 
education and health care by $7 billion? The government. Who has 
to live with it? The provincial governments, and these guys are 
patting themselves on the back and blaming the provinces for doing 
a poor job. Excuse me. That is a sorry way to run a country. It is a 
poor excuse for taking responsibility and telling the truth to 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Spending to the provinces by this government has been reduced 
by 42 per cent. Spending on its own federal administrative costs is 
only about 1.3 per cent. Tell me how all these spending reductions 
were made. On the backs of the provinces and the government is 
bragging about it.
<P>
	I just wanted to comment for about five minutes. I will allow an 
equal five minutes for the hon. member to comment. But that is the 
other side of the story. It is the complete picture. That is what we 
have to look at here: both sides of the story. The hon. member can 
comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed to hear all the doom 
and gloom from the other side. Things are not nearly as bad as the 
hon. member makes them out to be.
<P>
	His comment that low interest rates signal a collapsed economy 
is laughable. Perhaps the member would have visited Japan a 
couple of years ago and said: ``My goodness, you only have a 6 per 
cent interest rate. Your economy must be collapsed''. This is a joke. 
The member does not understand what a low interest rate means. 
But let us leave that and move on.
<P>
	The member has suggested that the Liberals did not agree with 
the Bank of Canada monetary policy in the last decade. There were 
times when we did not, that is very true. The Bank of Canada policy 
in targeting an excessively low inflation rate in the range of 1 to 2 
per cent, which it was, underbid what the economy was capable of 
doing. Consequently it caused a prolonged recession.
<P>
	People are not going to be told that, but that is what happened. 
The policy chosen by the bank and adopted by the government 
prolonged and exacerbated the recession of 1991-92. Liberals 
would have done it another way, just like we found other ways to 
make cuts in government spending. There is more than one way to 
skin a cat.
<P>
	The member thinks that because we thought we could have done 
a better job with the free trade agreement with the United States of 
America and with Mexico, that it is a reason for giving up on 
trading. Canada does not trade just with the United States or just 
with Mexico; we trade with the world. Our trade with the rest of the 
world is expanding.
<P>
	It is simply inappropriate and silly for the member to focus on 
the free trade agreement as being the function, the common 
denominator of the current government policy to foster trade with 
the rest of the world. The free trade agreement simply does not 
apply to that type of trade. The World Trade Organization rules do 
and that is where we are putting our money.
<P>
	The member suggested that it has been a long time since the 
throne speech, that we must not have very much going on now that 
is important if we have started discussing a speech that happened 
nine months ago. I am  sure the hon. member will agree with me 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6239"> 6239 </A></B>
<P>
that we have been so darn busy dealing with important legislation 
that we have not had the time or ability to get back to the throne 
speech, which was a very good throne speech.
<P>
	Some day the hon. member and his party will thank the Prime 
Minister and his government for delivering us through, no matter 
how they count the deficit, to a stable economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend the Liberal member who happens to 
be the only Liberal who dared to speak in the House this morning to 
defend the speech from the throne. None of the others did. He is the 
first one we have heard from. We have not heard from any 
members from Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to ask him whether we, members of the official 
opposition, are not clear proof that this government has done 
absolutely nothing about the main problem it is facing. It was 
elected, and now it has across the way, as the official opposition, a 
sovereignist party that wants to make Quebec a sovereign state. In 
the past three and one half years, the government has done 
absolutely nothing to deal with this question.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	When you say that you will be glad to go back to your 
constituents and tell them you got a score of 86 per cent, what are 
you going to tell them when they say you have done nothing to 
diminish the impact in Parliament of opposition members who 
want to completely transform the Canadian entity by turning it into 
two distinct countries? Do you think Canadians will be proud of the 
Liberal government's score?
<P>
	Here is the other question I wanted to ask, very briefly. It is true 
that interest rates have gone down, but to buy a house today, you 
need a job. What have you done to ensure that Canadians have 
jobs?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members will please direct their 
comments to the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know where the hon. member is coming 
from and we all do. He has a role to play in opposition. He is 
critical of the government because it has not been able to help the 
opposition in its objectives.
<P>
	There is no way in the world that this government is going to 
assist the official opposition in its number one goal of partitioning 
Canada. I am sorry, I regret that we cannot do that. I am not even 
sure we could do it legally if we wanted to. I hope he will forgive 
the government for that.
<P>
	In terms of modernizing the federation, we have gone some 
distance. After the referendum last year, the government 
committed to three separate things and we  have delivered or gone 
down the road to delivering on all three. I know the member 
opposite will agree that the government has done it. It may not 
accomplish his list. It may not get Canada dissolved. It may not 
partition Canada but it does deal with the issue of modernizing the 
federation.
<P>
	This government is going to continue to work on that agenda 
using small bites. If the province of British Columbia has a 
problem with item X and the province of Quebec has a problem 
with item Y, the federal government is going to work on it. The 
federal government always has, provided the provinces 
communicate and the federal government communicates back. We 
have seen a lot of progress and I think we will see more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to speak in this debate 
on the address in reply to the speech from the throne-although 
this particular speech from the throne goes back to last 
February-because we now have a better perspective on what the 
federal government has done in the past six months since it made 
those promises in the speech from the throne. Today, we are in a 
better position to evaluate the results.
<P>
	Last week in committee, I had before me the President of the 
Treasury Board, who said more or less that the role of government 
was to meet the expectations of its citizens.
<P>
	I suggest we evaluate on those terms the government's record on 
what it promised in the speech from the throne. Did it meet the 
expectations of its citizens during the past year? Did it meet its 
objectives, deal with political situations and take corrective action 
when necessary?
<P>
	The first item is fighting the deficit. One could say that yes, on 
the whole they managed to reduce the deficit, at least on the face of 
it, but in fact, and the hon. member for the Reform Party hit the nail 
on the head earlier, 42 per cent of the cuts were made in transfer 
payments to the provinces. This means that today, when we see 
50,000 or 60,000 people demonstrating against the provincial 
government in Ontario, it is largely as a result of these cuts.
<P>
	Twenty CEGEPs in Quebec are on strike as a result of these 
federal cuts. The federal government decided to reduce funding in 
this area because it was easier to cut at the expense of the provinces 
than to cut closer to home. The most obvious example of this is that 
this week, the Liberal majority voted against a motion to abolish 
the Senate.
<P>
	We spend $43 million a year on the unelected Senate, whose 
members are appointed for purely partisan reasons. The govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6240"> 6240 </A></B>
<P>
ment decided to turn a blind eye to this and continue paying this 
$43 million but, at the  same time, it did not hesitate to cut $1.2 
billion from transfer payments to the provinces. Let the provinces 
deal with their own problems.
<P>
	That is what the government has done to fight the deficit. So it 
did not get a passing mark. Clearly, the people of Quebec and 
Canada are not happy with the results, especially in ridings like 
mine, where people realize how they hid the fight against the 
deficit behind UI benefits.
<P>
	They changed the law, and we will see the results in the coming 
months. The federal government's day of reckoning has yet to 
come. It will come when people receive their last UI cheques in 
February, March or April 1997. They will realize that the reform 
cut 10, 12, 15 weeks and that they will have to go on social 
assistance while the UI fund boasts a $5 billion surplus.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	This is unacceptable. I almost feel like saying it is practically 
immoral to let people starve while the UI fund is growing. That is 
the result of the deficit-fighting measures planned in the Liberal 
government's throne speech.
<P>
	As for employment, did this government deliver the goods? Two 
and a half years ago, it campaigned on the following theme: we will 
create jobs, we will put people back to work. It did create some 
jobs, but there are still 800,000 fewer jobs than before the 1990 
recession.
<P>
	Above all, the government did not solve the problem of finding 
jobs for those who are now unemployed. We can put in place every 
possible measure to improve Canada's competitiveness in 
technology, and ensure that engineers and technicians have jobs. 
Fine, that is great. That is the way to go. But the problem today is 
that, while technologies are being developed, we have all these 
people with no technical training who are systematically being put 
out of work, people whom we are unable to retrain so that they can 
find another job to support themselves and be proud of it. That is 
the challenge the Liberal government has failed to take on in any 
way, shape or form. It is riding the wave of economic recovery. The 
interest rates have gone down. Great, but that does little to improve 
the situation of those who cannot afford to invest in the economy. 
When you are 25 years old and jobless, you do not start a family, 
buy a house and contribute to society, and that does not make you 
happy.
<P>
	The federal government should take a lesson from the Quebec 
economic summit, where, in a show of solidarity, unions, 
employers, the government and community organizations all 
agreed on one thing: there must be a clear and precise job creation 
target. When did this government agree to set a job creation target 
like the deficit reduction it had set for itself? It would be a good 
objective for this government to tell us what it is prepared to do, so 
that in one, two or three years, the unemployment rate in the 
country would go down by 2, 3 or 4 per cent, and so that we could 
see the impacts on quality of life and social expenditures. It would 
be interesting for Canadians to see their Prime Minister rise in this 
House and say: ``Our challenge will be to ensure that Canada's 
unemployment rate goes down by 2 per cent over the next two 
years''. This is in fact what labour federations are asking of the 
Prime Minister. To then see the whole government administration 
work toward this objective would be of significance.
<P>
	This is the type of concrete measure that is required, not a speech 
from the throne in which there is nothing to really change the 
situation, and in which the government relies on market forces. The 
result is that those who are solid enough manage to survive, which 
is fine, but those who are less gifted and who had less opportunities 
through their education do not. This government evaluates its 
performance on how it provides an opportunity to the strongest 
ones. However, a society or a government should assess its record 
based on the opportunities it provides to each and everyone to make 
a contribution.
<P>
	Society should be evaluated on how it uses its human potential. 
There are people who have not managed to complete their high 
school, who do not have a job and who have not been retrained. 
This government will be a good government the day it will make 
sure everyone is used to his or her full potential and is given an 
opportunity to make a proper contribution to society.
<P>
	The speech from the throne alluded to this issue, but these were 
only words. There is no concrete action or result, and this is very 
unsatisfactory. As autumn ends and winter begins, a tour through 
our ridings will bring home the insecurity people feel about jobs 
and the problems experienced by seasonal workers in particular 
when they think of what they are facing next February and March 
with the unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	They called it employment insurance. What a terrible piece of 
marketing. Employment insurance should mean a system that 
makes it possible to guarantee employment to somebody who has 
potential and can achieve it. They change the name and the 
packaging, but the product is even worse than before. It is 
unacceptable, and the government will certainly be judged on it by 
the people. I urge the government, if it dares, to go before the 
public today on this issue. You can count on a very clear and very 
direct message from Quebecers.
<P>
	There is another point I wish to raise, which involves something 
even more basic. It is the issue of this government's leadership. 
This is a government whose management style is short-sighted. 
Three years ago, the public elected 54 members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, a secessionist party, a sovereignist party that wants to 
create two countries within Canada. The message was not clear 
enough.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that Quebec's problem was an 
economic one, that the government was going to create jobs and 
reduce the deficit and the problem would go away. Except that 
there was the surprise of October 30, 1995, when they realized that, 
despite everything, 49.4 per cent of Quebecers had voted for 
sovereignty. That shook them to their short-sighted roots. For 
almost a month, they had been saying: ``This time it is really 
serious. We had better make promises, something must be done''.
<P>
	The morning after the results were in, they started to say that the 
only thing the federal government could do was to table a little 
resolution in the House about distinct society, thinking that then the 
effort would have been made.
<P>
	I was never an admirer of Mr. Mulroney, but compare the effort 
he made in the past to unite Canada with this lack of response to the 
emergency situation created by the referendum. There is a world of 
difference. The present government lacks leadership with respect 
to the situation in Quebec. It is not surprising that Quebecers are 
the only ones in Canada seriously dissatisfied with the federal 
government at this time: 68 per cent of them are dissatisfied with 
the performance of the federal government.
<P>
	Despite a period of economic growth, despite the fact that there 
has been at least some progress in the battle against the deficit, is 
there not a message here which the federal government ought to 
receive, to which it ought to adjust, on which it ought to make some 
proposals? Yet nothing is forthcoming. There are no proposals, and 
they are saying that they will react only once they have come up 
against a wall. This strikes me as a truly aberrant situation. People 
are waiting for concrete actions from this government, proof that it 
is going to react.
<P>
	To give another example, in the throne speech, reference was 
made to the pertinence of reforming the way shipping is managed 
in Canada. The diagnosis is fairly obvious, in my opinion. The 
federal government has been letting its facilities deteriorate for the 
past 30 years. The proof of this is that, today, 80 per cent of 
facilities are more or less useless, because they have never been 
properly developed. They have just been patched up here and there, 
over and over.
<P>
	We are in a problematical situation. The government says that 
changes must be made, and the first statement made, one which we 
agree with, is that the job of management was done by people who 
were too far away from the action, who could not possibly know 
what the concerns were in each region, who could not do any 
separate marketing, who could not allow facilities to compete with 
each other. Solutions had to be sought across Canada before the 
government could finally grasp that some latitude must be given to 
these facilities, but there are still many aspects that have not been 
settled.
<P>
	The address in response to the throne speech offers me the 
opportunity to tell the government that there will still be much to 
be done when the transportation bill is examined in the report or 
third reading stage. Since Confederation, this field has been 
characterized by a great deal of political partisanship. Every riding 
has its own story of someone who was port master because he was a 
Tory, another who was port master at another time because he was a 
Grit. These situations have never been settled.
<P>
	Yesterday in committee I proposed an amendment to ensure that 
the people appointed are qualified, and it was turned down by the 
Liberal majority. I was not calling for the minister to stop making 
appointments, not calling for him to no longer be able to choose 
between candidates, but only for assurance that they were 
qualified. Once again, the system took too long for adjustments to 
be made, and for actions to be taken accordingly. This is a specific 
problem relating to partisan politics, and one that is important to 
the public. It is important for the government to show evidence of 
acting justly.
<P>
	There is something even more fundamental involved as well. In 
this reform, there is a provision for the regional ports, the ones that 
are doing business, but not necessarily on an international scale, to 
be able to be turned over to local interests.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	We have tried, and we must keep on trying to add components to 
the legislation that will remove the arbitrary, political element and 
ensure that decisions to invest in Baie-Comeau, Cacouna, New 
Brunswick or western Canada are not made on the basis of the 
political colour of their representatives but on the basis of 
economic interest. The government should use the economic 
profiles and statistics compiled by officials with the Department of 
Transport and interpret them intelligently.
<P>
	Another important aspect is to ensure that ports without any 
commercial economic activity except a ferry service like 
Rivière-du-Loup to Saint-Siméon or Trois-Pistoles to Les 
Escoumins on the North Shore-can be sold at a good price without 
any interruption of service. This is a good example of the 
imperfections in our system and the need for reform. Ignoring the 
need for reform reflects a major lack of leadership on the part of the 
Canadian government.
<P>
	If no guarantees are given, we may get some outlandish 
situations. For instance, the federal government may decide it will 
no longer maintain a harbour facility, it may decide to get rid of the 
port of Rivière-du-Loup, for instance, even if the ferry offers an 
essential service recognized by the Government of Quebec and 
there is a subsidy for this service.
<P>
	The federal government, which is responsible for wharves, 
might decide it no longer has the money and no longer wants to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6242"> 6242 </A></B>
<P>
maintain the facility. The region would then be in a totally 
unacceptable situation. The government has to move, to react, to 
implement concrete solutions.
<P>
	I admit that in this particular case, Bill C-44, there was a lot of 
consultation. Suggestions were made which were adopted, but 
many aspects remain to be settled. I hope the government will find 
a way to do that.
<P>
	To sum up, should Canadians be satisfied with what they heard 
in the speech from the throne and the way it has been implemented?
<P>
	My answer is what people on the street, at the barbershop or the 
cornerstore are telling me. They ask where are the jobs all these 
government projects were supposed to provide. They ask me what 
is happening. Why do they not see any results? People no longer 
believe that millions of dollars have been cut and millions invested. 
They want to know if their neighbour will get a job, if any positive 
result will be achieved anywhere.
<P>
	In a riding like mine, Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, it will be 
a few more months before we can see if the government action was 
successful in any real way. We will have to wait and see if the 
transactions which are supposed to allow the local community take 
charge of the port facilities in Cacouna and to ensure the future of 
the ferries between Rivière-du-Loup and Saint-Siméon, and 
between Trois-Pistoles and Les Escoumins will come through. That 
is what matters.
<P>
	Regarding the employment insurance reform, a bill providing for 
the conversion of seasonal workers' contribution to the economy 
will have to be tabled. Seasonal workers must be able to find work 
during the winter. The government has increased the number of 
weeks required to qualify for benefits while reducing the benefit 
period. If only the negative aspects of the UI reform make it, we are 
headed for a major social crisis. I urge the federal government to 
find solutions and listen to those organizations that make 
suggestions.
<P>
	In my riding, there is a coalition of forest management 
companies. They are developing a plan, not to artificially create 
employment or to pay seasonal workers to do nothing, but to 
provide them with an extra three or four weeks of work, either in 
the spring or in the fall, through solutions involving forestry, 
processing forestry products and developing new products in order 
to achieve interesting results. This is my heartfelt cry to the 
government in this respect.
<P>
	We have fought long and hard against employment insurance 
reform. If the government wants to send a clear message to the 
regions, where there are many seasonal workers, telling them that 
there is not only bad news in this reform, time is running out. Act 
quickly, this is your last chance. The people in my riding will judge 
you by your actions.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	In reply to the speech from the throne, I think we can say, and I 
will conclude on this, the federal government has shown a blatant 
lack of leadership in terms of reducing the deficit for instance, by 
failing to cut back where it should have. In the area of employment, 
the proposed solutions are not the right ones and, on the 
constitutional issue, Quebec is being ignored and, to some extent, 
insulted. If the federal government's attitude does not change, the 
best solution will be to go our own way, because Quebecers are 
very patient.
<P>
	Twice already they asked Canada to change course and come up 
with proposals and twice Canada declined. The third time will be 
the right one. The Canadian economy will be completely 
reorganized and the Canadian territory will be divided in two 
countries, so that Quebecers can finally make decisions on what is 
important to them and for their future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to compliment the hon. member from the Bloc for a very 
constructive critique of the government's throne speech. I would 
like to dwell on one item that was in that throne speech which is of 
particular importance to his party and his party's objectives.
<P>
	There was a vague promise made by the Prime Minister months 
ago when the speech was given and I cannot remember the exact 
details, that all Canadians would have a say in the next referendum 
on separation. It is an issue that is very important and I would like 
to have the member enlighten me and clarify a few things because I 
am confused about two or three things that happened in the last 
referendum.
<P>
	The hon. member indicated in his speech that 49.5 per cent of 
Quebecers voted yes-it was very close-and that should send a 
signal to Ottawa. I agree with him. The government is not listening. 
It is not listening to westerners or to Quebecers and I agree.
<P>
	I disagree on what the solution is. I do not think it is separation. I 
am concerned about that. I would like to see Quebec stay in 
Canada. I would like to see Quebecers and the Bloc Quebecois 
argue for Quebec in the best interests of Quebec like an opposition 
party can using those tools to help it.
<P>
	I found the question in the last referendum to be ambiguous and 
convoluted. It was not a simple, straight, direct question of the 
citizens of the province of Quebec. I can verify that with the 
surveys, the information that came to me from the people who 
write stories in <I>Le Devoir</I>, which said that 39 per cent, or a high 
percentage of Quebecers did not really understand what they were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6243"> 6243 </A></B>
<P>
voting on. They thought Quebec could separate and still  stay in 
Canada and have some sort of economic association.
<P>
	I do not know why there has to be another referendum. 
Quebecers have voted twice on this issue and twice Quebecers have 
said to stay in Canada. Should the people of Quebec want another 
referendum and the member does get another referendum, would 
he agree that a straight, simple, direct question would be better and 
clearer for everybody? There would be fewer arguments, fewer 
flare ups. The question would be in French and English along the 
lines of: Do you want to separate from Canada, yes or no?
<P>
	If the answer to that simple and direct question were to be 
yes-which I hope it would not be-would the member explain to 
me what the plan is of the Bloc Quebecois? How and when does it 
plan to negotiate the separation agreement and terms? If there is no 
mechanism in place, which there is not now and it is not legal now 
as nothing in the Constitution allows for a province to secede, when 
do the negotiations start? Who does the negotiations? How does the 
Bloc Quebecois propose to settle issues, for example the size of the 
debt, the type of currency, access for Canadians through the 
province to the east coast. Issues such as those are extremely 
important.
<P>
	Those are the questions I would like to be enlightened upon by 
the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the Reform member for his 
question. I find it very significant that this question was asked by a 
member of the Reform Party. In fact, the Liberals are not asking 
questions this morning. I wonder what is happening; they seem to 
be ashamed of the throne speech.
<P>
	It is the kind of question Canadians should ask themselves. Such 
questions must be raised outside Quebec so we can search for a 
solution and decide how the matter should be settled.
<P>
	They are asking if Canadians will have a role to play in Quebec's 
next referendum. I myself think Canadians have a role to play now. 
If you want to show the people of Quebec that this country has a 
future, it is up to you. It is up to the Canadians to put their 
proposals on the table. But without any proposals, we cannot give 
you any answers, or even make suggestions. There is no leadership 
in this government. No one has made any significant proposal. 
What is clearer and more shocking to Quebecers is that this 
government's reforms are all superficial.
<P>
	Back in October 1995, things were heating up as minor proposals 
were being made left and right. One month later, they started to 
forget. And then last month, the Prime Minister repeated what he 
was saying in the fall of 1993: that Canada's problem is an 
economic one; that once the economy recovers, Quebecers will 
understand that Canada is the greatest country in the world and they 
will stay.
<P>
	Even if Quebec and Canada's economic situation were the best 
in the world, the fact is that a process is taking place in Quebec. A 
people is moving forward. A people is slowly learning. The 
numbers went from 40 per cent in 1980 to 49.4 per cent last year, 
and if the federal government does not meet their expectations, this 
people will choose to become a sovereign state.
<P>
	It will do so following a question whose wording will have been 
decided by Quebec's National Assembly, the only parliament in 
which Quebecers form a majority. This view is shared not only by 
the current premier, Mr. Bouchard, but also by the leader of the 
opposition, Daniel Johnson, and by the leader of Action 
démocratique, Mario Dumont.
<P>
	All Quebecers agree as regards the question. We are mature 
people. We do not live in a banana republic. We put a question 
twice. The first time, in 1980, we asked Quebecers for a mandate to 
negotiate. Forty per cent of the voters were prepared to merely let 
us negotiate. Last year, 49 per cent of them wanted us to build a 
country and to offer partnership to the rest of Canada. This is a very 
significant progress, because had we asked the same question last 
year as we did in 1980, the result may have been 55 or 60 per cent. 
This is an assumption, but one that could well reflect reality. In any 
case, Quebecers are making progress and sending a clear message 
to the current Liberal government.
<P>
	So, the question will be decided by the elected members of the 
Quebec Parliament. Until then, Canadians should tell us what they 
want. They have time to make proposals to us.
<P>
	The Canadian confederation is not unchanging. Since 
francophones and anglophones have been present in North 
America, we have had three or four different forms of government: 
Upper and Lower Canada, the Canadian Union and the 
Confederation. We must find formulae that are right for this 
economic entity. With the new rules of the game, such as the free 
trade agreement, this is very obvious.
<P>
	When I travelled through western Canada with the transport 
committee, this was brought home to me very strongly. Now, all 
trade runs in a North-South direction. Everyone is asking us for 
railway lines and highways that go south. This will bring about a 
fundamental transformation of Canada, independently of the 
options offered by politicians. This is therefore something that 
must be looked at. Quebecers and Canadians must behave like 
mature adults and tell one another that, in future, they wish to 
function in a different manner, work differently together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6244"> 6244 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore the question ``Are we going to separate or not?'' does 
not strike me as the right question to ask. The question Quebecers 
should be asked should be: ``Is there a formula that you would 
like to see, because the present one does not suit you?'' Basically, 
what they have always wanted is a sovereign state, with all 
decision-making powers in Quebec.
<P>
	It must be recalled that what Quebecers agreed to in 1867 was 
cultural and educational security, but we continued to grow and 
mature and now we are prepared to take over all responsibilities. 
Since I have been transport critic, I realize just how much the fact 
that Quebecers do not have jurisdiction over transportation has 
created major problems for them. Not because Canadians 
systematically have it in for Quebec, but because decisions have 
been taken that favoured east-west development rather than 
north-south development, for example, which was devastating for 
Quebec's economy.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This is where it starts to get interesting again. Our challenge, on 
the eve of the twenty-first century, whatever form Canada takes, 
will be to develop this north-south link, but we must adapt our 
political institutions to this new reality.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that our greatest criticism of the 
present Liberal government is that it lacks the basic leadership to 
resolve the problems of the year 2000. Sorting out this year's 
problems is not too bad, but a government's responsibility extends 
further. It must also have a vision of the future, and this is where 
the Liberals do not make the grade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to say a few words on the 
government's throne speech, which I find most appropriate at this 
time.
<P>
	When the Liberal Party formed the government in 1993, the 
country was, in my opinion, headed toward disaster. We were 
dreadfully in debt. Before our time, the whole idea had been to 
spend, spend, spend. The mortgage on the country, in other words 
the national debt, was increasing madly. Every year we had a 
deficit which was getting up near $50 billion.
<P>
	Suddenly, in 1993, the new Liberal government was faced with a 
situation calling for an economic program that held out some hope 
for Canadians, some hope for young people, some hope for their 
future and for the future of Canadian workers, and in particular 
some reassurance for seniors about government programs.
<P>
	Yes, the government did want to make cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bond market had a very negative outlook for Canada in 
1993. The interest rates were going up and one wondered if the 
international bond markets would keep on giving us a triple A 
rating. We were near collapse,  going in the other direction, and not 
even getting requests for the purchase of bonds.
<P>
	A program had to be instituted to put our house in order. That is 
exactly what has happened. The deficit has kept going down, down, 
down.
<P>
	The government does not create jobs. It did that in the past and it 
is only short term when it occurs. What we have to do is establish a 
climate for jobs and that climate has to be the proper economic 
climate.
<P>
	Our program was disciplined in cutting some programs. We are 
downsizing government, not shutting down government. That is 
the difference between us and some members of the opposition. We 
do not want to shut down government.
<P>
	We have to stop giving to everyone who thinks that all they have 
to do is write to the government requesting a grant. We have to do 
this in a reasonable fashion.
<P>
	This morning the interest rates decreased again. We have not 
seen interest rates like these in 40 years. People can now borrow to 
buy a home or to invest in some other fashion. That will create 
jobs. That is good. People can now spend money. It is affordable to 
borrow money in order to invest it. It is not to borrow money to 
have fun, to be wasteful. It is for investment, for example, in a 
home. Equity will build in that home and when it is sold in the 
future the owner will be able to live on that equity or they will be 
able to leave it to their children. We have to think of leaving 
something to our children.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	We had to downsize government. Government programs had to 
be cut. I had some concerns about that because my constituency is 
comprised of many public servants and people who have contracts 
with the federal government. As vice-chair of the government 
operations committee I was very diligent in ensuring there would 
be no abuse on anyone's part.
<P>
	The program review was to cut programs in an effort to downsize 
the federal government. There was a question of a lump sum of 
money that was to be cut. Obviously some jobs had to be 
annihilated. We had to let go and make way for a better system. We 
had to improve the way in which we were working. This meant we 
had to abandon those activities that did not need to keep going.
<P>
	We privatized in areas where the private sector could do better. 
For example, we privatized many activities that were once under 
Transport Canada. We developed Nav Canada and a great number 
of public servants who once worked for Transport Canada were 
transferred to this new private sector organization.
<P>
	The media interpretation was that 45,000 jobs would be lost. I 
did not appreciate the fact that 45,000 employees would be laid off. 
Lately one newspaper reported that with the new calculations the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6245"> 6245 </A></B>
<P>
number could be more like 55,000. Obviously this has a very 
negative impact on the community. This made people in the 
national capital region business community very insecure and the 
economy slowed down quite a bit.
<P>
	However, in the downsizing process the government made sure it 
did not maltreat its employees. We had programs like early 
retirement. The early retirement program was oversubscribed to. 
Many public servants, those who were getting close to retirement 
age, thought this was a wonderful opportunity to retire.
<P>
	Others accepted the early departure incentive. They were mostly 
public servants, managers or middle managers who were interested 
in going into private business. They are now the people in the 
national capital region who are working for the government, doing 
some projects, working on contracts. They are now the private 
contractors in the region.
<P>
	We have saved a great deal of money but I do have concerns. I 
want to make sure the government does not save money by 
downsizing on the one hand while on the other hand increasing by a 
phenomenal amount the money spent on contracting out. This is 
something I am watching for very diligently at the committee on 
government operations.
<P>
	In September 1995 the unemployment rate in the national capital 
region was 10.1 per cent. That percentage has now gone down to 
7.4 per cent, an improvement. People in the national capital region 
are starting to feel secure again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They are at ease, can see that there is some future, and the 
Canadian government decided that the National Capital Region 
would not be a ``one horse town'', that it would have a mixture of 
private industry and public industry.
<P>
	As well, organizations such as Systemhouse have sprung up, 
where former public servants have started up in high tech, and now 
the National Capital Region has a burgeoning high tech industry.
<P>
	The National Capital Region has, in fact, now become the major 
North American centre for high technology.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a balance between the private sector and the public 
sector now. I am happy to report that the public service is 
improving constantly in its effectiveness and efficiency. I am 
asking the government to make sure, though, that there is a 
renewal, that there is an opportunity for the young to be able to 
enter our reputable public service.
<P>
	We have to make sure that there is an entry situation where 
young graduates can come to work with the federal government 
and, if not the federal government, work on contracts for the 
federal government. That is very essential. I appreciate the 
opportunity to address the House on the question of the throne 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
paid attention to the hon. member's speech. I can vouch for the 
excellent representation he gives to the people of Gloucester. He 
has been an excellent representative.
<P>
	I would like to give him an opportunity. In the nation's capital, in 
the House of Commons, we often speak of billion dollar budgets. 
We speak about deficits in a very macro way.
<P>
	We speak of the lowering of the deficit, the fact that we have not 
increased personal income tax, the fact that the crime rate has 
declined, as have interest rates. I would like the hon. member to 
give us a feel of what has happened in his community as a result of 
the policy directions that this government has undertaken in the 
areas I cited.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from Toronto 
for his kind words.
<P>
	In my riding, business is doing well. The private sector is getting 
contracts. There is a movement in high technology in my 
community. This afternoon, I will go to the opening of AMITA, a 
high technology group of about 50 employees that are starting a 
business in my community.
<P>
	Almost every second week, a new business is starting, always in 
high tech. Because of globalization, we have to do things very 
differently. It is time for high technology.
<P>
	We are very lucky that the national capital region a few years ago 
started in high tech. Now we are becoming the high tech capital 
above the American border. There is high tech in the United States 
and the other place is right here in the national capital region.
<P>
	Private industry is developing. Both universities and the two 
colleges are producing specialists in high tech. Jobs are being 
developed to the point where, at this moment, we are told that 
thousands of jobs are available in high tech in the national capital 
region that have not been filled yet.
<P>
	The universities and colleges are trying to produce as quickly as 
possible graduates to fill these jobs. This is a very big plus for our 
community. Things are going better and better all the time.
<P>
	People feel secure. People feel a sense of hope. People feel that 
there is growth. By gosh, the national capital region is a heck of a 
nice place to grow and to have a family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to comment on the speech of the hon. member where he talked 
about the advantages of lower interest rates. There is no question 
that low interest rates mean significant savings for consumers and 
businesses. It puts more money into the marketplace.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	However, to only zero in on that aspect and to only point out its 
benefits, is wrong. That is only one sector of the population, only 
the borrowers of the nation. It is only people who can borrow 
money, qualify for loans or who already have loans in place. It is 
not all Canadians. It is not all good news for all Canadians. It is 
good news for those who have debts. It is also good news for this 
government because it is lowering the cost of its huge debt which 
does help all Canadians.
<P>
	However, because it only benefits the borrowers, what message 
is the government giving to those who do not have loans and who 
do not borrow? What are in the policies of the Liberal Party for the 
pensioners who have had been reduced and have lost their senior 
age exemption? What about the students who do not have loans and 
cannot borrow money? What is the government-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The hon. member 
has asked a question. I said it had to be very brief. This is five 
minutes questions and comments. Five are gone. I call on the hon. 
member for Carleton-Gloucester for a very short reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are hearing is the point of 
view of the Reform Party, a party that wants to shut down 
government and government operations altogether. It does not care 
about people who want to invest. In order to invest they need to 
borrow money. They have to roll money around. For these same 
people for whom Reformers say they want to protect the interest 
rates, they seem to suggest that the interest rate should go high.
<P>
	The Reform members are looking at their buddies who have lots 
of money and they do not care about anybody else. Perhaps on 
Sunday morning they give a donation to the odd person. They only 
care about people with money. They do not care about promoting 
the economy and those who want it developed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak this afternoon on the 
throne speech, a speech which reflects the real needs and concerns 
of Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberal government's jobs and growth agenda has provided 
Canadians with renewed hope for the future and its agenda is 
focused on creating opportunity for Canadians, through a fiscal 
climate which encourages investment, through ensuring that our 
youth have the tools they require in order to fully contribute to 
Canada's growth and competitiveness and through strengthening 
our small businesses, a primary source for job creation and 
innovation.
<P>
	Today we are faced with a markedly different fiscal situation 
than the one we faced when we took office. Interest rates are at the 
lowest point in 38 years and that means Canadians have new 
opportunities for investment and growth. All Canadians benefit 
from lower interest rates; from home owners to small businesses in 
my riding of Lincoln.
<P>
	Inflationary rates are also at 38-year lows. Lower inflationary 
rates mean that Canadians can operate in a stable economic 
environment. They can more confidently plan for their futures.
<P>
	Nowhere has the government's success in creating a stronger 
fiscal environment been more evident than in its efforts to reduce 
the huge deficit inherited when we took office. Indeed, getting the 
government finances under control has been the most effective way 
of getting interest rates down.
<P>
	After program review and rationalization, we have brought 
government spending under control. Today, we have not only 
projected that the deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP will be met but 
this target will be surpassed and in 1998-99 the deficit target of 
about 1 per cent of GDP will be met.
<P>
	Clearly the approach to restoring fiscal health has been 
measured, deliberate and responsible. It has involved carefully 
reducing spending, restructuring government and strengthening the 
economy. This approach continues to reflect the desire of 
Canadians to have their government develop a more sophisticated 
approach to deficit reduction. It has not imposed greater costs on 
the greater taxpayer by raising their personal income taxes. Nor has 
the approach been a slash and burn attempt to get government 
spending under control.
<P>
	Borrowing on the backs of our children and grandchildren will 
soon be in the past. Speaking of our youth, they have been 
identified as being a vital resource in the continuing effort to stay 
competitive. Today many young people remain unemployed. Our 
youth are worried that the future will not hold jobs for them. 
Employers are saying that there are jobs but that they are having 
difficulty in finding the skilled labour they need in order to grow 
and compete. Experts are telling us that the pursuit of education is 
still important to success in the job market. Far sighted Canadians 
everywhere argue that the country cannot afford to squander the 
talents and creativity of our youth. I know that all government 
members are aware of these concerns and are actively seeking 
solutions. Clearly, young people need more help in making the 
transition into the working world. They need more help in getting 
that crucial first job.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The government has doubled its summer employment programs. 
It has also made a commitment to work with the provinces and with 
the private sector. This type of co-operation is being encouraged at 
all levels. Canadians want to know that all their elected officials are 
working together, no matter what jurisdiction they represent.
<P>
	In this process, partnerships are essential. Many Canadians have 
expressed that only partnerships can  solve the short and long term 
challenges of youth unemployment. More needs to be done for our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6247"> 6247 </A></B>
<P>
youth and they can be assured that progress will be made because 
on this side of the House it has been made a priority.
<P>
	Let me also address the role of small businesses in our economy 
and in our country. Small businesses are the backbone of the 
economic community of my riding of Lincoln. This fact is not 
unusual given that the small business sector is very important to the 
entire Canadian economy. Indeed, hope for our youth and for the 
future competitiveness of our country rests with a strong small 
business sector. Small businesses, including the self-employed, 
now account for almost two-thirds of all private sector employment 
and approximately 60 per cent of Canada's economic output.
<P>
	As a small business owner, I know that the entrepreneurial spirit 
that drives the small and medium sized business sector needs to be 
encouraged and fostered because our economic well-being depends 
on it.
<P>
	What is the small business community saying? It is saying that 
access to capital in the start-up and expansion phase is still very 
important. The banks have done some work in this area and they 
can point to areas of success where they have increased their access 
for small business. But the demand is still there.
<P>
	Small businesses are asking for higher risk debt capital. It is a 
paradox that there are a number of small businesses in the 
community which require more funds for start up or for expansion, 
yet do not have the collateral to support the actual capital 
requirements. At the same time they have good export ideas. If the 
capital was available they would be able to expand their business 
and create employment, adding to the GDP of the country. We need 
more of what I will call high risk debt capital. We would look at the 
credit rating of a particular small business person and based on that 
rating the banks would provide the required capital.
<P>
	As a government we need to continue to fight and to work 
toward eliminating the regulatory barriers and the paper burdens. 
We have made some progress in that area. It is still a concern of 
small business and the government will continue to work toward 
the elimination of regulatory barriers and paper burden.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier with respect to our youth, there is a need 
to access skilled workers. There is still a mismatch out there. The 
small business community requires skilled individuals. It has 
positions to fill and is crying out, telling us that Canada does not 
have the skilled workers to fill those jobs. We need to address that, 
in partnership with the provinces, with the educational and 
post-secondary institutions. Those are the partnerships that need to 
be forged to deal with the question of providing skilled workers.
<P>
	There is also a call from the small business community for a 
reduction in payroll taxes, for some help in that  area because they 
claim they will be able to create employment if payroll taxes are 
reduced. There has also been a cry for some direct incentives to 
hire new employees and for some type of program that would help 
the micro businesses that may need some assistance and some type 
of relief. This would allow them to hire the one or two people they 
need in order to continue to grow, expand and contribute to the 
GDP of this country, to their local communities and to their local 
economies.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Those are a number of the issues and concerns brought forward 
by the small business community not only in my community but I 
am sure right across the country. This government will continue to 
work hand in hand with the private sector, with representatives of 
the small business sector to meet the needs of the small business 
community.
<P>
	This government believes that the small business community is 
the engine and the backbone of the economy. We look to the small 
business community to assist Canada, to assist this government and 
to assist all Canadians in working, in being competitive, in being 
efficient and creating those employment opportunities and jobs. 
This government will continue to improve the climate for small 
businesses and certainly will allow them to continue to compete 
globally. This particular sector of our economy is crucially 
important.
<P>
	In terms of what this government has recently done to assist in 
access to capital for the small business community, the Canada 
community investment program was announced some weeks ago. 
Communities from across the country are now participating in pilot 
projects. We in the Lincoln area were very fortunate to have had the 
opportunity to partner with the Hamilton, Brantford, Burlington, 
Haldimand-Norfolk area, along with the Six Nations in 
submitting an application for the Canada community investment 
program.
<P>
	The government will go forward to provide infrastructure dollars 
to assist local communities in coming together to provide that 
increased access to capital for small business. Those in small 
business are the employers and they are the medium size and 
multinational companies of the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague's 
excellent presentation. I note his tremendous interest and 
enthusiasm for small business and industry in his riding, but more 
so right across this country of ours.
<P>
	Having had the opportunity to speak with many of the small 
business people in my constituency, they are telling me as their 
member of Parliament to stay the course and to encourage the 
Minister of Finance to stay the course, to continue to bring our 
financial house in order, to continue with those low interest rates, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6248"> 6248 </A></B>
<P>
to continue with a low inflation under control. That is what 
complements small business and the jobs that will go with it.
<P>
	My question is based on the projections many economists and 
the OECD are making that among the G-7 nations, in 1997 Canada 
will actually exceed all of them in economic advancement and 
growth. Perhaps the hon. member for Lincoln would like to 
comment on this and on all the actions that have been taken, but is 
it enough? Are there other things we should be doing to encourage 
small business knowing that indeed those in small business are the 
ones that will produce additional jobs in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly small businesses in the 
constituency of Lincoln and in speaking with small businesses 
across the country, they want us to stay the course. They want us to 
continue to fight the deficit, move to a zero deficit and continue to 
maintain those low interest rates and the low inflationary course we 
are on. Certainly they are very much in support of the government's 
macro approach to our economy.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	As mentioned by the hon. member, Canada will lead the G-7 in 
terms of economic growth in the coming years. In fact, yesterday in 
Toronto the Bank of Canada indicated that it expects in 1997 there 
will be growth in our economy because of the approach which has 
been taken, because of low interest rates and because of low 
inflationary measures.
<P>
	What else needs to be done? Certainly we need to focus on the 
continued access to capital that small businesses need. We need to 
continue to focus on providing small businesses with the necessary 
skills and manpower which they need in order to continue to 
compete.
<P>
	In order for small businesses to compete globally we need to 
assist them with the tools to export. We need to get small business 
into the export market in a much bigger way. This country does not 
have as many small businesses exporting as it should have. We will 
work to ensure that the small business sector has the tools which 
are required to penetrate those markets. We are doing some of that 
by using the team Canada approach. There is also information 
which we need to provide to the small business sector. We need to 
identify global markets for the small business sector. We have to do 
more of that at the micro level.
<P>
	Those are a couple of things we need to do in support of the 
macro approach. We also need to take micro approaches for the 
small business sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	The previous Liberal government tried to control inflation with 
24 per cent interest rates. That now seems  to have been the wrong 
approach. Has the Prime Minister drastically changed his 
definition of what is right and what is wrong?
<P>
	I heard this morning that our gross domestic product has only 
increased by 1.1 per cent in the last year. With the low interest 
rates, how can he make the comment that the government is on the 
right track? To me it seems that the gross domestic product has to 
increase by more than 1.1 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Valeri:</B> Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member fails to 
understand is that the approach we have taken and the reason 
interest rates and inflation rates are low today is that we looked at 
government structure, we looked at government spending, we went 
through the program review, we went through the restructuring of 
government and we reduced spending in government. We have said 
that we cannot be all things to all people. We have taken a targeted 
approach with respect to what government can do and does best. In 
doing so we have put in place the structural changes which have 
brought the lower interest rates and the lower inflation rates.
<P>
	When this approach was being taken by the government a 
number of years ago, members opposite cried out and said that it 
would never work, that we needed to cut, slash and burn. That is 
their approach: Do it tomorrow; do it soon. They said that if we 
continued on the same track we would hit the wall.
<P>
	We did not hit the wall. Interest rates are low. Inflation is low. 
We are being heralded around the world as one country which has 
taken the direct approach and ensured that our economic 
fundamentals are in place. We will continue to prosper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Kootenay East.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in the House to speak on the speech from the 
throne, even though it has been nine months since the throne 
speech was first read. Instead of calling it the speech from the 
throne, maybe we should call it the old speech. We are here today 
talking about an old speech, with an old vision and old tired ideas 
that have not worked in the past and certainly will not work in the 
future. Ideas such as distinct society for Quebec. That was clearly 
and decisively rejected by Canadians across the country in the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	In the throne speech the government mentioned changing the law 
and making amendments to the Criminal Code. It seems that all we 
really got was some tinkering and not the major changes people 
talked about. All we got was some pretty thin soup. Canadians are 
asking, in fact they are demanding that government get tough on 
crime. For example, did we get from this government a victims bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6249"> 6249 </A></B>
<P>
of rights? No we did not. Not until my colleague from Fraser Valley 
West introduced his private member's bill.
<P>
	Our criminal justice system is in a state of disarray. It is out of 
touch. It is insensitive to the victims and their families. It is 
bureaucratic and moves slowly. We are all familiar with the phrase 
``justice delayed is justice denied''. I have a fistful of examples 
from right across the country of how inefficient and soft our 
criminal justice system is on criminals.
<P>
	I would like to zero in on one example from my riding of 
Yellowhead of how our criminal justice system works. It is with 
regard to the experiences of Judy and Don Thwaites who live in the 
town of Whitecourt, Alberta. It is a story I would rather not tell but 
it is very explicit of how our system works, or conversely, how our 
system does not work; hence my relating this letter in the House.
<P>
	Judy and Don had a couple of children, including daughter 
Norma who on January 25, 1981 was 17 years old. On the 
mentioned date Norma, who was doing post-secondary studies in 
Edmonton, was home for a visit. On the night of January 25 Norma 
was strangled to death. Then her lifeless body was raped by Larry 
Read. Norma was left in a vehicle and her frozen body was 
discovered by the RCMP the next morning. These are the basic 
facts of the case. It is not necessary for me to describe in greater 
detail the utterly despicable action against this young woman, a 
17-year old teenager.
<P>
	The letter from Mrs. Thwaites does not go into detail with 
respect to the murder of her daughter but rather she describes the 
system and her dealings with the system. Her letter is addressed to 
me dated March 29, 1995, re Larry Gene Read: ``I am writing to 
you about the above person, Larry Read, and his actions against my 
daughter, Norma, on January 25, 1981. I would at this time like to 
give you a point by point account of what happened after Read was 
arrested for the murder of my daughter, Norma.
<P>
	``Read was arrested within 24 hours of the murder of Norma in 
the city of Grand Prairie, Alberta approximately 170 miles 
northwest of Whitecourt or about 300 miles northwest of the city of 
Edmonton''. A common thread in Judy's letter is that she has great 
praise for the RCMP: ``We commend the RCMP for their prompt 
arrest and for the concern and caring they showed to our family not 
only at the time but in the years of agony and sorrow we suffered 
from that day until the present time. We were always showed 
consideration in every way through the arrest, preliminary hearing, 
two trials over a four year period and the sentencing. I would like 
the people concerned with the judicial system of Canada to know 
that about the RCMP.
<P>
	``My husband and I were present at the preliminary hearing held 
in Whitecourt in May in 1981. It lasted approximately two and a 
half weeks. We were never called by any member of the court 
system to brief us on what would take place at this hearing''. My 
colleague's  private member's bill remedies this complete omission 
of the victim.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	``We are never called by any member of the court system to brief 
us on what would take place at this hearing. Once again, we were 
told what they were able to let us know, legally, by the RCMP''. 
Then she asks a question: ``How come there is no provision made 
for the victims' families to enable them to handle this agonizing 
and tortuous procedure? After the preliminary hearing it was 
determined that the courts had enough evidence to proceed to trial. 
The trial was held in Edmonton and started exactly one year to the 
date that Norma was murdered''.
<P>
	She goes on to say how despicable that was: ``I realize that the 
courts are very full, but that is gross injustice to the family 
members. Once again, we were never informed of what would take 
place. Indeed, we were never informed about the trial date. This 
information was provided by the RCMP investigations officer who 
was our sole moral support through all of this affair''.
<P>
	Then she asks another question: ``Why is there no provision by 
the government to provide a person who would let the family know 
what has taken place over the past year, while waiting for the trial, 
and a run down on what to expect? I can appreciate that they cannot 
take the time for every detail but they could surely write a letter to 
let the date of the trial be known a few weeks ahead''. This is also a 
provision in the private member's bill, which is supposed to be in 
committee but I fear that is where it will rest for a long long time.
<P>
	``During the trial we were never approached by anyone from the 
crown prosecutor's office to inform us what tactic it would be using 
to establish the guilt of the murderer. We did seek to speak to the 
crown prosecutor and he did reluctantly divulge a little of what he 
planned to use against the murderer. After the trial was over and the 
judge addressed the jury to let it know what constituted first 
degree, second degree and manslaughter he made a mistake in his 
address to the jury which confused it and resulted in the charge 
being reduced to second degree murder.
<P>
	``Read was found guilty of second degree murder by the jury and 
it recommended that he be given the maximum sentence of 15 
years in prison with no chance of early parole. The judge reduced 
this sentence to 13 years and we do not know why''. The Thwaites 
do not know why.
<P>
	``Because the judge confused the jury when he was explaining 
what constituted what for the three classifications, Read was given 
a hearing for a new trial and he won that. The second trial was held 
four years after the first trial. It started in January of 1985 and once 
again was a nightmare for us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6250"> 6250 </A></B>
<P>
	``Some of the witnesses from the first trial could not be located. 
It was, to say the least, a catastrophe for us. The witnesses could 
no longer remember things that had happened five years before, 
and who could fault them?
<P>
	``Once again, we were informed by the RCMP that there was a 
new trial. Not once were we written or phoned by any justice 
system official to tell us that we had to go to hell and back again. 
This lack of consideration by the so-called system is about as cruel 
as it can get''.
<P>
	She asks another question: ``When are they going to quit 
mollycoddling these murderers? My daughter suffered amounts 
which I cannot bear to think about. Read has suffered nothing and 
is indeed protected from any pain by being placed in protective 
custody. When are they going to wake up to the fact that these 
pyschopaths are of little value to society?
<P>
	``After the second trial was over and the jury found Read guilty 
of manslaughter, he was sentenced to seven years in prison with no 
chance of parole. That was a very hard blow to us, as you can well 
imagine. I was by this time in a terrible rage over the lack of justice 
by our so-called system which I had, like all other Canadians, 
believed in. I must admit I am a much wiser person now. There is 
no justice system in our country and people are beginning to 
conclude that what we have rather than a justice system in this 
country is a legal industry.
<P>
	``Six years after Norma was murdered and raped by Larry Read, 
I finally found-my local doctor referred me because he could not 
help me to handle the rage I felt over all of the injustices I had 
suffered, and the terrible grief I felt over my girl not dying by an 
accident or by sickness, but because a human being had 
deliberately killed her for his own pleasure''.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	A Reform government would put the rights of the victim ahead 
of the rights of the criminal.
<P>
	Here is what she has to say about getting some assistance: 
``There is no one in Canada who anyone knew about at the time 
who had any training to help victims of this type of crime. I was 
indeed fortunate that I was referred to a Dr. Watson in Edmonton 
who was very knowledgeable about psychopaths. He told me that 
he was familiar with my case from discussions with his colleagues 
and by reading the newspaper accounts of the case. He was the first 
person to tell me that Read was a psychopath and that there was no 
cure whatsoever for these people.
<P>
	``He also told me that he had never counselled anyone or had any 
training in counselling anyone who had suffered having a person 
murdered in their family. He did not know of anyone in Canada 
who had ever received any training, either gone to the U.S.A. or 
any place-''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
hon. member but I have been trying to signal him. His time has 
expired. I believe he is splitting his 20 minute segment with the 
hon. member for Kootenay East.
<P>
	Accordingly, there is now five minutes of questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how did this lady respond to the help that she finally got 
from this medical person? Could the hon. member fill us in on that, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, there just was not 
any help available. He could not help her.
<P>
	The case does not end there. Read received a seven year 
sentence. He was let out after six years and only a few years later, 
after he was let out on early parole, which happens again and again 
across this country, he again committed a heinous act that is tough 
to describe in this House.
<P>
	In British Columbia, where he ended up, he went into a house 
where a 9-year old girl and a 12-year old girl were sitting. He beat 
them up, dragged them into the basement and, with a knife, cut 
their vaginas to their stomachs. He did not kill them but he 
certainly inflicted something upon them that will follow them the 
rest of their lives.
<P>
	At the present time there is no provision of any kind in this 
country to look after the victims of violence. Hence our colleague's 
private member's bill to deal with that. It covers the things I have 
related thus far.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very 
interesting as we are undertaking the continuation of this throne 
speech to take a look at the number of things that have changed and 
the number of things that have not changed.
<P>
	Clearly the things that have not changed have been on the 
Liberal side. One of the most interesting things last year, when 
Canada came within 50,000 votes of no longer being Canada, was 
the reaction of the Liberals to that situation.
<P>
	There is an old saying that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but in this 
case it is broken and we must fix it.
<P>
	There are three heads on a very bad penny here, the Progressive 
Conservatives, the Liberals and the NDP. None of them have any 
new ideas. None of them are bringing any new information. None 
of them are taking any role of leadership to do things differently.
<P>
	My colleague mentioned that the Prime Minister, in the three 
days before the vote, came up with the absolutely brilliant but 
totally discredited idea of distinct society. He did that and then 
brought it into the House of Commons. He forced it through the 
House of Commons. He also wanted to have a veto for Quebec.

	Not being able to do that, we now have a veto for five regions 
which fundamentally gives a total constriction of any ability to 
ever change our country and the way we govern ourselves. That is 
what the Prime Minister has done. One of his more imaginative 
ministers, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Deputy Prime 
Minister, wants to return to 1967 to rekindle the wonderful national 
spirit we had. She has come out with the fly a flag program which 
was originally, according to an official in her department, going to 
be costing between $6 million and $7 million.
<P>
	As was reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, suddenly they have 
turned around and said that it was going to be $23 million. We then 
had the brilliant news the other day that it was going to be $8 
million less than that. All we know is that we have over 600,000 
flags being distributed willy-nilly all over the country.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, there is an article in <I>Le Devoir</I> today that 
indicates that 15 of these flags were sent to people who had no 
interest in having the Canadian flag. The writer of the article says: 
``Thank you very much, but I am going to put it in my bottom 
drawer''. My office is being inundated by people who are either 
indicating they have received flags, do not want them or have sent 
them back. In fact, my office has been receiving these flags to 
return to the minister.
<P>
	This is the old vision. This is the cheerleader we have for a 
heritage minister. What of a new vision, a new vision that the 
Reform Party has? I quote the leader of the Reform Party:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the past few decades, Canada has been governed by an ideology which holds 
that an overpowering, overspending central government is the answer to every 
problem, including that of national unity. The Reform Party is not afraid to 
fundamentally rethink the way our government works. Through decentralization and 
a greater emphasis on local responsibility, we believe we have a realistic plan that 
will build a stronger, more united Canada. It will help us achieve our common 
objective of keeping Quebec in the federation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us take a look at what happened in the lead-up to the last 
referendum. In 1995, of the people who were surveyed, this from 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> dated October 30, 1995, 25 per cent of the 
people in Quebec still believe they could elect federal members of 
Parliament. Almost 30 per cent believed that they would be able to 
keep economic ties such as they have right now and over half 
believed they could keep their Canadian passports.
<P>
	These things are not a given. They would have to be discussed 
and agreed to by all the people of Canada. There was no discussion 
about what was going to be happening should they determine that 
they were going to be voting in favour of separating from Canada. 
There was no discussion, no contingency plan and no explanation 
to the people of Quebec when they voted in favour separation what 
their vote would actually mean.
<P>
	At that time, it must be noted, if we take a slice in time leading 
up to the referendum, the Reform Party was being vilified by all the 
old-line parties because this was a new way of thinking and they 
could not really get their mind around a new way of thinking. We 
were being vilified for saying: ``Just a second, why are we not 
having an exposure to the people of Quebec as to what the facts 
are? Why are we not letting the people of Quebec know that this is 
not a free ride?''
<P>
	We are being vilified because they think we are planning for 
their separation. No. I and my party are committed federalists who 
demand that this country stay together and we will do everything 
we can to keep this country together. However, it will be kept 
together by truth, by exposure of ideas and by straight, candid 
discussions.
<P>
	In a new Canada that the Reform Party would see, we would see 
a reduction in the size of tax requirements of the federal 
government. Right now in our nation, people through an 
underground economy and all sorts of devious means are walking 
away from their tax obligations because they believe taxes are too 
high and they do not want to be a part of it.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Let me make it clear, particularly to anybody in the revenue 
department, that I am in no way condoning the actions of people 
who walk away from their tax obligations. I am simply reporting 
that there is a tax fatigue within the country and people are doing 
everything they can to get away from it. It is becoming a serious 
problem in the way in which we relate to each other.
<P>
	We would refocus the federal government's powers on 10 areas 
of national importance. We would reform federal institutions to 
make them more democratically accountable and sensitive to 
regional interests. We would introduce a triple E Senate, one that 
would give a counterbalance to the House of Commons, which is 
after all at least something of a form of representation by 
population. Ontario and Quebec have two-thirds of the seats 
concentrated in this place. A triple E Senate, through its equal 
representation, would give regional compensation to the power of 
the House of Commons. We would decentralize other 
governmental powers to give all provinces the freedom and 
resources to develop as their citizens choose.
<P>
	Quebec is not the only distinct society. When we look around the 
country, Quebec has the distinctiveness of its language, but truly, 
are the Acadians not as much a distinct society? Truly, are the 
people who arrived in northern Alberta from Europe in the early 
1900s not a distinct society? What we are talking about here is the 
demand, and a very worthy demand on the part of people across 
Canada to have more say and to get out from under the stultifying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6252"> 6252 </A></B>
<P>
umbrella of the federal government. That is the positive side and 
the direction in which we want to go.
<P>
	On the other side of the coin we would also say that secession 
negotiations must respect the principles of democratic legitimacy, 
the rule of law and the interests of Canada. The right of Canadians 
within a seceding province to remain part of Canada and to petition 
Parliament for that purpose must be respected.
<P>
	I quote a gentleman, Gilles St-Laurent from Quebec City, 
Quebec: ``I believe the people of Quebec would like to have more 
control over their own affairs and less influence from Ottawa. And 
that is why I think that Reform's plan to give more powers to the 
provinces is one of the most likely to keep Quebec in the 
federation''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague for his remarks, but does he agree that the 
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society was not requested by the 
Bloc Quebecois nor by the Government of Quebec. This was a 
promise made by the Prime Minister, who also promised to 
entrench the concept of distinct society in the Constitution, but has 
been unable to keep his promise.
<P>
	Quebec is a people and a nation, not a province like any other. 
This is the basis for any discussion and, as far as we can see, only a 
referendum on sovereignty will provide the necessary basis for 
future discussions from people to people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I disagree on one point and I fully 
agree on another.
<P>
	When the member suggests that Quebec is a nation of people not 
like any other province, with respect I disagree. The reason I 
disagree is that undoubtedly there are a lot of people who come 
from families in Quebec whose ancestry has been in Quebec for a 
long time. Canada is made up of a society that to a greater or lesser 
extent is like that but of the 29 million to 30 million people in 
Canada about nine million people are recent immigrants. To 
suggest that the province is a nation because of there being a 
certain number of people who come from families who have been 
in that province for a long time, I cannot agree with the member.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	However I do agree that neither the Bloc nor the Parti Quebecois 
are asking for distinct society. It is very clear that what is going on 
here is the Prime Minister is attempting to fulfil a promise that is 
hollow and which has absolutely no value.
<P>
	If we want to deal in reality, Quebec is a distinct society in many 
of its characteristics, in many of the ways in which people relate to 
each other and certainly in their joie de vivre, their joy of life. It is 
that joy of life in Quebec which I think adds to Canada's culture in 
a very wonderful way. Quebecers have a distinct society in that 
reality.
<P>
	Here is the problem. The minute that we turn commonly used 
English words into law, those two words, distinct society, suddenly 
can become a club, a tool that can be used in ways we could never 
imagine. Because we put this into law in goodwill all of a sudden 
we might find that we are constrained.
<P>
	For example if the CBC wanted to make cutbacks in 
programming, the CBC could be constrained. If distinct society 
was in the Constitution and was recognized legally, all of a sudden 
it could be argued that because the French programming was in 
support of distinct society and because that was constitutionalized, 
any cuts that were going to be made at the CBC could only be made 
in English services but not in French services in Quebec. I just cite 
that as one example.
<P>
	The unintended consequences of the inclusion of the term 
distinct society in law is completely unknown. As a consequence it 
is a concept that should never ever be enshrined.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to participate in this debate and to outline 
and expand on the speech from the throne.
<P>
	The Liberal Party is proud of its record over the past three years 
since it assumed its role as the government. Most of the 
commitments outlined in both the red book and in the first throne 
speech have been fulfilled or are in the process of being fulfilled.
<P>
	The throne speech outlines our plan for action for the second half 
of the mandate. Yet it is not as much a new direction for the 
government to follow as it is an effort to build upon the 
accomplishments which we have achieved to date. In the first 
mandate the government laid the foundation for renewed 
prosperity. The throne speech contains the blocks on which we 
have continued to build. The speech from the throne concentrates 
on three main areas: security for Canadians; modernizing the 
federation; and jobs and growth. Without question each of these 
areas is of vital importance.
<P>
	Security for Canadians addresses concerns which we all have 
about the future of our social programs. A secure safety net is of 
great importance to all citizens. When we ask Canadians what 
makes our country unique, they always point to the social safety 
net. Today programs such as medicare are part of the Canadian 
fabric and represent a fundamental value that Canadians cherish.
<P>
	The Liberal Party understands the importance of the Canadian 
place in the future of these programs. It understands that for good 
reason it was the Liberal Party that brought these programs to life. 
As we all know, times have changed since their inception. As the 
throne speech rightly spells out, changes are necessary to ensure  
the continuing health of our social safety net. However, in the end 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6253"> 6253 </A></B>
<P>
our reformed social programs must still protect those most in need 
and we will make sure of that.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The second major thrust of the throne speech deals with national 
unity. The memory of last October's referendum remains strong in 
the minds of all Canadians. Canada must never again be placed in 
the position in which it found itself last October 30. However, the 
referendum results reflected a clear message. It was a message for 
change and this desire for change is shared in all parts of the 
country. The federal government agrees that fresh approaches are 
necessary and it will work with the provinces to ensure that the 
federation is modernized.
<P>
	The government proposes to work with all its partners to explore 
new options. The Prime Minister has called on all Canadians to 
demonstrate openness and to be a part of these changes. The federal 
government has already made substantial changes over the past two 
years. It will continue to do everything necessary to modernize the 
Canadian federation further. In the end it is important to remember 
that what unites us as Canadians is far greater than what divides us. 
The values which we share are as relevant as ever.
<P>
	While the referendum served to raise many eyebrows, the 
current trend toward nationalism is not a feature unique in our 
country. History has shown that many countries have successfully 
dealt with similar circumstances. While the tide of nationalism was 
high last October, the separatist threat will recede and the waters 
will calm once again.
<P>
	Jobs and growth was the final theme of the throne speech. It is 
the area I would like to talk about in some detail.
<P>
	Since the Liberal Party took office in November 1993, over 
600,000 jobs have been created. The unemployment rate has 
declined. I can speak for my own riding where the unemployment 
rate was at 7 per cent or 8 per cent. Presently the riding which I 
represent has an unemployment rate of 4.7 per cent. I know it is not 
the same across the country but it shows that the trend is getting 
better with the downward spiral of unemployment figures.
<P>
	The government is not about to sit back and rest on its laurels. 
More work needs to be done. That is why the speech from the 
throne targeted three main areas: youth, science and technology, 
and trade. Those are the key elements for the continued success of 
jobs and growth in the future.
<P>
	It does not take a genius to realize that youth unemployment is 
far too high. While it has been said before, it simply cannot be 
overstated: The skills of our young people are Canada's greatest 
resource of the future. Young Canadians need more help to make 
the transition into the working world and more help to get that 
crucial first job.
<P>
	To address this problem, the federal government will work in 
conjunction with the provinces and the private sector to create new 
jobs and new opportunities for youth. The throne speech outlined 
plans to double the size of the federal programs aimed at creating 
summer jobs in the past summer as it will in the future. The 
government has also challenged the business community to create 
jobs for youth.
<P>
	In partnership with the provinces, the private sector and young 
people themselves, we will work to create job opportunities for 
young Canadians. By working together, the youth unemployment 
problem can be tackled.
<P>
	The second element of the jobs and growth theme outlined in the 
throne speech is science and technology. Canada has the distinction 
of being a leader in the field of innovative technology. In today's 
global marketplace, that means more jobs, sustainable jobs and 
quality jobs for Canadians. However, strong leadership is necessary 
to ensure that Canada remains a leader in this field.
<P>
	To ensure ongoing success in the growth area, the government 
will continue to support development in aerospace technologies, 
environmental technologies and enabling technologies, such as 
biotechnology.
<P>
	The government will honour its red book commitment to launch 
a Canadian technology network to support technology diffusion. 
Just recently the Minister of Industry made that announcement. We 
will see these new high technology features being set up on the 
information highway. They will reach into areas of Canada which 
have never been able to access the information highway. The 
government has worked to improve access to the information 
highway in northern and rural areas. By providing support and 
leadership in these areas Canada will continue to enjoy its 
competitive edge in the world's technology marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Another key element of the government's jobs and growth 
agenda is trade. In the last two years Canada's exports have soared. 
Month after month Statistics Canada has reported a substantial 
increase in our exports, but these good news stories have become 
commonplace in the business pages of our newspapers. If the 
figures are added up they reveal a true economic phenomenon.
<P>
	In 1995 Canada's merchandise exports grew by over 20 per cent 
and its trade surplus by a dramatic 63 per cent over 1994. Adding to 
the good news is the fact that this rapid growth is diversified and is 
taking place in all major world markets. As a result of this robust 
expansion trade has become the single most important factor in 
creating jobs and growth in the past two years. We must now 
capitalize on our accomplishments and build on these successes. 
That is why the throne speech detailed a continuation of Team 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6254"> 6254 </A></B>
<P>
Canada missions which to date  have brought home more than $20 
billion in new deals and as recent as yesterday this figure is 
continuing to climb in the billions.
<P>
	As long as there are untapped markets Canada must be ever 
vigilant to seek new buyers for their goods and services. The 
government will also announce new measures to support export 
development in financing.
<P>
	Finally, the government will continue to work to expand the 
NAFTA and work toward more world trade liberalization. More 
markets mean more sales and that means more jobs for Canadians. 
By taking a proactive role in creating markets for our goods, 
assisting growth sectors in the science and technology field and 
giving our youth the skills necessary to succeed we are ensuring the 
continued prosperity of our nation. That is what the speech from 
the throne is all about, continued prosperity. Each element of the 
throne speech deals with prosperity, and the success of each hinges 
on the others.
<P>
	A modern and united Canada promotes stability. Stability 
enhances our potential for more jobs and growth. This continued 
prosperity allows Canadians to keep enjoying their cherished social 
programs and Canada as the envy of the world. By providing sound 
leadership and good government, as outlined in the throne speech, 
the Liberal Party is charting the course toward prosperity as we 
head into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the speech given by my colleague. I can assure you I do 
not fully share his satisfaction with the throne speech. If I may, I 
would like to recap in my own words the points he made and show 
the other side of the coin.
<P>
	He spoke about safety, about modernizing the Constitution, 
about employment. He talked about social security in Canada, but 
he forgot to tell us whether social programs will remain unchanged 
despite all the federal cuts in transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	On the subject of modernizing the Constitution, he spoke about 
national unity. He told us that, since the referendum, the 
government understands the desire for change. Not only has the 
government failed to table anything to meet Quebecers' demands, 
but the Prime Minister refuses to talk about the Constitution. He 
recently said he had done enough but, in our eyes, all he did was 
table a meaningless motion on distinct society.
<P>
	As for employment, the government's record is not much better. 
They claim to have created 600,000 jobs, but the hon. member 
forgot to tell us that 800,000 have since been lost. And the 
unemployment rate proves it, averaging between 9.4 and 10 per 
cent.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member admits that many young people are 
unemployed but that they will create summer jobs. In  fact, summer 
jobs simply enable young people to earn the money they need to 
pursue their studies. It is mainly young graduates who are 
unemployed. That is where the future starts for young people. 
There is absolutely nothing for them in this.
<P>
	We are told exports have gone up. Many of these exports are 
natural resources. In fact, it is the value added to natural resources 
that will create jobs for young people. The hon. member speaks 
about prosperity but forgets to mention the debt. What is slowing 
the economy down? Why is our unemployment rate so high? 
Simply because of the debt. I would like the hon. member to talk 
about the debt and how it could be reduced in the near future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes a 
number of points, but on two of them I would like to send him back 
to a couple of classes for his addition and subtraction. Certainly 
when one comes from double digits in unemployment down to 
single digits there is a significant increase in employment in the 
country.
<P>
	One of the things that is causing the lack of direct input into 
some sections of our country is the feeling of instability. The 
destabilizing effect of referendums takes its toll on certain areas of 
the country. I believe those who are part of that destabilizing effect 
have to take some of the blame for that.
<P>
	The member mentions some other features. When one looks at 
our export markets and what we are exporting, take a very good 
look and see how much of that really is value added. I think the 
member will be very surprised to see how much of that component 
is truly value added. In his own province in particular, some of the 
things that have been going out of the province are valued added 
products that are sold well on the foreign markets, such as the 
aerospace industry, the making of engines for the aerospace 
industry.
<P>
	There are many good stories about Canada. It is a slow spin-out. 
As recently as the past two weeks the Bank of Canada and other 
major banks have had a surge of money coming into Canada to 
invest and there is also the driving up of our dollar. These are all 
good signs that the Canadian economy has turned the corner. It is 
predicted that we will lead the G-7 in the next year in growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is so 
interesting today, on November 7, to be discussing the throne 
speech delivered on February 27, 1996. While we suspected that 
what the government was announcing was mostly window 
dressing, we are now certain of that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6255"> 6255 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me briefly remind you that the throne speech delivered by 
the governor general, on behalf of the government, had three major 
themes: a strong economy, the security of Canadians, and a modern 
and united  country. One might say that it was wishful thinking on 
the part of the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	We were just told again how strong the economy is. A major 
problem in this country, and not only in Quebec, is that a very large 
number-in fact an increasing number-of citizens do not think 
the recession is over, do not think Canada is the best country in the 
world, because life for them has become harder and their hopes 
have been diminishing.
<P>
	What about the security of Canadians and Quebecers? This 
government managed to reduce its deficit, but who paid, who is 
paying and who will continue to pay? It is those who could least 
afford to do so, and it will continue to be these people. We can 
never say it enough: had it not made substantial cuts to 
unemployment insurance and social transfers, the performance of 
this government would not be the same, because this is where it 
took most of the money used to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	Let me also remind you that we had two successive UI reforms, 
and that the government was elected by promising ``jobs, jobs, 
jobs''. But what did the government actually do? Its main initiative 
was to cut unemployment insurance and social transfers.
<P>
	As for jobs, over 870,000 jobs would be needed to now have the 
equivalent of the number of people employed in 1990. A drop in 
the participation rate is a major reason for the lower unemployment 
rate. This is nothing to be proud of, since it not only means there 
are fewer people working, but there are also fewer people looking 
for work. These people did not all go back to school.
<P>
	The result of these successive cuts to unemployment insurance 
is, and this bears pointing out, that in 2001 unemployment 
insurance benefits will drop by $1.2 billion in Quebec alone. These 
are official figures from Employment and Immigration, which has 
now become Human Resources Development, and the way it 
looked to me yesterday will become the Social Union Department. 
This means that those who are unemployed, in regions where 
unemployment is high, are helping to reduce the deficit. The 
regions and the people least able are contributing the greatest share.
<P>
	What about the Canada social transfer? I would remind viewers 
that for years now we have been saying that we have seen fewer 
concrete investments, fewer research and development investments 
and less routine spending by the federal government in Quebec. 
Since the Conservatives dared to give the CF-18 contract to 
Canadair, the only other investment we have seen, accompanied by 
much fanfare, was an $87 million loan, which our colleagues 
beside us are still going on about.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	They say we are irritated because we have more than our share of 
people on unemployment and welfare and  what we want are 
concrete investments. But they cannot even say that any more 
because the more cuts we see to unemployment insurance and 
welfare, the less so-called interregional subsidization there is. This 
is true for Quebec and also for the Maritimes, and I have never 
been afraid to say so. The Maritimes voted largely Liberal. The 
first reaction was deep cuts, followed by more cuts.
<P>
	If there are members here who think that people must not be 
helped out of dependence, I am certainly not one of them. But if 
dependency is going to be reduced, communities must have 
something concrete.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer is replacing what for years 
had been a kind of redistribution among poor and rich provinces in 
order to provide minimum living standards in all regions. It does 
not give them all the same resources with regard to education, 
health or welfare. Since their inception, these subsidies have been 
steadily declining. However, since the 1995 announcement, they 
have dropped substantially: seven billion dollars over two years. Of 
this seven billion cut, Quebec is absorbing more than a quarter 
because it has more than its share of people on welfare.
<P>
	The worst part about this so-called social union is that from now 
on whenever there is an increase in the number on the welfare roll, 
which is bound to happen, there will be no increase in financial 
assistance. The average citizen believes that the recession is not 
over and that another one is lurking on the horizon. It might not 
happen next year, but it will one day.
<P>
	In spite of all the rosy forecasts that the Canadian economy is on 
the upswing, our growth rate is only 1 per cent. A one per cent 
growth rate is not very far from zero growth. We are bound to enter 
another recessionary period, maybe in two years, and more people 
will be on welfare again. Who will pay for the increased numbers 
on the welfare roll? Quebec will, because it will receive no special 
assistance, and the other poor provinces.
<P>
	When we hear the federal government talk about social union 
and preserving the social safety net, and in the same breath, 
congratulating itself on the success of its deficit reduction program, 
we cannot help but feel extremely angry. In fact, in the current 
context, the cuts in the unemployment insurance and the Canada 
health and social transfer make life harder for the unemployed, 
who depend on government assistance. This is even more shocking 
and frustrating as these cuts caused directly by the Canada health 
and social transfer and indirectly by the cuts to unemployment 
insurance must be made by the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The cuts that are caused directly by the Canada health and social 
transfer, and indirectly by cuts to unemployment insurance, must 
be implemented by the Quebec government. Whether it is in the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6256"> 6256 </A></B>
<P>
area of education, health or welfare, putting an end to these 
subsidies will have serious effects.
<P>
	The third part of the throne speech speaks about a modern and 
united country, but since social conditions have seriously 
deteriorated and nothing has been done for the recognition of the 
people of Quebec, of the nation of Quebec, I feel the speech from 
the throne is, at best, an exercise in fantasy.
<P>
	I know that what I am saying might seem outrageous, but if some 
members here think that the situation we have had to put up with in 
Quebec is not extremely outrageous, they should think again. Since 
January, since the Liberal caucus, instead of a government which 
would make a place, a real place for Quebec and not merely 
enshrine a phoney distinct society in the Constitution when it 
cannot even be enshrined at present, a distinct society which we do 
not want and which is irrelevant to us, what did we get? We had to 
put up with a series of hidden, open, direct and indirect threats.
<P>
	The only purpose of plan B, which we could say is called plan B 
after the billy club or the baseball bat, is to frighten us, to try to 
convince Quebecers they should not seek to become sovereign. The 
intent is not to make them feel better, to make a place for them, to 
give them some dignity in this country, but rather to frighten them. 
We know that, throughout history, this tactic has never worked.
<P>
	Recently, probably because there is in election coming, they 
came up with plan A-``A'' as in ``attract''-a plan with little or no 
substance really. What is it all about? About entrenching the 
concept of distinct society in the Constitution and, to use the new 
terminology, creating a Canadian social union.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development spoke in 
generous terms in his speech yesterday, but did not include Quebec 
in any way. Like the initiative taken by Ontario at the Jasper 
conference, this shows that Canadians, Quebecers excluded, want 
to renew Canada. I think it is great that Canadians discuss between 
themselves how their country could be run better and how social 
policies are managed. But one thing is clear: there is nothing in 
there for Quebec. Not only is there nothing for Quebec, but the two 
movements that have been developing for years: a movement for 
Canada's renewal by the provinces and a movement, which is 
getting stronger and stronger, of Quebecers that recognize 
themselves and want to be recognized as a people and a nation. 
These two movements are going in opposite directions.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	But every basis for recognition is there. It is all there, except for 
one thing: recognizing Quebec as a people and a nation, so that the 
Canadian provinces looking to reorganize their country to their 
liking-and this is both desirable and necessary-can do so 
without Quebec getting in the way, while Quebec gets reorganized 
on its own terms, with full powers, without Canada getting in the 
way, and that both countries can share the same economic space as 
well as other aspects, if they so agree.
<P>
	Therein lies the real future, beyond the speeches made here. The 
truth, even when hard to take, must help us understand each other. 
It must prevail and allow us to create conditions whereby all of us 
will work at what is essential and urgent, at what our young people 
want, whether in Canada or in Quebec.
<P>
	We will soon no doubt hear another speech from the throne. How 
soon? I do not know. Certainly before the next election. One thing 
is certain though: we will keep a close eye, as you know, on what 
the government does about the needs of Quebecers. We will 
continue to say, not only for the good of Quebec but also, and we 
are convinced of that, for the good of Canada, that there is only one 
way to finally build a future that will allow us, in Canada and in 
Quebec, to respect and to help each other, and that is through 
Quebec's sovereignty.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONAL4-HWEEK">NATIONAL 4-H WEEK</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Prince Edward-Hastings, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is National 4-H Week. As a former 4-H club member 
and leader, I want to again remind Canadians that our young people 
are one of this country's most important assets. Today's youth are 
tomorrow's farmers, business people, scientists and political 
leaders. But they can only reach their great potential if they have 
the opportunity to learn the skills they need as adults.
<P>
	More than 42,000 young women and men are learning those 
essential skills by participating in 4-H clubs in rural communities 
across the country. As we celebrate National 4-H Week from 
November 4 to 10, we salute not only those young people but the 
12,000 adult volunteers who are the backbone of 4-H.
<P>
	``Learn to do by doing'' has been the 4-H model for more than 80 
years. Through 4-H activities, our rural youth are building skills 
such as leadership, independence, co-operation and responsibility.
<P>
	As a member of the Canadian 4-H Council, Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada is contributing to this effort. It will provide 
$300,000 over three years in support of national and provincial 4-H 
activities so our youth will get the chance to try new things, learn 
new skills and make lifelong friends.

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister and Liberal members keep saying that an end must be put 
to the political uncertainty created by separatist threats.
<P>
	The reality is that they are entirely responsible for the political 
uncertainty, with their federalist threats, such as changing the rules 
of democracy to suit them, preventing Quebecers from deciding on 
their own future and encouraging the partition of Quebec in the 
event of sovereignty. Furthermore, political uncertainty exists only 
in the discourse of hard-core federalists.
<P>
	For proof, we have this morning's announcement in the 
newspapers that Astra, a pharmaceutical company, has selected 
Montreal as the site for its first research centre outside Sweden. 
This project represents an investment of over $300 million over ten 
years.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	Fortunately, foreign investors do not allow themselves to be 
influenced by the dire warnings of federalists. They know good 
places to invest and both Quebec and Montreal are excellent 
choices. They have our thanks.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
school yard bullies, the government likes to start fights with those 
it knows it can threaten and beat.
<P>
	First it was the gun owners, ordinary citizens who will now have 
to pay to register their firearms or face criminal conviction for 
non-compliance.
<P>
	Then the government, intent on its own version of crime control, 
turned its attention to grain farmers. A Manitoba farmer was sent to 
jail and about 150 others face charges for selling their grain in the 
United States.
<P>
	Is it illegal for farmers to sell their crops? The courts said it was 
okay, but the agriculture minister, intent on protecting the wheat 
board's monopoly, secured an order in council to make it illegal.
<P>
	This Liberal government will leave no stone unturned to stop 
farmers from getting a better price for their grain. Customs 
inspectors and RCMP officers have strict orders to apprehend these 
people. Meanwhile, the flow of contraband continues north and 
south across the 49th parallel.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDIABETESMONTH">NATIONAL DIABETES MONTH</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as many members are aware, November is national 
diabetes month. We are all familiar with this disease and the impact 
it has on Canadians and their families. What many people are not 
aware of, though, is the alarming prevalence of diabetes in First 
Nations' communities.
<P>
	A recent study of the Sioux Lookout zone population in my 
riding showed that the incidence of diabetes among aboriginal 
Canadians is far higher than the general population. Even more 
alarming is that over the five-year period there was a 45 per cent 
increase in diagnosed cases and that aboriginal people are affected 
at a much younger age than the general population.
<P>
	Current efforts are proving inefficient to deal with the problem 
and the potential human and health care costs are staggering. In the 
light of this, I urge the Minister of Health and the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to step up their efforts to 
combat diabetes in the aboriginal population.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the past I have made statements in the House pertaining to the 
gasoline and banking industries. Today again I wish to speak on the 
gasoline gouging that is presently going on at the pumps.
<P>
	Many people are calling to express their disgust and dismay 
toward the gasoline companies and their unjustified and 
unacceptable increases.
<P>
	Every time we confront the gasoline companies their rebuttal is: 
``Well, it is competition''. I thought competition meant pricing the 
product downward to stay competitive. It would seem that with the 
gouging that is going on, the gasoline companies are indeed 
competing: competing to see which company can jack up the prices 
more.
<P>
	I say get with it. Come into line with what is happening out there. 
Listen to what the people have to say for a change. The government 
has worked hard to bring interest rates down and have succeeded. 
They should do their share and bring the prices at the gas pumps 
down. The public is asking for it. The economy needs it. Just do it.

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, each

across the country, it becomes more apparent that the events they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6258"> 6258 </A></B>
<P>
have experienced by serving Canada are receding more and more 
into the past.
<P>
	Our veterans are getting older and each year fewer are able to 
participate. Our veterans have much to teach the younger 
generation about the values that went into building this country and 
preserving democracy. We must encourage our veterans to tell their 
stories and to give our young people the occasion to listen.
<P>
	As a step in the right direction, the Prime Minister has declared 
November 3 to 11 as veterans' week. I invite all Canadians, but 
especially the younger generation, to take time to listen to the 
stories of Canada's veterans of the first and second world wars and 
the Korean war. I hope that all Canadians will make an effort to 
record these stories on paper, video, audio tape and now the 
Internet so that they may not be lost to future generations.

chapters in modern history. The International Court of Justice of 
The Hague is now putting together a multidisciplinary team whose 
mandate will be to hold an investigation and submit evidence 
against those responsible for the slaughter of thousands of 
Rwandans.
<P>
	A team of 21 special investigators is set to depart shortly for 
Rwanda for a period of six months. Nine officers from the 
Montreal Urban Community police force have been selected for the 
team, including Denis Bergeron, a resident of Saint-Césaire in the 
beautiful riding of Shefford.
<P>

	If there is to be lasting peace in this area of the world, justice

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recent 
announcements that Canadian Airlines is having financial trouble 
should be of concern to all of us.
<P>
	At a time when the Liberal job creation strategy has failed and 
unemployment is hovering close to the 10 per cent mark, we 
certainly do not want to see 16,000 airline jobs disappear.
<P>
	Certain steps now need to be taken by Canadian Airlines. It is 
acting very responsibly in taking those steps. Once the steps have 
been taken we can then look at what other action is required.
<P>
	A government bailout does not appear to be a viable solution. It 
has been done before and obviously did not provide a real remedy. 
What is needed this time is an effective plan that will work over the 
longer term.
<P>
	The Reform Party is meeting with officials from Canadian, Air 
Canada and American Airlines to discuss possible solutions and to 
work toward protecting Canadian jobs, Canadian investment and 
the Canadian travelling public.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we listen 
carefully we can hear thousands of voices, primarily from western 
Canada, telling the federal government that it is now their turn.
<P>
	We just heard that Canadian Airlines is in a very serious 
financial situation and 16,400 jobs are immediately at stake and 
thousands of related jobs are at risk. Many western and northern 
communities depend to a large extent on maintaining their 
connection with Canadian Airlines.
<P>
	The National Transportation Act provides an opportunity for the 
Minister of Transport, giving him extraordinary powers to 
intervene to resolve the situation. Two or three suggestions would 
be to provide bridge financing for Canadian to allow it to 
restructure properly, involving all of those who are stakeholders in 
the airline.
<P>
	May I suggest that with $87 million going to help Bombardier, it 
is now time for $70 million of bridge financing to help this western 
based airline.

Canadians across the country will pause to remember the sacrifice 
of Canada's soldiers, sailors, airmen and merchant mariners who 
died for them in the cause of world peace.
<P>
	While the deaths of our friends and family members are very real 
and personal to those of us who have experienced them first hand, 
to most Canadians alive today this is simply a matter of history.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Remembrance Day is a solemn occasion when we recall the 
sacrifices of the many Canadians who fought for the cause of 
freedom.
<P>
	This month <I>Legion</I> magazine pays special tribute to the 
contribution of Canada's servicewomen of World War II. In all 
three forces, nurses faced the same risks, hardships, burdens of 
command and front line service as other personnel. But in all three 
forces women also served in a variety of functions, both in Canada 
and overseas as enlisted personnel, NCOs and commissioned 
officers.
<P>
	It was the Royal Canadian Air Force, however, that provided a 
stellar example of allowing both men and women to contribute 
fully to the war effort. Although women did not serve in combat, 
they fulfilled duties in over half of the 102 RCAF trades.
<P>
	From 1942 until the end of the war more than 17,000 women 
served in the women's division of the RCAF, including some 600 
officers.
<P>
	During veterans week and on November 11, let us remember the 
significant contribution of the thousands of Canadian men and 
women who toiled and sacrificed in the name of freedom for all 
Canadians and humanity.

neither union nor management, but rather the process of collective

<P>
	Henceforth, in areas coming under federal jurisdiction, people 
working off the work site may take part in collective bargaining if 
they so desire. The employer will, moreover, not be allowed to use 
replacement workers in order to get rid of a union.
<P>
	Thanks to the proposed amendments, any deadlock in 
negotiations will not have repercussions on the public to such an 
extent as to make them withdraw support of the collective 
bargaining process. As well, union and management representation 
on the Canadian Industrial Relations Board will increase the 
credibility and legitimacy of that board's decisions.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian is facing insurmountable difficulties and 
calling, once again, for federal help.
<P>
	In response, the Minister of Transport stated that the government 
would not get involved for the time being. The Liberal member for 
Vancouver Quadra now says the government must step in. The 
pressures are growing and might even pay off.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. The government's policy 
has always been to let our air carriers play by market rules, which 
means allowing free competition with all the risks it entails. My 
question to the Prime Minister is this: Is government policy still the 
same and is he still ruling out any injection of public funds into the 
bottomless pit that is Canadian?

change in the government's position in this regard.
<P>
	We do not believe that putting money into a company that has 
not requested it, to deal with a problem that is essentially a

have any purpose whatsoever.

	Can the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Transport, assure us 
that his government will not now or later change regulations so that 
Canadian cannot be taken over by American?
<P>

Speaker, no application was received from either Canadian 
International or American Airlines to increase American's share of 
Canadian.

<P>
	As no application was made, we did not review this matter and 
there is no reason to make a decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the Minister of Transport not think that, in the final 
analysis, there is only enough room for one national air carrier in 
Canada, as the Bloc Quebecois has always maintained, and that the 
government's policy of encouraging and supporting two carriers 
can hardly work?
<P>
	Should the government not revise its policy before injecting 
taxpayers' money into the financial sinkhole that is Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the government's policy is to favour competition among 
several airlines. It is not a matter of having only two airlines; there 
are several others involved. We want a system that will help

<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Canadian is about to come back and pass the hat for more 
taxpayers' money to deal with its financial problems, but year after 
year, the same company continues to pay a very expensive $150 
million annually for its service contract with American Airlines, 
and will do so for 20 years.
<P>
	Before even considering the possibility of injecting one cent of 
federal money into Canadian, could the minister give taxpayers the 
assurance that he will make sure that Canadian's contracts with 
American Airlines have been revised to make them much fairer to 
Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's position is based on an erroneous 
premise. There has been no request from Canadian International 
for government funds, there has been no request for money from 
the government. We are not going to force a company to take our 
money. That will not happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there may be 
no request, but in January something is going to happen. We know 
that Canadian announced last week that the company will have a 
liquidity problem starting next January.
<P>
	Does the minister still intend to demand that Canadian continue 
to pay back the remainder of its $120 million loan from the 
government, as agreed, and will he refuse to delay the payback so 
as not to give Canadian special treatment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> First, 
Mr. Speaker, the loan of $120 million was from three governments, 
not one. Second, three-quarters of that loan has in fact already been 
repaid.
<P>
	With respect to the overall issue of the position of Canadian, we 
believe it is really important for this restructuring to succeed. A 
company which has a structural problem and consistently loses 
money year after a year is not in a position to continue for many 
years in operation. Therefore we want to make sure the 
restructuring process succeeds.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6262"> 6262 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue of a loan or of changing ownership simply does not 
enter into the fundamental question which is a restructuring of its 
systems so that it becomes a profitable company and can continue 
to employ 17,000 Canadians

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he holds his cabinet 
ministers to a higher ethical standard. However, in the past three 
years Canadians have seen little evidence of these higher standards. 
Minister after minister in the Liberal government has broken the 
code of conduct for even public office holders. Some are forced to 
resign while others are staunchly defended by the Prime Minister. 
Canadians deserve to know why this double standard.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister clear up this confusion by simply 
releasing the secret ethical guideline he has for his cabinet 
ministers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on June 16, 1996 we published the ``Conflict of Interest 
and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders''. We have 
issued the Lobbyists' Administration Act. We have other 
provisions in legislation to guide everybody in public office.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	As far as communications by the Prime Minister to ministers, 
they are communications within the privy council. I do not release 
them but it is not very complicated.
<P>
	I have said to ministers that they must adhere to the highest 
standards of conflict of interest that they can find. I am very proud 
to say that despite the member's innuendo there is only one 
minister who has given me his resignation. The reason he resigned 
was that he had written a letter to a tribunal to help a poor lady who 
wanted her husband to come to Canada.
<P>
	There was no other resignation, and the member cannot say what 
she said because it is not the truth. There was only one, and 
everyone in Canada knows why the former minister of defence 
resigned.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has bragged repeatedly over the years that he has 
ethical guidelines for cabinet ministers that go well beyond this 
code of conduct for public office holders, and now he says they 
have just mentioned it and had a chat about it.
<P>
	Nobody seems to know what these guidelines are, where they are 
or whether they exist at all. If the Prime Minister does have these 
ethical guidelines that he talks about, there is no good reason why 
they should not be made public.
<P>
	Again, does the Prime Minister have a set of guidelines for his 
cabinet ministers who have higher ethical standards than even the 
code for public officers which he has talked about? And if so, why 
in the world will he not release them to the public?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat they are communications between me and my 
ministers, and we have the result today.
<P>
	In three years there was only one incident that has caused the 
resignation of one minister. One of the complaints in letters I 
received was that they were too strict for the former minister of 
defence to resign.
<P>
	Look at the conduct. For the last three years this government has 
had no serious accusations of misconduct because the ministers 
have accepted the highest standards seen for a long time in the 
Canadian Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all the 
bluster and bragging in the world will not solve the problem. Ethics 
are a public matter and Canadians deserve to know what the Prime 
Minister's so-called higher standards are.
<P>
	In the last election the Liberals promised to restore integrity to 
our parliamentary institutions and make government open and 
transparent. I think I heard those words several times during the 
campaign.
<P>
	It is very difficult to see how secret ethical guidelines square 
with the Prime Minister's red book promises. Will the Prime 
Minister live up to his red book promise and release the guidelines 
for these higher standards for Liberal cabinet ministers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no wonder they are losing a member a week. They have 
nothing to contribute to this Parliament. They go on about this 
problem, which we have already explained.
<P>
	The secretary of state got up in the House and explained herself. 
It is the tradition of the House of Commons that if a member does 
not accept the word of a minister, they should make a charge, an 
accusation.
<P>
	They have nothing but innuendo. For example, yesterday one of 
the members linked this operation that was done in good faith to 
that of a bank robber. He did not apologize.
<P>
	When I see political people operating at that level of innuendo I 
do not want to spend too much time on them but I know they cannot 
find anything to talk about. When they cannot talk about the real 
problems of the nation we know they are politically bankrupt.

<P>
	Canadian taxpayers have the right to full disclosure and 
therefore have the right to see complete copies of credit card 
statements and supporting documents.
<P>
	In the interest of openness and accountability, will the Prime 
Minister direct that these documents be tabled in their entirety?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. 
The House or the members do not have access to personal 
information of a confidential nature. This is a right of individuals 
that is protected in our laws and that we will continue to protect.
<P>
	So that members will know exactly the source, it is under section 
19 of the Access to Information Act: ``A government institution 
shall not disclose personal information''. That includes Parliament.
<P>
	The Access to Information Act goes on to say: ``The definition 
of personal information stated under the Privacy Act applies''. 
Personal financial transactions are clearly included under personal 
information.
<P>
	The member should apply his time to other types of questions 
rather than hitting a wall that protects the privacy of personal 
information.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly when a 
minister puts personal expenses on a government card, that 
individual has moved it from the private to the public domain. That 
is the issue here.
<P>
	What we want are the facts that are missing. In just the six 
months for which we currently have some information, at least 
$9,300 is unaccounted for. We have no documentation for the other 
two and a half years. This could be cleared up very simply by the 
tabling of complete, un-whited documents.
<P>

documents be tabled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

there will be legislation and that it will follow all the parameters 
that he has indicated up to this point: the Supreme Court decision, 
the priority of the health of Canadians, and all the consultations 
that have followed as a result of the blueprint document.
<P>
	As to everything else, because we live in a democratic society, 
people are welcome to present their views, but there is no deviation

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Canada has been one of the main proponents in establishing the 
World Trade Organization and the rules based dispute settlement 
that goes along with it. This last year the Liberal government could 
have taken the dispute with the United States on softwood lumber 
to the World Trade Organization. Instead it has caved in to the 
Americans and accepted export quotas.
<P>
	Thousands of jobs in the forest industry will be lost because of 
this government's misguided, bureaucratic and unworkable quota 
system. What is the minister going to do about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we went the route of an agreement with the 
United States because that is what the industry wanted in all 
provinces. That is what the provincial governments wanted as well. 
They knew that, in fact, our chances of success at the WTO were 
very iffy and that we would have years and years of legal 
wrangling. They wanted stability and certainty.
<P>
	On top of that, in terms of the formula as to how the allocations 
were made, it was the industry that brought forward the suggestions 
on which the allocations were made with the concurrence of the 
provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems 
ironic that after only six days of this quota system we are getting a 
flood of mail from mills that are going to be out of business. If all 
the stakeholders put together such a good deal, why are all these 
companies going to be put out of business? What went wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the price of lumber went up substantially in the 
United States and, seeing a good business proposition, these 
companies decided to rush the border with lots of lumber, knowing 
full well that the quota was going to be based on their past 
experience. They put themselves in the position they are in. They 
created their own misfortune and put their employees in jeopardy 
with that kind of action.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, we have established a quota bank to give 
the lumber companies that have used up all their quota an 
opportunity to draw on it in terms of next year's allocations so they 
can continue to do business and provide jobs in the lumber 
industry.

I thought the hon. member was going to get up to congratulate the 
RCMP, the immigration department and the various other police 
forces for their recent success in smashing a major international 
ring which was smuggling immigrants.
<P>
	This success is an indication of what the federal government is 
doing, which is to work jointly with other federal departments and 
police forces to break up the rings which smuggle people and 
goods. We are working to deal with this serious situation in a way 
that protects our traditional open borders which are important to 
the vast majority of people in this country and in our neighbouring

<P>
	In order to put an end to this unacceptable smuggling of people, 
which may involve accomplices in high places in Hong Kong, can 
the minister inform us of the steps that have been taken, and the

	Over the past few weeks the leader of the Conservative Party in 
Prince Edward Island has promised that if elected, he would out of

view, this would be highly illegal under the act and Mr. Binns 
knows better.
<P>
	Could the minister clarify specifically, can funds be taken from 
the employment insurance account and given to a provincial 
government for such a purpose?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Employment Insurance Act 
makes it absolutely clear that the employment insurance fund is not 
a slush fund for the use of this government or any provincial 
government in the land. The employment insurance fund is there to 
help Canadians get back to work. It is there to finance active 
measures such as wage subsidies, earning supplements, 
self-employment assistance, job creation partnerships and skills 
loans and grants.
<P>
	Our government will be working with the Government of Prince

industry.
<P>
	I am a professional forester and I have spent 25 years in the 
forestry industry. Never before have I witnessed such secrecy 
surrounding the allocation of quotas to individual lumber mills; 
quotas that are far below expected levels and are forcing mills to 
severely downsize or shut down altogether. What I find most 
disturbing is that producers have been instructed by the minister 
not to divulge their individual quotas.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	My question is for the minister of trade. To clear this veil of 
secrecy regarding quotas, will the minister table in the House a full 
list of quota allocations showing all lumber producers in all 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

divulge their own quotas they can do so. If they have no problem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6266"> 6266 </A></B>
<P>
with that in terms of competition and commercial confidentiality, 
they are quite free to do that but certainly it is not my intention.
<P>
	The hon. member may have been in the forestry industry for a 
long period of time, but I do not think he ever got out of the woods 
or he would soon know that in fact the industry wanted this deal.
<P>
	We got the industry something that was unprecedented. We got 
five years of trade peace with the United States in terms of lumber. 
The problem is that a few of the companies thought this was such a 
great deal that even though they knew there were quotas, and they 
wanted quotas, they were still going to rush that border and make 
as much money as they possibly could. Now of course they are 
asking what happened. What has happened is there is no more 
quota.
<P>
	The companies knew that the quota was going to be based on 
their traditional exports. They knew what the rules were because 
their industry gave us their suggestions for the rules. By and large 
we adopted them and with provincial government concurrence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the minister ran on a platform of jobs, he forgot to tell Canadians 
that they were American jobs at the expense of Canadian jobs.
<P>
	Many lumber mills, particularly the smaller ones, are laying off 
staff or closing down altogether because their quotas did not 
materialize or they came in far below the expectations. A number 
of companies in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec are desperate 
for help.
<P>
	This government ran on a platform of creating jobs yet in this 
case thousands of jobs and livelihoods are being lost.
<P>
	My question for the minister of trade is plain and direct. What is 
the minister going to do for the families that he has now put out of 
work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> This government, Mr. Speaker, has put nobody out of work. 
This government has bent over backward to try to make sure that 
the system which the industry wanted-the industry wanted this 
protection-is fair and balanced. We have talked with all 600 of 
those companies that are getting lumber quotas to make sure that 
we are in fact fair.
<P>
	If some of them have gone overboard and have used their quota, 
we are still providing a quota bank to help them in terms of 
bridging over this period of time so that they can keep the jobs. We 
also know they can go ahead at the existing prices and even pay 
these fees which are staying in Canada. They can pay the $100 fee 
and the $50 fee and still make some money on it.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, among the commitments we made 
at the time of the 1993 election was a commitment to act upon the 
recommendations of the pest management regulatory report which 
was published under the previous government.
<P>
	We have made considerable progress in implementing the 
principle recommendations in that report, including the 
establishment of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. That 
agency brings together authorities that were previously in four 
departments to streamline the process. It has two principal 
objectives: to ensure the health and safety of Canadians and the 
environment; and to be fully cognizant of the competitive 
requirements of Canadian farmers to have a level playing field 
nationally and internationally.
<P>
	The Pest Management Regulatory Agency is working diligently 
toward that direction. We are in the process of establishing a 
stakeholders consultative committee to make sure that the agency 
has the necessary input from the private sector.
<P>
	I would point out for the hon. member's information that the 
legal responsibility for the Pest Management Regulatory Agency is 
in fact vested in the department of health, not the department of 
agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the agriculture community is finding that the Minister 
of Health is not listening.
<P>
	I have to commend the hon. minister for living up to his 
reputation recently described as having the conversational knack to 
circle the earth without ever landing.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am going to ask the member to put his question 
now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Will the minister please come down to earth 
and realize that his disregard for the bloated Pest Management 
Regulatory Agency, one that pushes cost recovery rather than 
reducing farmers' input costs, has ended up costing farmers a lot of 
money and that his bureaucratic mess is making Canadian 
agriculture less competitive? Will the minister admit that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking of landing, I would be 
delighted to land splat on the hon. member in the next election 
which I intend to do.
<P>
	In terms of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, I think the 
hon. member should know that the agency is in the process of 
getting up and running. It is in the process of soliciting all the 
necessary input from all of the relevant stakeholders. I am 
confident the agency and the responsible minister will take all of 
that into account.
<P>
	It would appear that we have a series of new pests to deal with in 
the Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	The seafood industry is concerned that the consolidation of food 
inspection services into a single food inspection agency could lead 
to a serious loss of expertise and advocacy for seafood at the 
federal level.
<P>
	Will the minister explain how the seafood industry will fit into 
the new agency structure? Will there be a dedicated seafood 
inspection branch staffed by former fisheries and oceans inspection 
personnel?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say that this 
regulatory process does fall under the jurisdiction of the minister of 
agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	I am happy to assure my hon. friend and the seafood industry 
that there will be no loss of expertise in the new Canadian food 
inspection agency. The current Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
inspection staff and all of their professional experience and 
expertise will be transferred to the agency to ensure that there are 
no gaps in service and no gaps in the quality of service.
<P>
	The seafood industry will benefit from this process, from a 
broader base of support to food inspection in general and by better 
co-ordination of all of the government's inspection resources. We 
will of course have new flexibilities under the legislation in terms 
of financial and human resources to make the system better than it 
is today.

	It is now two years since I asked the two previous ministers of

case. I know the hon. member is very concerned, because he asked 
the same question last week.
<P>
	We are looking into this case. I believe there is a problem due to 
the fact that the pension fund belonged to the Singer company 
which was transferred to the United States, it closed its doors here 
and has declared bankruptcy in the U.S. As far as the Canadian 
government is concerned, the circumstances make taking any kind 
of action rather difficult.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In my riding and in the general suburban area of Vancouver, 
street prostitution is a serious problem which the community wants 
dealt with. We had hoped for some action in 1994 yet still we have 
nothing from the government.
<P>
	At some point the government must gather itself, find a moral 
compass and act in a way that is right. The legal door for kids to get 
hooked into street prostitution has been left wide open by the 
justice minister.
<P>
	Will the minister act now to make street level prostitution an 
indictable offence or at least a hybrid offence? Will he act now on 
this important change to protect our children? Will he himself take 
action instead of continuing to blame his inaction on the provinces 
or those pressure groups that represent prostitutes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member knows 
that the issue of street prostitution involves more than simply 
changing the words in the Criminal Code of Canada. If we are 
going to resolve the question of people working the streets and 
selling their bodies for money, we are going to have to do more 
than simply amend the Criminal Code of Canada.
<P>
	There are some things that can be done effectively through the 
criminal law. Through Bill C-27, which is now before a committee, 
we have proposed tough mandatory minimum penitentiary terms 
for people who would use violence to coerce children into 
prostitution. That is going to be an effective measure.
<P>
	Let me say to the hon. member that two years ago, governments 
at all levels began looking at a short list of steps that could be taken 
not only through the Criminal Code but through other strategies to 
bring down the incidence of street prostitution and all the 
difficulties it causes for neighbourhoods, for families and for 
children.
<P>
	Consultation documents have been circulated in all the 
provinces. That process is almost finished. In fact, all but two of 
the provinces have now returned with conclusions from the 
consultation process. When that process is completed, and 
Manitoba and Ontario have yet to complete it, we will look 
carefully at the short list of possible steps that all levels of 
government could take and we will decide on an appropriate course 
of action.

is for the Minister of Transport. He will know that a political fire 
storm is developing in western Canada over the financial crisis 
faced by an airline based in western Canada. The minister knows 
that nearly 70,000 jobs are at risk and thousands more related jobs 
are at risk. He said that he has not been asked to do anything.
<P>
	Has the minister considered being proactive and providing 
leadership in finding a solution to this problem by suggesting 
actions that the federal government could take to help this troubled 
airline?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	The point I would like to make to him and to everybody in this 
House is that we must keep our eye on the actual problem of 
Canadian International Airlines.
<P>
	Anyone who thinks some government bailout can be a substitute 
for the restructuring plan of Canadian is simply dreaming. There is 
no point in coming forward with financial assistance to handle the 
losses of a period if there are no structural changes made that will 
prevent those losses from reoccurring in the future.
<P>
	That is why I can say to him-I appreciate his question-that we 
strongly support the proposals for restructuring Canadian airlines 
which have been put forward. I recognize this will be a very 
difficult decision for the employees and I am extremely 
sympathetic to them as they consider this plan.
<P>
	Without a plan within the company which deals with the 
structural chronic losses that it has had, we will not be able to have 
that company providing employment in the future as we would 
like.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NON-PARTYSTATUSMEMBERS">NON-PARTY STATUS MEMBERS</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a question of privilege pursuant to Standing Order 48(1). The 
privilege in question is one that is both the least questioned and the 
most fundamental right of any member of Parliament, freedom of 
speech.
<P>
	The breach of freedom of speech, as I will state, involves the 
inability of me as a member of Parliament and others to participate 
in debate on government legislation or to be an active member of 
House committees.
<P>
	I am aware that we as parliamentarians are bound by the rules 
and orders of the House with respect to  participation in debate. 
However, as we have seen in the past, the status quo regarding 
parliamentary reform has been challenged. It is my intention today 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6270"> 6270 </A></B>
<P>
to stand to challenge the status quo respecting the freedom of 
speech of individual members of Parliament.
<P>
	The question I raise asks for the Speaker to give additional 
recognition to the members of Parliament who do not have party 
status in matters of debate and committee representation. I would 
like to point out that when I refer to members who are without party 
status and currently sitting in the House, I am referring to those 
members who are not officially recognized by the House of 
Commons due in part to the 12 member party threshold to which 
we as parliamentarians are currently bound through the 1963 
statute that is embodied in the Parliament of Canada Act.
<P>
	We are currently sitting in the 35th session of Parliament with a 
high number of MPs without party status representing constituents 
all across Canada. It is now time that the House recognize this as a 
significant deficit in terms of opinion and representation in debate. 
Without these voices the constituents in 15 ridings are quiet.
<P>
	There have been a number of important debates in which those 
members have been unable to participate, and Bill C-41 is one of 
those in which many of us would very much like to participate.
<P>
	Under current parliamentary rules and practice the opportunities 
for members with non-party status are limited in committee work. 
Political parties dominate the ever increasing role of the House and 
it is extremely difficult for members who do not belong to a party 
to have the same influence or to participate as fully as members 
who are party members.
<P>
	Freedom of speech is a fundamental parliamentary privilege. 
Professor W.F. Dawson of the University of Alberta said in a 1959 
article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The privilege of freedom of speech is probably the most important and least 
questioned of all privileges enjoyed by the House. In its most elementary form this 
privilege was stated in the Bill of Rights which declared that `the freedom of speech 
and debates of proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in 
any court or place outside of Parliament'. Today, it is one of the privileges requested 
by the Speaker at the beginning of every Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Freedom of speech means that the members have the right to 
speak freely in the Chamber without fear of intimidation or 
challenge. What they say is privileged, protected or immune from 
being questioned outside of Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Joseph Maingot, former law clerk and parliamentary counsel of 
the House of Commons, has said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The privilege of freedom of speech, though of a personal nature, is not so much 
intended to protect the members against prosecutions for their individual advantage 
but to support the right of people by enabling their representatives to execute the 
functions of their office without fear either of civil or criminal prosecution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Freedom to speak freely is not the sole element of this privilege. 
Members must also be free to speak. This means that they have to 
have opportunities to participate in debate and to participate fully 
in the proceedings of Parliament, including parliamentary 
committees. Even if members are not inhibited in terms of what 
they say in the House, they are still inhibited in not being given 
opportunities to speak. The right to say whatever they want is 
meaningless if there is no chance to speak in any case.
<P>
	Freedom of speech does not mean that members have an 
unlimited or unrestrained right to speak on every issue. The rules of 
the House impose limits on the participation of members and it is 
the duty of the Speaker to restrain those who abuse the rules.
<P>
	It is clear that no member of the House can speak whenever he or 
she wishes. It is the role of the Speaker to recognize members and 
to preserve order and decorum. The democratic rights of an elected 
member are diminished when they do not possess the same 
opportunities as other members.
<P>
	The rights of members and through them of their constituents 
must be respected. I speak from my heart for Calgary Southeast. 
The Speaker must be assured that the rights of all members of the 
House are protected. This is an ongoing process and must be 
reviewed afresh from time to time. The question must be asked 
whether independent or non-affiliated party members are being 
allowed to fully participate in the proceedings of the House and its 
committees. The privileges of these members, their freedom of 
speech and the fundamental tenants of parliamentary democracy 
must be satisfied.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you find that I have a prima facie case of 
privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion, seconded 
by the member for Kamloops.
<P>
	I appreciate the time to speak.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has made an eloquent case for a prima facie case 
of privilege being established. I hope she will not take it as being 
too negative if I bring some other considerations to the attention of 
the House and to you, Mr. Speaker, the purpose of which is to urge 
you to reach the conclusion that there is no prima facie case of 
privilege.
<P>
	What the hon. member is complaining about has been the 
accepted practice of the House for many years, for generations. I 
would suggest that if the hon. member studies the opportunities 
available to her as an independent private member, she will find 
that the opportunities she is seeking do exist. She has the same  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6271"> 6271 </A></B>
<P>
opportunities as any other member to present petitions on behalf of 
her constituents. She has the same opportunity as any other 
member to file written questions or to file Notions of Motions for 
the Production of Papers.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, when it comes to speaking in debate it is you, sir, 
who has the ultimate authority to decide who to recognize, who to 
see. It is my impression, based on some years experience here, that 
if a member wishes to speak in a debate, while they may not get the 
floor at the exact time they would like to have it, if they make their 
interest known to Chair they will be recognized to speak in that 
debate.
<P>
	Furthermore, with respect to committees our rules are clear. One 
does not have to be a formal member of a committee to attend 
committee meetings and to take part in discussions. It is true the 
person will not have the right to vote in the committee, but in terms 
of being heard the rules are clear. I repeat, one does not have to be a 
member of a committee in order to attend the meetings and take 
part in discussion.
<P>
	The hon. member concedes that freedom of speech, being very 
important, has to have some reasonable limit. I think the reasonable 
limits which have been established both by our rules and by the 
custom of the House are an effort to make sure that the limited time 
available in any day for debate and discussion is distributed in a 
reasonably equitable fashion among members. I think this is a 
reasonable limitation on what she considers her freedom of speech.
<P>
	Finally, I would say that the comments she has made regarding 
freedom of speech refer to the right of someone once they have the 
floor to speak freely without sanction outside the House. The right 
of freedom of speech as I understand it does not mean that any 
member can speak any time whenever they want, perhaps in a way 
that is not equitable with respect to the equal rights of other 
members, including those who work together as an organized party.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made an eloquent statement. I 
understand her concerns but I would suggest that in consultation 
with you, with the Clerk of the House, with members who perhaps 
may have been here a little longer than she, she could well get 
advice which would help her to participate more fully even as an 
independent member than she has been able to do up to now.
<P>
	That being the case, I respectfully submit that she has not made a 
prima facie case to enable her to put a motion of privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fully agree with what was said by the government house 
leader. We have discussed this question on several occasions, both 
before 1993 and since then.
<P>
	I know that the Bloc Quebecois raised the matter when we had 
only eight members, and we had to live with the rules of the House. 
So I think that was settled. There is only one remedy and that is to 
take full advantage of other opportunities that may arise, in 
questions and comments, in committees, presenting petitions, and 
so forth.
<P>
	I would say that the best way is to belong to a party that fields 
candidates in elections and wins enough seats so its has even more 
opportunities to express its views here in the House. That is how 
the British parliamentary system works. Even with our own 
sovereignist option, as far as we are concerned, we fully agree with 
this kind of system. I would ask you to reject the question of 
privilege.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the comments and I share some of the opinions that have 
already been expressed here on behalf of the government.
<P>
	I would like to tell the hon. member that I have signed a sheet, 
along with the government whip and the whip of the official 
opposition, to allow the member to be an associate member of the 
committees of her choice. If there are other committees she would 
like to be an associate member of, I would be willing and happy to 
do that as well.
<P>
	I encourage the member for Kamloops, who did get a question 
today in question period, to realize that there is a rotation. Mr. 
Speaker, I know you consider the independents to be under the 
protection of the Chair and you want to ensure they have the 
opportunity to get on the floor as much as possible.
<P>
	At times I have substituted members of the NDP or other 
independent members when our members had to catch a plane or 
something. This allows them to get their speeches in if it had been 
difficult for them to do so. But obviously I have to look after the 
needs of my own party first. I will try to be accommodating. I do 
not want to see the hon. member not being able to get her point of 
view heard. If there are ways that can be dovetailed into the House 
life, that should be done.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for 
bringing up this point. She pinpointed that she was talking 
specifically about freedom of speech. I am going to come to that 
point in a second but before I do, I thank the hon. government 
House leader for his intervention as well as the House leader for the 
Bloc and the whip of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast will remember that 
early in this Parliament in 1994, possibly  as early as May 1994, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6272"> 6272 </A></B>
<P>
hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona argued very eloquently that 
independent members should be given more leeway in the 
procedures of this House. At that time in my response I mentioned 
to him that in the magnanimity of the House usually we could make 
some adjustments so that members who wanted to be heard on a 
particular issue could be heard.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I would point out to the hon. member for Calgary Southeast that 
now it is taken for granted that at least one and sometimes two 
independent members will have statements prior to our question 
period and we have tried as much as possible to get at least one 
independent member on in every question period every day. We 
have not always succeeded but to the extent that we have been able 
to get them on, I would suggest that the House as a family has been 
successful.
<P>
	Many times members will come to me on a particular issue 
where they have to ask a question on that specific date, for 
example, if there is a catastrophe in the Saguenay or something like 
that. That it is a topic just for that day and they have to get 
information from the minister. I make every effort to see to it that 
the member, whether an independent or belonging to another party, 
would have a chance to get their question on.
<P>
	I would tend to agree with the government House leader in this 
respect about freedom of speech. I direct myself precisely to the 
point that freedom of speech of course has to do with a member's 
being able to say what he or she wants to say without any 
impediments in this House after the member has the floor. As to the 
member's being able to get the floor, to get the eye or the attention 
of the Speaker, members as a House have generally decided that 
this will probably be the make-up. But in the absence of any 
suggestions from the different parties it is of course the 
responsibility of the Chair to make the decision as to who will 
speak and when.
<P>
	I find at this point that there is not a prima facie case of privilege 
with regard to the specific point to which the member alludes. 
However, once again I appeal to the House in its magnanimity, and 
I refer specifically to the whip of the Reform Party who said he has 
made some allocations where it was possible for independent 
members to take the place of some of the members of his party who 
would have spoken had it not been for another occasion, for 
example. These things I think we can work out together.
<P>
	However, specifically to the member for Calgary Southeast, if 
there is a burning issue, something on which the member must 
absolutely speak, although this does not occur on all the issues, I 
would ask the hon. member to address herself to the other whips if 
she likes or come up to the floor and where that slot is put in there, 
the Chair will give every consideration for those members who 
make a direct appeal to the Chair at that time.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their interventions at this time.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his Speech at the 
opening of the session.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with our deputy House leader.
<P>
	Today we are discussing the Liberal speech from the throne 
which was delivered on February 27 of this year, some nine months 
ago. It was 13 pages long. We all tried to listen to it. Only once in 
that 13 pages did the Liberal government even mention the word 
family, and that was just in a passing reference.
<P>
	Today I would like to take the government to task a bit about that 
and also explain perhaps the priorities I think the family issue 
should have been given in the speech from the throne and certainly 
would be given by the Reform Party.
<P>
	In an Angus Reid poll in 1994, 63 per cent of Canadians agreed 
that the family is in crisis, not just in trouble, in crisis.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	In our recent fresh start initiative we have addressed the 
concerns that many Canadians have about their families being 
under pressure, stressed out, overworked, underpaid and having no 
time to spend with their families, on charity work or on community 
work. They are feeling the stress and are not enjoying it.
<P>
	In a seven page attack memo that was put out by the Liberals last 
week in response to our fresh start campaign, they said Reformers 
do not understand the complexities of the modern family. Just what 
they are talking about I do not know. The modern family is not very 
complicated. I can tell members right now that if one wants to call 
it complicated, in the modern family most times both parents have 
to work. Some also have to moonlight. If that is complex then I 
think I understand it. The modern one income family has to pay 
$7,000 more a year in taxes than the two income family making the 
same amount when both parents work. This is the so-called 
complex reality of the modern family.
<P>
	I think it is really very simple. Parents to not have enough time, 
enough disposable income and enough assets to spend as much 
time and energy with their children because they have to work 
harder for diminishing returns.
<P>
	It is interesting that most of these people do not feel that they 
have a choice about whether they are going to spend more time 
with their family. They end up working  split shifts, two shifts, two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6273"> 6273 </A></B>
<P>
jobs and so on because they are forced to for economic reasons. 
Many of them would prefer, especially when the children are 
young, to be able to look after their children and have the assets to 
do that.
<P>
	On page 38 of the red book the Liberals said the following: 
``Young families need a support system that enables parents to 
participate fully in the economic life of the country. That is why the 
availability of quality child care is an economic issue''.
<P>
	The Liberals' concern for families is that they have to find ways 
for them to participate fully in the economic life of the country. In 
other words, it is Liberal doublespeak for ``get to work, people, you 
do not have enough assets to stay home and look after your 
children, so put them in day care''.
<P>
	The Liberals do not seem to understand that there are other 
options, that we can reduce taxes so that one parent can look after 
the children. We can change the Criminal Code so that parents do 
not feel worried about the safety of their families and their 
children. We can change the taxation system so that it reflects an 
equality for all people regardless of their choice for child care.
<P>
	Before I get into our own fresh start alternative, it is interesting 
that the Liberal answer seems to be to keep taxes high and force 
both parents to participate in the economic life of the country so 
that they can tax them both highly and then the government will run 
a huge national program in order to pick up the slack. It is no 
wonder 63 per cent of families feel that they are stressed out and 
overstressed. They do not have an option. The options have been 
taken away from them by this government. It does not seem to 
understand that the simple answer, and not just the simple but the 
correct answer, to what it would like to say is a very complex issue 
is a very obvious set of guidelines and priorities that can change 
and turn this whole problem on its head and give families the stress 
relief they deserve.
<P>
	This is what Reform's fresh start would emphasize if we were 
giving the throne speech today. First, we would acknowledged the 
problem which is that because of social and economic changes 
many families are facing high debt, stress, bankruptcy and burnout. 
A reform government will recognize the value of families as the 
most important building block in our society so they can spend less 
time under pressure and more time with those they care about the 
most. That should have been the guiding principle, the 
acknowledgement of the problem, so that we could get on with 
solving problems that families feel need to be addressed and should 
have been addressed in the throne speech.
<P>
	This is our commitment to the Canadian family. A Reform 
government would make families a priority and ensure that 
government policies and regulations are family friendly.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Second, extend the $3,000 to $5,000 child care deduction to all 
parents, including those who are there for their children at home.
<P>
	Third, increase the spousal amount from $5,300 to $7,900 thus 
levelling the playing field for parents who choose to stay at home 
to look after young children and helping families meet the needs of 
a more demanding economy. In other words, increasing the spousal 
deduction will put more dollars in their pockets so they can look 
after their families in whatever way they feel necessary.
<P>
	Fourth, help provinces and local governments ensure that 
deadbeat parents live up to their responsibilities to support their 
children when families break down. Reform will ensure that 
agreements concerning access to children are also respected and 
enforced. When families break down, an unfortunate thing that 
happens in society from time to time, Reform wants to make sure 
that deadbeat parents fulfil their obligations to their children and do 
not try to skirt around their obligations. It is not only a moral 
obligation but Reform wants to make it a moral obligation to 
support those kids.
<P>
	Fifth, Reform would enact a zero tolerance policy on family 
violence.
<P>
	Sixth, crack down on child prostitution and child pornography.
<P>
	Reform wants to make families a priority. It should have been a 
priority in the throne speech, and it will certainly be a priority 
under a Reform government.
<P>
	Reform believes that the strongest social programs to be had are 
policies to create and to build strong families. With a strong family 
all the other problems, many of which are dealt with here by 
legislation, go by the by. When there is a strong family that can 
look after themselves, feed the children properly, educate them and 
buy them school supplies, over the course of time those children 
are better educated. They have a lower crime rate, are able to 
concentrate better at school and have the confidence and the 
security that comes from having a family that is not stressed out 
completely. That is why families need and should have a higher 
priority than the government has given them to date.
<P>
	I would argue that time spent with your family is not a luxury 
that should be enjoyed by a few or by a fluke of birth or whatever. 
Family time is essential time whether you are talking economically 
or psychologically or crime prevention or literacy rates. Families 
that spend time together can address most societal problems within 
their own family structure.
<P>
	I would argue that parenting has real value and the government 
should recognize this as well. It is often said that children are our 
country's future. It is a phrase that is thrown out at every 
opportunity but it is true. Policies  and programs of governments 
need to reflect the truth: we are concerned about parenting and we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6274"> 6274 </A></B>
<P>
want to make sure that it is possible for families to have and 
recognize the value of that parenting skill.
<P>
	That is why Reform places such an emphasis on tax relief for 
people raising children. People raising children have increased 
expenses and increased needs. Why not allow the policies and 
programs to reflect that? Why not increase the spousal allowance 
so that people who are raising children do not have to send the 
government money? They can keep that money to look after their 
families.
<P>
	Why should we not say that all people who have children, 
whether they put them in a government run day care, whether 
grandma is looking after the kids or whether they look after them in 
their own home, deserve a pat on the back and encouragement. 
Some of that should come from the tax man. In other words, they 
deserve some tax relief that is targeted toward recognizing that 
parenting has real value and that good parenting is the key to a 
strong society in the 21st century.
<P>
	That is why Reformers say the child care deduction of $3,000 to 
$5,000 should be given to all people regardless of their choice of 
child care, whether it is institutional care, at home, with a 
neighbour, through a pooling of resources or with grandma. It does 
not matter. When you are raising children you need resources. 
Those resources should not just be made available to people who 
are able to hire a nanny. Those resources should be made available 
to them when they have children. That should be the criterion. It 
should not be the criterion of a government program.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	We believe that if these resources are given to parents they will 
be able to make better use of them than if those same resources 
were shipped off to Ottawa and people hoped against hope the 
program that was delivered in a neighbourhood might actually be 
of some use to them.
<P>
	There is an old saying that governments take the people's money, 
deduct 50 per cent for handling and then give back services the 
people never asked for nor wanted. That should stop. The services 
that parents want to provide for their families, if the resources were 
left in their hands, could be provided. They could provide for the 
needs of their children better than the federal government.
<P>
	There are some things we need to do to reassure families about 
their future security. We have to have zero tolerance toward family 
violence. As have many hon. members, I have had people in my 
office telling me terrible stories about spousal abuse, family abuse, 
child abuse and so on. Each story is sad and sickening. I have zero 
tolerance for it and so should government policy.
<P>
	That is why family assault should be made a separate and more 
serious offence under the Criminal Code. Those who abuse the trust 
of people need to be in a special category, a category which is more 
severe. Those people have broken a trust and have destroyed, 
perhaps forever, a child's security. It should not be tolerated. There 
should be zero tolerance for that.
<P>
	We also want to enforce and strengthen peace bonds and 
restraining orders toward those who have shown a tendency for 
violence or who have threatened family members.
<P>
	Finally, we want to make effective counselling programs a part 
of any sentence for family assault.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier some of the other things that families 
deserve.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you approach half a century on this earth, as you 
get toward a very serious plateau in your own life, you will 
recognize the need to place emphasis on the family. I will allow my 
colleague to elaborate on that. As you head into your second half 
century, I know, Mr. Speaker, that you will listen kindly to his 
remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we heard some very interesting comments from the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I was wondering if he has some other statistics. I think I heard at 
one time that some polling company came out with a statistic 
which told us how many mums or dads would love to stay home to 
look after their small children. If that was feasible financially, how 
does he feel about that?
<P>
	When I was in Winnipeg I had the privilege of attending a 
meeting of the Standing Committee on Health. An RCMP officer 
brought out a very interesting fact. He said that they had found it a 
lot easier to build a good kid than to fix a broken adult.
<P>
	When we spend billions and billions of dollars on the justice 
system, would the hon. member not agree that this would be money 
very well spent if it was directed toward the parenting of young 
children?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are statistics to back up all of the 
things I mentioned today, for example, that children who come 
from a secure home have lower rates of crime, have higher levels of 
literacy and education and have better health. The statistics go on 
and on.
<P>
	It is true that over 50 per cent of parents say that while their 
children are young they would prefer, if financially possible, to 
have one of the parents stay at home to be the chief provider for 
those children. In other words, they would train them, teach them, 
spend time with them, build security into their lives, pass on family 
values, show them right from wrong and so on. They feel that is a 
valuable asset and a valuable contribution.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6275"> 6275 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	That is why the tax proposals that Reform has come up with, 
especially for low income families, will lower the tax burden by 89 
per cent for families making less than $30,000 a year. Just think of 
it. I am not going to spend any time worrying about those who can 
hire a nanny. They have made their priority choices in life and I 
guess they have a lot of money.
<P>
	However, if those who are just on the cusp, just barely able to 
make it, were told that the choices were a little more flexible 
because if they are making $30,000 a year as a couple it maybe 
means that one person is working at a minimum wage job and the 
other is working part time, and I told them that their tax rate would 
be lowered by 89 per cent, it would mean that they would be 
virtually paying no taxes. If they are making $30,000 a year it is not 
a lot of money. They need all that money to raise their family.
<P>
	A family of four earning $30,000 a year is on the poverty line. 
Imagine if they got their pay cheque and where today it says 
deductions for income tax sent off to Ottawa, never to be seen again 
it seems. Twenty per cent or 30 per cent is deducted for taxes. 
Would it not be wonderful if they saw instead the column said zero 
and all the money they earned, they got to take home to spend on 
their families the way they saw fit? I think if Canadian families 
were asked who knows better where the money should be spent, 
most people would say they know the needs in their own homes. 
They would be able to provide for their children. They have the 
best interests of their children at heart and they know that given a 
good shot at it, an ability to hang onto their funds they would be 
able to do a better job than the bureaucrats in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, normally 
when I start a speech I say how privileged I am to join in the debate. 
But let us remember that this is, after all, November 1996 and we 
are debating the throne speech that was tabled on February 27, 
1996 approximately eight months ago. Throne speeches are when 
the government lays out its mandate and desires, what it wants to 
achieve on behalf of the nation. Unfortunately, over the years they 
have become perfunctory statements that are bland, wide-ranging 
and have very little meaning or substance.
<P>
	The speech we are debating in November 1996 and was tabled in 
February 27, 1996, is bland, wide-ranging, says nothing specific. I 
cannot imagine why we are debating this seven months after the 
fact rather than talking about specific legislation emanating from 
the speech. The answer unfortunately is somewhat obvious. It is 
because the government likes these bland, innocuous statements 
rather than serious legislation to fix the problems that are facing 
Canadians today.
<P>
	Members have heard the Reform Party talk about the one in four 
people in this country who either do not have  a job, are looking for 
a job, or are concerned about their job because they feel that their 
jobs may be in jeopardy. We were talking about that in the House in 
question period less than two hours ago. The finances of a major 
employer in western Canada are in serious trouble and many jobs 
are potentially on the line. The government says: ``It is not our 
problem at this point, '' yet it ran on a policy of jobs, jobs, jobs. It 
seems rather strange to me that it continues to spout the mantra 
without delivering on any of the goods.
<P>
	This is the lack of vision of the Liberal Party that the Reform 
Party has railed against for the years that we have been in 
existence. In the section ``Ensuring Opportunity: A Strong 
Economy'' of the throne speech it is stated: ``The government will 
work with the private sector and the provinces to make the 
collective investments required to produce hope, growth and jobs''.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We have not seen any tax reduction. The deficit continues to 
cause the government to borrow more money. The total debt is 
rising. It will soon be $600 billion. Yet, we have talked in this 
House in the last few weeks and have been critical of the 
government because it has given a company in Montreal, 
Bombardier, $87 million interest free.
<P>
	Surely, that must be what the Liberals were talking about when 
they said they would work with the private sector and the provinces 
in their collective investments to produce hope, growth and jobs. I 
am concerned about the logic. It is the ordinary taxpayers, the 
people who work hard every day and remember that one in four of 
them are concerned about their jobs, who have to pay taxes to the 
Government of Canada because the government had to borrow $87 
million which the government lent to Bombardier interest free.
<P>
	Bombardier is a large and successful company with an 
international reputation. It has factories in production around the 
world. We are proud of Bombardier. We are proud of a Canadian 
success. But why do we have to be so proud of our Canadian 
success that we have to go to the ordinary Canadian in the street 
and say: ``Can you spare a little more in taxes to pay the interest on 
the money we are going to borrow so Bombardier can have an 
interest free loan of $87 million?'' That does not make sense. If 
that is the only thing the government had in mind in this line in the 
throne speech about collective investments with the private sector 
and the provinces, surely we expected a lot better.
<P>
	Remember that the government's line was jobs, jobs, jobs. Here 
we are today, three years into the mandate and an election starting 
to loom on the horizon. I can see the next election being on the 
theme: ``We didn't do it last time but this time it is going to be job, 
jobs, jobs. Trust us. We are going to deliver''. That line is wearing 
thin. I doubt very much that Canadians will believe the Liberal  
Party this time if it runs on a policy of jobs, jobs, jobs. It does not 
wash.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6276"> 6276 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the section on trade: ``The government will continue 
efforts to expand NAFTA and will work toward more world trade 
liberalization. Where there are trade disputes, the government will 
spare no effort to promote and defend legitimate trade rights and 
interests''. Nice words. Remember that the Liberals in opposition 
said: ``Scrap NAFTA. We do not want anything to do with it''. In 
the last election, they said they were going to amend it to make sure 
that it fit their philosophy.
<P>
	As we can see, the Liberals have already moved a long way to 
acquiescence. After they won the election, they just said: ``Where 
do we sign? Show us the dotted line for NAFTA''. According to the 
throne speech, they are continuing efforts to expand NAFTA and 
work toward trade liberalization. My goodness, how they change 
when they get into power.
<P>
	Of course in the next line the Liberals talk about promoting and 
defending legitimate Canadian trade rights. We had it right here 
today. The softwood lumber disputes should have gone to the 
World Trade Organization for a complete, satisfactory and final 
resolution but the minister stood up and said: ``We got an 
agreement for five years. Isn't this neat and wonderful?''
<P>
	We open the newspaper and find out jobs have been lost in rural 
Ontario. We find out jobs have been lost in rural Alberta. We find 
out that jobs have been lost in British Columbia. We wonder what 
the government really means when it talks about defending 
legitimate Canadian trade rights and jobs, jobs, jobs. We could go 
on all day.
<P>
	How about the public pension plan. ``The public pension system 
will be there to support people in their old age'', the Liberals said in 
the throne speech. Within a few weeks thereafter, the Minister of 
Finance stood up in this House and said that universality for seniors 
is right out the window.
<P>
	There will be no more old age security in 2001. There will be no 
more guaranteed income supplement in the year 2001. The first 
thousand dollars of pension income tax free is out the window. The 
age exemption that every senior has enjoyed as a tax reduction on 
their tax return is out the window.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Instead anybody with any reasonable income of any kind is 
going to have a 20 per cent additional surtax applied as a clawback 
on top of normal taxation. If they are in the higher tax brackets 
their total payment marginal rate to the government can get as high 
as 75 per cent. And universality is out the window.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Finance stand up and say that in this House? 
No. He couched it in nice and wonderful  language much like the 
throne speech and said: ``Don't worry, be happy. If you can look 
after yourself, good, because we cannot afford to do it for you. The 
Canada pension plan is in trouble. We are going to soak the 
working people. We are going to take it back from the retired 
people. We are going to put the excess in our own jeans rather than 
saving the Canada pension plan''.
<P>
	That is what we found out in the throne speech. We are still 
waiting for the legislation. Eight months later and we are still 
talking about the throne speech. Surely Canadians deserve better. 
They do deserve better and it is outlined in the fresh start program 
of the Reform Party that we introduced a few weeks ago.
<P>
	Rather than taxing seniors more, we are going to give a tax break 
to every Canadian after the budget is balanced. After the budget is 
balanced. Please note that we want that job done first and then we 
will talk about tax breaks. We have laid these things out.
<P>
	We are going to cut unemployment insurance for employers to 
create jobs so that they pay the same rate as the employees, a 28 per 
cent cut. It is going to take this huge surplus in the UI fund and put 
it right back into the employers' hands because they are the people 
who create jobs.
<P>
	We are going to cut the capital gains rate for the entrepreneurs to 
give them the incentive to create jobs.
<P>
	We are going to talk about giving every family the opportunity 
for a deduction for their children in lieu of saying only if their kids 
are in day care can they claim a tax deduction and therefore they 
have no choice if they want to reduce their taxes but to put their 
kids in day care. We want to recognize that it is the parents who 
choose how to bring up their children. It is not tax policy that 
dictates how parents shall bring up their children.
<P>
	These are the things we have introduced in our fresh start 
program. This fresh start is a new vision of Canada compared to the 
no vision, the bland statements that are still bland statements eight 
months later. They were introduced on February 27, 1996 and 
today in November 1996 they have not moved forward one single 
inch.
<P>
	Let that record speak for itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say publicly that I congratulate you on your appointment to 
the Chair.
<P>
	I want to make a couple of observations pursuant to what the 
hon. member has just said. I think all of us would agree that when 
MPs come to Ottawa one of the most serious and one of the most 
grave responsibilities they have is to maintain national unity. The 
last thing we should do is to try to play one province off against 
another or one region off against another.
<P>
	Over and over again that is what the Reform Party does. They 
shirk that responsibility. They love this game  of playing one region 
off against another. In the last few days they have raised the loan to 
Bombardier and they somehow leave the impression that there is a 
game of favouritism going on here and that Quebec or the city of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6277"> 6277 </A></B>
<P>
Montreal is being favoured over some other city, some other 
province, some other region. Nothing could be further from the 
truth.
<P>
	It is noted very well on this side of the House that those members 
in the Reform Party never mention anything about what the federal 
government has done to support Calgary's bid for the exposition in 
2005. The federal government has done everything possible to 
ensure that the exposition in 2005 comes to the city of Calgary. It 
has nothing to do with the fact that Calgary is Calgary or that it is in 
the province of Alberta or in the region called the west. It is a 
Canadian city. It belongs to all of us, as does Montreal, as does 
Winnipeg, as does Halifax. And this federal government has a 
responsibility to support that bid.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	My city of Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba is getting the 
PanAm Games in 1999. The federal government is supporting that 
project to the tune of about $40 million. Do we hear that from the 
Reform Party? No. We do not hear that from the Reform Party. The 
Reform Party would rather talk about a loan to Bombardier because 
that somehow conjures up an image that Quebec is getting 
something and the west is not.
<P>
	I am from the west and I am sick and tired of that kind of game 
which divides this country. It is a game that should stop. 
Responsible members of the House of Commons would not indulge 
in that kind of talk. It is injurious to this country. It is very injurious 
and the sooner we stop it, the better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that was feigned outrage by 
the member who is from Winnipeg and from the west.
<P>
	I do hope since he is from Winnipeg that he stood up and spoke 
loudly and at length, that he shouted from the rooftops when the 
CF-18 contract was taken from Winnipeg and given to another part 
of the country. Everyone knows that Winnipeg was a better bid, a 
cheaper bid, yet the people in Winnipeg, in his hometown, were 
denied that contract.
<P>
	I am glad he raised the issue of unity. There was a referendum in 
the province of Quebec a year ago last week that we came within 
half an inch of losing. Why? Because this government sat and did 
nothing through the entire campaign. It sat on the sidelines and 
watched the country almost disintegrate because it had no policy 
whatsoever to deal with that situation.
<P>
	While the member for Winnipeg St. James talks about the 
Reform Party and its policies, I have heard nothing about his 
defending the motion to create a distinct society for part of this 
country which was introduced last December in this House. In 
many parts of the country, including Alberta where I am from, that 
type of issue would not even be contemplated. Yet it was 
introduced in this House by his government to divide this country 
because the west does not like that particular phrase.
<P>
	The member has the gall to accuse the Reform Party of divisive 
policies when we see the government he represents standing by 
without any governance whatsoever and allowing this country to 
fail both in unity and through the fact that we now have a $600 
billion debt hanging around our necks, courtesy of that 
government. That type of thing must stop and a fresh start Reform 
policy will do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too will share my time 
with a colleague. I would also like to congratulate you on your 
appointment, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I am also happy to participate in this debate, even though we are 
speaking about the throne speech that was delivered on February 
27, 1996.
<P>
	The very fact that we are still discussing the throne speech eight 
months later shows the importance of this document. I see the 
throne speech as a kind of business plan for the government. The 
fact that we are still debating this business plan shows how 
important it is.
<P>
	With your permission, I will not go over the whole plan but, as 
my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public 
Works, pointed out, I will address the part of the throne speech 
dealing with national unity.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Notwithstanding the actions we took in the weeks following the 
referendum, there remains some confusion, especially in Quebec, 
on the various measures our government took to try to settle the 
basic issue of Canadian unity.
<P>
	There are obstacles, but I listened with interest to the comments 
made about the throne speech by members of the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Reform Party, who, I must point out, were nowhere to be 
seen during the referendum debate. Today, they claim to be 
concerned about Canadian unity. That is not true. If they were 
really concerned about Canadian unity, instead of criticizing our 
government day in and day out and making no proposals to advance 
the debate on Canadian unity, they would have expended their 
energy on settling the matter and especially on trying to convince 
our colleagues and fellow citizens in western Canada to make an 
effort to understand a little better what Quebec has been seeking for 
so long.
<P>
	It was clearly specified in the throne speech.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6278"> 6278 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We were very clear in the speech from the throne what this 
government wanted to do. The Reform Party member who spoke 
prior to me stated that we have no vision of Canada, that we have 
no plan for Canada. Nothing could be further from the truth. I 
question, based on his intervention, whether he even took the time 
to read the speech from the throne.
<P>
	As I said in French, the speech from the throne is a blueprint of 
where our government wants to take this country. In the speech 
from the throne we talk about modernizing the federation. More 
important, we talk about the different areas of responsibilities that 
our government is willing to withdraw from.
<P>
	I want to quote from the speech from the throne concerning the 
areas which have been a sore point for most provinces. The throne 
speech states: ``The government will not use its spending power to 
create new shared cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction without the consent of the majority of the provinces, 
and any new program will be designed so that non-participating 
provinces will be compensated provided they establish similar 
programs in their province''.
<P>
	In the province of Quebec this has been a very sore point for 
many years. Traditional past governments, in order to penetrate or 
impede on some provincial jurisdiction, would through their 
spending powers introduce their own programs and thereby bypass 
the province totally.
<P>
	Our government was clear. We wrote it down. We stated that we 
will no longer do that. Why? We feel we have to work with the 
provinces because they are our partners. We cannot always look at 
the other levels of government as our enemies. If we are going to 
get Canada back on track, as we have done over the past two or 
three years, of which I am very proud, we are going to have to take 
new initiatives and work with the provinces.
<P>
	We also stated in the speech from the throne that the government 
will work the provinces and Canadians to develop agreed upon 
values and principles to underlie the social union and to explore 
new approaches to decision making in social policies. That is very 
clear.
<P>
	The Reform Party says we do not want to do anything and that 
we are not working with the provinces. The newly appointed 
Minister of Human Resources Development has spent a 
considerable amount of time, as did his predecessors, in 
negotiating manpower training with the provinces. It is a long 
process, but we made the ground rules and the blueprints in our 
speech from the throne which lay out very clearly where we are 
headed.
<P>
	In essence, what we are saying is: ``Hey, provinces, we are 
willing to work with you. Let us sit down and define which level of 
government is best able to deliver the services''. After all, there is 
only one taxpayer in this country. Whether it is a municipal 
government, a provincial government, a federal government or 
even a school board, there is still only one taxpayer. Quite often 
these levels ignore that fact.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	What we are saying is that we should look at the powers. We are 
looking at the responsibilities. We said it again in the speech from 
the throne. The government is prepared to withdraw totally from 
some sectors.
<P>
	The government is going to withdraw from manpower training. 
That is well under way and in the province of Quebec it has been 
accepted with open arms. The government is also willing to 
withdraw from areas such as social housing, mining, sports and 
recreation.
<P>
	The government has worked with the provinces on these matters, 
but there are probably some jurisdictions that it needs to retain, 
such as the environment. Obviously, pollution does not stop at a 
provincial border. The rivers which are polluted do not stop at a 
provincial border. The federal government still has to be 
responsible to a certain degree.
<P>
	Tourism and food inspection are two others areas in which the 
federal government is willing to work with the provinces.
<P>
	What we said in the speech from the throne is that we are 
prepared to renew the federation. It is incumbent-and the proof is 
in the longevity of our beautiful country-on every generation to 
look at Canada and to mould it for its needs and for the needs of 
future generations. That is what our blueprint states.
<P>
	I would like to touch on the different things that we have done to 
respond to the commitments made by our Prime Minister in the 
weeks preceding the referendum. Again, most people seem to have 
forgotten them rather quickly.
<P>
	During the referendum we promised that we would transfer 
manpower training to the provinces. We have done that. We 
delivered on that promise.
<P>
	We promised to recognize regional vetoes. I recall very vividly 
that debate. I was out west at that point in time. I remember that 
British Columbians felt they were a separate area and that they 
should be recognized as a region. Our government listened. Instead 
of creating four regional vetoes, we went ahead and recognized five 
regional vetoes. We gave all the regions a veto. Quebec, after all, is 
the only province that had constitutional change imposed on it 
against its will.
<P>
	I have one minute left. I will take that very important minute to 
appeal to my western colleagues to work with our government. 
They can use whatever phrase they want. The Liberal Party chose 
to use distinct society. Let us try to work together to recognize the 
distinct reality of Quebec. One has to be blind not to recognize that  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6279"> 6279 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec has a different language and a different culture. Let us 
work together to enshrine that in the Constitution.
<P>
	Yes, we did make exceptions for provinces. British Columbia, 
for example, in order to join Confederation, required that the 
national railway be built. In 1892 that dream was realized. Where 
would British Columbia be today if that dream had never been 
fulfilled?
<P>
	If there were only eight residents on Prince Edward Island, all 
eight would either be senators or members of Parliament. We 
recognize that even a small province can contribute to Canada.
<P>
	I make an appeal to the premiers of the provinces to work with 
our government. I make an appeal for all parties to work with our 
government to solve the Canadian unity problem once and for all.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question or two for the hon. member for Vaudreuil, one of those 
members who have frequently raised the fact that political 
uncertainty was disastrous for Quebec in terms of attracting 
investments in the province.
<P>
	I should point out to him that, just today, an announcement was 
made that a Swedish company will be investing $300 million in 
pharmaceutical research in the Montreal area, probably in or 
around my riding.
<P>
	If political uncertainty has such a disastrous effect-and perhaps 
he could address this in his response-it certainly is not political 
uncertainty caused by separatists, as he puts it, that adversely 
affects investment.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I would say that the Liberal government's attitude is much more 
detrimental. On November 5, Claude Piché wrote in <I>La Presse</I> that 
it was strictly an irrational excuse on the part of the Liberals to 
claim that investments were not coming in as they should in 
Quebec because of the political uncertainty caused by the 
separatists, when in fact it was just the opposite.
<P>
	The problem is due to the fact that the federal government itself 
would have everyone believe that the lack of investment is due to 
political uncertainty and the sovereignist cause.
<P>
	It is absolutely not true and I would like him to say so, because, 
if he is serious about wanting to help the people he represents-I 
think he speaks mainly for the people of Montreal and Quebec, 
given that he was elected by the people of Quebec-perhaps he 
should stop talking about political uncertainty and start creating an 
atmosphere to counter such a perception by investors, because this 
is strictly a matter of perception.
<P>
	The perception does not match the reality. There is no survey 
indicating that political uncertainty in Quebec adversely affects 
investment. He should say do publicly-I sincerely hope he 
will-if he is serious about wanting to help the people of Montreal. 
That is my first point.
<P>
	My second is the Bombardier investment issue, that the hon. 
members from western Canada keep raising. The problem, really, 
is the way the Liberals have announced it. The Prime Minister 
himself came to Montreal to announce that he was lending $87 
million to Bombardier.
<P>
	In fact, it is a loan equivalent to about six or seven million 
dollars per year, over a few years. As far as I know, never before 
has a Prime Minister made a trip with his ministers to announce 
with great pomp annual subsidies of $7 million to a major company 
such as Bombardier, when the economic spin-offs will be much 
greater than the $7 million in question.
<P>
	The problem that westerners face has to do with the way the 
Liberals came with great pomp to Montreal to announce what was 
in fact a loan of $87 million. It is a loan and this is fine. I have 
nothing against it.
<P>
	The problem is the way it was announced. The government 
misled people from the west by making them believe it was a huge 
subsidy, but it is not the case. I would appreciate it if the hon. 
member for Vaudreuil would explain it, to correct the false 
impression created by the fact that the Prime Minister came with 
great pomp and that the Minister of Industry said the government 
was giving $87 million. The government is not giving $87 million: 
it will give about $7 million per year, taking interest rates into 
account, for a few years. The hon. member should set the record 
straight.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member for Vaudreuil to 
provide a brief response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not have time to deal with the 
two questions in a brief response. I will discuss the issue of 
political uncertainty and its effect on the economy of Montreal and 
of the province as a whole.
<P>
	The member for Longueuil only has to walk or drive through the 
streets of Montreal to see the devastating effects that this region 
has had to put up with for a long time. I am proud of the measures 
recently announced by our government to help Montreal's 
economy. It is sad and deplorable that the Quebec premier did not 
invite the federal government to the socio-economic summit. If he 
cared about Quebec's interests, he would at least have invited the 
federal government. Yet, Bloc Quebecois members are asking us 
why we do not do more for Montreal.
<P>
	We are not the ones dreaming in technicolour, it is Bloc 
Quebecois members and separatists. The facts speak for 
themselves. Let us take a look at the unemployment rate. It is no 
coincidence. After all, we have the same policies for Quebec as for 
other provinces, and for Montreal as for other major cities. We do 
not devise policies to punish Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6280"> 6280 </A></B>
<P>
	We must ask ourselves why the unemployment rate is two points 
higher in the Montreal region. the Canadian average is around 9.6 
per cent, while the rate for Quebec is 12.6 per cent.
<P>
	Why is it that the uncertainty affects the Quebec and Canadian 
economies indirectly and directly? It is not good for Quebec and it 
is not good for Canada. I hope some day they understand that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Winnipeg St. James will 
have the floor. It is my understanding that the hon. member will be 
speaking for 10 minutes.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleague from Vaudreuil for allowing me to 
share his time in reply to the throne speech. I would like to pledge 
my co-operation to my hon. colleague from Vaudreuil as he makes 
every effort to strengthen Quebec's position and place in this 
federation.
<P>
	I have recognized in working in the national capital as a federal 
member of Parliament that we are all family and we are all 
Canadians. Quebecers are as much Canadians as Albertans or as 
Manitobans. We are all family. We have our own peculiar problems 
and our own unique concerns. All of us have a responsibility to 
work together so we can tackle these problems wherever they 
might be found, in Quebec, British Colombia or wherever.
<P>
	We know that the economy of the province of Quebec is in 
serious trouble, especially on the island of Montreal. We as good 
Canadians should do everything possible to revive that economy. 
The stronger the Quebec economy is, the stronger our national 
economy is. That applies to every province and region in the 
country.
<P>
	The member from Vaudreuil mentioned that the 1996 throne 
speech had a vision of renewing the federation, and that is very 
true. Its main thrust was renewing the federation. Renewing the 
federation comes in many manifestations. For example, getting our 
fiscal house in order was and is part of that vision. Cleaning up the 
fiscal mess in the national capital is part of that vision. Without 
stabilizing the government and our national finances, everything 
else is put into question, everything else is put at risk. As part of 
that vision, as enunciated in the throne speech, it was so important 
to talk about and to address this problem of our national fiscal 
situation.
<P>
	When this government came to office in the fall of 1993 the 
deficit was in excess of $40 billion, maybe even in excess of $45 
billion. That is a lot of money. Something had to be done because 
without addressing that deficit, other things that this government 
wanted to do would not be possible. So our finance minister went to  
work aggressively and established a course that he has followed. 
He has followed that course assiduously and without any deviation. 
In that process and by not deviating he has established credibility. 
When he sets out to do something, he means it.
<P>
	He started with a target to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of the 
gross domestic product, and he has done that. He has now reset his 
target at 2 per cent, and it is not going to be long before it will be 1 
per cent of the GDP. It will not be that long before there is no 
deficit at all.
<P>
	Not only is the deficit being brought down quite rapidly but in 
the process the debt is being tackled. The finance minister 
announced a few days ago that come fiscal year 1998 there will no 
longer be a need for borrowing new money. That is success.
<P>
	The debt is far too high, in the neighbourhood of $600 billion. 
Our interest charges are neighbouring $50 billion and that is far too 
much and has to be brought under control.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	However, the finance minister has established credibility. He has 
shown that he can get the job done, and Canadians believe him and 
support him. I know it is going to be done. As a result of his doing a 
good job interest rates have come down to the lowest we have seen 
in almost 40 years. Our interest rates are lower than those in the 
United States. With interest rates as low as they are it makes buying 
a car a possibility, a probability. It means more and more 
Canadians are able to buy new homes or repair their homes or get a 
mortgage because of the low interest rates. We have had 
considerable success on that financial front.
<P>
	That was part of the vision as outlined in the 1996 throne speech. 
However, there was far more to that vision than just cleaning up the 
fiscal mess. The throne speech mentioned technology partnerships. 
Nowadays it seems that wherever we turn we are confronted with 
new technologies. It is part of globalization and part of the new 
world order, technology and computers. For a lot of us who were 
raised a good many years ago, a lot of this new technology is 
perhaps beyond us. However, this government realizes that we are 
in a new technological world and we had better observe the 
necessities of the new technological age.
<P>
	That is why the Minister of Industry has worked very 
aggressively on working with technology firms. Through his good 
work he has developed all kinds of technology partnerships. The 
government has contributed about $250 million toward technology 
partnerships. That will further technological innovation and it will 
strengthen the economy. It means creating jobs, which is being 
done already.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the unacceptable unemployment rate in this 
country, a lot of new jobs are being created, especially in 
technology firms. This government has created over 600,000 jobs 
and I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6281"> 6281 </A></B>
<P>
expect better things to come. I expect those better things to come as 
early next year, 1997.
<P>
	Also part of the throne speech vision was youth services. The 
government has found additional money for youth services. Right 
now there are about 35,000 Canadian youths involved in 
apprenticeship programs which is a real opportunity for young 
people to move from secondary education, high school and other 
educational institutions into the workplace. It is an ideal 
opportunity for young people to make the transition from their 
lives of education to the workplace. I believe our youth policy is 
working.
<P>
	Maintaining medicare is part of the vision of the throne speech. 
Canadians believe very strongly in medicare and want this 
government to maintain it. I can assure members that we are going 
to maintain it and adhere to the five basic principles of the 
medicare system. We are not going to let the medicare system slip 
away.
<P>
	It should be observed that in the last budget brought down by the 
finance minister he put a so-called cash floor so that the support for 
medicare would be maintained.
<P>
	I could go on and on but I know I am out of time. However, I 
think the throne speech of 1996 has a well rounded vision. It is 
about renewing the federation. It is about strengthening the 
government. It is about getting government right. It is about 
serving Canadians much better than they have been in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been sitting here all afternoon listening to the 
various statements and comments with regard to the throne speech 
and I have a few comments of my own.
<P>
	I was a teacher, before I came to this House, for almost 25. I have 
been a parent for almost all that time. I have met people from 
across the entire country since coming here and previously and a 
lot of the remarks that I have today in response to all the speakers 
who have been on this afternoon come from that.
<P>
	There is one group of people in this country that I think is the key 
to the future. Despite all the rhetoric we hear, the government gives 
the impression that children come first but its policies and its 
legislation contradict this. That group of people that I think we 
must consider first and foremost in all the things we do is our 
children.
<P>
	Liberal crime bills are very often merely job creation programs 
for lawyers. Liberal tax policies have forced both parents out of the 
home in order to avoid poverty. Liberal social engineering 
programs cause education, health, justice and social program costs 
to escalate. But the most horrific aspect of the Liberal policies, and 
the throne speech is an example of that, is they cause violent crime 
to increase, and our kids will pay a terrible cost.
<P>
	What is the best crime prevention strategy that we could 
implement? It is simply to give children back their parents. This is 
the basis of Reform's fresh start family issues policy.
<P>
	Let us look at education. The first and best teacher a child could 
ever have is a loving, caring parent. If we look at justice the best 
strategy for preventing violent crime is one that encourages 
bonding between a child and a parent. If we look at health care, the 
best health care program is one that starts at home with proper 
emotional development. If we look at social programs, the best 
social program is one in which taxes are lowered to the point where 
one job will provide for the needs of the family. It is common 
sense. It is simple.
<P>
	When voters examine our fresh start platform they will see that 
Reform is the family friendly party. The party that puts kids first 
will do more to make society safer, improve health and education 
and reduce social program costs than all the big Liberal spending 
programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I found the hon. member's remarks 
interesting. I wish I could believe everything he has been saying. 
On the one hand he talks about the Reform Party being a family 
friendly party. Yet day in and day out in this House what do 
members of the Reform Party talk about? They talk about the 
criminal justice system. They talk about the spectacular cases that 
come up from time to time. They tell the government how we have 
to get tough on the young people of today, that we have to throw 
them into jail, that we have to lock the jail doors and throw the key 
away.
<P>
	What the Reform Party talks about is all we have to do when it 
comes to youth crime is just write another law, add an amendment 
to the Young Offenders Act. We do not have to strengthen families. 
We do not have to help families that find themselves in a 
dysfunctional way. Oh no, just write a law and strengthen the 
justice system and maybe get rid of the Young Offenders Act. Not 
only that, but maybe we can even start charging young kids of nine 
and ten years of age with crimes.
<P>
	That is what members of the Reform Party talk about.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Reformers do that every day in this House, and now the member 
for Yorkton-Melville comes along and says that his party is a 
family friendly party. I have two words: get serious.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to the address in reply to the throne speech, although I find it 
a bit odd to do so now, since the speech was given on February 27, 
1996 and it is now mid-November. I suppose the government, 
which controls the program in this House, did not want us speaking 
about the throne speech when it realized it had not met the 
objectives it set for itself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6282"> 6282 </A></B>
<P>
	I have been here for 12 years, and although I do not recall what 
happened other years, it seems to me it has taken a while to get 
to the throne speech. If we had spoken about it in March, April, 
May perhaps, I would understand. But it is now November. My 
birthday is November 15 and I did not think I would be speaking 
about it so close to my birthday. I would have liked to speak about 
it much earlier.
<P>
	The throne speech dealt with research and development, science 
and technology. The government said it would take steps to 
improve promotion of science and technology, and research and 
development in order to encourage job creation. It also said it 
would pay particular attention to the political uncertainty hanging 
over Quebec.
<P>
	It also talked about improving free trade with the United States 
and Mexico, and mentioned NAFTA and a climate favourable to 
economic growth. These were the main points covered in the 
throne speech. Unfortunately, this is not exactly what is being 
done.
<P>
	With respect to research and development, this morning I 
listened to experts and representatives of certain departments and 
Canadian institutions appearing before the industry committee. 
They seemed quite discouraged by the fact that the government was 
reducing research and development budgets. In my view and in the 
view of a number of people who know a little bit about economy 
and a country's economic performance, research and development 
is vital. It is something that must not be neglected.
<P>
	We must always keep a keen eye on a government's obligations 
regarding education, training, research, and assistance to 
businesses so that we can operate more economically and be more 
productive. All this concerns the production environment in a 
capitalist system like the one in which we live.
<P>
	People need training in order to be more effective. They need to 
be healthier, better educated. There must be more applied research 
that is more closely related to business needs. The purpose of all 
this is to provide a better standard of living for Quebec and for 
Canada.
<P>
	This is, however, not what is happening. Since the Liberals have 
been in power, there is more unemployment, more people on 
welfare, things are going from bad to worse. Every day we have to 
motivate people, to give them faith in the future. At the present 
time, there is a little glimmer of hope, a minimal rate of growth.
<P>
	Great attention must be given to everything related to research 
and development, educational levels, health, products, pure 
science, so that we can keep up with the growing international 
competition in the market place.
<P>
	There are some who think that international competition is 
somewhat vulgar, bad capitalism, but it is nonetheless a reality. The 
reality is that we have decided  to open up markets with the United 
States first, and then with Mexico. Now we are trying to open up 
markets with Israel, a small country, but still this demonstrates the 
desire to open up markets.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The countries of Asia and the Pacific have the same desire to 
open up markets in order to communicate, to do business together. 
This seems to me to be a good thing for humanity. The greatest 
opportunities to meet and to dialogue are always available in trade 
and in business.
<P>
	I have seen this in the few trips to Africa I have had the 
opportunity to take. Several of our experts told us that trade was the 
route by which we will manage to get to know each other and to do 
business together. Not in the crass capitalist sense of the word, but 
rather in the sense of having trade exchanges in which the interests 
of all partners are served. And when people's interests are served, 
they make an effort to understand each other and get along better, 
so that gradually, we are better able to live together in peace and 
harmony. We might have fewer wars and fewer conflicts if we are 
more open to the world.
<P>
	Since we know there is an advantage to being open to the world, 
for the reasons I just mentioned, the Canadian government must 
co-operate with business, universities, unions and everybody else, 
whether we are talking about human, scientific or other research, to 
help us draw on the resources we need to develop our own potential 
and help others do that as well, whether we are talking about trade, 
productivity, health care, education, or other sectors. This is all 
very important.
<P>
	The government must also be fair. So far, I can tell you the 
government has not been fair in the way it distributes spending on 
research and development and science and technology among the 
provinces.
<P>
	In 1989, I chaired a committee when I was with the previous 
government in power. It produced a report. At the time, we noticed 
that when officials of Statistics Canada evaluated how federal 
spending on research and development and science and technology 
was distributed, they always excluded the National Capital Region, 
which greatly distorts the results.
<P>
	For instance, if we ask Statistics Canada: ``Are your own 
employees distributed equitably among the provinces?'', Statistics 
Canada answers: ``Yes, we do a good job of distributing our staff''. 
So I asked them in a committee in 1989, and this was quite 
sometime ago: ``How are Statistics Canada employees distributed 
across Canada''? They told me: ``They are very well distributed, 
we have about 150 in Quebec, 185 in Ontario, about 85 in the West 
and 40 or so in the Maritimes''. I said: ``How many employees do 
you have together?'' I was told: ``We have around 4,500 or 5,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6283"> 6283 </A></B>
<P>
employees''. I said: ``Where are the others, I counted  only around 
700 or 800''? They told me: ``The others are in Ottawa''.
<P>
	So there were around 3,500 or 4,000 in Ottawa and furthermore, 
Ontario had 185, and Ottawa is in Ontario.
<P>
	This is just an example. So when Statistics Canada provides 
statistics, they are completely distorted because they exclude the 
National Capital Region, which is concentrated mostly or at least 
80 per cent in Ontario.
<P>
	Imagine what that represents. I did a calculation, and with 
unanimous consent, I shall if I may table this document in the 
House for information purposes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is asking for the unanimous 
consent of the House. Does the hon. member have the consent of 
the House to move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, this shows that the 
Liberals do not want to know the reality and the truth. It is that 
simple. In any case, this has already been made public, but I still 
wanted to table this document and ask the government if it could 
enlighten me about the direction of the changes reflected in this 
document-for the Liberals' information, I will get back to this 
document later-and whether these changes were going in the right 
or the wrong direction.
<P>
	In 1989, I commissioned and participated in a study on science 
and technology. Including the national capital region in the 
statistics is no simple matter. There are some 75 research and 
development programs in science and technology, and about 20 
departments are involved. So for each department and program, we 
had to calculate what the federal government spent in the national 
capital region. This is important. It had been done before, but I had 
never seen the figures, and I wanted to find out for myself. This 
exercise showed us there is no equity.
<P>
	In 1989, Ontario, including the national capital region, received 
$1.9 billion for science and technology, compared to $724 million 
for Quebec. This means that Ontario received $1.2 billion more per 
year than Quebec in federal spending. Even though 36 per cent of 
the population then lived in Ontario, while Quebec's share was 26 
per cent, the difference was enormous.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make earlier, to tie in with research and 
development, is that there was a $700 million discrepancy in that 
area, for a total of almost $2 billion per year in science and 
technology, and research and development.
<P>
	What this means is that Ontario was getting $2 billion more 
every year. I am not saying this only for Ontario,  but for all the 
other Canadian provinces that are disadvantaged by this. A large 
percentage of the $2 billion invested each year on science and 
technology-given how many jobs for scientists and experts there 
are in that area-is spent on salaries.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the economic spinoffs in Ontario. First, 
there are taxes paid on the products, houses and other goods 
purchased in the province. You can imagine the magnitude. I am 
strictly speaking in terms of science and technology, and research 
and development. Two billion dollars generate substantial 
economic spinoffs in a province.
<P>
	That is precisely why, a few years ago, I had suggested that the 
national capital region be considered a province in that respect and 
that the federal government keep the taxes collected in the region. 
It would have been fairer. But the government will hear nothing of 
it, because this benefits Ontario greatly. The fact that Ontario has 
always been richer than most Canadian provinces explains the 
presence of the federal government in the national capital region, 
where it spends tremendous amounts of money.
<P>
	This is all explained in the document I wish I could have tabled, 
so that government members could take a look at it, but I will find 
another way to get it to them.
<P>
	This goes to show that, when, in the speech from the throne, the 
government claims to want to be fair and equitable, to encourage 
harmony, to anticipate political uncertainty, it should start by being 
fair and equitable to the provinces, including Quebec, until it 
becomes sovereign.
<P>
	My other point also concerns research and development, as I said 
earlier. By the way, our leader is welcome to come and visit the 
Tokamak facilities in Varennes next week. It is a nuclear fusion 
research centre. The nuclear industry is a clean industry that can be 
established within city limits; it really is tomorrow's source of 
energy. The federal government has decided to withdraw from this 
project.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I invite you to visit the Tokamak project, in Varennes. It is an 
extraordinarily modern facility that is the result of a partnership 
involving Europe, Japan and the United States, and where research 
is conducted on nuclear fusion, a form of energy for the future.
<P>
	Electricity is produced with turbines, and power will come from 
the fusion that generates the heat. It is thousands of times more 
efficient than uranium and other sources of energy. This is not an 
imaginary thing. It is said that this form of energy will be available 
in 10 to 15 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6284"> 6284 </A></B>
<P>
	The materials created and developed through this research allow 
companies from the Montreal region and elsewhere to build high 
performance products that they would not otherwise be able to 
make.
<P>
	The chief executive officer of the company says that a large 
number of products sold are the result of the research conducted at 
Tokamak. This means that financial spin-offs for the federal 
government are greater than the $7 million it is currently investing 
in this program, but does not intend to reinvest next year.
<P>
	I do not know how the federal government does its evaluations 
but, by ending this annual investment of $7 million, it not only 
jeopardizes the very important development of nuclear fusion, it 
also loses potential revenues for itself. This is really a bad 
calculation.
<P>
	It is true that the $7 million invested in nuclear fusion research at 
Tokamak came from the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. AECL 
was competing against Ontario's oil and uranium industries. The 
Minister of Natural Resources said the project was not one of her 
priorities. I realize it is not one of her priorities because she must 
first protect the oil and uranium industries, not this new form of 
energy called nuclear energy.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry should subsidize Tokamak, since he 
does not have to protect other forms of energy. He is neutral in this 
respect. The Minister of Industry should subsidize Tokamak. I am 
making this request in all honesty; I am not playing politics. I 
believe the federal government is making a fundamental mistake 
by ceasing to invest a mere $7 million per year in the Tokamak 
project. This is very important.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about the whole issue of drugs. I 
remember all our efforts to attract medical research investors. We 
worked very hard. That was the first time I saw scientists travel to 
Ottawa to demonstrate against the opposition. There was a 
delegation of close to 200 scientists and researchers, primarily 
from the Montreal area, who came to demonstrate in favour of the 
government and against the opposition, which wanted to block 
passage of Bill C-22 concerning drug research.
<P>
	The Liberals were then in opposition and they vigorously 
opposed the bill. We were calling for the protection of patents. We 
wanted to give some protection to those doing drug research and 
development so that they could justify their investments.
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau had allowed drugs to be copied after five years. 
Companies doing drug research were forced to go out of business. 
Office buildings and research centres, particularly in the Montreal 
area, had to close their doors.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Hundreds of jobs were lost. Hundreds of millions of dollars left 
the country, and the Conservatives of the time wanted to get them 
back. Hundreds of millions of dollars  came back into the country 
to be invested once again in the Montreal area, because there are 
many very competent people doing drug research there.
<P>
	As recently as this morning, we learned that the Swedish 
company Astra is going to invest in the Montreal area. This will be 
the first time that this Swedish company has invested abroad, $300 
million over a ten year period, for drug research.
<P>
	Lately, we have learned to be very wary of the government. I 
have met people who lobby in Ottawa. They are in favour of Bill 
C-22 and C-91. They have doubts about the present Liberal 
government, which intends to reduce the number of years during 
which drugs are protected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to join in the debate this afternoon on the 
speech from the throne. The throne speech outlined many 
initiatives which the government would carry forward this year and 
into the future.
<P>
	It reflected what has been said in the House on many occasions, 
in statements by the Prime Minister and many ministers in the 
House and elsewhere that the number one priority of the 
government was, is and continues to be economic growth and jobs 
for Canadians.
<P>
	One of the most important initiatives in the speech from the 
throne was to get government right, to continue to bring order to 
our financial house and to meet or exceed our deficit reduction 
targets, targets that the government has met or exceeded to date and 
will continue for the balance of this year and for 1997 and 1998, 
reaching a reduced deficit target of $9 billion in fiscal year 
1998-99. This has resulted in the lowest interest rates we have seen 
in the country for decades and at the same time a low rate of 
inflation.
<P>
	It has prompted an increase in small business and industry in 
Canada which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new jobs 
being created. Getting the deficit on a downward trend toward a 
balanced budget and our financial house in order is also the best 
protection for our cherished social programs such as the national 
medicare system and the protection of pensions for those 
Canadians depending on this important made in Canada program.
<P>
	Let me talk a bit about economic growth and the enthusiasm for 
business, industry and the associated jobs with the same in my 
constituency of Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Earlier this summer I had the pleasure of attending the official 
opening of the new, expanded Sabian cymbal plant in the small 
community of Meductic, New Brunswick. This new, enlarged and 
modern facility means an additional 12 to 15 new jobs 
immediately. As a result of these wonderful cymbal producers who 
export  throughout the world and are marketing what is proclaimed 
to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6285"> 6285 </A></B>
<P>
the best or one of the best cymbal products known throughout the 
world is something to take a lot of pride in.
<P>
	Also earlier this past early summer McCain Foods in 
Florenceville, New Brunswick announced the expansion of its data 
processing centre to double its size, meaning another new 30 to 50 
jobs. That is confidence when we see this happening.
<P>
	In Centreville, New Brunswick, another small community in my 
Carleton-Charlotte constituency, Canusa Foods announced and 
began construction of a new potato processing plant, meaning 
another 25 to 30 new jobs that were not there before.
<P>
	In Woodstock, New Brunswick, Penn Papers is expanding its 
processing manufacturing plant which certainly means many new 
jobs.
<P>
	Last week in the village of McAdam, New Brunswick I had the 
opportunity to participate in the announcement that the former 
railway station would be turned over to the community by the 
Southern New Brunswick Railway Company and by the Irving 
family. This is a very picturesque railway station and something of 
which we can be proud as part of our Canadian heritage.
<P>
	What does it mean to the village of McAdam and surrounding 
area? It means that it is the focal point for the tourism industry, and 
I might say year round tourism industry, the focal point for the 
lakes, the beautiful eco-tourism industry of that whole surrounding 
area.
<P>
	Imagine, in a small community, over 800 people came out for the 
official announcement. They had waited years for this to happen. 
This did not just start yesterday. It started many years ago. I 
certainly was delighted to be part of it. What does it mean? It 
means new and additional jobs for that whole region.
<P>
	Briggs and Little in York Mills, New Brunswick is a yarn 
company which is famous across Canada. It will be opening its new 
plant this month which produces woollen yarns that are used in 
products across this country. It will see an additional 25, perhaps 30 
jobs as a result of this opening. It is a new modern plant, with 
modern machinery and modern technology to meet today's 
demands.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	Earlier this week, this very week, I had the opportunity to 
participate in the official opening of Apocan Inc., an antimony 
mine in the Lake George area of New Brunswick. Some 75 new 
direct jobs have been created. The mushrooming effect of this 
antimony mine will produce additional jobs in trucking and other 
services throughout the community.
<P>
	What is antimony? In the very early days it was used in the 
mixture of medicines. Later it was used as a component in the 
production of alloys. While it is still  used to a small extent in those 
areas today, one of its major purposes now is as a fire retardant. It is 
used in many of our homes in such things as draperies, carpeting, 
even in our clothing because of its fire resistant qualities.
<P>
	The projections are that the use of this product will increase at a 
rate of 8 per cent a year for each year in the foreseeable future. 
Therefore I am optimistic that those 75 jobs announced this very 
week will continue to expand to become 100, 150 or 200 jobs in 
future years. They in turn will have the spin-off effect of creating 
jobs in service industries to support them.
<P>
	In St. Stephen the famous Ganong Brothers chocolate plant is 
working at full capacity at the present time. It is working on its 
Christmas production of those famous chocolates that are in 
demand not only in Canada but in many parts of the world.
<P>
	Connors Brothers which operates fish processing and packing 
plants in Blacks Harbour, Back Bay and Seal Cove has certainly 
seen increased production this year and the important jobs 
associated with that.
<P>
	Agriculture, the traditional fishery, aquaculture, forestry, 
literally hundreds of small businesses and industries of all sizes are 
working hard across Carleton-Charlotte, and indeed across New 
Brunswick, in order to profit, expand and provide hundreds of new 
jobs.
<P>
	There are challenges with the new technologies and the changing 
requirements of today. There is no question that much work still 
has to be done, but these new technological requirements are being 
met today and will continue to be met into the future. There are a 
few examples which were just announced this week by Industry 
Canada.
<P>
	There is support for the community access sites. I can refer to 
those in my constituency and others may want to talk about those in 
their constituencies because this is good stuff. These are great 
opportunities for our communities and our youngsters. New 
technology, new opportunities to connect with the world 
marketplace are at our doorstep.
<P>
	Announcements were made for new community access sites in 
St. Stephen, St. George, Fredericton Junction, Florenceville and 
Hartland, New Brunswick. These announcements on this three year 
program are in addition to the ones that were made last year for 
community access opportunities in Juniper, Bath, Woodstock, 
Harvey, Lawrence Station, Deer Island, Campobello Island and St. 
Andrews.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The program provides all of those communities and indeed all of 
those rural areas with the tools to reach out to the markets and to 
the information that is available around the world. That is what the 
throne speech was about: equal access for all Canadians. 
Regardless of whether they live on Prince Edward Island, in New 
Brunswick, in the wonderful province of Quebec, on the west coast, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6286"> 6286 </A></B>
<P>
in central Canada or in the Northwest Territories and Yukon, there 
will be equal access and equal opportunity for all Canadians.
<P>
	That is why leading economists and even the OECD have 
projected that in 1997 Canada will lead all G-7 nations in economic 
growth. Canada will lead all of the industrialized countries of the 
world in economic growth. What does that mean for Canadians? It 
means jobs. That is why we are excited about it. It will mean jobs 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	I see my colleague across the way from St. John's, 
Newfoundland. She is excited because there will be an opportunity 
for her constituents to get jobs. Jobs are needed in Atlantic Canada, 
there is no question about it.
<P>
	Yes, we have challenges and we will continue to have 
challenges. But we will meet tomorrow's challenges as we have in 
the past. We did not say it was going to be easy and that the 
solutions would simply fall at our feet. It has been tough work.
<P>
	On arriving here we faced a $42 billion deficit. The debt was 
over $500 billion. There was a $6 billion deficit in the 
unemployment insurance fund. It went on and on. When we opened 
the books it was scary. Yes, there is still a way to go. There is no 
question about it. But is it not great to see our deficit on a 
downward trend? We can look forward to a balanced budget. That 
is exciting stuff.
<P>
	What is being said about Canadian exports? We know that team 
Canada is planning another trip. Business and industry leaders, the 
Prime Minister and the premiers will get together to travel overseas 
to create more opportunities for Canadian business and industry. 
That is being planned for early 1997. What does that mean to us as 
Canadians? We are told that every $1 billion of export trade that is 
garnered means 11,000 jobs for Canadians, either in new jobs or 
existing jobs which will be protected. That is important.
<P>
	Almost every day in the newspapers the leading economists 
write that Canada will lead in economic growth in 1997. That is the 
result of getting government right. That is the result of bringing 
down the deficit. That is the result of having an acceptable inflation 
rate. That is the result of good administration and hard work. It will 
continue from this time onward until the next throne speech and 
thereafter.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte on his 
speech. It is a very fine Liberal speech. He has listed for us the 
things that are going well in his riding, and the things that are going 
a bit better in Canada with respect to putting our finances in order 
and reducing the deficit.
<P>
	What struck me at the beginning of his speech was his reference 
to three objectives in the throne speech: getting government right, 
bringing order to our financial house, and reducing the deficit.
<P>
	I wish to address the first point. I think he perhaps did not speak 
much on it: getting government right. There is much talk of this, in 
the newspapers, in books, in magazine articles. They all say the 
state must change, must be defined differently.
<P>
	Our Reform colleagues often tell us that we need less and less 
government, that the state has no role in certain economic or social 
areas. On the other hand, it ought to play a heavy role in 
suppressing crime, and other such things.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask my colleague is not a loaded 
one. I would just like to know how much it can be claimed that the 
Canadian government has re-examined the role of the state since 
the Governor General's reading of the Throne Speech? Does this 
mean less involvement in the economy, less involvement in social 
measures? Does it mean government involvement in job creation?
<P>
	Reference is often made to job creation, and sometimes the 
impression is given that the government is boasting of having 
created jobs. There is talk of 600,000 jobs, yet certain ministers 
sometimes tell us that the government is no longer the one creating 
jobs, it is business.
<P>
	Having made these few comments, I wish to ask the following 
question: How has the federal government met the objective it set 
for itself in the throne speech to get government right? How has it 
re-examined the role of government, and what are the differences 
today between the federal government's concept of government 
before the throne speech, and now, five or six months later?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
the Bloc for his many questions. There were a number of them and 
I will try to answer them in the order that he put them forward.
<P>
	The member talked about rethinking government. As all 
government members are well aware, since arriving in this place 
we certainly have been rethinking government. We have been 
looking at the size of all departments.
<P>
	The first thing I recall being done upon arriving here was 
reducing the number of staff members in ministers' offices. Many 
offices in the junior portfolios had 50 to 60 staff members and the 
senior portfolios had from 100 to 120 staff members. Those offices 
are now working with 15 to 20 staff members. We are rethinking, 
taking the challenge first.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6287"> 6287 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member will know that the budget of every member 
of Parliament was frozen. Government members and opposition 
members alike, we all shared in it because it was a burden and 
we had to overcome it.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	There have been a number of those initiatives to build a smaller 
and more active oriented government that can provide services to 
people.
<P>
	This was done in balanced fashion. We protected those social 
programs that I spoke about earlier and a number of others that we 
and our constituents across Canada cherish in this country. We did 
not cut and slash and say they would be gone tomorrow, as others 
have suggested we do. We looked at their value and tried to make 
the difficult changes in a very balanced fashion that would be 
respected by all Canadians.
<P>
	Industry, business and job growth were mentioned. I think all 
members see that it is our responsibility to develop and take the 
initiatives that will build the climate in which business and industry 
in this country can expand and develop, thus creating the jobs that 
are needed for Canadians, creating jobs in the new technologies 
that we know are developing right here in the city of Ottawa. It is 
happening right under our noses. We heard one of our colleagues 
speak about it this morning.
<P>
	It is also happening elsewhere in Canada in many small 
communities. I spoke earlier about the importance of community 
access so that rural communities would be on the same level as our 
urban areas. Those are the important things.
<P>
	I would like to give a quick example. Some of it has been tabled 
in the House and some of it will be coming. We know in agriculture 
and fisheries how important our inspections are to ensure that we 
have the best product to export around the world. Whether it is in 
agriculture, fisheries or whatever product we are producing it 
seemed to put them under one umbrella, a new agency that will 
have the expertise and the most modern technology to ensure that 
our product is the number one quality in the world. Those are the 
types of things that will help us to continue our growth in the export 
trade and continue making Canada number one in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I think seeing the member for Carleton-Charlotte sitting 
there with his hon. colleague from Malpeque I would have to ask 
one simple question about the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Hearing the member talk about all the expertise in 
communications that we have today, I am wondering why the 
Canadian Wheat Board sold less grain than in the previous year. 
Why, when there was a tremendous need in the U.S, did we sell half 
a million tonnes less into that market? Now we have a record 
carry-over in durum and also some feed grains.
<P>
	It was very interesting to read in the papers recently what the 
priorities of this Liberal government are. When a motion or a 
resolution was brought forward to its policy convention supporting 
the Canadian Wheat Board it was side tracked by a motion to 
legalize the production of hemp. One of the reporters said: 
``Instead of supporting the wheat board we can now legally smoke 
a rope''. I am wondering if that is supposed to soothe the nerves of 
western farmers, with Liberal philosophy of that sort, so that we 
can sit quietly at the end of the field and more or less smoke a 
couple of ropes and not realize that our grain is still in the bins 
instead of being sold. I wonder how the hon. member would 
respond to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try to be as brief as 
possible. I thank my hon. colleague from the Reform Party for his 
question.
<P>
	I recall in all the east coast literature I have read over many years 
and all of the programs I have seen on television that people around 
the world have exclaimed time and time again what a wonderful 
organization the Canadian Wheat Board must be because it 
continues to bring revenue for western farmers in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It has, time and time again, shown that it could bring more 
revenue than those selling on an independent basis in many other 
countries, many other wheat producers around the world.
<P>
	Yes, there are problems. The hon. minister, time and time again, 
has alluded to those problems and is looking at ways to make it 
better. It has a wonderful history. I am glad to see it is going to 
continue to expand and prosper for all farmers in western Canada in 
the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate today. I am a little surprised that we are 
continuing only on the fifth day of debate on the speech from the 
throne, considering it is nine months since the speech was given. 
Perhaps it speaks volumes about the worth of the words in the 
speech from the throne and the integrity of the government in 
implementing some of those ideas.
<P>
	I listened with considerable amusement to the former speaker 
because it was such a typical Liberal speech. The Liberals, in the 
last three years since I have been here, truly have been masters of 
governing by illusion and creating an illusion of doing great things 
when the facts do not bear those things out.
<P>
	Truly, what could we expect from a party whose leader has an 
imaginary friend he talks to on the street corner and has imaginary 
ethical guidelines that his ministers go by? It would only stand to 
reason that we would have an imaginary report card on the 
performance of this government giving it an honours score when, 
in reality, the facts do not bear it out in any way.

	I would like to go through some of the facts and statistics that 
would paint a somewhat different picture than what I have heard 
coming from the members of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The speech from the throne, as a previous speaker indicated, 
kind of took a three pronged approach in its direction. Its objective 
was ``to provide security for Canadians, to provide unity for 
Canadians and to provide jobs for Canadians''. I believe that was 
the expression we heard.
<P>
	When we look at the facts, in spite of the rose coloured glasses 
that some members wear, they do not bear that out. When we look 
at the security for Canadians, this government over the last three 
years has cut social spending transfers to the provinces by some $7 
billion. It has cut funding for health care, for education and has 
enforced the closure of hospitals. There are many things people do 
not hear it talk about.
<P>
	It has cut substantially the benefits to seniors since coming to 
office in spite of the rhetoric we hear about protecting seniors' 
benefits and all the rest of it. There has been one segment, however, 
that it has provided substantial security for to show where its 
priorities are. Of course, that is in the security of the MP pension 
plan, looking after its members' own security on retirement. I do 
not hear a lot of them bragging about that when they are proposing 
to cut security for other seniors in this country.
<P>
	When we look at the promise to create unity for Canadians, the 
statistics do not bear out that there has been much progress on this 
front as well. Only a year ago we came within half a percentage 
point of losing the referendum and having this country split apart.
<P>
	I did not see much progress being made up to that point and 
certainly not much since. The only reaction before going back to 
sleep on the whole issue was the proposal to drag up the distinct 
society clause for Quebec which even the party representing 
Quebec in this House and most Canadians rejected soundly in the 
Charlottetown accord many years ago. I do not see that there has 
been substantial progress on that.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The third prong of the speech from the throne was dealing with 
jobs for Canadians. Perhaps this is one of the most dismal areas in 
spite of the illusion that the previous speaker tried to create of this 
wealth of jobs being created for Canadians.
<P>
	The fact remains that personal and business bankruptcies are at 
an all time record high in this country. In spite of presumably 
coming out of the recession that the North American economy was 
in and having some of the lowest interest rates since the 1960s, our 
unemployment rate still hovers on one side or the other of 10 per 
cent, in spite of the fact that across the border to the south 
unemployment rates are only half the  rate they are in Canada. I do 
not see a lot to brag about when we talk about job creation.
<P>
	Looking a little further at what has been going on in Canada over 
the last 30 years it is hardly any wonder that conditions in Canada 
led to the creation of the Reform Party and some of the ideas the 
Reform brought to this House and promotes in Canada. In spite of 
all the bragging and illusion created Canadians today, after three 
years of Liberal government, are unquestionably worse off than 
they were three years ago. There is no arguing that.
<P>
	The income of an average family of four has dropped by $3,000 
since 1993. People are working harder and harder just to try to 
maintain a standard of living. Two out of three two-parent families 
have two or more jobs; 1.4 million Canadians are unemployed and 
continue to be unemployed; 2 million to 3 million Canadians are 
underemployed and one in four Canadians are worried sick about 
losing their jobs and not being able to provide for their families.
<P>
	Canadians truly have taken a national pay cut. For a family of 
four the pay cut has been some $3,000 over the last three years. The 
Liberals at the end of their mandate will be collecting some $26 
billion more in taxes than they were when they came to office in 
1993. This government, which says everything is so wonderful and 
rosy, the economy is booming, jobs are being created, has added 
$111 billion more to the national debt, forcing it up to the $600 
billion mark; truly not a very good track record.
<P>
	Looking at the last 25 or 30 years in this country, in 1972 when 
Pierre Trudeau came to power only 553,000 Canadians were 
unemployed. When his government was defeated in 1984, 1.45 
million Canadians were unemployed.
<P>
	Then the Tories took over and were going to turn things around. 
They talked about a job for every Canadian who wants to work. By 
the time they left in 1993, 1.65 million Canadians were out of 
work. Certainly in 1993, in spite of the red book promise of jobs, 
jobs, jobs, there remains in Canada today 1.5 million Canadians out 
of work.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is trying to tell Canadians that somewhere 
around that level of unemployment is acceptable, that it cannot be 
brought down lower. We know what happened to former Prime 
Minister Kim Campbell when she made that remark.
<P>
	Certainly we have heard a lot of bragging today about balanced 
budgets. A number of previous speakers talked about achieving a 
balanced budget somewhere in the year 1998-99, getting the deficit 
down to $9 billion and then assuming at that point that the budget 
was balanced. I submit that only in a place like this would anyone 
presume that a $9 billion or $10 billion deficit is in fact a balanced 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6289"> 6289 </A></B>
<P>
budget. Certainly in the real world I do not think that could be 
considered a reality.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Between 1972 and 1984 the Liberals increased the national debt 
from $17.2 billion to $199 billion, a staggering 1,057 per cent 
increase. In 1984 the Tories promised to put a stop to the increase 
in the debt. Instead they increased it from $199 billion to $508.2 
billion in only nine years.
<P>
	Then of course the current government has added another $111.5 
billion, bringing the debt to the $600 billion mark. It is not a record 
about which most governments would have the audacity to brag, I 
am sure.
<P>
	The illusion is not one that most Canadians will long believe. I 
firmly believe that Canadians are demanding an end to this 
political rhetoric, this campaign platform that makes all kinds of 
promises that the government has no intention of living up to. 
Canadians are demanding some integrity in government, some 
honesty in election platforms and they are demanding a fresh 
approach to government, a basic restructuring of government, a 
basic downsizing of government.
<P>
	I spent last week travelling in western and central Canada with 
the natural resources standing committee which is holding hearings 
on rural economic renewal. In spite of real prompting from the 
members of the Liberal Party on the committee to try to initiate 
some response in favour of another infrastructure program or 
subsidies to provide incentives to small business, witness after 
witness said: ``We don't need more hockey rinks and canoe 
museums and the like. What we need is government to get off our 
backs, get out of our pockets, give us a chance to make a dollar, 
succeed in our businesses and be successful''.
<P>
	That is a story we heard over and over again. I very much look 
forward to the day when we write the report on the committee and 
put into print what supposedly we heard on the tour.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Could the hon. 
member please indicate to me if he is sharing his time with another 
colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Yes, Madam Speaker, I am sharing my time with 
my colleague from Surrey North.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That should 
have been indicated at the beginning of your speech. You are two 
minutes over your time. I will give you 30 seconds to wind up your 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not realize that the time 
had expired. I apologize for that.
<P>
	The government has maintained the degree of popularity that it 
has over the last number of years through illusion and political 
rhetoric that really is very shallow. I am sure that Canadians, come 
the next  election, will see through the rhetoric and the illusion and 
take a dim view of the record of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I just have a couple of comments to make.
<P>
	The hon. member of the Reform Party was talking about jobs. He 
was criticizing the government for not creating enough jobs. I think 
the member's credibility is lacking very seriously.
<P>
	Reform Party members have been in Parliament now for three 
years. For almost three years the word jobs never crossed their lips, 
never crossed their minds. Did we hear a word about jobs from the 
Reform Party in 1994? Not a word. Did we hear about jobs from the 
Reform Party in 1995? Not a word. It was not until this past 
summer that Reformers discovered the word jobs in the Reform 
Party vocabulary. Somebody put it there. I suspect what happened 
was that they read a survey or two or a poll and they discovered that 
Canadians are actually preoccupied with the issue of jobs. This is 
the party that talks about its members speaking to its constituents.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	It took Reformers three years to discover the word jobs in their 
vocabulary. Where have they been for three years? Talk about a 
fresh start. That is the kind of fresh start we get from the Reform 
Party. It discovers that Canadians are actually concerned about 
jobs.
<P>
	While they were somewhere in the wilderness, somewhere in the 
bush, not realizing that Canadians do have a concern about jobs, the 
government has been doing something. Since the government came 
to office, well over 600,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	One more thing. Now that Reformers have discovered that 
Canadians have a concern about jobs, what does the Reform Party 
propose as a response to that? It proposes a tax cut, right across the 
board. Do Reformers ever learn anything?
<P>
	What did Ronald Reagan do in the United States when he came 
to power in the beginning of the 1980s? Across the board tax cuts. 
What happened? The deficit went right through the roof. The 
United States went from being the greatest creditor nation in 1980 
to being the greatest debtor nation in the world in 1988. That is 
what Ronald Reagan did. The Americans suddenly realized that 
this trickle down theory of economics does not work.
<P>
	But here is the Reform Party, true to its dinosaur heritage: ``Yep, 
that's what we're proposing, across the board tax cuts''. It did not 
work in the States and it will not work here in this country. 
Canadians do not believe in it and it will never work. That is why 
this member and all the members of the Reform Party have 
absolutely no credibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6290"> 6290 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, I can only assume that what 
I am hearing from across the floor is political rhetoric. I assume 
the member opposite is an intelligent individual and can certainly 
read our fresh start platform and our platform of the last four or 
five years. Job creation has been an integral part of that platform 
from day one.
<P>
	I do not expect him to believe or to support our platform, which 
is perfectly reasonable. Since he is a Liberal and I am a Reformer 
we take quite a different strategy in dealing with job creation. We 
believe that jobs can be created by the private sector, by getting 
government out of Canadians' pockets and off their backs, by 
giving Canadians back some of the 60 per cent of their wages that 
governments take away from them with the view that it is smarter 
than the individual and that it can spend it more wisely.
<P>
	I heard the comment awhile back that they believed the primary 
purpose of government was the redistribution of wealth. I am only 
assuming that is rhetoric and positioning. I think the member 
knows better.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in the debate today on the throne 
speech. I will direct my remarks to the family.
<P>
	The throne speech was in February. I wondered if the 
government was going to take the opportunity, as is traditional, to 
utilize the throne speech to tell us what it intended to do to meet the 
needs and wants of Canadians. I am glad to see we are now 
debating it again so we can pursue that.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	One of the areas in which Canadians want change is in the area 
of families and how governments treat families. Of course, work 
and the resulting income is an essential component for the 
establishment of a healthy family unit, yet the government and 
those which preceded it over the last 20 or so years have 
implemented social and economic policies and continue to enhance 
those policies which result in undermining the security of Canadian 
families. That contributes to the levels of stress, burnout and 
financial hardships which many Canadians face today. The policies 
of the last 20 odd years have created the situation in which we find 
ourselves today.
<P>
	For example, one in four Canadians are worried about losing 
their job. Another two million to three million Canadians are 
underemployed. They are unable to find work in the area for which 
they trained. There are approximately 1.4 million Canadians who 
are on the unemployed list. That was the number in 1993 I believe. 
That number has not changed.
<P>
	Not much of an inroad has been made into job creation. If 
inroads have been made, then other jobs have disappeared, because 
the figures are still hovering around 1.4 million. We all know that 
puts extra strain on  people's lives and on their families. If we do 
not have a sense of job security we are left in limbo. We begin to 
wonder what kind of a future we will have.
<P>
	Canadians are worried about making ends meet. Often two 
incomes are necessary. Often, despite the two incomes, we do not 
get enough time to spend with our families and raise our children. 
About 25 years ago one income seemed to cover the bills and there 
was some room to spare. Now, for many families, it takes two 
incomes to run the family.
<P>
	When we consider that the tax freedom day falls in June, it is 
easy to see where that second income has to go. One income goes 
to the household and the other goes to government in some form or 
another, be it in taxes, user fees or a licence for this or that. It seems 
that the government wants both parents to have to work. It wants 
families to need two incomes to survive.
<P>
	In a recent letter the Minister of Finance said he is opposed to 
changes in the day care tax deduction because levelling the playing 
field would be a disincentive for both parents to work. The day care 
tax deduction should not apply to those parents who work, it should 
be directed toward the children. It is a day care service for children, 
so it really should not matter if the parents work. If they have 
children, they should be entitled to it.
<P>
	The priority of members of the Reform Party is the family. The 
best words to illustrate that goal are the words of the leader of our 
caucus, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, who said: 
``Because of social and economic changes, many families are 
facing high debt, stress, bankruptcy and burnout. A Reform 
government will recognize the value of families as the most 
important building block in our society, so you can spend less time 
under pressure and more time with those that you care about 
most''.
<P>
	We are committed to Canadians and to the family. We want to 
make the family a priority and ensure that government regulations 
and policies are definitely family friendly.
<P>
	Where do you start? One place to start is to extend the $3,000 to 
$5,000 child care deduction to all parents, not just to those who are 
working.
<P>
	We could also increase the spousal deduction from $5,380 to 
$7,900, levelling the field for parents who choose to stay at home 
to look after their young children. Of course, that would help 
families to meet the needs of the more demanding economy.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Family time or family life is not a luxury. If families are to 
preserve health and happiness in a home it is not a luxury, it is a 
necessity. They need the time to spend building that core structure. 
It is time to make families a priority once again in our Canadian 
lifestyle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6291"> 6291 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that parenting has real value and if 
there is anything this whole House can agree on it is that children 
are the key to the future of countries around the world.
<P>
	We must give parents greater freedom to spend time parenting 
and to succeed economically while they shape the lives of their 
children. Some ways we feel that can be done is to increase the 
child deduction to parents to $5,000 for every preschool child; 
$3,000 for every child age 7 to 12 years old. All this is in the fresh 
start program. We have to start somewhere and these are some of 
the targets we are looking at which will definitely assist the family 
situation.
<P>
	To make it as fair as possible to all families with regard to 
income level, we will turn the deduction into a tax credit. That 
method will allow everyone to save.
<P>
	My critic area is in aboriginal affairs. Consequently, I have spent 
a fair amount of time looking at that aspect of our country. One 
thing that comes forward there is family violence. It is not just in 
that group. It does not matter who we talk to in the country, it 
seems to be at all levels of society. It does not matter if it is in the 
north or in the south. I certainly believe that family violence, 
spousal and child abuse, has to addressed and there have to be some 
guidelines put out there. We have to identify the playing field.
<P>
	This is one thing Reform would like to do. Instead of looking 
solely at the intent of the action, we would like to focus on the 
action itself. Assault is not something Canadians choose to have in 
society. We want to get more firm with people who assault, assault 
of any kind. However, this predominantly occurs in family circles, 
which we are not able to address because there tends to be a 
reluctance to identify the situation. Therefore many people live in 
these abusive situations who do not wish to come forward. We 
should create a situation that would encourage them to come 
forward.
<P>
	Another thing is that when there actually is a situation of abuse 
and someone has been charged, in looking at the counselling 
aspect, the aboriginal community is trying to tell us that there is 
more than one way of getting to the bottom line. I really feel we 
should be looking at different methods and address the one which is 
most suitable to achieving the bottom line.
<P>
	If a person wishes to read and understand the English language 
as written in Reform's fresh start, from the family point of view 
which I am addressing today our main concern is to leave more 
money in the hands of parents to allow them to build that home and 
the structure in which to raise their children, cloth, feed and 
educate them, and give them the choice as to how they wish to 
pursue that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciated the remarks of the member for Surrey North 
with respect to wanting to improve the lives of families in 
Canadian society, possibly by tax means and other instruments.
<P>
	I would like to point out to her this is a sentiment that is shared 
broadly in the House. Two nights ago there was a motion presented 
to the House by the member for Mississauga South, a government 
member, which proposed that the government introduce a caregiver 
tax, particularly for families with young children and families of 
the disabled. That motion was supported on all sides of the House.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	I think I can assure the member for Surrey North that the desire 
to give better opportunities to the traditional nuclear family is a 
concept that is shared by all members of this House, not just the 
Reform Party. I think we can look forward in the coming year to 
some significant steps on the part of the government in that regard. 
I think certainly most members on the government benches would 
support it in every way.
<P>
	I would like to take the member just briefly down another road if 
she would not mind. One of the points made in the speech from the 
throne was there would be a modernization of the federal labour 
code which applies to federally regulated industries.
<P>
	Just this past week a bill was presented to the House containing 
the proposals of the labour minister in this regard. I would like to 
draw the attention of the member for Surrey North to a couple of 
provisions in the proposals put forward by the government in this 
new legislation. One of the provisions pertains to replacement 
workers.
<P>
	In Quebec there has been a ban on replacement workers during 
labour stoppages since I think 1977. In Ontario legislation was 
brought forward by the New Democratic Party banning 
replacement workers in 1993. This legislation was since overturned 
by the current Conservative government. We find this Liberal 
government bringing down legislation that is in between these two 
extremes. What it proposes basically is that replacement workers 
continue to be an option of a company facing a strike or a work 
stoppage but that company is not allowed to use those replacement 
workers to break the union. I think this addresses the problem that 
exists with several very nasty strikes that exist in Quebec. It seems 
to me that this is a very positive compromise on the part of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	I also point out that the labour code proposals also suggest that 
following work stoppage, those who have been out of work and 
faced with replacement workers are entitled to return to their jobs. 
Again the government in its wisdom has made provisions for 
workers who have legitimately sought to pressure a company by 
the means of a legal strike but not to be unfairly penalized at the 
conclusion of that work stoppage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6292"> 6292 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope the member for Surrey North can reply to these three 
initiatives. The third and final point, which I thought was very 
progressive on the part of the government in introducing these 
amendments to the labour code, is that it is proposed that when 
it comes to the grain handling industry, only those unions that 
actually handle the grain should continue to have the right to stop 
the shipment of grain. In other words, peripheral unions will no 
longer be permitted to hold the country at ransom by the stoppage 
of shipments of grain.
<P>
	These are three very positive initiatives that spin directly out of 
the speech from the throne. I could find the page in the speech from 
the throne for the member. I think these are very fine initiatives and 
I would like to hear the member comment on these three initiatives. 
Does she support them or reject them?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Madam Speaker, I find it ironic that when I 
address my remarks to family how it suddenly got into silos and 
grain, but here we are.
<P>
	I think at the heart of what I want to say here is that the policies 
of this government and preceding governments over the last 30 
years miss the point. We tried them but they are not working. It 
does not matter what we are looking at, replacement workers or 
whatever.
<P>
	Basically what we are doing here is taking a policy and 
band-aiding it. My background is health and I feel we are 
addressing a symptom. We are not actually looking at the cause and 
treating the cause to resolve the problem or the disease.
<P>
	The negotiating process where we have the type of thing that is 
being suggested by the government of bringing in these workers 
when a strike is threatening was not the original intent of the 
negotiating process.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The negotiating process initially was to give the employee, when 
things were perceived to be wrong by the employee, some clout to 
negotiate and bargain to get them right.
<P>
	We have let that go to the nth degree. It is not working-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We are now 
resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak today in the debate on the Throne speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The speech from the throne was delivered on February 27, 1996, 
approximately two years and four months into the government's 
mandate. It was an opportunity for the government to confirm its 
priorities, namely jobs and growth, and to continue on that agenda. 
At that point over half a million net jobs had been created. Now we 
are at over 620,000 net jobs created.
<P>
	The speech from the throne went on to deal with three priority 
themes: the jobs and growth agenda, the security for Canadians, 
and the modernization of the federation to ensure national unity. 
The area where I would like to concentrate my remarks is national 
unity.
<P>
	When we speak of national unity, invariably we end up speaking 
of the Quebec situation. Canadians are aware that national unity is 
a much broader question than simply the wants and desires of the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	We end up concentrating a lot of our effort and time dealing with 
the Quebec question because the separatist governments in that 
province have twice called referendums under provincial 
legislation dealing with the question of the separation of Quebec 
from the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Going back prior to the speech from the throne and the time just 
before the last referendum, Canadians will recall that in the week 
before the referendum the Prime Minister became very active in 
the campaign.
<P>
	Until then the Prime Minister had been a member of the no 
committee, constituted under the Quebec legislation. There were 
other members of the committee, federal ministers, the leader of 
the federal Conservative Party, the leader of the Liberal opposition 
in Quebec, et cetera.
<P>
	The strategy that was arrived at was that the Prime Minister 
would make certain timely interventions in the campaign. As the 
campaign wore on it became evident from the polling that there 
was difficulty, that the result was going to be much closer than 
polls indicated earlier.
<P>
	The Prime Minister became much more involved. He made 
certain commitments to the people of Quebec dealing mainly with 
the recognition of Quebec's distinctness, the question of regional 
vetoes and the issue of job training. It had been a traditional 
Quebec demand that job training be turned over to the provinces so 
that they would have more jurisdiction in that field. The Prime 
Minister made those commitments.
<P>
	In December 1995 the House of Commons passed the motion on 
distinct society, passed the bill dealing with regional vetoes and in 
the course of its employment insurance reforms it has been dealing 
with the job training issue.
<P>
	As far as the federal government and the Prime Minister's being 
able to honour those commitments without the participation of the 
provinces, they have done so.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6293"> 6293 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	The government has also indicated and continues to indicate its 
willingness to entrench the recognition of Quebec's differences in 
the Constitution as well as the regional vetoes. Of course, that 
cannot be done unilaterally by the federal government and requires 
the participation of the provinces in accordance with the amending 
formula of the Constitution which requires seven provinces 
representing at least 50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	The speech from the throne sets out what the government's plan 
on national unity is. Basically it is a plan of reconciliation, to 
reconcile all of the concerns of all of the provinces and all of the 
regions of Canada and to modernize the federation to take those 
concerns into account.
<P>
	Much progress has been made with respect to the modernization 
of the federation. At the first ministers conference in June, steps 
were initiated and negotiations were undertaken. At the premiers 
conference in August, there was a resolution passed and agreement 
arrived at by the premiers that they would work with the federal 
government in its efforts to try to make arrangements so that the 
jurisdictions between the provinces and the federal government 
could be worked out to the satisfaction of all parties.
<P>
	The federal government has acknowledged that there are certain 
areas where definitely there should be more provincial 
involvement. I have made reference already to the job training 
areas. Another area is the administration of social housing. There 
are also the forestry and mining sectors. Measures have been taken 
in the Fisheries Act to allow for the delegation to the interested 
provinces of responsibilities for management of freshwater 
fisheries habitats.
<P>
	Later this month there will be more meetings in the field of the 
environment. The provincial ministers of the environment will be 
meeting with the federal Minister of the Environment to try to 
negotiate the terms of subagreements on environmental assessment 
to eliminate duplication and the mixed jurisdictions in those areas.
<P>
	As well, the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Minister of Health are negotiating with their provincial colleagues. 
They are trying to come to arrangements where perhaps the 
provinces would have more say in certain areas of jurisdiction and 
maybe certain other areas of jurisdiction would be turned over to 
the federal government or their role would be heightened in the 
appropriate cases.
<P>
	On the question of future referendums the speech from the 
throne also indicated the following: ``As long as the prospect of 
another Quebec referendum exists, the government will exercise its 
responsibility to ensure that the debate is conducted with all the 
facts on the table, that the rules of the process are fair, that the  
consequences are clear and that Canadians, no matter where they 
live, will have their say in the future of their country''.
<P>
	That commitment is in the speech from the throne. The 
government has acted upon it with the intervention in the Bertrand 
case when the Quebec provincial government was saying that the 
rule of law had nothing to do with the right to self-determination, 
and also with the reference to the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	Inevitably, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech, we end 
up speaking of Quebec when we speak about national unity, even 
though many of the other provinces share many of the same 
concerns that Quebec has with the operation of the federation and 
the need for its modernization.
<P>
	Canada today is not the same place it was in 1867. Much has 
changed and obviously there is a need to modernize the workings 
of the various levels of government. We come back to the Prime 
Minister's commitment on the question of recognizing Quebec's 
distinctiveness.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	In today's debate I heard one of the members from the Reform 
Party mention Charlottetown and that the concept of a distinct 
society was rejected when Charlottetown was rejected and that the 
people had their say. There were so many things in the 
Charlottetown accord. No one can say with any degree of certainty 
which of the components of the accord people were voting against 
when they voted no. If they were voting yes, they had to agree with 
every component. It was a flawed process and I think we have 
learned our lesson.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has indicated on several occasions in this 
House that his strategy is to deal with these issues separately one at 
a time so we will know exactly what the acceptance of a particular 
concept is. It is not correct to say that the people of Canada rejected 
the distinct society because it was one of the components of the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	The polls tell us that 60 to 65 per cent of Quebecers feel an 
attachment toward Canada and want to see the difficulties that are 
being expressed by many of the provinces and not just Quebec 
resolved within the Canadian context. We need to determine why 
then did we have a referendum result with 49 per cent voting yes? 
Was the question reasonable and fair? Did the people understand it 
precisely?
<P>
	I think it was more than that. There has to be some other 
explanation as to why, if only 30 to 35 per cent of people are 
committed to separating, as high as 49 per cent would vote yes. We 
need to look at that and determine the reason for that and for those 
of us who want to see the country stay together, what we can do to 
deal with that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6294"> 6294 </A></B>
<P>
	That is where we come back to the question of the recognition 
of Quebec, its difference by reason of its French language, its 
French culture and its French institutions. Those are the facts. 
Quebec is the only province in Canada that has a predominantly 
French speaking population, a predominantly French culture. It 
has le droit civil. It is one of two jurisdictions in North America 
that has le droit civil legal system as opposed to the common law 
system. There is an indisputable difference I would submit and 
we need to deal with that. A recognition of that difference needs 
to be entrenched in the Constitution.
<P>
	People may have noticed that I am not using the term distinct 
society. When that concept is discussed there is a fear in the 
provinces other than Quebec that it means there is going to be some 
advantage, right, power or privilege given to Quebec that the other 
provinces will not enjoy. That certainly is not what is being 
proposed by this government. This government is simply 
proposing a recognition of Quebec's difference by reason of its 
French language, culture and institutions without granting to it any 
further rights, powers or privileges.
<P>
	That begs the question: Of what value is it? Is it simply 
symbolic? It is not going to fill the bill. It is not going to address 
the concerns of the Quebec people who are looking for some reason 
to remain in Canada. I submit it is more than symbolic because it 
would entrench in the Constitution the existing constitutional 
convention.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Brian Dickson, the retired chief justice of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, recently published an article in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>. It indicated that presently the Supreme Court of 
Canada in interpreting grey areas of the Constitution takes into 
account Quebec's difference by reason of its French language, 
culture and institutions.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	We would be guaranteeing what is existing now. On the one hand 
we would have something substantial which Quebecers could feel 
secure about. On the other hand we would not be granting any 
rights, powers or privileges that the other provinces do not now 
enjoy. In other words, there would be no preference given.
<P>
	There is certainly room for that type of discussion, not by our 
friends in the Bloc Quebecois and members of the PQ government 
in Quebec because they want a separate country. Offering them any 
form of guarantee or recognition in the way the Constitution is 
interpreted today will not be of any benefit to them because it will 
not lead to separation.
<P>
	We have to address the other 60 to 65 per cent of Quebecers who 
are looking for that. It is also a way for Canadians outside Quebec 
to express to their fellow Canadians in Quebec that they are 
prepared to assist in the preservation of the French language, 
culture and  institutions which are prevalent in Quebec. It is a way 
to support them and to alleviate their insecurity.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has said that if 
Quebec is the only predominantly French speaking province or 
jurisdiction in Canada and in North America, it creates a natural 
insecurity and a legitimate concern with respect to the preservation 
of the French language, culture and institutions. If we Canadians 
outside Quebec can show that we are prepared to support them in 
that preservation, it would have an influence on their desire to 
remain a part of this country.
<P>
	As part of my duties for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs I have travelled to different regions of Canada. I was in 
three of the four maritime provinces this past summer. I have been 
to British Columbia and Alberta. I have spoken with people who 
have formed Canadian unity groups, Canadian citizens who are 
concerned about Canadian unity. They have expressed frustration 
at not being able to do anything about the preservation of unity in 
Canada. They have come together in an effort to become involved 
in the process.
<P>
	When I speak to them in the terms I have just outlined, I get very 
little opposition to the concept of recognizing Quebec's differences 
by reason of its French language, culture and institutions when it is 
presented to them in a way that gives them some assurance that it 
will not lead to any additional rights, powers or privileges. Once 
the term distinct society is put into the equation however, then there 
is all of the baggage that comes from the constitutional wrangling 
of the previous government with the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown accords.
<P>
	There is a way to develop that support and to act on it. The 
government is on the right track. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs has spoken to most of his provincial 
counterparts. In certain provinces he gets a warmer reception than 
in others. However, we must continue to work on it.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I noted 
that the member focused on unity or disunity or the lack of unity or 
the concern about unity but very little on how to build unity in the 
country.
<P>
	I was particularly intrigued by one comment. I am talking about 
the courts of this land for which we have respect and high regard 
for their impartiality and the quality of the judgments they render 
based on the law. The law of this land is important and it is the 
responsibility of the courts to uphold the law as Parliament sets it 
out in the statutes for them to apply. Of course, there is a great deal 
of independence between this House and the courts to ensure that 
they are totally impartial and unbiased and not influenced by the 
House or by anyone else for that matter.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6295"> 6295 </A></B>
<P>
	The member made reference to the fact that the courts seem 
to take into consideration the political perceptions of the different 
culture in Quebec, the language and so on, compared to the rest 
of the country.
<P>
	I wonder if he was suggesting that the courts are becoming 
politically aware, if I can use that phrase. I hope not, but I thought 
that is what he was alluding to.
<P>
	I happen to have a little quote here, a supreme court ruling in the 
province of Alberta, where I am from. It was a rather eloquent 
judgment that went on for some considerable length by Mr. Justice 
John McClung in a ruling in 1996 in the Alberta Court of Appeal in 
the case of Vriend et al v. Alberta.
<P>
	He said: ``None of our precious and historic legislative 
safeguards are in play when judges choose to privateer in 
parliamentary sea lanes''. I thought that was a wonderful quote that 
says that the courts are apart, separate and must protect their own 
integrity and impartiality. If they want to privateer in the sea lanes 
of politics, we should all be serious concerned.
<P>
	Would the hon. member please confirm to me and to the 
members of the House that he was not suggesting that the courts 
would take politics into consideration or anything into 
consideration other than the law which they are asked to interpret. 
Or did I misinterpret what he was trying to say?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree with the proposition 
that the hon. member has put forth that the courts should not 
become involved in politics. We need to maintain the separation 
between the judiciary and the political procedures in the country.
<P>
	I was quoting an article by Mr. Justice Brian Dickson, retired 
chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He was not talking 
about politics. He was talking about when the Supreme Court of 
Canada is called on to interpret grey areas of the Constitution; in 
other words, areas where the jurisdictions are not clearly aligned.
<P>
	The convention now is that the Supreme Court of Canada in 
those grey areas takes into account the fact, not a political policy, 
that Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada which has a 
predominantly French speaking population. There are French 
speaking people in all other regions but they are not the majority. 
Therefore in Quebec they are different by reason of the first 
language of use, by reason of their culture because they are of 
French origin and have a different culture than the multiplicity of 
cultures we have in Canada and because their legal system is the 
Napoleonic code, le droit civil, which is an entirely different legal 
system which therefore leads to different institutions in that 
province.
<P>
	He is not playing politics. He is saying that the Supreme Court of 
Canada takes those actual facts into consideration when it needs to 
interpret areas that are not black and white in the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Simcoe North for his remarks 
which I appreciated very much.
<P>
	I would like his response to a point about distinct society. There 
are about 600,000 Francophones who live in Ontario plus many 
thousands who live in New Brunswick and other parts of the 
country. My thoughts with respect to affirming that Quebec has 
distinct society status are that it would not only protect the cultural 
traditions of Quebec but it would also be a guarantee to 
Francophones elsewhere in the country that this national 
government will defend their interests, their language and their 
culture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, that is the case with the 
government's policies on official bilingualism and that is being 
done by the government at the present time. The French speaking 
minorities in the other provinces are protected where the demand is 
sufficient and they can obtain the services they need in the French 
language.
<P>
	However, that is a different issue from recognizing that Quebec 
as a province has a majority of French speaking people; whereas in 
the other regions the member referred to, the French speaking 
people are the minority or perhaps in the case of New Brunswick it 
is almost a 50-50 split. In the other provinces, save New 
Brunswick, French speaking people are in the minority.
<P>
	It is the recognition that Quebec is predominantly French 
speaking, although it has many other people from various 
backgrounds, that we are talking about. It is about recognizing that 
fact and the consequences of its culture and its institutions as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I am still intrigued by the 
question I asked. I am not sure I got a satisfactory answer. The hon. 
member quoted a retired chief justice, an eminent person.
<P>
	I am still trying to get clear in my mind these facts he kept 
referring to. The courts are to apply the law and the law is quite 
specific. It is written down quite clearly. The law is the basis on 
which judgments are rendered by the courts. I get this uneasy 
feeling that he is suggesting the courts take facts, whatever facts 
may be or however one interprets facts, into consideration in 
rendering their judgments. Could he make it crystal clear?
<P>
	I am not aware of any law on our books today that says one 
province is different from another. Yet the law of the land is what 
the courts are supposed to apply. Could he be crystal clear and tell 
me on what basis extraneous facts can be introduced by courts in 
rendering their decisions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, I guess we are going to beat this 
horse to death. It is simple. There are grey areas in the Constitution. 
The member says the law is clear. Well, it is not. There are many 
areas. The Constitution  does not cover every possibility. There are 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6296"> 6296 </A></B>
<P>
unclear areas which the court has to interpret. I am not saying it. 
Mr. Justice Dickson is saying the court takes into account the 
difference that Quebec has by reason of its French language, 
culture and institutions. That is what we are trying to get to make 
that a law. It is not a law now. It is a constitutional convention. We 
are saying let us entrench it into the Constitution. It should be of 
some comfort to some Quebecers and it is not taking anything away 
from the other provinces because it is what is happening now.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will now 
recognize the hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. 
The hon. member may start on the first five minutes of his speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Just the truth, just the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> You will hear the truth now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say that I only have three or four 
minutes left until the end of this sitting. I will resume speaking on 
the next day of debate on the Throne speech. I do not have time to 
get into the main part of my speech, which was supposed to be 
about the government's record on dealing with the disabled, but I 
will get back to this later on.
<P>
	For the time being, I will merely refer to some statements by my 
colleague from Simcoe North who, I think, is a reasonable man 
who is usually able to make a fairly correct assessment of a 
political situation, but when he talks about the situation in Quebec, 
I should remind him of certain facts, just to fine tune the facts he 
already has. He said, if I am not mistaken, that about 65 per cent 
want a new and improved Canadian federation, that is, 
improvements within the Canadian system.
<P>
	I do not know to which poll he is referring but, depending on the 
questions asked, you can get the results you want. It is like the 
Prime Minister, who at his convention about two weeks ago gave 
himself a score of 78 per cent when referring to his government's 
achievements. If we dig a little further, we get far different results.
<P>
	I just want to take one poll as an example, since my colleague 
from Simcoe North was referring to polls to support his own figure 
of 65 per cent. A poll published today in the daily papers found that 
the level of satisfaction with the Prime Minister and the 
government has been dropping since the beginning of the summer. 
It now seems that 35 per cent of Canadians support the leader of the 
government, the Prime Minister, while in April this was 39 per cent 
and a few months ago it was 44 per cent.
<P>
	We see there has been a major drop in the level of satisfaction, 
which is a strong indication, before an election, of the kind of 
support a government would get if there was an election tomorrow 
morning.
<P>
	So figures can be made to say what we want them to say. The fact 
is that if we want to get involved in a constitutional debate, we are 
looking at something that is impossible within the Canadian 
federation. Federalists with the federal government or in the 
provinces who, over the past thirty years, have tried to change the 
system in response to the legitimate demands of Quebec and also of 
the other provinces, have always come up against a dead end. We 
were always faced with an impossible situation following 
negotiations, and the hon. member was referring to Charlottetown, 
when the people spoke for the first time.
<P>
	But apart from this exercise, we always came up against the 
situation where Quebec was isolated, having come away 
disappointed from discussions. And I think it important to repeat 
this. I have said it I know not how many times in this House, and I 
will say it again. This was after discussions between federalists, not 
discussions between federalists on the one hand and separatists on 
the other, as my colleague for Simcoe North mentioned just now, 
when he said that it would never be possible to satisfy the wishes of 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	I know that the period provided for debate has expired, so I will 
close by saying that, if political partisanship were put aside, and the 
proposal made by sovereignists and almost approved by a majority 
of Quebecers read carefully, it would be understood that 
sovereignists in this House and in Quebec basically want two 
things: first, recognition of the people of Quebec, the means we 
have and the means that go with this recognition in order to be able 
to affirm ourselves; and second, a partnership agreement with our 
preferred partner, Canada.
<P>
	That is what we want and that will be the key in the future to 
resolving our present problems. I will continue these thoughts 
another time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.31 p.m.)
