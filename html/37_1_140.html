	Mr. Speaker, in the House all members are protected from harassment for their beliefs by parliamentary privilege, but judging by the personal smears that have been launched by the opposition it is clear that some of us are abusing that privilege to harass a private citizen.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the disgraceful treatment of Mr. Jean Carle and his family.   I know Jean Carle.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked very closely with him. Jean has a great deal of talent and I am privileged to call him a friend.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sin of having worked for the Prime Minister he has become the victim of an opposition witch hunt that would make Senator McCarthy proud.  He has been the subject of baseless allegations of wrongdoing, allegations that have been refuted time and time again including in the <i>National Post</i> this morning. His every career move is fodder for snide comment and gross innuendo with no regard for fairness or for the effect on his reputation and his family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition may be doing this just for laughs but it is no joke.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, for five days last week I accompanied Clayton Prince, executive director of the British Columbia Snowmobile Federation, and 18 other snowmobilers on a  cross-country trip from Kitimat in northwestern British Columbia to Wells in central British Columbia, a distance of almost 500 miles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Columbia Snowmobile Federation is promoting the linkage of communities throughout British Columbia and across Canada by winter trail. I recognize that snowmobiling is a legitimate sport and a real revenue generator for winter tourism, especially in smaller communities in rural parts of the country and I fully support that effort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of the trip I had the pleasure of attending the Northern British Columbia Winter Games in Smithers.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDA has contributed up to $7 million over four years to SOCODEVI to support its work with small agricultural cooperatives in Guatemala.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition democratic reform task force offers a vision that includes an elected and reformed Senate, accountability and responsibility for individual members of parliament, and more opportunities for citizens to have a direct impact on the way they are governed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vision endorsed by our PC/DR caucus coalition.  It is a vision endorsed by those of us who come from the reform Alliance tradition in this coalition.  It is a vision endorsed by the Conservative Senate caucus.  It is a vision endorsed by the Progressive Conservative management team.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan has the opportunity to draw Canadians, yea, political parties together to replace the Liberals who operate by the maxim, “We're the government.  We can do whatever we want.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any naysayers let me say that this is our culture, this is our raison d'être, this is our chance.</p>

The minister can use whatever terminology he wants, but the TPC terms and conditions clearly state  “the contribution will be repaid”.  That is a loan.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes between three and five years for these investments to produce returns.  We have received over $20 million so far in royalties repaid to the government.  We expect that all of these investments will be repaid to the Government of Canada.</p>

Today across Canada students are demonstrating against rising tuition fees.  Ninety per cent of these students repay their loans.  If they do not, they are hounded to death.  Compare that with corporations that have repaid less than 2% on technology partnerships loans.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rumsfeld said clearly last week that they will respect the Geneva conventions.  Of course there will be a determination done under the Geneva conventions to determine  if they are prisoners of war or not.

The determination has to be done by the people who have custody of the prisoners. In this case, they are the Americans.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the first line of defence for Canada is our customs officers. Yesterday in the House the Deputy Prime Minister stated that we must not create an apprehension of problems that do not exist. Unfortunately numerous reports prove otherwise. In one instance a passenger at Pearson airport became violent, abusive, tore up papers and threw them at the officer. When he was arrested the officer was bitten in the thigh.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Yesterday the minister's colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that we take the position that there must be some kind of process to make the determination of the status of prisoners that are captured by Canada.  There is no process in place now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the minister a very straightforward question. Why does Canada continue to say that we will turn over prisoners to the United States when there is no process in place?  Why are we showing such contempt for international law?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Rumsfeld himself has given this assurance and we will continue to ensure that this does take place in accordance with international law and the Geneva conventions.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of  privilege. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During oral question period, the Prime Minister accused me, along with my colleagues, of having become the defenders of terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, and I quote, “Therefore, it was not imprudent on the part of the government, in the context of our fight against terrorism, to side with a nation that was attacked and not become the defenders of terrorists, as the Bloc Quebecois has”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am raising this question of privilege because this is, in fact, an attack on our reputation, not only my own but that of all members of the Bloc Quebecois.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very beginning of this crisis, after the terrible events of September 11, we have raised the necessity of dealing with the terrorists, but in so doing, to quote the Prime Minister, “setting the example of democracy, not becoming like them, that is not respecting international conventions”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point we are raising today is that the terrorists must,  of course, be attacked, but democracy and international conventions must still be respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore calling upon the Prime Minister to withdraw his statement.  This is an attack on myself personally, on the members of the Bloc Quebecois, and I would say also against parliament and against logic.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today is February 6, 2002.  Hon. members will know that this must be a bittersweet day for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen of Canada. It was 50 years ago today that she received word of the passing of Her beloved father, thereby making today the 50th anniversary of Her accession to the throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has given notice of a motion for an appropriate humble address to Her Majesty marking this occasion and we will proceed with that motion in the very near future.    At that time I am certain members will want to more fully express their best wishes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems appropriate, however, that the House should take note of this event on the actual day of the anniversary.  Her Majesty has travelled widely in Canada throughout Her reign and we happily anticipate another royal tour this autumn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty is the 40th monarch of Her line, going back to William the Conqueror.  Only four of Her predecessors reigned longer than she now has. We look forward to many more happy years of Her reign.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-123452"></A><a HREF="#Int-123459"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-123447"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the official opposition I  thank the government House leader for his remarks and express our regret that we did not have the opportunity to pass in the House today a humble address to Her Majesty.  I understand that one has been presented on the order paper and fittingly so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty years ago today the 25 year old Princess Elizabeth was awoken in a safari lodge in Kenya to learn that Her father,  King George VI, had died.  She  ascended to the throne, Regina Dei gratia, as the 40th monarch since William the Conqueror and as the fifth Sovereign of Canada since Confederation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then she has dedicated herself unswervingly to Her duty as the head of state of over two dozen countries, the head of the Commonwealth, the patron of hundreds or organizations and regiments including many in Canada and as the Queen of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She visited every part of Her Canadian Dominion addressing Canadians in both of our official languages.  She signed into law our newly patriated Constitution Act in 1982.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty, to whom each of  us in the House has sworn allegiance, opened parliament in 1957 on Her first of 20 official visits to Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we prepare for Her golden jubilee visit this October, it is my hope that she will be again invited to do so  in a concrete demonstration that the crown remains and integral element of parliament, what Eugene Forsey described as “the first principle of Canadian government”.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This institution is solidly anchored in the past. The crown symbolizes the protection of the rights of the most humble citizen by the monarchy, across the kingdom. In exchange, we owe our sincere allegiance to the monarchy. I believe that it was John Farthing who explained this the best. The historian said that “freedom wears a crown”. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such occasions are rare.  The last golden jubilee that we celebrated as Canadians was in 1891, the year that our first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, died, and the 50th year of Queen Victoria's reign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an age when Canadians are more concerned about their sovereignty and their role in the world, the monarchy is one of the distinctive Canadian institutions that sets us apart from our American neighbours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as members of this place will come and go, depending on the political fashions of the day, but the crown goes on as the ultimate symbol of our order and the continuity in our constitutional monarchy.  Queen Elizabeth's 50 years of selfless service have personified our crown with dignity and grace.  Long may she reign.  God save the Queen.   Vive la reine.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we respectfully acknowledge the comments made by the government House leader regarding the Queen, and it is our opinion that  members from the other provinces  of Canada have the right to feel such respect towards Her Majesty the Queen of England. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we in no way recognize the authority she claims to exercise over Canada, and particularly over Quebec, and more importantly over our institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the Queen in Canada are the Governor General and the Lieutenants Governor in the provinces, and this institution, for which we have no admiration whatsoever and which we believe   is greatly outdated, needs to be subject to an indepth reform as soon as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our political party sincerely believes that if members from the other provinces, and Liberal members from Quebec, want a monarch  who hails from another country to be the head of their country, they are free to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois members elected to the House represent citizens who want a sovereign country that is not led by any foreign monarch, but one that is elected by the people that he or she will lead.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has presided over the British Commonwealth with great dignity, enjoys much affection from Canadians and symbolizes for many the merits of a constitutional monarchy in which the head of state, or in Canada's case her representative, is separate and apart from the ongoing political struggles of the day.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a humbling experience to stand in this storied House on behalf of my colleagues and constituents and offer sincere congratulations to Queen Elizabeth II on the 50th golden anniversary of her reign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy burden of public service and constitutional duty devolved on the Queen when she was only 25 years old and the mother of two was an awesome and daunting task.  For half a century she has, with grace and complete and total integrity, discharged her constitutional obligations to the people of this country and throughout the Commonwealth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pledge made by the 21 year old Princess Elizabeth, and later made by her again as Majesty in her coronation oath, was to serve the people however long she may live.  What more noble promise can there be than to serve the people and to preserve the rule of law?  There is none higher.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her Internet message this morning, the Queen expressed the hope that this jubilee year would not be nostalgic but rather an occasion on which to look forward with confidence and pride.  We will do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, on the anniversary of the succession, many Canadians of an earlier generation than mine personally remember with gratitude the life and service of the Queen's father, King George VI, who died 50 years ago today.  He came to the throne in a time of crisis,   led the people through the second war and died much too young. Today we think as well of a widow of 50 years who forged an innovative and dynamic life of public service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my lifetime, and for a majority of Canadians, we have known only one person as our sovereign.  Queen Elizabeth has always been there.  There has been constitutional stability and we have grown up in a peaceable kingdom. Too often we take things for granted or because they are familiar.  We fail to notice them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Queen's Canadian parliament.  The laws we pass are the Queen's laws to keep the Queen's peace.  Those who sit in the cabinet serve the crown in the name of the people, not as the masters of the people. At the very core of parliament and responsible government are the crown and the concepts of duty and service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 50 years Queen Elizabeth has fulfilled her pledge to the people of Canada.  She has not been just a fair weather friend.  In difficult times, in difficult circumstances, she has been loyal to us. We now have the honour to return that loyalty with gratitude. She has remained faithful to us in her duty and we thank her.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the right hon. leader of the PC/DR coalition and my colleagues and constituents, we send to her our personal best wishes. We look forward with pleasure to her visit in this jubilee year and we echo the prayer from the anthem:  Long may she reign.</p>

John McCallum (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to present  Bill C-49, the Budget Implementation Act, 2001 for second reading. This bill would implement  many of the measures announced in  the 2001 budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by giving an overview of the 2001 budget, which will set the context of the measures contained in this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to go back  for a moment to September 11. The terrorist attacks perpetrated that day in the United States constituted first and foremost a great human tragedy, measured in lost lives, destroyed families and rekindled fears,as the minister of finance pointed out. Budget 2001 deals with the economic impact of this tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on a long term government plan to build a strong economy and to ensure a safe society, but it also responds to Canadians' immediate concerns regarding the economy and security following the events of September 11, in four ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the budget stimulates the economy in this period of global downturn and uncertainty. It provides Canadians with the means to fully benefit from the expected recovery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it acts to build personal and economic security by protecting Canadians, by keeping terrorists out of our country, and by maintaining a secure, open and efficient border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it keeps the nation’s finances healthy by balancing the budget this year and for the next two years.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, it fully protects the $100 billion tax cut announced in October 2000 and the $23.4 billion in increased support  for health care and early childhood development announced in September 2000.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure members of the House that the events of September 11 have not shaken the government's budgetary convictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government continues to lay the foundation for a better future. It continues to invest in human resources, to cut taxes, to pay down the debt and to build a strong economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand by our commitment to reduce the debt. In addition, the 2001 budget confirms that the government will continue to implement its long term plan of investing in the future without falling back into a deficit situation. This is the result of our prudent approach.</p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having given a background regarding the budget, let me turn now to an overview of the bill.  The major points the bill seeks to achieve can be summarized as follows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with respect to transportation there is the creation of the Canadian air transport security authority, along with the introduction of the air travellers security charge. Second, there are some measures to improve the income and business tax system, as well as the employment insurance system. Third, there are measures to establish the Canadian strategic infrastructure fund and the Canada fund for Africa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak briefly to each of these major areas in turn, beginning with the Canadian air transport security authority. As part of the government's comprehensive response to the events of September 11, the 2001 budget committed $2.2 billion over five years to enhanced air travel security. This commitment is crucial to assuring air travellers that Canada continues to have one of the safest and most secure air transportation systems in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air security services will now be consolidated under the new Canadian air transport security authority which will provide key air transport security services, a consistent and integrated air transport security system across the country, and enhanced security performance standards and services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority will be responsible in the following areas.  The first is the certification of screening contractors and officers.  The second is pre-board screening of passengers and their belongings, taking over this function from the airlines and of others who have access to aircraft or restricted areas through screening points. The third is the acquisition, deployment and maintenance of explosives detection systems and conventional pre-board screening equipment at airports. The fourth  is federal contributions for airport policing related to civil aviation security measures. The fifth is contracting with the RCMP for armed police on board aircraft.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport Canada will continue to regulate and monitor the provision of security services while the new authority will be responsible for delivery.  This separation between service delivery and regulating and monitoring will enhance checks and balances in the system. Air travellers can now be assured that Canada continues to have one of the safest air transportation systems in the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of the air travellers security charge.  The enhanced air travel security system will be funded by a new air travellers security charge.  The charge will be collected by air carriers or their agents when airline tickets are purchased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhanced air travel security will principally benefit air travellers using the air transportation system.  A user charge is therefore fiscally responsible and reasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travel within Canada the total cost of the charge will be $12 for a one way ticket and $24 for a round trip.  The charge on a ticket to the continental U.S. will be $12.   It will be $24 for a ticket to travel outside Canada and the continental U.S.  These amounts are inclusive of GST where the GST applies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travel in Canada the charge will apply to flights connecting the 90 airports where the government is planning security enhancements. Small aircraft such as those carrying only four to six passengers as well as certain specialty services such as air ambulance services will be exempt. All proceeds of the charge including net GST will be used to fund the enhanced air travel security system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point on this issue is a critical and very simple one.  If revenues exceed costs over time, the government will reduce the charge.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at the measures having to do with the EI system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first measure I would like to examine improves parental benefits  under the EI program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve the support provided for families, among other measures, the 2000 budget extended the duration of parental benefits under the EI program from 10 to 35 weeks, thus allowing parents to spend more time at home with a newborn or a newly adopted child. Bill C-49 further improves these benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current EI program, certain seriously ill women may not qualify for extended parental benefits because of the 50 week ceiling on the combined total of sick leave, maternity benefits and parental benefits an individual is allowed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-49 increases this ceiling by one week for each week of sick leave taken by a mother during her pregnancy or while she is receiving parental benefits, so that she may benefit fully from the special benefits. This change will take effect on March 3, 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second measure takes into account the fact that parents must now apply for parental benefits in the year following the birth or adoption of a child. This may limit benefits when a child is hospitalized for a long period after birth or adoption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow a bit of leeway to parents who want to start applying for the parental benefit once the child comes home from hospital, they will now have up to two years to apply.  This change will come into effect once Bill C-49 is passed.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third element, the Canada strategic infrastructure fund. As I said, the government's long term goals are to build a strong economy and a secure society and to improve the quality of life for Canadians. The strategic investments in the 2001 budget help achieve these objectives by dealing with today's needs and bridging to a better tomorrow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern economy of the 21st century requires a backbone of sound physical infrastructure to sustain the nation's growth and our quality of life. Canada must have the physical infrastructure it needs to succeed. Previous budgets allocated funding to improve provincial and municipal infrastructure. In particular the 2000 budget introduced both the infrastructure Canada program and the strategic highway infrastructure program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the need for additional support for large strategic infrastructure projects, Bill C-49 will establish the Canada strategic infrastructure fund with a minimum funding of $2 billion as set out in the 2001 budget. This new fund will compliment other federal infrastructure initiatives such as the two programs I just mentioned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with provincial and municipal governments in the private sector, the Canada strategic infrastructure fund will provide assistance for large infrastructure projects in areas like highways and rail, local transportation, tourism, urban development, and water and sewage treatment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments in these projects will stimulate job creation and confidence in the short term and will make the economy more productive and competitive in the medium term. The minister of infrastructure will  be responsible for all government infrastructure initiatives to better co-ordinate all  government activities in this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the subject of the Canada fund for Africa. As my hon. colleagues will recall, the Speech from the Throne last January indicated the long term well-being of Canada and Canadians depends upon success in improving global human security, prosperity and development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the G-8 summit in Genoa last July, African leaders presented their proposals and G-8 leaders, Canada included, pledged to support this initiative. The partnership is about Africans taking control of their own development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then the Prime Minister has restated his commitment that development in Africa will be one of the principal themes of the G-8 summit that we will host this coming June. As was stated in question period today, the Prime Minister's support  recently in New York for this project received strong support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of this commitment the 2001 budget announced $500 million for African development. The new Canada fund for Africa will provide $500 million in funding for activities that will help reduce poverty, provide primary education and set Africa on a sustainable path to a brighter future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to investing in skills and learning. Another strategic investment in the budget involves these very things. The acquisition of skills and learning is further encouraged  through a number of changes to the tax system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, tax assistance will be provided to help apprentice vehicle mechanics cope with their extraordinary costs. A second measure affects adult students who received government assistance to pay their tuition fees for basic education at the primary or secondary school levels. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assistance must be included in income without any offsetting credits. For many the tax cost of receiving this assistance is a real burden and discourages them from advancing their education. Bill C-49 will exempt from tax the tuition assistance for basic adult education provided under certain programs including employment insurance. This measure will apply to eligible tuition assistance received after 1996.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third measure will help more students undertake lifelong learning. Beginning in 2002 the education tax credit will be extended to students who have received financial assistance for post-secondary education under certain government training programs including employment insurance.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes would provide significant tax relief to approximately 65,000 Canadians for upgrading their skills and give them access to the same tax benefits that are available to other post-secondary students.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will briefly mention a  number of tax measures to improve the personal income tax and business tax system. First, there would be an improvement of the tax treatment of intergenerational transfers of woodlots. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we would make permanent the 1997 budget measure that provided special tax assistance for donations of certain securities to public charities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a measure to improve the system for providing GST credits. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to provide a cash flow benefit to small business, federal corporate tax instalment payments for January, February and March 2002 would be deferred for at least six months without penalty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, although this is not an exhaustive list of measures, the budget allows full deductibility for the cost of meals provided to employees at temporary construction work camps where employees could not be expected to return home each day.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Canada's air system is among the safest in the world.  The new air security authority will make it even safer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge for air passenger security is financially wise and reasonable, and it is only logical that the costs of these new expenses relating to security be borne by passengers using the airlines rather than all taxpayers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the parental benefits available under EI will help families of newborns or newly adopted children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Strategic Infrastructure Fund will make it possible for Canada to have the material infrastructure it requires for success in the 21st century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Africa Fund is concrete proof that Canadians have not lost sight of their obligation to help those who are less well off than themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the income tax changes help enhance the simplicity and fairness of our taxation system.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 budget reflects the decisions reached by the government in these uncertain times.   Managing the economy in hard times is a matter of balance.  The 2001 budget is the best example of this.  It provides the support that is essential during a crucial period, but not at the expense of past progress or future prospects.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and address the budget implementation act, Bill C-49.   I regret to tell the hon. member who just spoke that it does not enjoy the support of the official opposition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before in the House, this is the worst budget the finance minister has ever brought down.  Frankly, it is a disgrace to see spending rise by 9.3% and to see some  other things that have occurred. We had a $6.2 billion planning deficit  until this year when the government conveniently changed how the books were kept to avoid the embarrassment of having the deficit exposed by its own documents. These are not just my observations.  Others have observed them.  I will say more about that in a moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The markets have passed judgment on the budget.  We saw this in the precipitous fall of the dollar in the last several weeks.  The decline has been absolutely amazing despite the amateurish efforts of the government to talk up the dollar, as if anyone could talk up the dollar on a permanent basis.  It can only be done in the short run.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is confused.  We have seen that in the events of the last couple of days. The government is talking about changing the infrastructure program it proposed from an arm's length program into one run by the Deputy Prime Minister and subject to the caprices and whims of a politician.  At bottom that is what the Deputy Prime Minister is.  Being a politician he is always tempted to use government money for his own political ends.  It is a dangerous situation and we need to be wary of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the government propose another accounting trick in the budget where it would take $500 million and put it into a trust.  This is what it did with the Africa Fund.  The finance minister today said no, that would not happen.  He said the money  would go into debt retirement.  The government has been stung by the accusation that it has not retired debt this year. Even $500 million is a pittance when we have a debt of $547 billion. It would take hundreds of years to pay down the debt if we proceeded at a pace of just $500 million a year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is a disgrace for other reasons.  At a time when the whole world has been rocked by the events of September 11 and when  the first role of government must always be to protect its citizens, it is an absolute disgrace that so little emphasis in the budget was put on protecting the public.  I will talk in greater detail about that in a moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been revealed that the government has  made a $3.3 billion accounting error à la Enron in the last couple of weeks.  This points to how money seems to flow through the fingers of the government like water.  It calls into question whether the government has done an adequate job of scrutinizing all it does to find waste and mismanagement.  I would argue  it has not.  I will say more about that in a moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this has been a terrible budget.  It does not do the finance minister any credit.  The finance minister has won plaudits even from the opposition for some though not all of the things he has done. However he blew his reputation completely with this budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will offer as evidence  some newspaper commentary we saw in the wake of the  budget.  Here is one from the Montreal <i>Gazette</i>. Commenting that the finance minister “spends like Santa”, it says:</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I offer these quotes as evidence of my assertion that this is the worst budget the minister has ever brought down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say a few things about what the budget did not do. It did not inspire confidence in the ailing dollar. The fall in the dollar since the budget came down is evidence of that. It has done nothing and will do nothing to improve our productivity. That can only happen when the government withdraws to some degree from the economy, is less intrusive, lowers taxes and provides some kind of economic vision for the future. That has not happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result the budget has done nothing to offer new job opportunities at a time when unemployment is rising. Surely to goodness the government should be concerned about that but it was not reflected in the budget. The budget has done nothing to offer new opportunities for investment in Canada, something which is completely linked to the concept of productivity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, there is no vision to help Canada reach its incredible potential as a nation. The government did not rebalance its spending. In the wake of September 11 that is shocking. In not doing so  the government is almost guilty of gross neglect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For  every year in the $170 billion budget a spending envelope of about $15 billion would go to grants and subsidies. I will not say the entire $15 billion consists of things that can be cut out of government without harming people.  However billions of dollars in the envelope are examples of unnecessary and low priority spending. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants to artists and regional development grants have been shown over and over again to distort the economy and hurt businesses that are making it on their own. They are always subject to politics. We have often revealed in the House how the government rewards its political friends by handing out grants and subsidies so liberally. I say that both figuratively and literally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In not addressing the $15 billion envelope of grants and subsidies the government did not find new money without raising taxes that could have been used to help  it fulfill the most important role of any government. What is the primary role of government? It is to uphold the law. No society can long survive unless there is a government that consistently upholds the law.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do that we would need   a strong criminal justice system.  We would need the  police   to enforce it.  We would need  good controls on our borders and  on immigration.  We would also need a strong national defence and a strong intelligence arm.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the record of the government is to take what is the core business of government and chop it to the bone while it expands spending in all   other areas that really are slush funds, in my judgment, and money the government uses to help it win elections.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that organizations like CSIS, which is our intelligence arm in helping to protect the Canadian public, has been slashed to the bone.  Previous to this budget, the government introduced cuts to CSIS of about 28%, and even with the money it put back into CSIS, we are still at 1993 funding levels in inflation adjusted dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSIS,   an  organization that has been charged with finding out if there are terrorists or criminal elements trying to get into the country, if they are active in the country, what they are doing, how active they are and if they are infiltrating government, for instance,    has been cut to the bone under the leadership of the Liberal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should be roundly criticized for that because when it does something like that it puts    public security at risk.  We have seen   many examples in the last several months of terrorists who were allowed into the country, in some cases being sought by international authorities in connection with the efforts of al-Qaeda and perhaps even in connection with what happened on September 11.  That is disgraceful and we should not be allowing it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not to say that  could never happen, even with a fully funded organization, but  obviously the government has to put  more priority on it.  The same applies to immigration.  We pointed to    problems over and over again in the House.  We think immigration is positive   and it is a good thing but it does not mean that we just let everybody in. There should be some scrutiny at the borders but that does not require a bunch of new laws, laws like the government gave to itself in the wake of September 11 that allow  it to do all kinds of things without consulting parliament, things that are contrary to our common law tradition, where the government can arrest people for 72 hours without allowing them to access a lawyer and without pressing charges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really need more officials at the border to handle all the cases we have but we do not have  that.  It is well know that there are many thousands of people who have been allowed into Canada as refugees   and were subsequently turned down but     we have no idea if they actually left the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were they turned down?  They were suspected, in many cases, of being a security risk.  We have no idea whether they left the country.  There are some estimates that  as many as 27,000 of those people may be running loose in Canada.  Rather obviously, that should be a huge concern of the government but the government has always shortchanged security even though it is the primary role that any government should play.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a few years ago that the Canadian Alliance  pointed     out in the House that the RCMP in British Columbia did not have enough money to put new tires on its  cars.  It did not have enough money to put fuel in its  boats and planes, and to do drug interdiction on the west coast.  It was an absolute disgrace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary role of government is to set the laws and enforce them because no country or society can exist without that.  However the government had no money for that while it spent billions upon billions for discretionary spending on all kinds of crazy things.  That was a disgrace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now trying to play catch up, but it really is an indictment of the government that it made it such a low priority for so many years.  Over the last couple of days we   have had examples of how the government has failed our customs officials who are the first line of defence when people come into Canada.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people enter the country the first people they meet are our customs officials. Customs officials must  uphold dozens and dozens of statutes in Canada.  We have heard stories of how customs officers, who are not armed by the way, have    been so afraid of some of the people  they are dealing with at the border that they have actually allowed them into the country because they themselves were not armed and feared that the person on the other side of the window was.  We have heard from customs officials themselves that this has occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are arguing that the government has done a terrible job of looking after our customs officials to make sure   they are adequately protected and   can make sure that these people who are suspected of criminal activity or even terrorist activity not be allowed into the country or in fact   arrested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was revealed the other day that customs officials at Pearson airport do not have any protective gear.  They do not have pepper spray, batons or flak jackets.  However  we understand that immigration officials have been issued those things.  Is that not a little ironic?  The customs officials are the  first ones to deal with new arrivals into Canada but they are not given those things.  It is only after these people have been pulled aside by the customs officials that they are handed over to the immigration officials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked the Deputy Prime Minister about that  yesterday and he was quite confused about it all.  He did not know that it was happening.  We have it on good authority   that it is happening. We want the government to start taking the security of Canada seriously, something that was simply not reflected in the budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it ironic that in the last number of days there have been a lot of concerns coming from the Liberal backbenches and actually even from former cabinet ministers, like Lloyd Axworthy, about sovereignty in the wake of what happened on September 11 and in the wake of discussions about co-operating more fully with our allies, especially the United States, on security measures, for instance.  The reason this is very ironic is because the same people who have repeatedly voted against increasing funding for Canada's military, the RCMP and CSIS, are the same people who complain about a threat to our sovereignty by the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not worry about the threats to our sovereignty by terrorists or criminals that are caused by a lack of funding for   officials who have to greet   dangerous people at our borders.    However the moment we talk about working in a co-operative way with the United States and  exercising our sovereignty by making a decision in the interest of Canada to work with the United States,  they rise up on their hind legs and start to scream bloody murder.  I think they are guilty of gross hypocrisy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not   end there.    What do we mean when we talk about sovereignty?  I think   we mean  that if a country is sovereign it has the ability to make decisions that affect its own destiny.  What happens in Canada if we as a country make the decision to work co-operatively with the United States on issues that we think will benefit Canada?  What if we exercise our sovereignty in that way? Is it offensive to members across the way if we make that decision?  We are exercising our sovereignty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the issue here is   the issue of sovereignty.  What members across the way have a problem with is co-operation with the United States of America, which  many of them frankly resent.  They resent the Americans because they have become so extraordinarily wealthy at a time when our standard of living is falling against that of the United States.  They resent them because they are able to put more money into public health  care than Canada has with its socialized medical system.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have become resentful.  They mask this resentment with the argument about sovereignty but let us look at it for what it   is.  It is bitterness and resentment, and it is time   it was exposed.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my friends across the way honour me with their presence in wake of the speech I am giving.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a few words about something that is perhaps the greatest flaw in this budget and it is really the greatest flaw of the government in general. The Liberal government has been in power since 1993.  Where it falls short, more so than in any other way, is with respect to the economy.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government makes decisions every year about how to spend roughly $170 billion of taxpayer  money.   I think it is engaging in a game.   It takes the hard earned dollars of taxpayers and appropriate them to itself in the form of taxes and then hands the money  back to those same taxpayers and tells them to be grateful.  That is fine as far as it goes.  However, as members across the way know, that has a terrible impact ultimately on the economy.  I will  get into that in more detail in just a moment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that in the last number of years Canada's standard of living has fallen rather dramatically.  I want to quote some statistics in order to help make that case. The 1990s really was a decade of drift in Canada.  I want to touch on some numbers and I hope members will allow me to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes drifted higher as a share of the economy in 2000 to 44.3% of GDP, up from 44% in 1999.  The Canadian living standard fell $44, or about 0.2%, from $17,915 in 1989 to $17,871 in 2000.  Over that entire decade our standard of living actually went down. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. standard of living increased by $2,573 or about 13% from U.S. $20,546 in 1989 to $23,119 in 2000, an average annual increase of 1.1%. An average American could buy more in 2000 than they could in 1989. They were much richer.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between Americans and Canadians increased 61% between 1989 and 2000.  By 2000, Canadians were just 70.3% as well off as Americans, down from 79.3% in 1989.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to underline that those  are not my numbers.  It was just a couple of years ago that the former industry minister, now the Deputy Prime Minister, raised these issues as the industry minister in the House.  He said that the average standard of living for Canadians at that time was lower than that of the poorest of the poor U.S. states, Alabama and  Mississippi. That was a tragedy.   Does anyone know who that was a  real tragedy for?  It was a real tragedy for the poorest of poor Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years I have sat in this place and listened to  the government lecture us on  how it cared about the little guy.  However when the economy does not move at its full capacity, who are the people who are hurt?  It is not the people with big incomes  and   all kinds of education. It is not the people with all kinds of contacts.  It is not part of the family compact.  It is not people who are connected to the government.  Those are not the people who are hurt.  It is the people without skills.  It is the people who come from underdeveloped regions of the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason   our economy does not move at full capacity and why we have an unemployment rate that has gone from 7% to 8% to 8.4% in the last several months is because the government decided it was willing to sacrifice economic growth in order to sustain billions upon billions of dollars in funding that it can use to politically benefit it and its colleagues. That is a moral outrage and a disgrace  but  it happens every budget.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Liberals should do, and they know this because they have economists who sit in their caucus,  is pare out the unnecessary spending.  By definition, if it is unnecessary, it is a waste and should not be in there.  They should turn it back to people in the form of lower taxes, which creates more activity in the economy and broadens the tax base.  When  more businesses start up because of more activity, more jobs are created and eventually  the unemployment rate is lowered.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best example is the recent expansion in the United States. I pointed to this many times in the House.  During the height of the U.S. expansion, the unemployment rate in the black community in the United States, which traditionally has been the poorest ethnic community in the United States, dropped to 7%.  It was the same as our national unemployment rate in Canada. That was a wonderful thing because  the black community had been disadvantaged for so many decades in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that great expansion, many companies that could not find workers when the unemployment rate was 4%   went into areas where the unemployment was very high.  They went into ghettos.   They said they would train the people because they wanted them to come to work for them.  Maybe these people had been on welfare their entire lives, or did not have the skills or had not finished school.  However the companies  wanted  them to work for them.  The companies said that if they did,  they would not only get a wage but they would get some training, some contacts,  some confidence and  some hope, something they had not had that until then. That is the great triumph of an economy that is moving at full capacity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, our economy cannot move at full capacity because it so weighed down by taxes and debt that the government has built up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to change that is to change the entire course of what we do.  We do not just maintain the status quo or make it worse by increasing spending by 9.3%, which was what the government did last time around.  We shed all that heavy baggage of extraordinary spending that is not needed and   offer it back to people in the form of lower taxes.  We cut unnecessary regulation and  pay down debt.  The government should  focus on its core role, which is to ensure that we have a peaceful country and that people are protected and secure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  that were done, eventually  underdeveloped regions of Canada,  just like occurred in the United States in the recent expansion, would see industries move into them, like Cape Breton, Newfoundland, or northern Canada, northern Ontario, northern Alberta, northern Saskatchewan.  Industries would move there because of the pools of labour, those people who do not have jobs but want them.  Pretty soon people    would have the opportunity they did not have before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the shame of the government that it has never ever recognized this obvious fact that it needs to do things to make our economy work much faster so that people who are on the bottom end  and who have never had a chance in Canada will finally have some kind of an opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I promise the government that as long as I am in opposition, I am going to harry it on this every chance I get.  It  has been completely hypocritical to the point  where the Liberals speak forever in this place about how much they care, yet on the other hand, their actions show something completely different.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am simply going to conclude by saying the budget implementation act should not be supported. Again, this is a disgraceful budget, the worst effort ever by the finance minister. We see that in recent developments where the government is still trying to tinker with it two months after it coming out. We see the judgment of the markets in the form of a falling dollar. It is rather obvious the markets do not care for it and think the government is out of control. A 9.3% spending increase is absolutely shocking. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the government has not put any emphasis on providing for our military,   those brave men and women who are going to Afghanistan. It has not put a priority on protecting them by funding them adequately and ensuring  they are well equipped. The same applies to customs officers, immigration officials, RCMP and CSIS agents, all those people who do so much to protect our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members around this place to vote against Bill C-49, the worst budget ever produced by the government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was explaining to my colleague, the Bloc Quebecois critic for international affairs, how this budget had totally changed if one is to belive the statements made yesterday by the finance minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time I see a finance minister, eight weeks after tabling the budget, completely change his mind on some basic aspects of the government fiscal policy that was  read here in the House, described in the budget documents and announced during several scrums after the budget speech. This gives us a peculiar image of this government, especially the finance minister, who does not seem to know where he is going. This does not make sense and I will give two rather obvious examples of what happened yesterday. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight weeks ago, we were told that during the current fiscal year, 2001-2002, the finance minister would not spend one dime on paying down the debt because of the  downturn we are  now experiencing and other priorities the government had, including investing in infrastructure to encourage economic growth and setting up a fund to help Africa, which is welcome news under the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, and I will borrow the phrase used by the Prime Minister during oral question period, the finance minister flip-flopped magically. He has now decided to apply any surplus accumulated at the end of fiscal 2001-2002, the fiscal year ending March 31, 2002, to the debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the foundation, it remains to be seen, we do not know yet. The infrastructure foundation has become the Strategic Infrastructure Foundation and we do not know the rules yet. We do not know how it will work. It would have been too simple to simply renew existing agreements, especially with the Quebec government, regarding the infrastructure program and allocate new money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to understand where the finance minister is going. Not only did he say yesterday  that he would apply any surplus, which might be bigger than planned, to the debt, but today during oral question period he is saying surpluses are dwindling  and might be insignificant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we understand what the government is up to, in terms of management, when in just  eight weeks, the finance minister  changed his policy on the use of surpluses, in a few hours, modified his vision concerning  the scope of these surpluses, and in a few minutes, went  from the infrastructure fund to the infrastructure foundation, after we were told  yesterday that the foundation  no longer existed? The unbelievable confusion around  this minister's management makes us think that he doesn't know where he is going. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we have confidence in the initiatives he has announced and which were in the budget tabled eight weeks ago? Since yesterday, he has put himself in a shameful contradiction in terms of the debt and the infrastructure fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before getting into  the bill and its various proposals for review and comment, I would like to recall certain elements   of the financial framework designed to help assess these measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is wrong to say—as the Minister of Finance did today while he  said the opposite yesterday—that surpluses are not important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will  end  the current fiscal  year with substantial surpluses, probably  double  what the Minister of Finance  initially announced. Even taking into consideration the new initiatives totalling about $4 billion that were handed out eight weeks ago in the budget, the net surpluses after subtracting the cost of all these initiatives will probably exceed $6 billion.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the initiatives announced eight weeks ago, we had anticipated that  surpluses between $10 and $12 billion. Even after factoring  in  the initiatives announced in the budget eight weeks ago, there will still be a  6 or $7 billion surplus. People must know that it is still possible to do things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, this  is rather astonishing, yet   the Minister wonders why he is not being taken seriously and why he is regarded  more like a stand-up comic than a real manager of public funds. Yesterday, I read  the budget over, because I was not sure I had clearly understood the Minister of Finance and his statements regarding the debt and the foundation compared to the infrastructure fund.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing his estimates, I noticed that he overestimated his expenditures. There is a $11 billion year over year increase in expenditures, which is not supported by the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, he underestimated his revenues. For example, if one looks at the employment insurance fund, one sees that, a few weeks after the actuary for the fund indicated that the surplus could exceed $7 billion, the Minister of Finance wrote in his budget that the surplus in the EI fund would be about $3.5 billion. That is half of the amount estimated by the chief actuary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must quit taking people for fools. It must quit doing these kinds of flip  flops on such important issues. What do people on the outside think of the Minister of Finance and this government when they see such flip flops eight weeks after the tabling of a budget? They do  not take them seriously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to New York City last weekend, I met  business people. I also met forecasters, serious people. And I can tell you that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are not taken seriously when they show up in New York City saying that everything is fine, that our fiscal house is in order, particularly since we have just learned, eight weeks after the tabling of a budget, that there has been a change in policy and that there will not be a debate on the issue of monetary instability and monetary integration for the Americas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People must not be taken for fools. Those who take an interest in the evolution of the Canadian economy, in public finances, in the budgets and in the great debates on currency know full well that when the government steers the House away from this kind of debate, it is because it does not want to talk about these issues. And if it does not want to talk about them, it is because there is a problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Minister of Finance tells them “Perhaps we could advertise in the <i>New York Times</i> and in the <i>Washington Post</i>, to sell the Canadian dollar”. It is not smart at all to say such things. It creates  doubt in the financial sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say “If there is no problem,  why  advertise in the <i>New York Times</i> and in the <i>Washington Post</i> to promote the value of the Canadian dollar and say that it is not appreciated at its fair value?” By doing so, we are drawing attention to  the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government may  spend billions of dollars in advertising, but this will not enhance the competitiveness of Canadian businesses versus American ones, and that is the main reason why the value of the Canadian dollar has been decreasing over the past 30 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this will not convince international speculators, who make billions of dollars on infinitesimal variations of secondary currencies such as the Canadian dollar, to stop making billions by speculating. This is totally ridiculous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately,  ridicule does not kill, otherwise a number of government members would no longer be around. It does not make sense to manage public funds the way the Minister of Finance has been doing, especially in the past 24 hours. That is unbelievable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also dubious and questionable decisions in this budget—I am going back to the specific bill, Bill C-49—particularly the imposition of a tax on domestic air transportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some sad events occurred on September 11 in the United States. If there is one sector that was directly hit, and in a catastrophic way, it was the air transportation industry. And, in his great wisdom and with surpluses that far exceed what he claims to have available for the current fiscal year, the Minister of Finance has decided to impose a new tax on air transportation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a nice way to help the airline industry. What a nice way to get the economy back on track, as we have been asking him to do since September, because we were already experiencing a slowdown, and September 11 just hastened things. What a nice way to help the airline industry, and  regional development too. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ill-advised—and I am being polite when I say that—to impose a tax on air transportation  services provided by small carriers, particularly those serving remote regions. They have enough problems as it is, but the government imposes a new tax on them. What a bright idea.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, some regional carriers are pulling out of some areas, because the routes are no longer financially viable.  Because of this tax that is coming up, it will be even less worthwhile.  Air travel will no longer be competitive.  The people in the regions will be considered second class citizens.  We have just learned that Air Alma has dropped its Alma-Montreal service, and recently Alma-Magdalen Islands as well.  What sort of country will we end up with?  Only someone who was not in his right mind would impose such measures.  There are plenty of questions to be answered about this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget implementation bill, the airports where security is improved with the funds from this tax have been classified.  It will be collected at 20 Quebec airports, for example, and the charge will range from $12 to $24  per ticket, as if the price of tickets were not already high enough.  I will remind hon. members that the price of air travel  has risen 9.2% since 1983 in Canada, overall, while there has been a drop of  43% in the United States over the same period. This is a fine way to improve our competitive edge.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of making ridiculous statements, like saying they will bail out the Canadian dollar by putting ads in the <i>New York Times</i> or the  <i>Washington Post</i>, they should show more intelligence, and take some measures that are not counterproductive, unlike the ones in the airline sector.  The situation is totally ridiculous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might well wonder, in connection with the airports affected by these improvements to security, why there were 20 in Quebec out of the 90—all over the regions, as will be seen when I list them later, which is rather peculiar—whereas there are only 15 in Ontario.   Why is a greater need being felt to improve security in airports in Quebec than in those in Ontario?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that there are more airports in Quebec where this tax will have to be paid, more airports in Quebec that will be affected, as will the air carriers themselves, by this new tax, which will be detrimental to their competitiveness.  This means that there will probably be more residents in remote parts of Quebec whose areas will be served less frequently or certain routes will simply be eliminated altogether.  May we have an explanation of why this is the case?  This is the type of question that will be raised in committee.  We will have a lot of questions to ask.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the list of the affected airports throughout Quebec: Alma, Bagotville, Baie-Comeau, Chibougamau, Gaspé, Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Kuujjuaq,  La Grande Rivière, La Grande-3, La Grande-4, Blanc-Sablon, Mont-Joli, Montreal, Quebec City, Roberval, Rouyn-Noranda, Sept-Îles and Val-d'Or. Virtually all regions are affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do people really think terrorism will be an issue in Kuujjuaq, and that we should improve security there that much  in case something unfortunate happens?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, a little bit of logic helps. Once again, why are there more airports in Quebec than in Ontario that are dealt this blow against the competitiveness of airlines? Will the prejudice caused by  this charge be greater in Quebec than in Ontario? We need an answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like  the general content of the budget did, Bill C-49 makes us wonder about the abilities of the Minister of Finance. And we are left to wonder even more, after what happened in the last 24 hours. We have to ask whether the minister should let somebody else take over. It is fortunate the Deputy Prime Minister is there to put a semblance of order in  government business. Otherwise,  the government and its management would really not look good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois has always strived to improve things. Right after the events on September 11, we urged the government and the Minister of Finance, who is forever doing flip-flops, to help the economy weather the storm, but the minister did not listen.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, either late October or early November, we even presented a five-point emergency plan to help the businesses and workers who could be seriously affected by the economic downturn, not to say recession,   then anticipated. We even put down  suggestions in writing and sent them to the Minister of Finance, who has run out of new ideas and does not know where he is headed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said, “We will sit down at the drawing board. We will make some appropriate suggestions and we will give him a little help. He may have run out of ideas and have problems, but we have ideas on how to help people and companies”. We then made public our emergency plan, which included a real reform of employment insurance. Why? Because this government has slashed EI benefits and literally stolen from the pockets of unemployed workers and people who pay into the EI fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should never forget that the federal government is no longer putting a red cent into the fund. Proportionately speaking, the premiums paid by employers, employees, SMBs and average wage earners account for the bulk of the fund. But, year after year, for the last five years in particular,  this government has literally been stealing the surplus from the EI fund. This minister keeps telling us how well he is doing his job, but the real reason he has a surplus and can  look so good is that he has been stealing other people's money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our emergency plan included provisions for improving the EI system so as to help support the economy in two ways. First, by helping those who make the economy run and who were in danger of being affected by the downturn. We have seen the increase in unemployment in recent months. Our plan was to help these people qualify for EI, because many of them could have been excluded by the stringent and inhumane requirements imposed by this government. Our plan contained provisions for helping current and future unemployed workers with a humane and decent system, which would not be governed by completely inhumane and vicious criteria, like those this government introduced a few years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our plan provided for the injection of new funds into the economy. Let us not forget that each time there is a flow of new money, it can help boost the economy. It can help the regions through the economic downturn. We were told no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development made 17 recommendations. These were unanimous recommendations. Unanimity is not common here. All members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, including Liberal members, signed a report containing 17 recommendations designed  to improve the employment insurance plan by making  it more humane, more accessible and more universal. Right now, only 40% of Canadians are covered under the plan. Is it not stupid to have a plan that does not even cover the majority of the people it should help? It is absolutely ridiculous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite such unanimity—and we know the proverbial courage of Liberal members, who may say many things in committee but  later get their arms twisted and say nothing when it is time to vote because they all have the ambition of becoming ministers—they all voted in favour of the budget even though it contained only one measure out of the 17 recommendations. We do welcome this measure, which gives more flexibility to parents with children who are hospitalized for extended periods, because we, in  the Bloc Quebecois, fought for it. It was part of the  improvements we asked for so as not to exclude certain people, especially among the most disadvantaged. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques fought for this. Before him, it was my colleague, the member for Mercier, who is now our party's critic for foreign affairs. All of the Bloc Quebecois fought for these types of improvements. We are being shown an improvement when there were 17 recommendations that would have used part of the $7 billion surplus from the employment insurance fund, not all of the surplus. The measure proposed involves spending some $50 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must be joking when they say  “We are helping the unemployed”. One would have to be a heartless millionaire to propose this kind of thing and then say “we are helping the unemployed”, while proposing measures as insignificant as these. Eventually something is going to have to happen, because it is ridiculous to manage taxpayers money like this and  mislead Canadians every year with surplus forecasts that are way off.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had also asked, as part of our emergency plan, to anticipate—because we, on this side of the House, are responsible—measures which are not costly but which could provide a leg up for business, particularly in times of  crisis, after the events of September 11, to help them weather the economic turbulence that we experienced at that time, but also to help them get through the economic downturn, which had begun prior to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We proposed a measure that would cost the government virtually nothing. It was the deferral of corporate tax instalments. We know what businesses must pay periodically. We said, “Let us allow them to regroup. Let us allow them to assess the situation, take corrective measures,  in terms of managing their business, strategic planning, and as a result of the events and the downturn. And in order to give them a real hand, it would be a good idea to defer their tax payments, their corporate instalments, by six months”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mme Marois, in Quebec City, did not wait until December. She proposed this measure right away, and was applauded by the business leaders. But no. Our Minister of Finance was thinking. He was not acting. And when he thinks, it is dangerous, because he changes his mind  about four times in 24 hours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased with this measure, because it is included. The Bloc Quebecois fought to have this measure  included, to allow small and medium size businesses to defer tax instalments, so as to make it easier for them to make it through the economic downturn. It would have been so easy to announce and implement  this measure at the end of October. It would have been a breath of fresh air for businesses. But no. The minister had to think. And since this idea was not his own, perhaps it was not such a good idea. There is a bit of narcissism in politics. The Minister of Finance is not immune to it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also pleased about another measure. It would be difficult to feel differently, because we are the ones who proposed it. I am referring to the tax deduction for  mechanics' tools. It was my colleague, the hon. member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, our deputy whip, who made that suggestion through a bill he introduced in the House several months ago. We are not talking about last week. That was a number of months ago. He was a forerunner and his proposal  is included in the December budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my colleague presented this most beneficial bill—because  tools now cost a mechanic or an apprentice a small fortune; there are incredible technological advances in this area and there is a need for  this type of measure—our Minister of Finance, the stand-up comic, told his Liberal colleagues—we saw him, we were there—to oppose my colleague's bill, instead of supporting it, because he had not sponsored it. This minister is as proud as a peacock. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, we sometimes we get carried away by  our emotions. But I refrained from saying certain things. It could have been worse. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were pleased to see this measure included in the budget. But again, why  wait almost a year before implementing such a measure, when it would have been so easy to announce it immediately? The minister thought this was a good idea since he used it. He thought the Bloc Quebecois had a good idea since he included it in his budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why did he vote against the bill introduced by the hon. member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans? This is called petty politics. To engage in petty politics is to put one's image, one's prestige first, it is to give the impression that we have ideas and to present them in a budget and get all the praise. One can either engage in petty politics or truly help people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance decided to turn the budget into a show, with surprise announcements at the end of the year about surpluses that were larger than expected, when one would have to be completely stupid to come up with  the sort of forecasts he did, containing errors that gave him an extra  $50 billion  to play around with  over six years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called looking out for one's political career, one's political image, one's chances of winning the next leadership race. It is a cheap stunt, because the money we pay to this government does not belong to the Minister of Finance. It is not his to do with as he pleases.  It belongs to taxpayers. Taxpayers expect their money to be used honestly and in a transparent manner, and they are tired of being fed ridiculous forecasts.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came up with a good measure. The Minister of Finance waited, presented it himself, and it was passed by a majority. However, this measure only went part way. My colleague's bill was much more complete. It affected all mechanics, not just apprentices. Bravo, we are happy for apprentices, but it would have been a good idea to allow tax deductions for all those in this line of work, to make deductions universal, as with other professions. But no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we have trouble understanding the reasoning and the philosophy behind the decisions and the flip-flops of the Minister of Finance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that the Minister of Finance is not more clairvoyant and not more courageous in his ideas and measures. In the last budget, there could have been tremendous opportunities for improving the general wellbeing of society, of taxpayers, of unemployed workers and of companies. The Minister of Finance could have jumped at this chance to show us just once that he was capable of coming up with ideas, that he too had a vision for the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking Quebec—not that we want to imply that we are better than anyone else—just look at what has happened in the last two budgets.  Quebec's minister of finance and deputy premier, Mme Marois, has succeeded, with the little funds available to her, to put in place some forward-looking meaningful measures.  Do hon. members realize why we have so few measures in the Quebec government, by which I mean budget measures?  It is because the federal government has deprived it of them.  SInce 1995, the federal government has outrageously slashed transfer payments for health, education and income security.  This leaves Quebec in a budget situation that is not characterized by the same huge surpluses that are enjoyed here by our minister, Mr. Flip-flop. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have successfully put in place programs to assist the regions, to attract investors to the remote regions, to improve the secondary and tertiary processing sectors in the resource regions, to attract foreign capital, to earn   Montreal the reputation of an international financial capital, to make the regions more than just the source of workers for the major centres.  We have put measures in place to allow young people in the regions to stay home, to enjoy a decent life, to earn a living and to prosper and thus improve regional prosperity.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While over here, nothing at all was happening, Mr. Landry's government was helping the Gaspé. With very little means, helpful measures were developed. It does not take billions of dollars to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have living proof. The Minister of Finance has billions of our dollars, taken in excess from our pockets, and he is still unable to come up with development policies and policies to help support the economy. He shows up late with his measures. They are pieced together and based on the most erroneous forecasts of the surplus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to top it all off, eight weeks later, he changes his mind. I do not know how he manages to maintain his credibility, but his is a pretty strange way of managing public finances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that despite Ottawa robbing the provinces when it comes to transfers for health, education and revenue equalization, Quebec has managed, in its two most recent budgets, to come up with measures that help people, that help business and that help the regions that are in trouble, whereas here, we have  not even been able to lift a finger to help the regions that are experiencing hard times, not even to improve the employment insurance program, even though we are experiencing a downturn, and unemployment has risen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it somewhat indecent that Bill C-49 is being introduced and that we are being asked to support it because it contains good measures. If it does contain good measures, where did they come from? They come from suggestions made by the Bloc Quebecois. Because the pressure on the Minster of Finance was too great, he had to give in on certain small measures, otherwise he would not have survived.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is one thing the finance minister should be thinking about first and foremost, it is the well-being of our fellow citizens. First and foremost, he should  serve taxpayers well and stop using his office as a platform for the upcoming leadership race. Every single one of his budgets, especially the 1996 one, was aimed at boosting his ratings, taking credit for unexpected surpluses, claiming to be a good manager who made all the right decisions, when in reality the provinces, especially Quebec, have fallen on hard times since he became finance minister. He ruthlessly cut  health and education transfer payments that should have been maintained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada invests respectively 8 cents and 13 cents for every dollar  invested by Quebec in health and education. That is the contribution of this government. This is the lowest in history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is sending us by mail  documents—in Quebec this document is not the same as in the rest of Canada— which state on the first page that health is paramount and education is an investment. Oh yes? The Government of Canada contributes 8 cents out of every dollar invested in health and 13 cents for education. And health is of paramount importance and education is an investment? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to have a lot of gall to advertise how much the Canadian government invests in health and education, when in reality it hardly contributes any  money any more to these areas. One has to have a lot of gall to say that the government actually contributes 50%, because it includes the tax points transferred in 1977 in the calculation of federal expenses regarding transfers to the provinces. One has to have a lot of gall to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you sell your house, Mr. Speaker, do you go and tell the new owner 20 years later that this house still belongs to you? Tax points were transferred and the tax system was rebalanced. In those days, we had ministers, and prime ministers too, who were intelligent enough to know that the tax powers of the various government levels were in need of rebalancing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are asking for today with regard to correcting the tax imbalance is nothing new. History has seen two major conferences aimed at balancing the taxing powers of the provinces and the federal government, namely the Quebec City conference and the one that took place in 1977. That is when  tax points were transferred. At that time, nobody used the kind of demagogic arguments and meaningless rhetoric used by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to lead us to believe that there is no tax imbalance. No. People had discussions and they believed that it was a good idea to do some kind of realignment, especially since the main functions of provincial governments and of the Government of Quebec are to provide essential services in areas such as health and education, and now manpower training as well.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, will continue to defend the people, to fight for the most effective use possible of the funds entrusted to this government and to see to it that the flip-flop minister quits changing his mind this way every 24 hours, quits promoting himself as a politician and starts putting the well-being of those people whom he purports to represent above everything else. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will keep working for the major reforms we have been demanding for years, especially the reform of the employment insurance plan, so that we will have  a fair and decent plan. We will keep fighting for the elimination of outrageous conventions between Canada and Barbados, for example, that allow tax avoidance with the  complicity of the government and the Minister of Finance, who may have assets in Barbados. Actually, he does have some. The organization chart of his companies shows that he has some in Barbados. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue our fight to help the Quebec government and other provincial governments to get  a new fiscal balance in Canada. While the federal government puts up a big show,  flip-flops, smiles broadly and boasts about the economic and financial performance, there are real decision makers and managers in the Quebec government and other provincial governments who look after the people,  because their job is to manage health care, education and income security.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A time comes when some have it easier that others. In the coming months, the Bloc Quebecois will work eagerly to get a better balance in taxing powers to better serve the citizens, and not the ambitions of the Minister of Finance.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with the next speaker, there will be a ten minute question and comment period.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<A NAME="Int-124263"></A><a HREF="#Int-124405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-124260"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, Bill C-49 implements many details of the    December budget.  It was a budget of missed opportunities and failed to address many     important problems facing Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation bill contains five or six  key aspects of the budget.  A  major change has been made in the last eight weeks in the way part of the budget is organized,  namely  the infrastructure program and the Africa fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the budget went through the House and there was no whimper, no scuttlebutt, no talk whatsoever about making a major change in the administration of a major part of the budget. I speak about the infrastructure fund that was supposed to be administered at arm's length from the  cabinet, from the federal government, from the politicians.  It was to be run like an arm's length foundation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have some concerns about the terms of accountability to parliament. The attitude of the government has changed 180 degrees.  It has decided that the infrastructure fund will be under the responsibility of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger of it becoming a politically targeted infrastructure fund for the Liberal Party of Canada if it comes under political direction.  The temptation is there, some     $2 billion.  There would be a real temptation to put some of that money into more politically sensitive projects than if the fund were administered totally at arm's length from the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big change  was the  $500 million Africa fund.  Again, the fund  was to be administered at arm's length from the federal government but there was a change and it too is under the political responsibility of the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether or not the finance minister has lost a little tug of war within the cabinet.  The Prime Minister seems to be favouring the Deputy Prime Minister as his  successor  as leader of the Liberal Party. He tried with Mr. Brian Tobin who was  the Minister of Industry but that did not work out.  That  fizzled and failed.  He has made  the former foreign affairs minister the   Deputy Prime Minister. He has given   him a lot more responsibility and a lot of political clout in terms of doing favours for all kinds of government members.  That is a real concern to me and many other members of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation bill, in addition to what I have already mentioned, brings in a number of other aspects of the budget.  It establishes  the new Canadian air transport security authority, because of what happened on September 11.   The new authority  will be responsible for security at the airports. It will have the full power of a crown corporation and will be run by 11 government appointees.  I would bet dollars to donuts that most of those 11 government appointees will be people who are very active in the Liberal Party of Canada.  Another 11 people will be put in patronage positions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the way the legislation is written and from the briefings we received,  I do not think  regular travellers will see much of a change at the airports as they go through  security screening.  I think the same or similar  private sector contractors will be running airport security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that a public opinion poll was taken and  70% of Canadians wanted the security services at the airports to be under the authority of federal officials.  Only 20% wanted to have private contractors responsible for screening at Canada's airports. I predict that the screening will continue to be provided by private contractors and I do not think that is the way the general public wants to go.</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the rights of workers who are already there.  Many of them are members of the United Steelworkers  of America union, which represents many of the people who work in airport security.  I am concerned about what kinds of rights they will have as we go through this changeover and phasing out of the present system into the new.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we should be noting is that last year the Toronto airport authority gave the federal Liberal Party a contribution of $7,500, and   I think that  when we have this new crown agency its 11 government appointees will be looking at political considerations, not necessarily solely the safety considerations for the people of our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to mention  something new in the bill, the implementation of the air traveller security charge as of April 1, 2002, to fund the air security enhancements at airports in the country.   This will be a charge of $12 a flight, $24 per round trip, plus the GST.  It does not matter in most cases how long the trip will be. Whether it is a long haul flight from Vancouver to Halifax or a short haul flight from  Ottawa to Toronto or Regina to Winnipeg, there will  be a charge of $24 plus GST.  Meanwhile in the United States the equivalent fee that the Americans will be charging is $2.50 U.S. a flight.  Let us say  that is $4 Canadian a flight.   Our government is charging $24 Canadian a flight, fully $20 Canadian more for a flight in this country than is being charged in the United States. According to some of the research that has been done, only about $2 of that new fee will go to fund the new agency, the Canadian air transport security agency, and $10 from that flight will go into general  government revenues or coffers.  In other words it is just a new tax grab. It is a fee.  We get tax reductions on one side and fee increases on the other side and the ordinary person will pay through the nose once again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned about this. It is something we will fight against in the committee.  I am sure the Canadian people will be on our side in terms of mobilizing against this new airport tax, most of which will not be for airport security but will go into government revenues for other purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more point I would like to mention and it is one thing that I certainly agree with in the budget implementation bill, because we should not forget that a bill like this  is an omnibus bill.  It has the good, the bad and the ugly.  The ugly is the airport tax. There are a lot of bad things in the bill but there are some good things as well.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the good things is the deferral of taxes for six months for the small business people of the country.  The federal government will be deferring tax instalments for January, February and March of 2002 for up to six months to assist small businesses in their cashflow.  This is $2 billion.  It is not a tax writeoff.  It is a tax deferral.  Because of the slowdown in the economy, the recession or near recession in the economy, and because of what happened on September 11, there is a deferral of taxes for up to six months for small businesses that want to exercise that deferral right.  We support that, because small businesses in the country employ about half the Canadian population  and  now create about 80% of the  new jobs in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talk about small businesses, I mean really small business.  In fact, 80% of small businesses in the country have sales of less than $1 million a year.  Eighty per cent of the new jobs are in small business. Sales for  80% of those small businesses are less than $1 million a year.  They employ from one to twenty people, maybe up to thirty or so. Many of these small businesses are single person operations.  Many people operate  these companies out of their own homes or have a small retail operation such as a hair salon.  These businesses create about 80% of the new jobs in the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sector we should be looking at in terms of creating jobs, creating wealth, helping Canadian people and putting Canadian people to work.  This deferral is one small way of helping people who are employed by small business or who   indeed are   owners of small businesses. I remind the House that the majority of   small business owners and those who work in small businesses in the country now are women, not men.  This is an area that needs a lot more assistance in the future.</p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another  positive thing in the bill is a new provision  to allow an apprentice vehicle mechanic to deduct a portion of the cost of new tools acquired after 2001. Mechanics, men and women, who bought tools for their businesses could not  deduct them as an expense.  They buy these tools to work.  People in a business operation who have a legitimate business expense  can deduct it on their taxes, people such as  doctors, dentists and many other professionals, including consultants.  Consultants who  have home businesses   can deduct a portion of home expenses on their taxes. They can claim 20% of their home expenses or whatever amount it is and telephone costs and a certain amount for utilities.  They are deducted as legitimate expenses.  Yet we had mechanics, young people  in the country starting out,  who were spending thousands of dollars on tools  but could not  deduct them as a legitimate expense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, I introduced a private member's bill in the House, Bill C-338, calling for the deduction of costs of mechanics' tools from income tax.  I did that after circulating a petition throughout my riding and parts of Saskatchewan, getting signatures from hundreds of mechanics who were saying they wanted fair treatment, justice and equality in the tax laws. I have  raised this issue  time and time again at the finance committee.  The government  has  not gone as far in the budget as mechanics want it to go, but at least this is a start.  It is going in the right direction and it will  allow the deduction of some of the cost of  purchasing tools.  I will keep pushing to make sure that we get the full deduction of the cost of tools for mechanics in the years that lie ahead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the budget in terms of the implementation is the change for companies that want to donate securities to public charities.  In our country when people have capital gains they are taxed on 50% of the capital gains.  The 1997 change to the law for companies making donations to charities  was that instead of having 50% of that income taxable, the government put  it down to 37.5%.  This budget brings it down to only 25%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States and the United Kingdom there is no tax whatsoever when securities are contributed to charitable organizations.  What we have done in this country is strike a note halfway between what happens in the U.K. and the United States and what we used to have here. I certainly support that provision as well.  I  support making it easier for companies to donate to charities.  There has been a lot of lobbying  on that in the finance committee over the last while.  Indeed, many members of the finance committee would like to see the capital gains tax eliminated altogether for securities donated to charities by companies in our country.  I have not gone that far and the Minister of Finance has not gone that far, but at least there is some progress in that direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing I wanted to mention again. I  started to say at the outset of my remarks  that a big thing that is happening is the $2 billion Canada infrastructure fund, which  will provide assistance for infrastructure in the country.  We need a massive infrastructure program in Canada.  This is one of the ways to create jobs.  It is one of the ways to build the country, to build the economy.  We need a vision of building  our country and our economy, a vision of building the roads, highways and water systems and cleaning up the environment.  What we get in the budget  is a $2 billion fund over six years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States over the equivalent period of time, the Americans have committed $217 billion in transportation infrastructure alone.  In our country we have some $2 billion to cover all infrastructure over a period of six years.  If we were  to have an equivalent measure of investment into infrastructure, comparing our population to that of  the United States, we would need at least $18 billion more than we are seeing in this budget implementation bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some parts of the bill that will be debated in committee.  Some of them are negative, some of them are positive and some of them are really bad, like the airport tax that everybody will have to pay.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the bill is the African development fund to reduce poverty, provide education and set the African people on the path to a more sustainable development of their societies and their lives. This is a promise that was made by the Prime Minister to Nelson Mandela many years ago.  It is $500 million over six years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, we are now spending only .25% of our GDP on foreign aid. The goal for many years has been .7% of our GDP.  We are spending just a bit over a third of what we should be spending to help countries in the third world. It is a sad commentary on our country.  In Canada we should be  strong advocates of a world economic development agency that has a vision of a new  development plan, a modern day Marshall Plan that would develop places like Africa, Afghanistan and many other parts of the world.  That should be one of the things that we advocate as a Canadian parliament and as a Canadian government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to solve some of the problems of world poverty, world despair and world hunger. People are dying of starvation as we speak in the House of Commons today. Hundreds of people in the world are  literally dying from a lack of food, yet we have the means in this country and in this world to produce a great deal of food.  We have the means  for international development in the world. If we do not solve some of these problems we will have more  tragedies like those of September 11 and more  calamities that will haunt us in the years that lie ahead.   We have the means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three years ago, parliament passed a private member's motion   I introduced, stating  that we endorsed in principle the idea of the Tobin tax,  a tax on the speculation in currency around the world.  This is a tax that was suggested by an American professor named James Tobin whereby we would put a very small tax of about .1% or .2% on  speculation in currency.  In the world today over $1 trillion is traded in currency every single day, mostly by big banks. With this  small  tax we could raise hundreds of billions of dollars for international development and environmental cleanup.  Much of it could be spent in  countries around the world to develop social programs, to help eliminate poverty and to help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. We have the means in the world to have these kinds of funds developed to help all Canadians and help all peoples of the world, whether is it a Tobin tax or some other means of funding some of these initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude by saying that the budget brought down by the Minister of Finance was a budget of missed opportunities.  It was a budget that did not tackle some of the real problems that we have today.  It was a budget that failed to address the real issues of the economy and unemployment.  Back in December the unemployment rate rose to 7.5%.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the national unemployment rate if 8%. This is the highest rate in years. In the forecasts the finance minister issued  two months ago, there was nothing regarding job creation for Canadians.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to create jobs and we do that by investing in infrastructure, by putting money into affordable housing,  into  cleaning up the environment and into water treatment facilities across  the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do it by making sure that we have a fair deal for the farmers of Canada.  The farmers of Canada are in a real crisis, largely because of massive government subsidies for farmers in the United States and Europe. There is now a bill before the American congress, supported already by the house of representatives, I think,  and going to the senate.  It was agreed to by the president of the United States.   It will inject into the American economy over $170 billion American in additional money in terms of farm subsidies to support the farmers of the United States of America. We should think about the impact that will have on Canadian farmers. Yet the government brought down a budget with absolutely nothing in it for the farmers of our country.  Canadian farmers need a fair shake and a fair deal. The foundation of the country is agriculture and when the farmers are better off we are all better off.  There would be job creation  in the towns and cities from coast to coast to coast. We need more assistance for our farmers.  We have missed the opportunity. The Minister of Finance should be changing some of those things instead of the changes he made in terms of infrastructure and the African fund. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the government took power, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened.  We have a part time, high unemployment, low wage society and that is what must be changed.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I  thank my hon. colleague, the finance critic for the  NDP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget did not include aspects concerning  seniors and the disabled. As the federal Liberal government was bringing down the budget, the revenue department was sending out what I call the greatest insult to people with disabilities. A letter was received by 106,000 people. This new form stated that if a person could walk in an ordinate amount of time with a device on a flat surface, then that person would no longer able to collect the disability tax credit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We held a press conference in my riding. One gentleman who is 60 years old has been missing a leg since he was 13. When he got this insult in the mail, he thanked the Liberals because only the Liberals could take away his disability. Unfortunately, when he looked down the leg was still missing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person is missing a leg, would the hon. member consider that person to have a slight disability? If that is correct, why would the federal Liberal government take away the tax credit? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these people get a tax credit from $200 to $800 a year  to offset  their additional costs for clothing, devices or whatever it is they require  to have a semblance of a normal life. The government is trying to take it away from them. It is an insult to seniors and people with disabilities. Would my colleague care to comment on that?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I certainly agree with the hon. member that if somebody is missing a leg, surely to goodness that is a disability. Why would the government take away a small disability pension or  tax credit from someone in that situation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of issue that was not addressed by the government in the budget that came down in December. Instead, it is more content to keep its tax promise of $100 billion in tax cuts over five years. Much of that would be going to the wealthy and the large corporations. The government should be trying to do something for people on disability pensions  who should be getting a disability tax credit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the areas of social policy that the government has fallen down on year after year. My mother, who is no longer alive, suffered for  many years from very severe rheumatoid arthritis. When I meet people in that kind of situation I realize that there is a big hole in the social safety net in terms of adequate help and support for people with disabilities, whether it is through a new social program,  the taxation system or a combination of a federal-provincial program. It is a  sad commentary on modern society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a society that will spend all kinds of money on corporate welfare for  large corporations. There is all kinds of money being wasted on all kinds of projects. There is $60 million a year on an unelected, unaccountable Senate across the way. We do all these kinds of things as a government and as a parliament, yet  people with disabilities are struggling to put food on their table, to pay for decent housing or shelter, to pay for utilities and to help their children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a  warped vision of a just and fair society. We should be striving to help the common good, to create more equality in our society, to help people help themselves and to make sure that we give opportunities to those who need help. That is exactly what government should be for.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member for Regina--Qu'Appelle.  He would probably agree that at best the budget is nothing more than status quo and keeping the Liberal record as dismal as it has been in the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  have been here for nine years and this is the eighth budget.  We know what happened to the other one that should have been presented.  The budget is always full of wonderful rhetoric about the wonderful things the government will do.  The Liberals have a Minister of Finance who is excellent in presenting a budget to the  television land people who think it is wonderful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know the budget is  empty because the Liberals do not produce what they say they will do.  The red books have not been up to snuff in accomplishing what they are supposed to be accomplishing, for example,  scrapping the GST all through the years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a budget of all the things the opposition knows the government is not doing but  that it could be doing.  We know of the shortages in the security areas and the absolute zero help for farmers.  We know about all these things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all of a sudden  the department of revenue is spending $50 million to hire 960 individuals to collect more taxes.  More auditors are being hired to go after struggling  businessmen and farmers that are having a  tough time  paying their taxes. The hon. member, as much as anybody else in the House, has to deal with situations of individuals  being pressured by Revenue Canada to pay up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is hiring an army of people to do this.  It will cost $50 million. I find it totally inexcusable. I know the NDP is not really ashamed of taxes. I would like to hear what the member from the NDP would have to say about that.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would start off by saying what I said to the previous member.   A good example of people being harassed is people being harassed over the disability tax credit.  They are being cut off when they should be getting a tax credit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government seems to be spending so much money on hiring so many people to harass ordinary citizens.  It is going after a few dollars here and a few dollars there from people who are struggling.  That is a wrong priority and the wrong way to go. The question raised about the fellow without a leg is a  good example of that. An individual is being harassed for a few dollars a year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we have huge family trusts outside Canada that evade taxes.  We have large corporations that do not pay their fair share.  We have huge government expenditures every year in terms of tax expenditures to subsidize the huge multinational corporations.   I am not talking about small businesses.  I am talking about the really big companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canadians want a fair taxation system then everybody should be treated fairly and justly based on their ability to pay.  The tax system in the last few years has become less fair and less progressive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of years ago  we had seven or eight different marginal tax brackets  and a more progressive tax system.  This has started to disappear as we flattened the tax system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reduction in income tax, as is the case in Ontario, and I do not know about the situation in Alberta but I suspect it is the same thing there,  often leads to an increase in user fees.  User fees in Ontario have gone up in many instances for ordinary people.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A user fee is a flat tax.  Whether  individuals are rich or poor they pay the same fee when entering a park. If  individuals are wealthy or not they pay the same fee when paying a premium on health care as people do in the province of Alberta.  That is not the way to go.  The way to go is to make sure that we have a very progressive tax system based on the ability to pay.  We do not have that in this country.</p>

	Madam Speaker, last July we were blessed with the Whitehorse accord dealing with agriculture.  The agriculture minister came out with a five year plan.    He did not tell us at the time  that it would take five years to develop. When the ministers next meet we will be one year into that plan.  We have no details and no agreement between the provinces.  We have no new money for that plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that while the federal government gave  less than a billion dollars in aid to agriculture, it ran through a $2 billion slush fund without hardly saying a word. How do farmers get help from a government that is far more concerned about public relations than it is about actually helping farmers put substance into this plan?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-124464"></A><a HREF="#Int-124475"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-124457"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Lorne Nystrom: </b>

	Madam Speaker, that is a  good question and a difficult one to answer. How do farmers get help from the government? We have been trying to answer that question for many years.  We sent many articulate members of parliament from  the prairies and  rural Canada to the House of Commons. However, we have a government across the way that gets very few votes from  farmers and very few seats represent farmers in the Liberal benches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we must do, and I say this in all sincerity, is take a real look at our electoral system. We should bring in an aspect of proportional representation, a mixed member proportional system so that we would have a fair electoral system.  In a fair electoral system  a vote in Kamsack, Saskatchewan would be worth the same as  a vote in Toronto or Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government across the way will have to listen to every Canadian regardless of where they are. Right now the Liberals do not listen to  farmers. They do not have any seats there  so why should they make that a big priority  in terms of spending. As long as they have an electoral system that distorts this place, that will continue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know some members of his party have  looked at it.  A system of proportional representation would mean that everybody's vote would be equal.  There would be no structural discrimination  built into the system against any people  because everybody's vote would count. Today,  there are  no Liberal members from the  rural part of the prairies.  The rural part of the prairies tend to be ignored but with PR a vote would be worth as much as a vote in the city of Ottawa.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-49 regarding the budget, which was a great disappointment to many Canadians. On the day after he introduced the budget the finance minister stated during question period in the House:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--what is important in a budget is the way...it is received by the public.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should all  be disappointed by a finance minister who believes that public opinion and focus group economics is the way to govern a country when sometimes the most important and best decisions for the long term good of a country are not always the most popular decisions.  I am speaking of decisions like free trade, the deregulation of financial services, transportation and energy, all of which were controversial and many of which were not popular.  Even the replacement of the manufacturers sales tax, which was the euphemistic way of introducing the unpopular GST, was not popular  but has proven to be the right policy down the road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have paid a significant price for this type of government that focuses on polls and focus groups and does not have a vision or the wisdom and foresight to make the types of decisions which will improve the lives of Canadians well into this century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the budget from the perspective of the finance minister's statement, “what is important in a budget is the way it is received by the public”. The public includes  Canadian farmers who  have spoken out loud and clear on the budget. They were as disappointed as all Canadians and as they have  been   with every budget the finance minister has introduced by the fact that the minister and the government have failed to deal adequately  with the crisis facing farmers across Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a view in the federal department of agriculture that if  something is not raised or grown in the west it is not agriculture.  As the member of parliament for the riding of Kings--Hants where 50% of all the  agricultural products of Nova Scotia are produced, with a larger output of agricultural product than the entire province of Prince Edward Island, I urge the department and the government to take seriously issues of agriculture which have not been dealt with properly by the government.  It has failed to recognize the important contribution made by Canadian farmers  to the lives of all Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget failed to deal with the crisis the Canadian military is facing.  Even in a pre-September 11 context our Canadian military had been starved of resources.  In the budget the government  did not deal with the crisis that existed in military funding pre-September 11.  If  we add to this difficulty and the stretching of scarce resources the September 11 imperatives, the new security imperatives, and the increased levels of duty and tasks added to our Canadian armed forces, clearly the budget does not come close to addressing these needs.  It was supposed to be a security budget and it did not even address those issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous presentations were made to the House of Commons finance committee by the non-profit sector urging a permanent elimination of   the capital gains tax on gifts of publicly listed securities.  In the budget the government made permanent  a reduction to the capital gains tax on publicly listed securities, but that was a baby step in the right direction.  The Canadian philanthropic sector, Canadian charities whether  a university foundation, the United Way or a hospital foundation, is at a competitive disadvantage when competing with funds  currently being drawn to places in the U.S. and the U.K.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not worked with the non-profit sector to make it easier for Canadian institutions, the non-profit sector,  universities, hospitals,  foundations and   charities to raise  money that is necessary, particularly during a period of decreased federal and provincial funding.</p>


	<A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the minister's view that we should judge budgets based on public opinion the budget was a gross failure.  Probably the most damning gauge by which to evaluate the budget is what the international markets have said about it and about the performance of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the government the Canadian dollar has lost 20% of its value against the U.S. dollar.  The Prime Minister's response is typically that this is not really  a problem and a low dollar is good for exports.  If we think about the logical corollary of the Prime Minister's arguments and follow his flawed logic, by  reducing the Canadian dollar to zero Canada could be the greatest export nation in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument that the Prime Minister makes about the Canadian dollar is that although we are doing badly against the U.S. dollar we are doing well against other currencies.  He is right.  Our dollar is doing better than the ruble at this time.  All we have to do is wait, because we have lost 15% against the British pound and we have  lost significantly against the Mexican peso.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 20% drop in the value of the Canadian dollar represents a pay cut to every Canadian, a drop in our standard of living and a reflection of the fact that Canadians are getting poorer as Americans are getting richer under the watch of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance went to New York for a couple of days.  During the period of time  they were out of the country the dollar improved marginally.  Since they have returned, however, the dollar has dropped again.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest  that the government seriously consider sending the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance  out of the country for about 30 days.  Based on that performance, if they stayed out of the country for 30 days the Canadian dollar might  ascend to the level at which it rested prior to the government taking power in 1993.  Maybe the answer is to get the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister out of the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not here they certainly will not be able to direct funding to departments and misguided spending programs where it ought not to be going.  They will not be able to spend money in one of the sixteen departments  the auditor general described as having out of control spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the finance minister was given an opportunity to reduce spending in some key areas he did not take that opportunity at all.  He did not cut one area in a $130 billion budget.  No one is saying that the finance minister should be cutting in health care, the military or agriculture, the prime areas  he ought to be investing more in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there are areas of government waste.  There is no member on either side of the House who does not realize in his or her heart there are areas of government spending which do not reflect the priorities, the needs, the values and the long term interests of Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an esoteric debate  we are making as people with so much money that we do not have to worry about how we balance the budget.  Based on U.K., U.S. and German accounting standards the fact is that Canada is in a deficit right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our own accounting standards Canada is sliding toward a deficit position next year.  This year the government provided not a tax break but a  deferred corporate tax benefit to next year.  Why did it do that?  Did it do that to be nice to people?  Did the government do it to try to help  corporate Canada?  If it were interested in doing that it probably would have applied it in some way that would have benefited mom and pop operations and would have been more broadly based.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did it for one reason and that was to avoid the stark reality of being in a deficit next year. The only thing that is keeping Canada out of a deficit position right now is Liberal leadership politics.  A stark fear  exists on government benches that because of its lax spending and the fact that it has not monitored spending  it will slide back into a deficit.  It wants to avoid that reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of health care there is a health care crisis in every province in Canada.  We cannot blame provincial governments for the health care crisis in Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blame belongs squarely on the desk of the Prime Minister and  on the desk of the Minister of Finance  who have cut transfers to the provinces.  In an unprecedented cruel way they have put provinces in a position where they have not had the resources to meet their basic needs.  The provinces are now paying 85% to 88% of health care costs.  When medicare was first introduced the federal government was actually paying 50%.  Now it is down to 10%, 12% or 15% depending on the province, to a point where a province like Nova Scotia is now facing a health care crisis, a province that does not have the tax base of  Alberta or Ontario. A province like Nova Scotia is hit disproportionately hard by these types of cutbacks.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why   provincial governments are  in such a difficult position trying to keep clinics and hospitals open.  The waiting lists for surgery and treatment  have grown well beyond what anyone considers acceptable.  The blame belongs squarely on the government which has not only failed to respond in every  budget prior to this one but has disappointed all Canadians  concerned about health care in the latest budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were serious about addressing some of the real challenges facing Canada in this century, a century during which Canadians will face an even greater rate of change and challenge than they have faced in the last century, I would posit that the government would have used the budget to strengthen our health care system, to strengthen our commitment to agriculture, to rationalize spending in other departments, to find areas of government waste where it could have reduced some of that spending and   to address the fundamental issue plaguing Canadians, the Canadian dollar.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian dollar should be a source of pride for Canadians, not a source of embarrassment.  The Canadian dollar should not be a joke.  It is really terrible when  our friends and family in the U.S. talk to us about how they are being paid in American dollars and laugh at us.  The Canadian dollar is more than just a bread and butter or nuts and bolts issue.  It is a symbol of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier today we were speaking in the House in honour of Queen Elizabeth whose face graces our Canadian dollar.  What an embarrassment that  we honour Queen Elizabeth in the House yet we embarrass her by failing to introduce the types of economic policies that would strengthen the dollar bill upon which her face is placed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious about honouring Queen Elizabeth and the Canadian dollar, we ought to introduce a productivity agenda. That means  tax reform focused on productivity.  That means regulatory reform focused on productivity.  That means the rationalization of spending focused on the types of initiatives that would lead to the long term success and prosperity of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize  education  for very important reasons is under provincial jurisdiction in Canada, but  by restoring transfers to the provinces to the levels at which they ought to be the federal government could help significantly in terms of ensuring that all Canadians have the opportunity to obtain an adequate education. Not only has health care been devastated by the cuts of the federal government but our education system has as well.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I was planning to go with a long speech on this important subject, but since the bill has been on the order paper I have been given every necessary assurance by the government to move forward with the content of the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is known, not only here in North America but around the world, as a leader for its progressive agenda on the issue of children. As a signator to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child the government has taken a tremendous amount of action to fulfill its commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-408 falls within the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. There is legislation  before the other House, Bill C-15A, which will be dealt with tomorrow on a clause by clause basis. Under the leadership of the government the legislation would remove all references to the word illegitimate when it comes to children. This would be a victory not only for the House  but for all children across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second component of the bill would affect native children. I have been given assurances that the government is in the process of negotiating with the native community. I  am confident that at the end of negotiations the second part of the bill will be dealt with positively and expeditiously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted with the government's leadership. It has not only listened but taken action. It cares about the children of Canada and of the world. </p>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today and speak to Bill C-408.  The bill would remove the word illegitimate from  the definition of child in two federal statutes and replace it with the phrase “child born of persons who were not married to each other at the time of the birth”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not merely a cosmetic change to make people feel better.   Words are important.  They have profound meaning.  Words are concepts that reflect our most deeply held beliefs.  They guide the direction of public policy. The word legitimacy in this context lies at the heart of the difference between conservatism and liberalism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is the negative nature of the word illegitimate. There is an element of fairness to it.  A child can be born and raised with a label that stigmatizes him or her as something less than a legitimate person  because of the circumstances of his or her birth. The circumstances into which children are born are something over which they have no influence whatsoever, yet children are marked for life with the negative word illegitimate. This  is truly unfair.   A child should not be forced to suffer because of something his or her parents did.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways children can suffer because of the actions of their parents.  Let us take  the problem of fetal alcohol syndrome.  A pregnant woman with a drinking problem may be condemning her child to a life of great personal difficulty.  This too is unfair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents with substance abuse problems, chronic gambling addictions and diseases brought on by their own actions pass them along to their children on a daily basis. Patterns of verbal and physical abuse are unconsciously transmitted to children by their parents.  It is a rule of life that we all echo both the greatness and failings of our ancestors. This is  reality but it is not fair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason I agree that the word illegitimate in  referring to children should be removed.   Every child is a legitimate person and the laws of Canada should reflect it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research literature universally attests to the fact that it is in the best interests of children  to grow up in a stable home where the parents are married. A professor at the University of Chicago examined numerous statistical studies across America and had this to say in her recent book, <i>The Case for Marriage</i>:</p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Why does it matter to kids whether or not their parents are married?  A short answer is this:  Marriage shapes children's lives first and foremost by directing the time, energy and resources of two adults toward them...it is marriage that creates the conditions under which warm, affectionate, consistent parenting is most likely to take place.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much evidence from Canada as well.   In its massive National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, Statistics Canada found that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--children from single-mother families had higher rates of difficulties than children from two-parent families for all of the emotional and behavioural problems and academic and social difficulties examined, and the differences in these rates were all statistically significant...The average household income of a single-mother family was...less than half that of a two-parent family.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of marriage is confirmed by Canadian social commentators such as Professor John Richards, a former NDP member of the Saskatchewan legislature. He said “At this point, I want to be blunt: family structure matters, and two parents are preferable to one for successful child raising”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of lawful union is designed to be a protection for children.  The law recognizes that if a couple is committed to join their lives together and form a permanent home their union forms a stable, healthy cradle in which to grow a happy and healthy child. It would be ideal for every child to enjoy an environment like this. It is therefore less than ideal for a man and woman to have a child when they are not committed to each other, not committed to the child and without any intention of imparting to their child the benefits of their collective support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is in the best interests of children to be born to parents who are lawfully wedded it is in the interests of the state, even the state's responsibility, to encourage that behaviour. John Richards says:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society we need to reaffirm that sex is not just a lark or a thrill.  It is a serious act of tremendous gravity and importance.  It is the most profound of any physical union and bears the potential to produce another human being worthy of dignity, respect and a lifetime of caring and love.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition of the tremendous value of every child lies at the foundation of the institution of marriage. To reduce its position of privilege and honour by legitimizing arrangements that are not in the child's best interests is to reduce the protection we can afford the weakest members of our society: our children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state has the right and the responsibility to help single parents and their children in the difficult situations in which they find themselves, and to encourage marriage and dual parenting in the future by using the instruments of public policy and the institutions of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question marks a great difference between the world view of the liberal and that of the conservative.  The liberal believes in the granting of more individual freedom.  Unfortunately this too often happens at the expense of others.  The conservative believes the state should require more individual responsibility and cause its citizens to exercise more caution and care toward others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the dictionary definition of illegitimate is “not lawful”, the word has a more negative connotation.  Children should be given every opportunity to enter the world as free of obstacles as possible.  The psychological implications of labelling children illegitimate are a barrier to a healthy childhood.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I reiterate my belief that no child should be labelled with such a negative term as illegitimate.  From birth every child is a legitimate being and should be validated as such.</p>

	Madam Speaker, before I start I would like to say that we will obviously support this bill. We find it interesting because it would eliminate the adjective illegitimate when referring to a child.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to congratulate my colleague from Ottawa Centre for his insight and for introducing  Bill C-408.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not use up my ten minutes as it would appear that we will have to consider another bill later. We will debate this at a later date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would simply like to state a very definite opinion regarding the bill. In Quebec, theses words have been removed from the civil code since 1994. In recent history, being called illegitimate  meant a lot of things for children in their daily life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was listening to a program coming from the United States. I listened to children who had been labelled illegitimate, children who had been put up for adoption or institutionalized. They were telling their story. Today, they are between 40 and 45 years old or even less. They were talking about how they were treated when they were young and how the fact that they were branded illegitimate marked them for life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here, in Canada, we have had the same kind of problems, including the Duplessis orphans. We have seen the way  orphans were treated  in orphanages in Newfoundland and nearby in Ontario. We have just seen what it was like  to be considered illegitimate in our societies that are supposed to be free and respectful of individual rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had yet another example in the debate just concluded in Ireland. In case my colleagues did not know, this debate has lasted for years in Ireland, and it has just concluded now. Our societies change. It is important, at least that is what the Bloc Quebecois thinks, that we take that word out of the criminal code. A child cannot be illegitimate. A child is the son or daughter of a mother and father. Being born cannot be illegitimate. Legally, a child cannot be illegitimate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the gist of my argument. I want to see us go a little further.  I have not yet seen the new bill the government intends to introduce, but I hope it goes a little further still.  I hope that the Canadian government will look at what has been done with the revision of the Quebec civil code, and that it will at the very least draw upon what has been done, and well done, therein.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain words have been taken out.  As far as is possible, I would like to see the entire Criminal Code looked at, not just the parts relating to children, as have been proposed by my colleague for Ottawa Centre—whom I again congratulate and thank—but a complete review of the criminal code in order to seek out everything that, in my opinion, does not do justice to people and still hangs on to what I would call stuff from the past.   We are still dragging along baggage from the past, tradition that is, to my way of thinking, unhealthy, and this is particularly the case with the matter of concern to us at present.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we shall have to get back to the debate raised by my colleague, as  I have said, I merely wanted him to know that we were in agreement with his bill.  We hope that the one to be introduced by the government will go a little further still.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the coalition supports the amendments that the bill would bring to the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act. We feel it is important enough that it should be voted on. We should have more than just an hour of debate on a  bill of this importance.  It should be votable and it  should be moved on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are against any form of discrimination. We find that words used in the act are discriminatory against children who were born outside of  marriage. The legislation has very objectionable language in it and  this private member's bill,  Bill C-408, would  deal with that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 241 says that “child” includes an adopted child and an illegitimate child.   Bill C-408 would change that wording, which is very important.   From  personal experience, I know children sometimes carry burdens because of things outside  their control. The least we can do in the House is try to undo the damage that words can place on a child.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's modern society to treat  children who through no fault of their own find themselves born in an unmarried relationship  is just a sign of the times. We can lay judgment on whether it is right or wrong. We can lay judgment on whether or not the state should support it.  However to lay judgment on children who have had no opportunity to change the circumstances is  not fair and not right. Whether we like it or not, we have many different forms of families. Not all families have a father and not all families have a mother. That we in this House would discriminate against children who find themselves in a family that does not meet the tradition is not appropriate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will  be supporting the bill and hope that it actually finds its way into changing legislation, albeit it will not be voted on in the House. Young people have a hard enough time in today's world without the stigma that words can impose upon them. We would just hope that this private member's bill does not stop at this point. The intent of the bill should carry the weight of government and  the government should be sensitive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many bills that in Canadian tradition  have words that are inappropriate in today's modern society. This is one instance where we need to be considerate of the changes and ensure that the language in today's legislation is appropriate and reflects the changes we see around us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition is very supportive.  We wish the member well in taking this through the system. We hope the government uncharacteristically takes note of the debate and the support this has and  puts some meaningful change in.</p>

	Madam Speaker,  I am very happy to rise in the House today to speak in support of Bill C-408 and to congratulate the hon. member who brought it forward. I apologize for not hearing the earlier debate, but unfortunately I was in a committee and could not get over here fast enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  is very remarkable in its simplicity. It is an issue that has a lot of history and a lot of weight. The principle  being put forward here, which is very important, is to ensure that children are not being discriminated against by the use of really archaic language and labels.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the implementation of something like this to ensure that the definition of child and the use of the words illegitimate child are removed from all legislation may be a fairly logistically complex thing to do,  we should not lose sight of the principle  contained in this private member's bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party  supports the bill and its principle. Being a signatory to the international convention on the rights of the child, it is very important that the Government of Canada upholds that convention and ensures that its legislation, public policies and program development do  not  discriminate against children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that point of view, I would say most strongly that it is very important that not only do we move forward in addressing programs and policies to uphold  the rights of children in Canada, but we also look at our history and the legislation on the books. We have to recognize that sometimes we have to go back and update, change language and modernize. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been various instances where that has taken place in the House of Commons through government initiatives and maybe through private members’ initiatives. We have had that in legislation pertaining to same sex relationships and  the modernization of benefits and responsibilities. We have had that in legislation that pertains to the equality of women and the use of more gender neutral language. All those things are very important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the rights of children and how we portray them, not only legally but in language that is used in the media or in our local communities, it is  important to ensure that we use language and make references that are not judgmental and   do not reinforce stereotypes that serve to harm the well-being of children in our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support this effort.  I would hope that all members of the House would support it. It is something that is pretty straightforward. Even though logistically it may be very difficult to accomplish, in going through goodness knows how many hundreds of pieces of legislation to make changes, it should be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope there is a will in this place and a commitment from members on all sides of the House to ensure that we  adopt the bill and encourage the government to begin the process of making these changes to ensure that the rights of children are upheld.  It is important  that we refer to children in a way that is appropriate,  that reflects our modern day society and  that is respectful of different kinds of relationships.  Most important,  we must be respectful of the rights of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to support the bill and  thank the hon. member for having the courage to bring it forward. I hope it will gain acceptance from all members  and that we will  be able to accomplish this.</p>

	Madam Speaker, Bill C-408 addresses an important issue for many Canadians.  It proposes to eliminate the term “illegitimate” in two federal statutes, the criminal code and the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I turn to an examination of the bill, I would first like to commend the hon. member for his dedication and his commitment to the eradication of this antiquated concept and   language from federal law.  He has continued to bring this important issue before the House in a number of private member's bills over the passage of several years.  His hard work and his personal commitment to the belief that all Canadian children deserve the same protection under law and to be treated with the same dignity by the law is very much appreciated by Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I share the view of many in the House in thanking him for his role and his contribution.  Children should be included in and protected by our laws without regard to the relationship of their parents.  It is the responsibility of government to ensure that the concept of illegitimacy no longer exists in any federal law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not new to the House.  The Modernization of  Benefits and Obligations Act, that was enacted by parliament in June 2000, accomplished several goals, one of which was removing the last remaining references to illegitimacy in  seven federal statutes, including the second statute proposed for amendment in Bill  C-408.  These amendments specifically address the concerns of the hon. member and that he had previously brought before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that these amendments in the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act to remove references to illegitimacy do not actually change the substance of the law.  The seven statutes included all children. The references to illegitimate children that have now been removed were actually the earlier attempts of the House to ensure that children born to unmarried parents were included in eligibility for benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, if a specific statute referred to the child of a person,   some doubt existed  in law about whether this referred only to children born to married parents.  In order to make it clear that the law was intended to include all children, the acts were amended many years ago to specify that a child meant both legitimate and illegitimate children but this was in an effort to be inclusive in providing benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, with new international commitments and changes in our law, these specific references are no longer legally necessary.  It is now clear in law that a reference to a child of a person would include any child, whether the parents were married or unmarried.  Clearly the goal of this government is similar to that of governments that passed those earlier amendments; that is, all children, regardless of the relationship of their parents, deserve the same protection and treatment under the law. I have no doubt that all members support this worthy goal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more modern law, we can now remove the references in our statutes to the concept of illegitimacy without risking some children being left out of legal protections.  Removing these references will help in turn to eradicating any discrimination or differentiation in the treatment for children. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada continues to emphasize the importance of families and of supporting families as set out in the Speech from the Throne last year.  The government means that all families with children are important--married couples, common law couples and lone parents--so that no Canadian children will be stigmatized by something so clearly not within their control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-408 supports the work accomplished in the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act.  The first provision of the bill proposes an amendment to the criminal code to change the definition of  child  to remove the reference to an illegitimate child.  This amendment addresses a definition which was repealed by Bill C-15A and was passed by the House last fall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second provision of Bill  C-408 would bring the amendment made in the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act to the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act into force as of December 31, 2001. The reference in the statute to legitimate and illegitimate descendants in the definition of the “Inuk of Fort George” or the “Inuit of Fort George” was removed. </p>


	<A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that it has not yet been brought into force.  However this is for a good reason.  The Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act is a federal statute based on negotiated agreements: the James Bay and northern Quebec agreement and the northeastern Quebec agreement. Therefore the amendments to this act must be discussed with the Cree, the Naskapi and the Inuit prior to being brought into force.  These discussions were raised at both the House standing committee and the committee of the Senate during the passage of the modernization act.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from   officials of  my colleague, the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, that consultations with the Inuit are underway.  It is hoped that some agreement is possible through that process, following which the amendment would be brought into force.  However it is clear I am sure to members of the House that bringing this provision into force at this time might jeopardize that ongoing process.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the reference to legitimate and illegitimate may unfortunately remain in one statute for a short while longer, the effect on the children covered by the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act would not change; that is, they would continue to be included.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing let me emphasize that the government believes that there is no longer any place in federal legislation for the use of language such  as “illegitimate” or “children born out of wedlock”, with two small exceptions, one of which is currently under consideration by the Senate in Bill C-15A, federal law no longer distinguishes between children on that basis, and this last remaining stigma of another era will finally be gone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  intention of this bill is laudable and the government will be acting to implement its intent.  </p>

I profoundly disagree with a lot   the member does, and   I have made some snide remarks, even in the last few days, about his being the sponsor of a bill to legalize prostitution, but  it is  quite a contradiction in the personality of the member to now come up with such a very fine bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having done  the negative on previous occasions, I felt it was important for me to now stand up and positively support what he is doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most members in the House and certainly our pages have no idea how things were many years ago.  I love to take my grandchildren on my knee and read them storybooks.   I am at the age now where I do that sometimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the speeches were taking place, I was thinking about  when I was a youngster.  I recalled that at about seven or eight years old, I, for some reason,  became convinced that I was not the biological child of my parents.  Thinking  in that way caused me considerable personal distress. In those days, a long time ago, there was indeed a considerable social stigma attached to being a child without recognizable parents.  The word   illegitimate  was used and   I felt that I was illegitimate.  This feeling caused me a lot of what they now call a lack of self-esteem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out later on that it was not true.  However I was so afraid that it may be true that I could not bring myself to ask my parents.  I remember one day when I was rummaging through my mother's pictures and other paraphernalia that she had and in there I found a little newspaper clipping.  The newspaper clipping said “born to C.K. and Mary Epp on May 11,    a son”.  That was in our local newspaper  way back in 1939.  Members have no idea what a relief that gave to me.  I was indeed my mom  and dad's son.   It was very important to me and the stigma was gone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we know that stigma has, through societal changes, been substantially removed and today's bill will help to further that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my wife and I were raising our children and as I  now look  at our kids raising the next generation of four grandchildren,   I look at it over and over and realize  what a marvellous design it is that requires  two people, a male and a female,  to produce a child.  It is a marvellous design because when I see our children raising their children it's a full time job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on a bus in Ottawa not long ago and  a young lady was there with a child.  I did not inquire as to whether she was a single mom or what, but I felt genuinely sorry for her.  Her child was totally out of control and she was so frustrated.  I was thinking in my mind that the child needed a firm hand, as I did on occasion, of a father's grasp on the shoulder, the back of the neck or the leg which  meant  settle down.  It is the team work that is needed. I would like to give some encouragement to everybody who happens to notice this.  As adults let us make choices that  are good for children.  Let us make choices that  give those children a stable home in which to grow up.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grieve for the many children who go through life  from broken homes because of divorce. Children suffer immensely in those situations. I do not think there is a law that we could pass that would change that. I would certainly encourage  the ideal, the best situation, a mom and  a dad with a lifetime commitment to each other who provide a stable, secure home for the children as they grow up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this bill.  It is a very important step in taking  the stigma away  from those children who had zero to do with the situation.  It was not  their choice.  Let us do the very best we can for all children, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

	I thank all of my colleagues on  both sides of the House for their tremendous support and their very eloquent interventions as well as  for the unanimity that this bill received from the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a victory for children  across Canada, regardless of the circumstances under which they were born.  It is a victory for the people of Canada because the Government of Canada will take a leadership role on this issue  to clean up the  remaining legislation on the books. The government will  proactively work with its partners,  the provinces, to clean up their acts. In excess of 22 different acts at the provincial level attach this terrible stigma to children,  and to men and women, many of whom are in their late sixties and seventies. It is my hope the provincial governments will take note of this debate and the unanimity that exists here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Minister of Justice and the member from Kitchener who spoke so eloquently when delivering the government's position on this matter.  I take this to heart. I am confident  this commitment will be fulfilled. I will be on the lookout.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this item was not deemed to be votable by the committee that looks at private members' legislation, I can assure the House that with the unanimity here, it will be back on the floor of the Chamber  in one way, shape or form should action not be taken as quickly as possible.  However I am very confident that action will be taken.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to follow up on a question I initially posed to the minister of agriculture in late October prior to the implementation of the December federal budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quick summary, essentially the point I raised was that the government and the agriculture minister himself have become well known for stumbling from ad hoc program to ad hoc program with no long term vision. These ad hoc agriculture programs are consistently heavily weighted in bureaucracy. They are  very complicated and eventually fail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the minister to  give some kind of assurance that  there was a plan in place to move  past the government's crisis management, ad hoc to ad hoc program style of agriculture policy and implement a long term, sustainable agricultural policy which farmers could rely on to do some planning. The minister's response, according to <i>Hansard</i>, was that the government did want to move beyond crisis management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose there was some room for hope that the federal budget would contain a long term sustainable policy vis-à-vis agriculture. Regrettably there was no plan for agriculture in the December budget. There was no new money in the budget, nothing at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time we have been questioning the agriculture minister periodically. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today at the agriculture committee the minister marched in with his deputy minister, assistant deputy minister and about a dozen other bureaucrats in tow and announced that he was unveiling his great new plan. He called it the new architecture for agriculture plan. He had a very fancy slide presentation. He said that the new architecture plan for agriculture includes five points: risk management, food safety and food quality, environment, renewal, and science and innovation. There was no substance nor specifics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are farmers supposed to do with this new architecture plan? Imagine a farmer walking into a bank and saying “Here is the new plan from the minister of agriculture. I want a loan so I can put my crop in this spring”. Exactly how are farmers supposed to do any long term financial planning or crop planning if they do not know what programs are going to be there for them?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said there were no specifics on any of the five points of the plan, except to a slight degree  with respect to risk management.  The minister said that it would be a partnership of federal and  provincial governments and farmers themselves. It is reminiscent of GRIP, a  program which  the Liberal government dismantled in 1995. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, as the minister himself said today in committee, the programs  have been failures. We have been telling the minister that every year since 1995. These programs have failed. They do not work. We have to come up with  a viable, sustainable agricultural policy. At least he finally is admitting that those policies did not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. farm bill is a comprehensive program of safety nets. It includes soil, water and wildlife conservation, a value added program, a drinking water program, rural development, research and trade subsidies. Why does Canada not come up with some kind of comprehensive agriculture policy like the Americans' plan  and commit to it such as the Americans have so that our farmers can plan?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to answer the member's question by talking about the fundamental policy changes we are currently working on for the agriculture and agri-food sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member may know, in Whitehorse in June  last year the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food obtained agreement in principle from his provincial and territorial colleagues on an action plan to develop a new architecture for agricultural policy in the 21st century.  Of course the federal government must act in consultation with the provinces and with producers, as it is doing.  It cannot simply act out of the blue without that kind of process.  It is following a process.  It is important to develop this policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new architecture is designed to position the agri-food sector for success in the 21st century by branding Canada as the world leader in food safety and quality, innovation and environmentally responsible production.  In the December 2001 budget the government committed to provide its share of the long term funding needed to support the development and implementation of a new integrated and financially sustainable architecture for agricultural policy in the 21st century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now working with the provinces and territories on mapping out the road ahead to turn the action plan into reality.  With our provincial and territorial counterparts we have reviewed farm safety net programs and are working on new directions to ensure improved risk management programming for farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also looking at renewal programming so that farmers can upgrade their skills to take advantage of new opportunities.  Food safety and environmental performance will also be improved to meet consumer and citizen expectations.  We will work with industry to enhance on-farm food safety programs and strengthen safety and quality assurance systems across the food chain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our focus with respect to the environment will be on research and development, information sharing and tools for producers.  Investment in science and innovation will form the basis for a new product and process development but also underlies progress in food safety and environmental practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new architecture will provide for a consistent national approach in all of these critical areas. It will improve our agriculture and agri-food sector's ability to compete and succeed in the global marketplace in the 21st century.  This in turn means more revenues for farmers through increased sales and new opportunities.  It will also provide for a much greater return on the government investment in agriculture and will have positive benefits for both urban and rural Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments will be undertaking an extensive consultation process.  This will be an opportunity for the industry and Canadians to give governments their ideas on how we can make the most of this opportunity to redefine Canadian agriculture.  By working together, by working with all the stakeholders, I am convinced  we can successfully move the sector beyond crisis management and toward a prosperous and successful future.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I understand and agree with my hon. colleague that it is necessary to involve the provincial counterparts in order to formulate a long term sustainable agriculture policy.  However, all I hear is rhetoric devoid of substance with more promises to consult. There is nothing substantive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the U.S. farm bill as I was wrapping up my comments earlier. It is actually the farm security act which  is now before the U.S. senate.  The president of the United States himself said that the U.S. will support agriculture to whatever degree is necessary.  We know what that means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bill  has provisions.  It is a comprehensive program that includes safety nets, soil, water and wildlife conservation plans, value added programs and drinking water programs for rural development, research and trade subsidies.  It is a comprehensive program that  delivers to farmers in the United States certainty and security in a sustainable long term policy. It is  a program  they can rely on. It is a program which  they know the government will support. However it actually causes even more problems for our farmers. The competitive disadvantage that our farmers  face against the subsidies of other nations is becoming further entrenched.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seven years the government has been stumbling along from one ad hoc crisis management program heavily weighted in bureaucracy  to the next. It is incumbent upon the government to look at the American model.  Look at what the result is going to be for our farmers. Give our farmers something of substance like what the American farmers have, the farm security act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have no confidence that will happen because in committee today the minister said that he did not really understand the American program.</p>

	Madam Speaker,  the government is interested in what is happening in the U.S. and around the world in agricultural policy.  The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food  is always watching these developments with great interest. The member said there is no substance.  Let us  review what I said a few minutes ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is talking about ensuring improved risk management programming.  That is substance; that is real for farmers. We talked about renewal programming so that farmers can upgrade their skills.  That is important to farmers; they can take advantage of opportunities. We talked about improving food safety and environmental performance. That is an important, substantive thing for farmers. We are working with the industry to enhance  farm food safety programs and to strengthen safety and quality assurance systems across the food chain. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of areas where the government is working on substantive  policy changes, actions and commitments that would make a difference for farmers across the country. I do not agree with the member's view on this and I hope that he will reconsider his view.</p>
