</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely honoured to rise 
to speak to the merits of Bill C-69, an act to amend the Criminal 
Records Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important bill, dealing as it does with 
improving the safety of our children and other vulnerable 
people.  This is an objective shared by all parties, as was 
amply demonstrated during debate and in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by complimenting my colleagues sitting 
opposite on the spirit of co-operation that clearly demonstrates 
the extent and depth of our shared commitment. 
With the co-operation and advice of the other parties, this bill, 
as amended, is even stronger than it was when first tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I am pleased to acknowledge the initiative taken 
by my hon. friend from Calgary Centre to introduce his own 
private member's bill on this same matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his co-operation we have been able to ensure that the 
principles of his Bill C-284 are captured within Bill C-69 so that 
we can proceed expeditiously with this single proposal.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central objective of the bill will be achieved by a process 
that it is outlined in clause 6.  It will allow a flag to be 
placed in the criminal records system when a sex offender is 
granted a pardon and that record is sealed.  This will help 
ensure that such records are identified and can be disclosed by 
the solicitor general for screening purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will know, the Criminal Records Act establishes 
a system to offer pardons to former offenders who have 
demonstrated a return to a law-abiding life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is designed to both recognize that return to good conduct and 
to encourage continued positive adjustment by removing the 
stigma and barriers to normal social participation created by a 
criminal record.  Under that act, offenders can have their 
records sealed by obtaining a pardon from the National Parole 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that this does not expunge the conviction nor 
does it erase the record.  The conviction is a matter of 
historical fact and the criminal record can be unsealed on the 
authority of the solicitor general if that is required in the 
interests of the administration of justice or national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pardons are granted only when it has been demonstrated that 
crime free conduct has been resumed. 
In the case of summary conviction offences, this requires a 
three-year crime free period after completion of any and all 
sentences.  In the case of more serious indictable offences, the 
waiting period is five years.  Before a pardon is received, 
police are consulted in every community where pardon applicants 
have lived during the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of success in obtaining pardons by applicants is quite 
high, well over 90%, but this does not reflect any lack of 
diligence in considering pardon applications.  Rather, it 
indicates that the vast majority of applicants qualify for a 
pardon, whereas those who would obviously not qualify are 
deterred from applying when they see the thoroughness of the 
application information they must provide, including 
fingerprints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of pardon recipients are law abiding at the 
time of being pardoned.  In fact, most pardon requests arise 
precisely because the applicants have returned to a stable 
law-abiding life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most hon. members will know from the inquiries they receive 
from their constituents, the most common reason for seeking a 
pardon is for purposes of employment and travel outside of the 
country.  Moreover, and perhaps most important, the vast 
majority of pardon recipients remain law abiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the past 28 years, nearly a quarter of a million pardons 
have been granted and of these, just over 6,000 have been 
revoked for a new offence.  This is a “success rate” of over 
97%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I hasten to note that Bill C-69 deals primarily with sex 
offenders, a small segment of the larger pardon group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 
solicitor general's department has recently estimated that, 
during the past 28 years, 4,200 sex offenders have received 
pardons and, of these, 114 or 2.6% have had their pardon revoked 
for commission of another sex offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, these estimates demonstrate that, thankfully, only a very 
small number of pardoned sex offenders continue to pose a risk 
to society and to children in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how small the number, we are determined to reduce 
that risk to the lowest level possible.  And that is why Bill 
C-69 is so crucial.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new found concern of the government.  Bill C-69 is 
founded on measures that have been taken since the beginning of 
our mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, extensive consultations were conducted in every region 
of this country with child-caring organizations of many 
descriptions:  school and child welfare officials, voluntary 
organizations such as Boys and Girls Clubs, Big Brother and Big 
Sister agencies, Volunteer Canada, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police were also included in all of these consultations as were 
victims organizations. 
It was clear in those consultations that a check of criminal 
records constitutes only one part of a comprehensive screening 
process, but an important and essential part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on that consensus, the national screening system was 
launched in 1994.  That system is a collaborative effort 
involving child-caring agencies, the police community, the 
Canadian Police Information Centre, or CPIC, and the departments 
of the solicitor general, health and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteer Canada in particular has been an important partner in 
training and informing the voluntary community about sound 
screening practices  Only recently, I was proud to participate 
in the launch of a public information campaign by Volunteer 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the motto “You Have A Responsibility to Question”, it will 
encourage parents to insist that organizations to which they 
entrust their children have effective screening practices.  The 
national screening system provides access to criminal records of 
applicants for positions of trust with children and vulnerable 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the consent of the applicant—I repeat, because this is 
important, with the consent of the applicant—local police check 
the CPIC records system for a criminal record.  They then 
provide the results of that search to the screening agency, 
usually through the applicant him or herself, for review as to 
its relevance to the position in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national screening system has been working well and its use 
by the voluntary sector and other bona fide organizations is 
constantly expanding. 
There have been over 700,000 searches conducted to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 further refines the national screening system by 
correcting a weakness that has been identified in its use.  That 
is the fact that a pardoned record of a sex offender could be 
overlooked during a routine screening check of the CPIC system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands today, the solicitor general has the authority to 
unseal and disclose a pardoned record for purposes consistent 
with the administration of justice, including screening. 
However, he cannot use that authority if such records are not 
requested—and they cannot be requested if their existence is 
unknown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because such records are removed from the CPIC system and kept 
separately in a sealed database, they do not show up when a 
routine query of CPIC is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what is intended by the Criminal Records Act. 
For most purposes these records should be invisible.  However, 
when persons are applying for a position of trust and their 
record suggests there would be an increased level of risk to a 
specific vulnerable category of person, an exception is 
warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was unanimous agreement on this point among the federal, 
provincial and territorial ministers of justice and solicitors 
general when they met in October 1998.  A working group of 
senior officials examining ways to better protect children 
submitted 10 recommendations to their ministers.  All 10 were 
adopted and are being implemented at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One proposal was that the records of pardoned sex offenders be 
made available for consideration during screening of persons for 
positions of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Solicitor General, with the support of the Minister 
of Justice, undertook at that meeting to determine how best to 
do so, in consultation with provincial partners.  Consequently, 
Bill C-69 provides that when a criminal record that includes a 
sex offence is pardoned and removed from CPIC, a notation or 
flag will be left in its place.  After that, when a screening 
check is conducted, that notation will direct the police officer 
doing the search to submit fingerprints to CPIC headquarters 
with a request for that record. 
It will then be brought forward to the Solicitor General to 
consider its unsealing.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that this measure runs counter to the fundamental 
intent of the Criminal Records Act.  Admittedly there is some 
basis for that position, but it is the government's view that 
this is a narrow and limited exception that is warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers of justice from all jurisdictions have supported this 
principle, as have all parties in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not taking this step would risk incurring the potential 
consequences of the pardon helping a predatory sex offender work 
his way into a position of trust with vulnerable people.  I say 
it is a narrow exception.  Only sex offences on a list that will 
be placed in regulations will cause a flag to be placed on CPIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This flag will only become visible during a screening search 
that will be indicated by the entry code on the computer 
terminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unauthorized use of that code will be prohibited by the act and 
by CPIC policy.  Moreover, there will be other safeguards built 
into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consent of the applicant will always be required and he will 
retain the option of abandoning the application if he wishes not 
to disclose his record to the screening agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fingerprints will accompany the request to unseal a pardoned 
record to ensure the accurate identification of the applicant. 
And finally, the Solicitor General will have to agree that 
disclosure of the record is warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These safeguards will protect the rights of pardoned 
ex-offenders.  They will protect them from having their pardoned 
records arbitrarily disclosed while ensuring that bona fide 
agencies will have access to the full record of applicants who 
have committed sex offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not automatically deny them placement in such 
positions, but it will allow agencies to fully consider what 
role in their organization would be appropriate for such 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring that police will play a central role in screening will 
provide considerable assurance that the system will not be 
abused by persons who are trying to evade detection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I should mention that flagging pardoned 
records on CPIC is not the only provision in Bill C-69.  The bill 
will also clarify and strengthen the pardon system is other ways 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it will provide that pardons will be automatically 
revoked upon conviction for a so-called hybrid offence—one that 
can be prosecuted by indictment or a summary offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, automatic revocation applies only to indictable 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a waiting period of at least one year will be 
required before an applicant who has been denied a pardon can 
apply again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appeals to the board in cases of denial or revocation of a 
pardon will now normally be in writing only, and the act will 
specify more clearly that the effect of the pardon is to seal 
the record, not expunge the fact of conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations to the act will also specify the sex offences that 
will be flagged on CPIC and the wording that must be used in the 
consent form that applicants sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations will also set out the factors that are considered by 
the Solicitor General in making his decision whether or not to 
unseal a record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important changes.  They are changes that are based on 
experience with earlier and effective measures already 
instituted by this government.  They respond to the unanimous 
recommendation of provincial and territorial colleagues. 
They are consistent, I believe, with the shared concern of all 
hon. members to do all that is possible to protect our children 
and vulnerable adults from predatory sexual offenders who would 
conspire to harm them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House welcome the interest and support of 
the other parties for this important legislation.  In view of 
the clear interest of all parties, I am confident we can proceed 
expeditiously with this legislation. 
Naturally, I invite all my colleagues in this House to support 
the bill. I will conclude, however, by again complimenting them 
all, particularly the hon. member for Calgary Centre, for the 
superb contribution and excellent co-operation that has led the 
Standing Committee on Justice to stand unanimously behind this 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to express my sincere thanks to the hon. member for 
Brossard—La Prairie for his excellent speech.  He has covered 
many of the key points on the bill.  I do not think it would 
serve the House for me to repeat them at any great length.  He 
has articulated the purpose of the bill very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just touch on a couple of the points that have brought us 
to the decision the House will make today on Bill C-69.  These 
points have to do with the human interest part of the bill.  It 
speaks well to the process we have and that it can still work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member articulated the purpose of the bill.  It is to 
allow access to pardons.  If a person, who has committed sexual 
offences, particularly against children, applies for a position 
of caring for children, there would be an opportunity for 
organizations to get access to the pardon records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 is a bill for which, not surprisingly, there is broad 
support in the House.  It relates very specifically to a bill 
that I brought forward to the House, Bill C-284, which 
effectively did the same thing and which passed second reading in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the information in the CPIC system today of those who 
have been pardoned for sexual offences, as the hon. member 
mentioned.  The bill will now allow those pardon records to be 
flagged so that those who want access to that information in 
order to assess someone who is applying for a job of caring for 
children can now have access even past the pardon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good bill.  It is very consistent with Bill C-284, which 
I brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill, Bill C-284, passed second reading in the House.  At 
about the time that we were in the justice committee looking at 
Bill C-284 the government brought Bill C-69 forward.  Bill C-69 
effectively did the same thing as my bill. It was broader in some 
areas and included more types of sex offences, which was good. 
However, it was not as strong in our estimation in some other 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collectively, we worked together to bring both bills to that 
committee at the same time so that committee members could 
examine the different aspects of both bills and come up with a 
stronger option at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things I would like to see in Bill C-69 that are 
not there, but the majority of issues I was concerned about have 
been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we get here?  I think there is a human interest story 
the House should be aware of.  Six years ago a lady in Vancouver 
named Gertie Pool started a petition to allow for greater access 
to information to protect children from sexual predators which 
quickly received 25,000 names and was brought forward to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member for Fraser Valley put forward a private 
member's bill in the 35th parliament that was basically on the 
same theme as Bill C-69 and Bill C-284.  That bill was never 
drawn or deemed votable but it was in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 36th parliament, I took the member's bill, modified it 
slightly and put it back into the mix.  Interestingly enough, my 
private member's bill was drawn.  I appeared before the committee 
to see if it would be deemed votable and we had some witness 
testimony that helped the decision.  In the wisdom of the 
committee, they said, “Yes, let us bring this before the House 
and make it votable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We debated the bill in the House. Even though there were a 
number of members on the government side who thought maybe we did 
not need Bill C-284, it passed second reading and that got it to 
committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a concerned citizen's petition we have a private member's 
bill that has passed second reading.  The government was also 
somewhat concerned about the issue.  It had been doing some 
studies in Correctional Service Canada and was working on Bill 
C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all came together in the justice committee.  Once we were 
in committee we put forward some amendments to make it a more 
automatic disclosure so that there would be less discretion on 
whether or not the information would be disclosed to the hiring 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give thanks to the many witnesses that came before the 
committee such as the police association and the chiefs of police 
association.  Julian Fantino also came forward, as well as many 
victims groups.  These witnesses brought home the tragedy of a 
sexual offence, particularly against children, being a life 
sentence to the victims, something they never fully get over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many groups from the YMCA, boys groups, boy scouts and all kinds 
of children's organizations signed on.  They told us they were 
behind us in this regard and wanted us to get it through the 
House of Commons.  Many of them sacrificed time and effort to 
support the bill.  They are one of the reasons we are able to 
support an amended version of Bill C-69 which combines the 
strength of both bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague from Brossard—La Prairie.  He has been 
instrumental in working with the committee, with the solicitor 
general and with me.  He has been true to his word throughout the 
process.  He has been a key factor in bringing it all together 
and implementing a very important bill, which I believe is one of 
the first bills of the new solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very important bill allows children's organizations and 
those concerned about the care of children to do a thorough check 
of the information.  The information is in the CPIC system.  The 
flagging which he detailed in his speech is all that is needed. 
We can now use the information we already have to do a more 
thorough check to protect our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad we have been able to demonstrate in the House through 
the bill and through the process that we can bypass partisan 
issues.  We are not entirely agreed on how exactly to do it, but 
substantively, for the most part, there is agreement.  It is 
better that we get 80% rather than nothing.  Both sides of the 
House saw that.  At the end of the day we have proven that the 
process can work, that we can serve the needs of Canadians and 
that we can better protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the good work the bill will do, for me and for 
many members of the committee one of the most rewarding aspects 
of the whole process is that with persistence, perseverance and 
an honest concern on the part of citizens, witnesses and members 
of the House we can put forward legislation that serves the 
people and better protects our children, the most vulnerable 
members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can actually implement laws which will enable us to do that. 
A very encouraging note for me as a two year member of the House 
is that there is a way for all of us to impact on the process if 
we really care about putting Canadians first and putting some of 
our partisan positions aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House and the member for the earnest and diligent 
effort that all have applied in this regard.  I encourage the 
House to send the bill on today to the Senate and hopefully soon 
for royal assent so people have access to this new tool to 
better protect Canadian children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am taking part today in this debate at the third reading stage 
of Bill C-69, an act to amend the Criminal Records Act and to 
amend another act in consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before speaking to the bill, I would like, on behalf of my 
colleague from Charlesbourg, to acknowledge the excellent work 
done by the Standing Committee on Justice in its study of Bill 
C-69. I am pleased to lend my voice to the member for 
Charlesbourg to recognize the exceptional spirit of co-operation 
shown by all members of this committee, who set aside any 
partisanship to do a thorough study of this bill. This kind of 
spirit should always be present in committee work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 amends the Criminal Records Act and one provision of 
the Criminal Code. To better understand the meaning of these 
amendments, one must take a quick look at the current Criminal 
Records Act, which dates back to 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act allows those who are convicted of a criminal offence to 
be granted a pardon after serving their sentence. Such pardon 
may be granted after a specified period, provided there are no 
other convictions during that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The period is three years for a summary offence and five years 
for an indictable offence. After having repaid his or her debt 
to society, a person may apply for a pardon to the National 
Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pardon eases the rehabilitation of an individual who has served 
his sentence by removing the negative aspects of sentencing in 
the case of such things as jobs and travel abroad.  The records 
of pardoned individuals are therefore kept separately from other 
criminal records and may not be disclosed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention that a pardon may be revoked automatically 
if an individual is convicted on summary conviction or by the 
parole board if the individual is found guilty of an offence 
punishable either on indictment or on summary conviction or if 
the board deems the behaviour of an individual is such that he 
no longer deserves to be pardoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three main changes proposed by Bill C-69 are the following. 
The first is the imposition of a waiting period prior to 
re-application for a pardon following a denial.  In the existing 
legislation, an individual whose pardon application has been 
denied may re-apply immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the second, the pardon will be automatically revoked on 
sentencing for a hybrid offence, that is, an offence punishable 
either on indictment or on summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and this is the biggest change to the bill, a provision 
provides for notations in the records of individuals found 
guilty of sexual crimes and pardoned.  This provision will 
permit disclosure of the records of these individuals when they 
apply for a job in which they will be in close contact with 
children or vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6.3 of the bill permits the disclosure under certain 
circumstances of the record of an individual who has been 
pardoned.  This provision is a measure of protection against 
repeat offences by pardoned sexual offenders.  The aim is to 
prevent a pardoned sexual offender from becoming a playground 
supervisor or holding some other position putting him in contact 
with children or other vulnerable groups, such as people with 
mental handicaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP will therefore be able to separately identify the 
records of persons who have been pardoned and who have been 
sentenced for a sexual offence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT8"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT8"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1040
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, an agency like Big Brothers, for instance, could 
ask the RCMP to disclose the record of a convicted sexual 
offender. Of course, the offender must consent to the content of 
his record being disclosed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the record shows that the individual has previously been 
convicted of a sexual offence, the solicitor general must break 
the seal and release the information to the police who would 
then inform the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision is an exception to the pardon principle, which 
can be justified by the fact that our society wants children to 
be protected against sexual predators, even those who have been 
pardoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize however that the current 
legislation meets its objectives. In fact, the recidivism rate 
of pardoned offenders is about 2%. Since 1971, almost 250,000 
pardon applications have been granted and less than 2.4% of 
pardons have been revoked by the National Parole Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the same period, covering almost 30 years, some 12,000 
pardons were granted to sexual offenders and about 700 pardons 
were revoked because of a subsequent sexual offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the current recidivism rate is very low, at about 5.8%, 
we hope that Bill C-69 will help to reduce it and even provide 
an incentive to promote and facilitate the pardon process. This 
is why the Bloc Quebecois will be supporting Bill C-69.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to add our contribution to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our critic in this area has already spoke to the fact that the 
NDP caucus finds a lot of merit in Bill C-69.  We understand that 
the bill finds its origins in a legitimate public concern about 
the legitimate social issue of whether our interest comes from 
the fact that one is a parent and has concern about these issues, 
whether one works for an NGO or is one of the employers who may 
be concerned about a certain type of individual to be hired or 
the qualities the individual may possess.  We are very glad to 
see the bill introduced because it finally starts to address 
legitimate concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Criminal Records Act which we understand 
Bill C-69 to introduce would flag the criminal records of 
hardened sex offenders seeking positions of trust.  That is the 
operative word.  There has to be some burden of proof that the 
person is making application for a position of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 would make them available for screening purposes by 
placing a flag on the records of convicted sex offenders so that 
police could be alerted.  The sealed pardoned record would exist 
so they could then request the solicitor general's authorization 
to unseal the permanent record.  Even if the individual has been 
pardoned and the criminal record has been sealed, the bill would 
give access to that information if it were deemed necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to these concerns Bill C-69 would develop a schedule 
of offences to be flagged.  It does not mean that all pardoned 
offenders would have their records flagged.  It would be a 
schedule of the types of things the community needs to know about 
and that should be flagged.  It would also place a definition on 
children and vulnerable groups so that we would know what groups 
would be making application for the unsealing of closed records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is valuable to specify in the regulations factors to be 
considered by the solicitor general when looking at an unsealed 
pardoned record that should be reviewed, itemized and clarified.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 automatically revokes pardons for new convictions of 
indictable or hybrid offences.  Someone may have been pardoned or 
there may be a pardon on record for a past offence but new 
offences obviously would have to be reviewed and revisited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports the overall intent of the legislation to ensure 
that the criminal records of pardoned sex offenders seeking 
positions of trust are available to law enforcement officers for 
screening purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing we have to be careful about in this type of 
legislation is that the rights of the individual still must be 
protected.  The test of legislation of this kind is if it meets 
that challenge and we can be comfortable that the rights of the 
individual are not being trampled because that would not be to 
anyone's benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 strikes a sufficient balance between the rights of the 
individual and the safety concerns of the community.  That is the 
ultimate test and that is the thing we have to be worried about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By giving law enforcement agencies the authority to access all 
records relating to the previous criminal conduct of an 
individual we may be able to prevent future tragedies.  This is 
something that all members of the House, and I am pleased to see 
all speakers so far, are firmly committed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has always recognized that the true measure of our 
community and our culture is how we treat the most vulnerable in 
our society.  Nobody would argue that children placed in a 
position of trust are easily those who are the most vulnerable. 
We believe that legislation like this takes us one more step down 
the road of making sure that our society can provide a safe and 
nurturing place for those people who are most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always maintained that history will judge us not by the 
illustrious buildings in our capital cities nor the might of our 
armies.  We will be judged by what measures we have taken in this 
very privileged time to make sure we all enjoy the benefits not 
only of the redistribution of wealth but also of having some 
measure of safety and security no matter where we and our 
children are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad to vote in favour of Bill C-69.  We are very pleased 
this measure came forward.  It is the right thing to do and a 
very timely thing to do.  We compliment the movers of the 
amendments.  I give my assurance that the NDP caucus will vote in 
favour of Bill C-69. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to take part in this debate.  I 
can assure the hon. member who just spoke that it will be 
unanimous in terms of our support.  The Conservative Party as 
well is very much in favour of this bill as we were of that of 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre.  His Bill C-284 was the impetus to 
the government's adoption of this particular notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As outlined by previous speakers who referred to Bill C-69, this 
particular act that is to be amended will now incorporate and 
permit law enforcement agencies, and by virtue of their 
co-operation, agencies such as Big Brothers, Scouts Canada, 
kindergartens and those who seek to have persons in positions of 
trust in their employ, to inquire through the police and through 
the solicitor general's department about the appearance on a 
person's record of a prior sexual assault conviction. Prior to 
this amendment there was no ability to do so with any certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned a balance always has to be struck when one 
is attempting to disclose information that was deemed to have 
been pardoned.  This country's pardon system has often been 
questioned. This bill and the amendment to this type of 
information is very positive. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along those lines, May 3 to May 7 was sexual awareness week. The 
city of Lethbridge promoted this week by bringing to the 
attention of Canadians the issue of sexual assault.  It made this 
comment in its literature:  “It is not an issue of sex; it is an 
issue of power and control”.  That is very true when it comes to 
the disclosure of information to protect those in our society who 
are most vulnerable.  I am talking here about children who are 
very vulnerable when exposed potentially to individuals who have 
been convicted of sexual assaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which will amend the Criminal Records Act and other 
acts as a consequence, will provide the necessary protection.  It 
allows access to records of pardoned individuals which was 
previously unavailable.  It will work in conjunction with another 
bill which is currently before the House of Commons, Bill C-79. 
That bill is aimed specifically at bringing victims more into the 
picture with respect to our criminal justice system.  It is 
intended to allow access in particular by the police and agencies 
to this vital information which concerns sex offenders who had 
received a pardon previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safeguards to protect the individual's rights exist within 
the legislation.  The solicitor general has a degree of 
discretion where, as referred to, police officers are now 
mandated to make the disclosure when the request has occurred and 
the proper vetting has also occurred.  There are safeguards and 
scrutiny will take place before the information will be 
disclosed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of high profile individual cases that have 
become very public, one of which rocked our national sport of 
hockey.  I am referring to the Toronto Maple Leafs scandal 
involving an usher, John Roby whose case is now coming to a 
close. Mr. Roby was facing 35 charges of molesting children and 
showed very little remorse throughout the trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of predatory violence is something we must do 
everything possible about in this House and certainly in our law 
enforcement.  We must do everything within our means to ensure 
the proper information is disseminated to society so people will 
know and can identify those persons who are preying on our most 
vulnerable the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior access to criminal records may not have helped in that 
case. This is a situation where this is not retroactive for cases 
that have already been heard.  But in similar future situations 
where there is a high rate of recidivism, which is the case when 
it comes to sexual assault complainants, they need to know that 
individuals have in the past engaged in this type of despicable 
behaviour.  These records will be flagged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who have engaged in that activity and who have been 
for whatever reason granted a pardon will have their records 
flagged.  Agencies will be permitted to gain access to that 
information and then make informed decisions as to whether they 
would put a person with that type of record in a position of 
working in close contact with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another tragic case which has garnered much public attention is 
the case of Alison Parrot, an 11 year old who was raped and 
murdered by Francis Carl Roy in 1989.  Alison's mother tried to 
seek justice in the death of her daughter yet there was a further 
tragedy.  Mr. Roy should not have been on the streets.  He had 
two prior convictions for the rapes of teenage girls and had 
assaulted another woman only days before Alison Parrot was raped 
and murdered. The judge decided to protect Mr. Roy's right to 
presumption of innocence and agreed to the defence motion not to 
disclose to the jury the prior convictions in the other cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be an issue for another day, but I suggest again that 
when it comes to the protection of children, information is 
power.  It is power in the hands of those who need it most, 
mainly the police and agencies that oversee children through 
their education or caregiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 will set up a sex offender registry which will be 
accessed over the Canadian Police Information Centre, the CPIC 
system.   That information will be quickly available to police 
officers who can then pass it on to those who make the inquiries. 
This again is important.  Speed of access is very important. 
When a person applies for a job or volunteers for an 
organization, the information needed for the decision to hire or 
not to hire is required in a very expeditious way.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure that would enable people to notify these 
agencies like CPIC is by making direct inquiries through the 
solicitor general's department.  Again this is a welcome change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to enact legislation such as Bill C-69, we may 
some day reach a point where the Canadian public will again begin 
to believe in our justice system and have greater faith in the 
ability of our law enforcement agencies to protect them from 
sexual predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always talk in situations such as this one of the 
charter of rights and the individual's rights to be protected. 
We know that a pardon is an extraordinary remedy when a person 
has already been convicted and has gone through the proper legal 
channels.  However there are some instances, and obviously the 
protection of children is one, that outweigh that individual's 
rights to keep this information private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that there is a recognition of this by the government 
and the efforts of the hon. member for Calgary Centre and all 
participants of the justice committee. I would commend the 
witnesses who also came forward and spoke in favour of this 
legislative initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal records concerning a pardoned offence will only be 
released by the solicitor general or the RCMP after there is 
written notification given to the affected offender. There will 
also be an element of vetting as to the appropriateness of this 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community rights in most instances should prevail. Statistics 
have shown that since 1994, 700 pardoned individuals have 
reoffended.  This is somewhat disturbing, particularly when it 
again bears on the protection of children. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in democracy. Therefore, I believe in rights for 
everyone, including former sexual offenders. I can understand 
the minister's dilemma: she must always try to ensure that the 
rights of all Canadians are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-69 the minister tried to come up with a bill that 
will protect all Canadians. In a democracy we must 
debate bills, to allow elected representatives to suggest 
possible changes. Normally, these changes will improve the 
legislation. 
However, a balance is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I apologize for interrupting the hon. member

three of our nine school liaison officers; that is, one-third.

justice.

decision is made by cabinet of a replacement for Mr. Justice Cory 
that decision is subject to the scrutiny of parliament through

leads us to believe that what we are doing now and what we will 
continue to do has brought good results.

apply for permanent residence other considerations apply.

complicated.  They referred him to a 1-800 line in Agriculture 
Canada which also could not help him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that the staff could not help and 
Agriculture Canada could not help, would the minister be prepared 
to go out to the lobby, pick up a telephone and call Mr. Linnell 
now at the following number: 306-697-2913?  Mr. Linnell is

in my department for staff to personally help the farmers fill 
out their forms. I do know there are lots of qualified people out 
there.  I would suggest that the farmer speak to his accountant.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK175">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-69, an 
act to amend the Criminal Records Act and to amend another act in 
consequence, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House broke for question 
period the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough had 11 
minutes remaining in his allotted time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I was saying before the question period break, 
what is needed in all cases involving justice where there is a 
balance to be reached between the individual and the right of 
society to be protected, a very delicate balance must be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the protection of children, who are least able 
to protect themselves, I would suggest that in most, if not all 
cases, we must tip that balance in favour of doing all that is 
possible to protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier the case that arose in Toronto at Maple Leaf 
Gardens.  We are also aware from news reports of the case of 
Graham James who was the former head coach of the Swift Current 
Broncos. It was a much publicized case involving the position of 
trust that a coach would hold and his ability to act in a 
predatory way toward vulnerable young men, in this instance 
hockey players. 
We know as well that there are numerous instances when this 
occurs and a position of trust is abused.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reinforces the importance of Bill C-69 and the ability of 
agencies, coaches, teachers, volunteers, counsellors and 
individuals involved in the delivery of services to children to 
access information that would disclose this type of background. 
One would be quick to acknowledge that it is a very sick and 
twisted background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-69 go far enough?  The names of convicted sex 
offenders in this case belong to the solicitor general and his 
records.  The solicitor general would have the discretion as to 
whether that name and the record itself would be disclosed.  The 
RCMP, due to recent amendments to this bill, do not have that 
discretion and I believe that is a good thing because there is an 
opportunity in some instances for individual police officers to 
be placed in a very uncomfortable position about whether they 
should in fact release this information.  They need the support 
of their department, and in this case we are talking about the 
solicitor general's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims of crime, individuals who have been directly affected, 
including their families, are those who would be most in favour 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police of course were very supportive of the efforts that 
were made by the hon. member for Calgary Centre.  They spoke very 
favourably of his efforts and were very receptive to the 
government's position that it took in incorporating those 
suggestions into the bill which is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to citizens in communities, I have seen instances 
where citizens have taken steps of their own.  They have posted 
notices around the neighbourhood when they were aware of an 
individual who had been engaged in this despicable exploitation 
of children and yet the agencies were not able to make public 
that person's past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that this bill will, in some way, remedy that situation 
in terms of disclosure, public knowledge and, ultimately, 
protection.  Knowledge will protect people affected by sex 
offenders living in their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern that a person might have is about the bureaucracy 
that often surrounds the implementation of an exercise such as 
this.  The solicitor general could gain possession of records 
only through a written request to the prison commissioner if the 
subject of the records had already given written consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For police investigating a sex crime, the same type of rule 
would apply.  They would have to rely on the commissioner to make 
a notation; in other words, to flag a certain record that would 
allow the police to then access the information.  Yet a police 
force or other authorized body may also request the commissioner 
to provide the minister with any record of the conviction of that 
applicant and the commissioner may then transmit the record to 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With more work now being placed in the hands of the already 
overworked and underfunded police forces around the country there 
is some concern as to how they will handle this additional 
workload. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen similar government bills, such as the youth 
criminal justice act, where greater responsibility and emphasis 
will be placed on the police in the exercise of their front line 
authority, but there will be no additional resources.  This is 
something about which we have to be sensitive.  Hopefully the 
government will also be sensitive to it when it is looking at 
next year's budgets and the money that will be allotted to the 
police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to give them the tools, legislative 
initiatives, changes to the Criminal Code and changes to the 
Criminal Records Act without giving them the accompanying funding 
that will allow them to use effectively these law enforcement 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others who might request the information that is covered by Bill 
C-69 would be members of organizations, possibly for the 
well-being of children.  Examples might include a parent who 
would like to find out about a child's hockey coach, a teacher or 
a kindergarten supervisor.  Associations like the Pictou County 
Minor Hockey Association, the Antigonish Minor Hockey 
Association, Big Brothers or Big Sisters would be able to access 
information about employees or volunteers who were in or were 
attempting to enter those organizations.  This is relevant, 
prevalent information that should be in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been discussion about the rights of the sex offenders 
themselves.  I will be the first to acknowledge that there has to 
be some degree of respect for any person who has very damaging 
information such as this on their record, particularly when it is 
extremely dated.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we are into the argument of balance.  I would suggest 
that any indication this information would be withheld or kept 
completely private would certainly be outweighed by the need to 
protect the public and the need to protect children in this 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill fully.  I know the bill hinges upon passage 
quickly through this place.  This is a process with which you are 
intimately familiar, Mr. Speaker.  It often takes a long time. 
Bills coming through the justice department and the solicitor 
general's departments are coming in some instances in a very slow 
and grinding fashion.  We saw that particularly with the youth 
criminal justice act.  However, with the unanimous support we 
have seen for the bill and the importance that has been place 
upon it, there is hope of its speedy passage through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of the community has to be given the highest 
order when it comes to bills of this nature.  There is ample 
support not only in this place but around the country for having 
the bill firmly ensconced in our Criminal Code and in our 
criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pride that I lend support to the government's 
initiative.  Again much of the impetus and credit for the bill is 
to be bestowed upon the member for Calgary Centre.  He worked 
very diligently in bringing the matter forward to this point.  He 
was very active in the justice committee in having it brought to 
fruition and is to be commended for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 will certainly lead to a more stringent offender 
registry.  I have serious concerns, and the Progressive 
Conservative Party repeatedly expresses its concerns, about the 
already overburdened Canadian Police Information Centre and the 
computer system that houses the information such as the DNA 
databank, the criminal registry, the DNA registry and the 
ill-founded gun registry that is set up to fail.  All these 
current computer information systems are embodied in one system 
that is extremely strapped at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has announced a $150 million addition in funding 
for the computer system, but conservative estimates from the 
police indicate that it is simply insufficient.  It is not half 
of what is actually needed to make the system operate 
efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 will receive the support of the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  It is the hope of our party that those who 
prey upon children and have been caught and those whose names 
have been recorded in our criminal justice system will not now be 
able to point to a pardon as a means to protect themselves from 
having that information disclosed to those who need it most. 
Sadly, we will never be in a position to ensure that children are 
not vulnerable in certain instances, but the bill goes some 
distance to achieving that very laudable goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend all those involved in the production of the bill, 
those involved in the drafting, and particularly those who 
testified and had great input into the bill reaching this point. 
The PC Party will be supporting the bill.  We look forward to its 
passage and seeing it become a legislative initiative.

<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am certainly very pleased to 
rise today to bring to the attention of my hon. colleagues the 
short but very important Bill S-23 which was considered and 
passed by the Senate earlier in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues will recall that parliament recently dealt 
with legislation pertaining to marine liability in the form of 
Bill S-4.  With the introduction of Bill S-23, we are proposing 
to move in the area of air carrier liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-23 amends the Carriage by Air Act so that Canada can join 
other states in legally recognizing two major international 
instruments dealing with matters relating to air carrier 
liability such as Montreal Protocol No. 4 which relates to cargo 
and the Guadalajara convention which clarifies the coverage of 
the Warsaw convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two documents update and modernize elements of the Warsaw 
convention, which sets out the legal rights and responsibilities 
of the carrier, passengers and shippers in relation to 
international air transportation.  They will be annexed to the 
legislation as schedules IV and V. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Carriage by Air Act was first enacted in 1947 to give the 
federal government the authority to have Canada accede to the 
Warsaw convention, which had been signed in 1929. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act was amended in 1963 to authorize the federal government 
to implement The Hague protocol, which amended and updated the 
Warsaw convention to take into account the evolution in the 
requirements of airline carriage in the 25 years following its 
signature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeking with this bill is essentially the same as in 
1963:  additions to the Carriage by Air Act which will enhance 
and clarify air carrier liability coverage and simplify 
documentary requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unification of law relating to the international carriage by 
air, in particular the unification of law relating to liability, 
has been of vital importance for the harmonious management of 
international air transport.  Without such unification, complex 
conflicts of laws would arise and the settlement of claims would 
be unpredictable, very costly, time consuming, and possibly 
uninsurable.  Furthermore, conflicts of jurisdiction could arise 
which would further aggravate the settlement of liability claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This uniformity remains a significant contributor to the 
facilitation of international air transportation in that the 
conditions for the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo are 
to a large degree similar on international flights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard the Warsaw convention has been hailed and 
recognized as the one international private law conventions that 
has managed to unify the legal systems of some 140 states party 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the international scene it has long been recognized 
that the 1929 Warsaw convention requires change to modernize it 
so as to provide a wider mandated protection for passengers, for 
carriers and for shippers.  Montreal Protocol No. 4 and the 
Guadalajara convention were developed to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal Protocol No. 4 amends the liability regime as it 
applies to cargo by providing stricter carrier liability and 
establishing unbreakable limits. 
It also simplifies the cargo documentation requirements and 
authorizes the electronic transmission of information.  This 
transmission of cargo information, using means other than the 
traditional multicopy air waybill, can provide significant cost 
savings to carriers and to shippers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become extremely important that Canada act quickly to 
accede to this protocol as it came into effect in June 1998 when 
the minimum number of 30 states had ratified it.  More 
specifically, the protocol was ratified by the United States in 
late 1998 and came into effect in that country on March 4 of this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that until Canada has been able to deposit its own 
ratification documents and the protocol has come into effect in 
Canada, our carriers and our shippers will be at a competitive 
disadvantage vis-à-vis their U.S. counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Guadalajara convention clarifies the relationship between 
passengers and shippers on the one hand and carriers on the 
other.  The convention extends the rules of the Warsaw liability 
regime to the carrier actually performing the carriage when it is 
not the same as the carrier with which the passenger or shipper 
has contracted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sharing of the liability between contracting and operating 
carrier, when they are not the same, has become increasingly 
important as international carriers, such as both Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines, joined together in global commercial 
alliances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extensive consultations were conducted by Transport Canada.  It 
was determined that both Montreal Protocol No. 4 and the 
Guadalajara convention have the unanimous support of the Canadian 
aviation industry as well as all the aviation related 
organizations in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notably, the airlines are very anxious for Canada to act 
quickly, particularly now that Montreal Protocol No. 4 is in 
force and applies in many countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to industry consultations, 23 federal departments 
and agencies were consulted, including justice, finance, foreign 
affairs, national defence and the Canadian Transportation Agency. 
All departments expressed support for or raised absolutely no 
concerns regarding the adoption by Canada of these two very 
important instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative, hon. members, that we ensure that Canadian 
carriers, travellers and shippers have the benefit of an 
international legal regime that better reflects the realities of 
today's aviation industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should move quickly to adopt this short but 
extremely important bill.  To delay would be to increase the 
length of time our carriers will be at a competitive 
disadvantage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party basically agrees with the bill.  It is very 
technical.  As the parliamentary secretary stated, the amendments 
will implement the Montreal Protocol No. 4 of 1975 and the 
Guadalajara supplementary convention, 1961. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international agreements amend and supplement respectively 
the Warsaw convention of 1929 and the unification of certain 
rules relating to international carriage by air of 1955, which 
are part of Canada's Carriage by Air Act.  The 1929 and 1955 
agreements establish documentary requirements and liability 
regimes for international air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said initially, this is a fairly technical bill and, in 
some ways, a housekeeping bill.  The Reform Party agrees with its 
implementation, but we strongly disagree with the method by which 
it arrived in the House.  It came from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House account to our constituents.  At the next 
election, they will tell us whether they agree or disagree with 
us.  That is democracy.  This is the House that the bill should 
have come from, not the Senate.  The Senate is unaccountable and 
not representative.  In our view, all bills should originate in 
the lower House and then go on to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, we agree with the bill but we strongly disagree 
with the method and the route by which the bill has arrived in 
the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the name of my riding is quite long, but it truly represents the 
many sub-regions I have the honour to represent here, in Ottawa, 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 40 minutes to speak on this issue pursuant to 
parliamentary procedure, but since it is Friday afternoon, I 
know that many of my hon. colleagues are looking forward to 
heading back to their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that, even if parliament is not sitting next 
week, unlike what many people might suggest, members of 
parliament will not be on holiday. We will be in recess. I want 
to make a non-partisan comment. I believe that, next week, none 
of my 301 colleagues in this House will be on holiday. We all 
have work waiting for us at our riding offices, people to meet 
and companies to visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, some reporters are suggesting that members of 
parliament will take some time off. The people close to members 
of parliament know that, yes, we do take some time off 
sometimes, because we are human after all. But next week, from 
May 17 to 24, the 301 members of parliament will not be on 
holiday. We will be in recess and working in our respective 
ridings. 
I wanted to make this non-partisan comment because of the great 
respect I have for the House of Commons as a parliamentary 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules of procedure allow me to speak for 40 minutes, but I 
will not use all the time I am allowed, especially since, as my 
Reform colleague rightly pointed out earlier, Bill S-23 is mostly 
a technical bill aimed at implementing two international 
conventions. One can hardly be against this type of bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, like the Reform member, I too want to deplore the fact 
that the government has chosen, once again, to let this bill be 
brought in through the other house, the name of which I cannot 
mention. Members know that the Senate cannot be mentioned by 
name in the House, and that is why I must refer to it as the 
other house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has 155 elected members, which is a majority. 
Since it was elected to govern, it could very well have 
introduced this bill through the usual channel. What is 
disturbing to opposition members is that, if one reads <I>Hansard</I> 
from the years 1984 to 1993, it shows that the Liberals 
criticized the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney for 
using such a procedure. Now that they are in office, they are 
doing exactly the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the members of the Bloc Quebecois had the 
opportunity to say during the campaigns leading to the 1993 and 
the June 2, 1997 elections—and we will have the opportunity to 
say it again during the next election campaign—that Liberals and 
Conservatives are all the same. When they sit in opposition, 
they criticize the government, and when they take office, they 
act in the exact same way as the government they criticized.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disturbing to see that the government has chosen to 
introduce this bill in a house made up of non-elected members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to underline the terrific work being done by my hon. 
colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle and by the Liberal member from 
Sarnia—Lambton, who are campaigning to have the Senate abolished. 
Through their work, they want to ensure that the decisions are 
taken by democratically elected parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as we MPs are concerned, the people can replace us every 
four or five years. We are not appointed for partisan or 
political reasons or because we are government cronies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear about former ministers in the National Assembly 
who were appointed to the Senate by the current Prime Minister 
and who are receiving their pension from the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also mention Ross Fitzpatrick, the Liberal bagman from 
western Canada, who was appointed to the Senate by the current 
Prime Minister and who sits on the board of directors of 
Canadian Airlines and is lobbying for this company. We could 
come up with many more names like these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about people who were appointed under the Mulroney 
government, like Senator Pierre Claude Nolin, the chief 
Conservative organizer in Quebec during the 1988 election 
campaign, who was appointed to the Senate at age 39. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point here is simply to raise public awareness and make you 
realize, Mr. Speaker, as I am sure you are by now, given the way 
you seem to be hanging on to my every word, that we will be asking 
the government in the future to continue to use— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it was not my colleague's intention to name the other 
place. Usually members do not name the other place in this 
House because both Houses are different from one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, to respond to the point of 
order raised by the member who interrupted me, I will say that I 
have been talking about the other House since the beginning of 
my speech. I did not say the other place. I am being careful not 
to mention the Senate by name. I have been talking about the 
other House, but we will not get into this any further. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My 
colleague knows full well that he is not supposed to mention the 
Senate in the House.  If he wants to say the other place that is 
fine, but he should not name it by name.  The member knows that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill is aimed at giving 
effect, in Canadian law, to international treaties ratified by 
Canada. To do so, this bill amends the Carriage by Air Act to 
implement the Montreal Protocol No. 4 and the Guadalajara 
Supplementary Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two international agreements amend and supplement the 
Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating 
to International Carriage by Air, which establishes the 
documentary requirements and liability regime for international 
air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal Protocol No. 4 simplifies cargo documentation, 
authorizes its transmission by electronic means, and amends the 
cargo liability regime. The Guadalajara Supplementary Convention 
extends the rules of the Warsaw Convention to carriage performed 
by a carrier other than the one with whom the passenger or 
shipper entered into a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree, this topic is quite dry and technical.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it regrettable that the leader of the government is 
eating an apple in this House.  We are not allowed to name the 
Senate, but what about eating apples in the House?  The member 
for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell is eating an apple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to show disrespect for this member.  We can see 
he is looking after his health, and finds it important to eat 
apples.  I would have preferred him not to do so here in this 
House, for a degree of decorum is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Montreal Protocol No. 4, which came into force in 
June of 1998, took effect in the United States last March 4.  In 
other words, until Canada implements it, American carriers and 
shippers have an advantage over their Canadian competitors, 
because they can use the electronic transmission of air waybills 
for cargo, which is far less costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that countries applying these international 
conventions will have a certain advantage over those that do 
not.  This is, therefore, a bill which is in the interests of 
Canada and Quebec, and one which represents a needed change as 
commercial exchanges continue to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to point out that these agreements were signed 
under the auspices of the Montreal based International Civil 
Aviation Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons our party supports this bill, and 
encourages the government to see that it is passed as quickly as 
possible, if this can be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I want to say that I am splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Churchill River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is called Bill S-23.  For people watching today, bills 
come here called <I>C</I> which means Commons.  Some are called 
<I>S</I> which means they originated in the Senate rather than the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object to having a bill originating in what we call the other 
place.  The other place is not elected, it is not democratic and 
it is not accountable to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the minister, who is the government House leader across 
the way, hanging on to the curtain in the back.  I would like to 
know from him why more and more bills are originating in the 
other place. I can see him shaking his head but I cannot hear 
what he is saying.  Now he is scurrying out the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I do not wish to 
interrupt but it would certainly not be fair to suggest that the 
government House leader was scurrying out.  He is making a very 
dignified exit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  He did not scurry or crawl but 
he did make an exit.  Maybe he will come back in again after he 
has a bowl of soup or something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise this very serious question because this bill 
originated in the other place.  In the last poll I have seen, the 
other place has the support of about 5% of the Canadian people. 
Five per cent of the Canadian people support the existing Senate, 
support the structure of the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great debate in the country as to whether or not it 
should be abolished or reformed.  Of the remaining 95% of the 
Canadian people, they are roughly divided equally between 
reforming the other place and electing it in some way, and just 
abolishing it and getting rid of it.  That is the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems very strange that the government across the way would 
originate a bill in a place that is not elected, not accountable 
and has the support of 5% of the Canadian people.  I do not know 
another democracy in the world that would legitimize the other 
place by originating a bill in the other place when it is not 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about a board, or a commission or an agency. 
We are talking about a legislative body that can initiate 
legislation to change the laws of the country.  I think that is a 
serious democratic issue in a modern-day parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see you sitting in your chair looking pretty sad 
yourself when you start reflecting on the state of democracy in 
the country.  I am also pretty sad to see the government doing 
this time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people do not support that institution. 
Ninety-five per cent of Canadians are saying that they do not 
support the existing institution of the Senate. 
Yet the government time and time again will go there to initiate 
legislation.  That is fundamentally wrong. I would like to see 
government members stand up and defend why they do this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one minister in the House now who is listening very 
carefully to this debate.  We have time this afternoon for him to 
get up and respond as to why they insist on doing this.  The time 
has come for us to have a serious debate about electoral and 
parliamentary democracy and how to make this institution more 
meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew the government House leader many years ago.  I remember 
in 1968 when I was first elected he was working in the House. The 
turnout in that election campaign was about 80% of the 
population.  In the last election campaign it went down to about 
67%. More and more people are giving up on the electoral system. 
They are losing confidence in the electoral system.  More and 
more people are cynical of politicians and the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason is that we have a legislative body that initiates 
legislation.  It is not elected, not accountable and not 
democratic.  We cannot get back at those people. If a Reform 
member from British Columbia or an NDP member from Regina does 
something people do not like, every three, four or five years the 
people can say no.  I experienced that in 1993 when I lost the 
seat of Yorkton—Melville in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do about a senator?  There is nothing that can be 
done about someone in the other place, short of their being 
convicted for some serious criminal activity and being forced out 
by their colleagues.  There was one who was living in Mexico for 
a long period of time.  He had to resign under the pressure of 
public opinion.  Short of that, there is no way of holding those 
people accountable and keeping their feet to the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members in the other place who do not live in their 
home provinces and hardly ever go back to them.  They do not go 
to meet their people.  Some of them have even lived outside of 
the country.  They draw a salary and expenses roughly equivalent 
to those of a member of parliament.  They travel the world. 
People think they are like American senators so the red carpet is 
rolled out for them.  That is the kind of institution we 
tolerate. We spend $50 million a year of taxpayers' money funding 
the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of the homeless people under a bridge a few blocks from 
Parliament Hill who could use a few thousand dollars for public 
housing.  Think of the money we could put into training and 
skills to put people to work.  Think of the farmers we talked 
about in question period today who are now on a suicide watch 
because they do not have money to pay their bills. Yet we pay 
those people in the other place, who have no obligations 
whatsoever in terms of accountability, $50 million. And the 
government across the way initiates legislation in the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government House leader will rise to his feet and 
explain to us how in the name of modern democracy he can tolerate 
such a situation.  I can say that the Canadian people do not 
tolerate it.  Only 5% of them support the other place, yet we 
have a government that ignores the wishes of 95% of the Canadian 
people.  My oh my, once in power how they change their minds and 
how they change their hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister across the way will answer the questions on 
behalf of the people of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very intently to the words of my hon. 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everyone in Canada, certainly everyone in this 
place, is well aware that our two parties share the same 
sentiment toward the inappropriateness of the present structure 
of the other place.  Where we differ is that my hon. colleague's 
party chooses to support the abolishment of the senate, while the 
Reform Party of Canada supports a triple E senate.  I wear the 
triple E pin very proudly.  I still support the concept that we 
need an equal, effective and elected senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my hon. colleague that the vast majority of 
Canadians do not believe the Senate as it is presently structured 
serves any useful purpose.  It is a patronage haven for the old 
parties.  With the dictatorial system we have in the House and 
the way in which the present government operates by ramming 
through legislation with closure, I ask my colleague how would we 
have a check and balance without having an elected, effective and 
regional Senate?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the 
triple E idea is ever going to happen. We would need an amendment 
to the Constitution and the unanimous consent of all provinces 
along with the federal parliament in order to do that. I do not 
think we are ever going to get Quebec to agree to have the same 
number of senators as Prince Edward Island, let alone Ontario 
having the same number of senators as New Brunswick. If we did 
get that agreement the powers would be so weak and ineffective it 
would not matter if we had a Senate in the first place. It comes 
right down to the fact that this is never going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we need a second elected body in terms of 
bureaucracy and the many more politicians who would be funded. 
The amount involved would be greater than the $50 million we see 
today.  This would invite gridlock between the two Houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member's question, we need to bring 
accountability into the House of Commons.  We need to bring the 
review process into the House of Commons by reforming and 
democratizing this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers of the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council 
Office have to be reduced. These questions were raised in the 
House today by the Reform Party and I certainly agree.  The 
appointment of justices and the appointment of senior people in 
the government should have a parliamentary and democratic review 
as is done in most countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliamentary committees should be stronger and have more 
independence where legislation can be initiated.  We should have 
fewer confidence votes in the House of Commons.  All kinds of 
bills go through this place that should not be confidence bills. 
Parliamentarians should be able to vote their own line and 
express their own point of view. That should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that we should have fixed election dates, fixed 
dates for budgets and fixed dates for throne speeches. This would 
again take power away from the government and away from the Prime 
Minister and the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that?  I say it because we need big democracy in 
this country.  There have only been two elections since 1921 
where a majority of the people voted for a majority government 
and those were the governments of Mackenzie King in 1945 and John 
Diefenbaker in 1958.   Every other time a majority has been 
elected by a minority of the people.  This Liberal government has 
the support of 38% of the Canadian people, yet it has had a 
majority for five years. I think that is wrong without 
accountability built into this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking at modernizing our electoral system by 
bringing in a mix of proportional representation so the vote of 
the people is reflected by the composition of the House.  We are 
now one of only two or three countries in the world without a mix 
of PR.  We are not a modern electoral democracy and the minister 
across the way knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Britain, the mother of parliaments, has a mix of PR in the 
Scottish assembly and the Welsh assembly. In the election after 
the next, it will be brought into the United Kingdom parliament 
itself.  There is an election taking place now for the European 
parliament where every member from Great Britain is being elected 
through PR, through regional constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are things which we should be looking at.  Every other 
country in the world has modernized its electoral system. We can 
do it in Canada as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill S-23 is an act to amend the Carriage by Air Act.  There are 
opportunities to improve air transportation in this country and 
not only by this act. I will put forward a challenge on this in a 
very short while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air transportation in this country has evolved to become a major 
component of our way of life and the way we do our business. We 
will all be travelling back to our constituencies during the 
upcoming recess and a vast majority of us will depend upon air 
transportation to get us home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air is the only form of transportation to access communities in 
certain regions of this vast country of ours.  Air transportation 
moves the basic necessities of life such as food and other cargo 
into isolated and remote areas. These isolated and remote areas 
depend upon good service from air carriers, but if these services 
are not available, then good sound legislation is of utmost 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modernizing of our Carriage by Air Act is long overdue.  The 
last update was in 1964, almost 40 years ago. There has been a 
lot of developments in the air transportation industry since 
then. There has hardly been any development on the issue of a 
passengers bill of rights.

be assured for luggage and cargo loss.  I had not realized this 
until I read the bill. A few years ago I had a carry on bag with 
sound equipment and photography equipment in it.  Somebody walked 
off with it at the next stopover.  When we arrived at our 
destination, my bag was missing.  I had $1,300 of equipment 
missing and the offer made to me was $35.  I could never figure 
out where the $35 came from.  It comes from the Guadalajara 
convention of 1961. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are international agreements that bind our nations, such 
as the 1988 Montreal protocol.  All Canada is doing with Bill 
S-23 is modernizing and updating it to its international

</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge I want to place before the House and the 
government is that we have a Canadian passengers bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear of recent developments on the news and in the media 
about the Americans.  Our neighbours to the south are just as 
dependent on air transportation as we are, going between the east

were protected under the American passengers bill of rights.

what protection our families have, when looking at disasters that 
have hit our airports and airlines in recent years.  Our 
situation forces us to use air transportation. Other situations 
loom before us in terms of a passengers bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A snowstorm hit eastern Canada this past winter.  Passengers 
were inconvenienced and left stranded in Canadian airports. 
Toronto was a prime example. Passengers were the last to know of 
any developments in the weather or decisions being made by the 
air carriers regarding the rescheduling of flights or 
arrangements for overnight accommodation.  We saw pictures of 
passengers sleeping on benches in the airports.  There were 
stories of lost cargo and luggage. This is a challenge for the 
government to look at a sound and safe passenger bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new territory was born on April 1.  We hear stories that the 
entire territory does not have any highways to connect any of its 
communities unless it is winter travel by snow machine or dog 
team.  They depend on air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary air transportation responsibility is highlighted in 
this bill.  People switch from one airline to another.  They may 
end up on six different airlines to reach their destination 
because of the huge explosion of other air transportation systems 
after deregulation of air transportation in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at protection and who is responsible. It is 
highlighted in the bill that the primary air carrier will be 
responsible for passengers rights, whatever limited rights there 
are in the act.  It does not matter whether passengers transfer 
flights.  As long as the first air carrier on the ticket is 
listed, that is who is responsible for the passengers rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill S-23 and the updating of the Carriage by Air 
Act.  It is an international standard act. I must repeat that we 
need a Canadian bill of rights for passengers, for our citizens 
and for visitors whom we wholeheartedly welcome into the country, 
as we just recently did with the Kosovar refugees. Tourists drive 
the economy of many regions of the country, especially during the 
spring and summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish everyone safe travel this weekend. I welcome and wish all 
passengers and refugees who have come to our country safe travel.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of our transportation critic from Cumberland—Colchester I 
will take a few moments to speak to Bill S-23, which we will be 
supporting.  Like the member who just spoke, I would like to see 
discussion on some other things, such as a Canadian bill of 
rights for passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region of Canada I come from is Newfoundland and Labrador. I 
would love to get a chance to discuss in the House the cost of 
airfare in this country, in particular the cost of regional 
airfare.  The cost of airfare in Newfoundland is a significant 
prohibiter to travel.  There are significant problems for the 
tourism industry.  For many individuals who have to travel on 
crisis calls, the regional costs of airfare are absolutely 
shameful. Someday we may get a chance to discuss these issues in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will read a few notes on behalf of our critic which 
address Bill S-23.  It is a bill regarding air transport that 
ratifies amendments to the Warsaw convention on international 
carriage by air.  More specifically, Bill S-23 takes the form of 
amendments to the Carriage by Air Act by implementing Montreal 
Protocol No. 4 and the Guadalajara supplementary convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Warsaw convention was signed in 1929.  It assigns liability 
to the air carrier and provides for maximum liability in the 
event of death or injury of a passenger and loss of baggage or 
freight.  In addition, the convention authorizes the passenger or 
shipper to enter into a contract in order to improve the terms of 
that liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada gave effect to the Warsaw convention in June 1947 by 
passing the Carriage by Air Act.  This act has been amended from 
time to time to reflect new international agreements relating to 
the conduct of the international airline industry.  The Montreal 
Protocol and the Guadalajara convention are the most recent of 
these new international agreements and parliament has been asked 
to ratify them through this piece of legislation which is now 
before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-23 makes some housekeeping amendments to the Carriage by 
Air Act.  Clarity is provided through definitions at the 
beginning of the act.  The text, in keeping with modern 
legislative practice, has been rendered gender neutral, and a 
formula is provided for the establishment of international 
currency conversions.  The Montreal Protocol and the Guadalajara 
convention are dealt with in schedules IV and V and are referred 
to accordingly in this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal Protocol No. 4 amends the liability regime for cargo 
with stricter carrier liability and with maximum limits.  It 
provides that a carrier is liable for damages to cargo to the 
limits of the liability but only after those damages have been 
established.  As a result, the carrier cannot escape liability by 
taking all necessary precautions and cannot be assessed damages 
beyond the maximum limit even in the event of gross negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This protocol, signed in 1975, only came into effect in 1998 
when the requisite number of 30 states had deposited their 
instruments of ratification.  This protocol came into effect in 
the United States in March of this year and thus puts U.S. 
carriers at a competitive advantage over Canadian carriers.  It 
is therefore imperative that Canada ratify this protocol as soon 
as possible so that our air carriers can remain competitive in 
what is an increasingly competitive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Guadalajara convention in schedule V was first signed in 
1961.  It clarifies the relationship between passengers and 
shippers on the one hand and air carriers on the other.  It is 
already widely in force and it clarifies the application of the 
Warsaw convention to situations where the contract of carriage 
was made by a carrier that did not actually perform some or all 
of the carriage by air.  In short, it distinguishes between the 
contracting company and the carrier actually performing the 
carriage and sets out varying liabilities for each.  This fills a 
gap that results from modern practice where one airline issues 
the ticket and another airline does all or part of the actual 
flight in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Warsaw convention is thus made to apply to the contracting 
carrier throughout the journey and to the actual carrier during 
those parts of the journey that it actually carries.  A claimant 
may sue either, but the aggregate of damages is limited to the 
amounts established by the Warsaw convention.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-23 enjoys the support of the Air Transport Association of 
Canada, a body representing all of the major airlines and many of 
the cargo operators, regional carriers and small airlines as 
well.  The industry regards this legislation as long overdue and 
essential for the modernization and commercial viability of 
Canadian commercial aviation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the PC Party supports the bill and urges its 
quick passage.

order.  I would be remiss if I did not try asking you again to 
seek unanimous consent, which I thought we had, to deal with the 
report stage and third reading of Bill C-64, without debate, to 
dispose of it.  Will you seek unanimous consent to do that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The government House 
leader has moved that the Chair see the clock as being 2.30 p.m.
