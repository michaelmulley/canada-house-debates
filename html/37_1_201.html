<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from June 5 consideration of Bill C-53, An Act to protect human health and safety and the environment by regulating products used for the control of pests, as reported (with amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-275956"></A><a HREF="#Int-275965"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill at this stage, where we are considering amendments introduced by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an amendment that seems particularly unacceptable to me, because it provides for this bill to be subject to examination of its implementation by the Senate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel as if we were going back to the 18th or 19th century, because the elected representatives here in this House and the government itself wish for unelected people to review this legislation and its implementation after several years. This seems totally irrelevant to me, particularly  since we are talking about issues related to pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that the people who have a say on the legislation, its content and its implementation be elected by Canadians rather than senators, who can be influenced by all kinds of lobbyists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how these lobbies are powerful  here in Ottawa, at present. If, on top of that, we give to a unelected chamber the responsibility for intervening  and influencing the content of this legislation after several years, it is as though we were reaching a compromise with official lobbies and trade lobbies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as if we were saying to  them “There must be legislation; a conclusion must be reached; a bill must be introduced, but we will try to make it as painless as possible for you.  If things calm down in two, three or four years, with the Senate's involvement, we will manage to revisit the situation”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great pity to have such an amendment in this bill, when the bill itself has the potential to improve the situation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois considers the bill itself—and not these amendments, including the one that makes it possible to review application of the law a few years later, but rather the bill itself—to be positive and the product of a spirit of co-operation.  Overall, we intend to support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does, however, strike us as important for members to reflect on this.  Why suddenly come up with an amendment of this type? What is more, it is an amendment that, while not creating a total precedent, nonetheless creates precedents for the future.  Why would there not be the same type of amendment in future to all manner of laws, particularly those concerning the environment?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very much surprised that the Minister of the Environment would accept such amendments, thus giving a say to people who have not been elected, not only senators but also the lobbyists that are behind them,  the multinationals in this industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sector in which human health is at stake, in a context where recent knowledge makes us realize that we must minimize the impact of pesticides, it is inappropriate to have presented such an amendment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill itself explains that the people of Quebec and of Canada are increasingly concerned by the negative impact on health of all kinds of pesticides. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an exponential development in recent years of the pesticides available.  Now we realize—and it was even on the news yesterday—that people are developing all manner of illnesses that may be linked to pesticide use, cancer among them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children are affected, and far more in urban areas that might be expected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we use pesticides a lot, it is essential that the public be made aware of the situation. Governments too. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat:  why should we give the Senate a say when we are not required to do so?  Why not keep that right for ourselves, for elected members of parliament?  This seems much more important to me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, about this bill,  the Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides has said that we should not disregard the damages caused by pesticides.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Toxicologists who used to say that pesticides are not terribly dangerous are now changing their   stance”. This is what Édith Smeesters, a biologist and the President of the   Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides,  said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the National Academy of Sciences in the United States is now saying that being exposed to pesticides causes serious neurological problems for young children.  They  have found that when a mother or a father plays with a small child on the grass, if pesticides have been repeatedly used on the grass, the parent could be contributing unawares to the development of certain ailments in the child.  It is essential that we remedy this situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill now before us will at least partially improve the situation.  We must keep on working toward this goal  because we need legislation in this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that pesticides have few short term effects, other than nausea and diarrhea, but that there is  much greater long term risk. This is the most insidious type of illness. If we were to make a comparison, it is similar to tobacco and cigarettes. It is possible to enjoy smoking and to do so for several years, but it is the cumulative effect of the years of smoking and  risk factors that diminish quality of life and increase the rate of  mortality over the long term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same type of situation with pesticides. On a day to day basis, when we are on our lawns or in a public park, we are not necessarily aware of the immediate impact that pesticides can have, but repeated exposure to them causes serious long term problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that the entire pesticide industry is  important. We must keep this in mind when looking at the amendment that the Liberal majority is trying to get through right now, to give the Senate the right to review the legislation in a few years. It is at this point that the burgeoning industry will be able to intervene among unelected parliamentarians and propose amendments to the act that will be introduced in the Senate with or without the approval  of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, it is  very important that we reject this amendment. I think that the members of the Liberal majority and of the  opposition parties should give serious thought to the appropriateness of this amendment and vote against it. In the end, we will still have a very positive bill and one that is better than if these amendments were included.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, let me quote Ms. Smeesters from  CAP:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The residential lawn care industry has grown spectacularly in the last two years. This is a result of mass marketing. A well orchestrated ad campaign has convinced people that their happiness depends on a perfect lawn, that weeds are a serious threat and that pesticides will save them. This is a typically North American behaviour and we want to stop it. The growth in this industry is maddening, since lands are now polluted with pesticides.</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to be on guard against this lobby. This is why we must vote against today's amendment introduced by the Liberal majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask ourselves why and how the government could be convinced of the need for such an amendment. Members of the House of Commons are elected by the people. In the Senate, we have people who are not elected, who represent different lobbies and are influenced by them. Many people owe their appointment to the fact that they were once bagmen, that is of people collecting funds from companies for the Liberal Party of Canada, for the Progressive Conservative Party and the other parties represented in the Senate. Why would the government and the elected members of parliament give a voice to a chamber of unelected people, when all the necessary expertise can be found in the industry and in the pressure groups that want a tougher stand on pesticides?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Senate, when it was created its role may have been to ensure the quality of legislation to compensate for a certain lack of training of members of parliament. This is no longer the case. In this House, we have all the necessary skills to determine whether legislation is appropriate. This is why I believe it is important to defeat the proposed amendment.  I think it is important for the public and  members of the House to know that we want to make a very constructive contribution to the bill. The proof of this is that we will be voting in favour of the bill, but this amendment does not improve it in any way.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I will vote against the amendment that would allow the Senate to review the legislation, but I will vote in favour of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we will continue to improve this bill in the most acceptable fashion possible to ensure that it is adequate, so that we can say in 5, 10 or 15 years “We did good. We made the corrections at right time and now there are fewer illnesses resulting from the use of pesticides”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, as legislators, we will have done our job properly. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, before being elected to represent the constituents of Surrey Central, I was in the business of pest control and the marketing of pesticides. I do have some experience dealing with pesticides and   I hold a degree in agriculture. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Standing  Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development when it studied pesticides, we tabled a minority report on behalf of the official opposition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this background I am pleased to rise to participate in the debate on Bill C-53, an act to protect human health and safety and the environment by regulating products used for the control of pests. In the report stage, only Motion No. 1 and No 7 are up for debate and vote. The others were ruled out of order. Motion No. 1 reverses the PC amendment and is merely changing an “and” to “or”. It likely makes no difference either way. Motion No. 7 reverses a broadly supported subamendment at that committee which adds the “Senate or both  Houses of parliament” instead of a committee of the House of Commons only to conduct a mandatory review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are very straightforward amendments so  I will not make much fuss about them.  However the  legislation intends to control the import, manufacture, sale and use of all pesticides in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stakeholders recognize that there is room for improving the transparency, efficiency and accountability in our pesticides management system. The official opposition advocates promoting a balanced approach toward dealing with the issues relating to the management and regulation of pest control products, and to offer recommendations on how the Pest Management Regulatory Agency can improve on fulfilling its mandate to protect human health and the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, the government lacks balance and does very little to promote partnership and understanding between stakeholders, farmers and property owners. It fails to recognize the tremendous efforts and successes achieved by manufacturers and users of pest control products to make those products as safe to human health and the environment as they are effective in controlling pests and protecting crops.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the May 1999 report, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development dealt with a number of issues relating to identifying, managing, and reducing pesticide risks. The environment commissioner's criticisms of the PMRA included concern over inefficiencies in its regulatory operations, timeline delays within re-evaluation activities, a lack of information sharing and lack of co-operation with industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike legislation in other jurisdictions, as part of the approval process the bill requires manufacturers to show that their chemicals are effective. This adds unnecessary cost and time to review the process. New product registrations should not be delayed. The PMRA should only be concerned with safety and the market will decide if a pesticide is efficient or not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility for risk management must be shared between the PMRA and industry and they should agree on the principles and ground rules guiding risk management. The stakeholders are eager to work with government to ensure the improvements in risk management practices and processes are implemented in  Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficiency of the PMRA's registration operations has a direct impact on Canada's ability to remain competitive internationally. Such a transparent process would go a long way toward enhancing public confidence and accountability in the regulatory system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked the government to amend the bill to include specific approval procedures for minor use chemicals. We asked the government to align Canada's risk management practices with those of our trading partners and through Canada's membership in organizations such as the OECD. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment commissioner expressed serious concern over the credibility gap that exists between talk and action in the federal government's environmental agenda. The lack of co-operation in federal interdepartmental information sharing is a systemic and chronic problem that has persisted under this Liberal government.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-evaluation of scientific evidence should not result in a duplication of  the work conducted by other OECD countries.  Opportunities to accept OECD decisions or to co-ordinate re-evaluation activity among other industrialized countries with regulatory systems similar to that of the Canadian systems should be fully utilized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that 50% of Canada's agricultural production  is exported to the United States, priority efforts must be made to align re-evaluation activities with those of the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PMRA should step up work with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to harmonize data requirements with NAFTA partners and those of other OECD countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition believes that a clear understanding of environmental regulations and research responsibilities between federal and provincial governments and the private sector must be achieved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new act authorizes the exchange of confidential business information, including trade secrets, and creates the potential for intrusion into the area of intellectual property rights, or a violation of fundamental individual and corporate freedoms.  A more thorough investigation of these issues is necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also fears that aircraft dusting pesticides may potentially be used by terrorists.  Canadians need assurances regarding security and safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-53 ignores addressing the problems faced by Canadian farmers.  For instance, pesticides banned in Canada are not banned in many other countries around the world, including the United States of America.  However agricultural produce, fruits and vegetables, from these countries continue to be imported for consumption by Canadians. Not only does this     pose a risk to Canadians but  such produce is cheaper to produce since the banned chemicals are usually cheaper in price.  Canadian farmers, on the other hand, have to use chemicals that are expensive and therefore are at a competitive disadvantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of pesticides in non-agricultural settings has also become a subject of controversy.  The government has done very little to further the understanding of the need for pesticides in urban environments and to recognize the importance and role of the products in non-agricultural sectors in controlling weeds, insects, fungal and other diseases. Pesticides are important to allergy sufferers in minimizing the risk of related disease or damage associated with weeds, pollens or moulds. Pest control products are one tool to create healthy environments and increase the aesthetic value of land. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition is supportive of developing and using proven alternatives in urban environments. Everyone agrees that the health of Canadians should be paramount.  Increased efforts to protect the health of children and pregnant women are to be commended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moratorium on pest control products should  not  be put in place until  there   is a substantial amount of conclusive scientific evidence   that unequivocally links such products to human disease or ill health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition also believes that proven sound science, domestically and internationally, should continue to be the cornerstone for the development of a public policy that is balanced and reasoned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition encourages a national pest management education program with the industry that will further the knowledge of Canadians surrounding pest management challenges and the tools to deal with them.  The Canadian Alliance believes that the single agency model of the PMRA provides for greater accountability and efficiency in pesticide regulations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance supports the general intent of the bill but believes that the amendments  I have mentioned should be made to reflect changes within the industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition advocates promoting a balanced approach toward dealing with issues relating to the management and regulation of pest control products.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like my address today to be designed in two or three parts, some specifically on a couple of the amendments that the department has moved subsequent to the committee's work, which again represents the attitude of the government that the committee work generally is useless work, that it is to be ignored, that any changes to legislation that are sent from the bureaucracy or the minister's office, or in some cases the PMO, are sacrosanct, not to be altered by the plebeians of the House of Commons in the form of members of the committee, in this case the health committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows up in what was really a fairly  important but small amendment that was made by the health committee with regard to  the giving of information to the public, requiring producers of these  pesticides to disclose in detail the contents of the product  they were putting out for consumption in the general marketplace and which  many times has a negative impact on our natural environment, as well as the health of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it was simply saying that we, as intelligent members of society, citizens of Canada, have a right to know what is being placed in the natural environment.  We have a right to make decisions as to whether we will  expose ourselves or our dependent children to these chemicals.  If we are going to make intelligent decisions we need to know the contents,  not just the main ingredient, which the bill does provide for, but all the other ingredients.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first motion today in effect makes that much less likely to happen as a result of the intervention by the minister and the department to reverse the work done by the committee, a committee which was working   not just from this bill as drafted by the department, but also from a lengthy report that was done a year and a half to two years ago by the environment committee which had put forward in great detail the type of legislation,   set out what the problems were  as far as regulating pesticides and   set out in very extensive detail what would be   required in legislation to provide a legislative and regulatory system to protect Canadians and our natural environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some significant degree the bill does not represent     the recommendations that were in that report.  One of those recommendations was to give individual citizens who would be exposed to these chemicals as much information as possible.  This would have been just one way they could have done it. As I said,   at least that was accepted by the health committee.  However it is now being reversed by  this subsequent amendment from the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to appreciate the significance of this. There are other parts of the bill that do not go far enough.  For example,  it does not go far enough in giving   workers   who will be  using these chemicals and who will be exposed to them quite extensively, in some cases, on a daily basis, such as horticulturists and farmers,   sufficient information they need.  As well, it does  not give the doctors who will be treating those workers   should they develop health problems enough knowledge about what they have been exposed to. </p>


	<A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, the position of the government is that we are forcing producers to tell us  the main ingredients. I heard an example used  at the health committee. This is like saying to an individual who has a very high intolerance level to the peanut, “Here is a salad.  There is lettuce in it”,  and then forgetting to tell the person that ground peanuts are also a  part of that salad.  Therefore the person has a very negative reaction to the salad.  We are doing exactly the same thing.  We know there is a major chemical in the pesticide but do not mention all the other ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to consider, with this proposed amendment, the whole question of the cumulative effect.  We may have a chemical that forms 75% of the product and three or four others that form 5%, 6%, 7% or 8% of it. How can a researcher  analyze the impact of the cumulative effects of 5% of this chemical and 2% of that chemical on the human body, on animal tissue and on the natural environment, when this information is not available?  Researchers, whether they be biologists or medical researchers, will not  be assisted at all in their ongoing scientific work and analyses when they do not know to what people, animals and the natural environment have been  exposed.  The bill does not require that to occur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to put this in context. There is something like 6,000 to 7,000 chemicals that are regulated and  permitted in Canada as pesticides. We must think of the potential cumulative effect of those and the potential danger from interaction. We now know more and more about the potential danger, and in many cases real danger, of the ill-effects of the interaction of various chemicals, whereas in the past we ignored them.  A small amount of one chemical acting independently may be of no concern to human health, animal species or to the natural environment.  However, if it is combined, sometimes in a very small proportion, with another chemical there might be a very negative impact on human health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I want to make  is a more general one. We  would have liked to have seen in the bill a regime for phasing out the use of pesticides by general consumers on gardens and around households and schoolyards, basically in an urban-suburban area.  One major recommendation in the report of the environment committee of couple of years ago was that  the phase out and absolute ban of cosmetic pesticides be a cornerstone of any legislation of this nature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat in on some of the hearings of the committee.  It was really quite sad to hear  about people who were on occasion confined to their homes.  They could not go outside due to danger from cosmetic  pesticides.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to speak to  the bill at report stage.  I ask that the House  not approve the amendment contained in Motion No. 1.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-53, An Act to  protect human health and safety and the environment by regulating products used for the control of pests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was time for the legislation regulating the use of pesticides to be modernized. It has been talked about for years. For years, there have been proposals on the table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, many scientists have been warning the public that using pesticides is not a trivial matter and that pesticides are products which carry a health risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more studies are showing the long term impact of pesticides on human health. There is particular emphasis on the effects of pesticide induced illnesses among young children, who have more contact with pesticides because they tumble around on the lawn and often play outside, in close contact with the elements of nature, which may contain vapour from pesticides, insecticides or herbicides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more epidemiological studies are showing beyond any doubt that, in the medium and long term, pesticides can definitely have an impact on human health, not just in a sporadic way, such as dizziness or vomiting, but that they can even actually cause cancer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of pesticides has become routine and their danger played down to the public over  the years, often by the companies which sell these products. The practice of using pesticides is not a trivial matter. In Quebec alone,  8,200 tonnes of pesticides were spread in 1997. Even in the ornamental horticulture sector, there has been a 60% increase   since 1992 in the use of pesticides by ordinary citizens, who often lack information about the dangers of using these products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, there has been a greater attempt at raising awareness in the past few years  coming not from governments but from scientists—particularly in American publications—who are warning the public about the dangers of using pesticides, particularly for improving the appearance of lawns, a  popular practice since the mid-1970's.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the old saying goes, the grass is always  greener on the other side of the fence. We always want to have the greenest lawn in the neighbourhood. It is a matter of pride in our modern life. We want to be able to say our lawn is greener than the Jones' and that it is free of weeds and dandelions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attitudes are changing, though, and so much so that the federal government wants to modernize the Pest Control Act by implementing several recommendations of the committee, and that the Quebec government has also introduced a bill and done some promotion and education to help the public understand the risks of using pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last several years, municipalities have regulated the use of pesticides within their jurisdictions. But that kind of regulation is a brutal attack against  the markets of big corporations that not only produce pesticides but also spread them on the lawns for  consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ChemLawn and Spray Tech have challenged before the supreme court the right of the municipalities to make regulations on the use of pesticides, and they lost. It is a huge victory because these companies which are backed by the manufacturers of pesticides like Monsanto and CIL all too often control the information and the market. This is happening not just here, but also internationally.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is so serious that  a major debate has been going on for some 15 years regarding the fact that these companies control not only the pesticides, insecticides or herbicides that are used for agriculture, which accounts for 80% of their use,  or for  cosmetic purposes, but also control related seeds. Through cross-breeding and genetic manipulations of the seeds, they have managed to ensure that these seeds cannot reproduce themselves. Therefore, it is not possible to keep some of the seeds harvested at the end of the crop year to start the following crop year. These seeds and the plants they produce are also subject to very strict requirements regarding the use of pesticides and pest control in general. The result is that, first, farmers no longer have control over their production and their future. This is happening here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they are forced to buy from these companies, which have an upstream and downstream monopoly on  agricultural production and sales. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, these companies are often transnationals, such as CIL and Monsanto, and they take advantage of their presence all over the world to organize the market, depending on local regulations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has happened in the past. It happened with DDT, a pesticide that was used massively by farmers in Quebec and in Canada. The product was banned here after being banned in the United States, because it was proven to be a strong cancer causing agent. Several years after it had been banned in the United States and  Canada, this product was  still being used in South America. South American farmers were once again being exploited by the large companies that were producing DDT. They were not warned of the dangers related to DDT, a product that had been banned for a number of years already in Canada and in the United States.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time that these corporations, which not only control pesticides, but the very future of agriculture in Quebec and in Canada, and even throughout the world, were brought into line. It is time to break their monopoly on the future of humanity. When one has such perfect control over food production, one also indirectly has perfect control over the survival of the human race.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being said, we deplore the fact that, with the two amendments that were presented, the government only did 80% of the work. It could have improved its legislation and made us 100% happy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, when we  talk about the legislation review process by the Senate, there is something wrong there. The Senate is asked to continue legislative measures or to stop them, while it is for the House of Commons, comprised of elected members who vote, to do its job as lawmaker. It is not legitimate to ask a non elected chamber to decide on the continuing or not of a public policy bill like this one, when it was passed by   elected members. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we would have liked that one of the main recommendations of the committee be included in the bill, that is promoting alternative products to chemical pesticides. There are organic pesticides everywhere. We can blame Canada, as was the case in the 1980s when I was an economist at the Union des producteurs agricoles, for its slow approach in registering pesticides, compared to what is happening in the United States. It is totally different there. The process is very slow here, while American producers now have access to alternative pesticides that are not harmful to the environment. They have a competitive edge over our producers. We should model the registration process and the related resources on the United States. This is what needs to be done here.     </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we deplore the second amendment proposed by the government on the confidentiality of business data. The government could have ignored this type of consideration, especially since there is a problem with  public information about the danger of pesticides when the companies are asked to conduct analyses on the possible effects of their products on health, and these analyses are kept confidential and  the public cannot have access to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will nevertheless vote in favour of the bill, but we would have liked  the government to do  100% and not 80% of its job. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Friday mornings are often full of nice surprises and I do consider it a nice surprise to be able to speak today to a bill that deals mostly with public health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked directly with sick children for many years, so everything that has to do with the health of children is a priority of mine, even more so since I have become a grandmother.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a comparison to explain the significance of this bill. I do not think it has been done yet in the House, so it should be very worthwhile.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antibiotics were developed in the 1950s. They were considered a great thing because they were healing patients. Very serious studies had been carried out. In the end, they concluded that the benefits outweighed the side effects. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell the House about two types of antibiotics that were widely used at the time. The first one was called chloromycetin. Park &amp; Davis shareholders made a lot of money on this drug until a lengthy study showed that it had catastrophic side effects on blood cells, namely the red blood cells which carry oxygen, the white blood cells which are our body's defence system, and the platelets which prevent us from bleeding to death when we hurt ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloromycetin lost all its virtues, since its side effects far outweighed any benefit it could provide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second antibiotic I want to talk about also had serious side effects. it was called gentamicin and was prescribed to patients with cystic fibrosis. Everyone has heard of cystic fibrosis. Everyone knows that Celine Dion lost a niece to cystic fibrosis. This wonderful antibiotic had irreversible side effects on the auditory nerve. So, people lived a little longer, but went deaf. These are just two examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues was talking about DDT recently. I remember  seeing cans of this product in my house, in my little village of Vaudreuil. It was fantastic, extraordinary. However, we have since discovered that DDT had  terrible effects on the environment and on people's health. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any bill dealing with health, there is a  very important principle known as the precautionary  principle. We are now using  pesticides for several reasons. In the last 10 to 15 years, the most obvious one for all city dwellers is to have a beautiful lawn. Everybody wants to have a beautiful lawn that looks just like the green carpet here in the House, although it does have a few spots.  A green carpet is quite nice. But a few spots on the lawn will not kill anybody. It is essentially  a question of appearance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it quite ridiculous to  threaten people's health for cosmetic reasons only. This makes no sense at all in terms of what is  really  important  in life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we talk about pesticides in agriculture, we know that we all have to eat and that we all want to eat healthy products  that are not dangerous to our health.  I feel it is  important that the pesticides used to ensure good quality products be as  harmless as possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore need quality products, products that have been carefully evaluated and that are still regularly evaluated, even once they have been recognized as safe enough. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really wonder about what the government is up to with its amendment to  re-examine the entire legislative process, which is  the normal thing to do, but give that role to the Senate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that since our senators are appointed for life, or rather  until they reach 75 years of age, some will probably recall certain pesticides they knew when they were young. They said “Obviously, they are no good”. There may  certainly be an element of truth in this, but I personally do not think that it is a good reason.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time we talk about fundamental issues like public health, I always think that this is a responsibility that belongs to  duly elected parliamentarians.  Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will vigorously oppose the Liberal government's amendment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment  is also quite disquieting.  I do not have to  remind those who are listening today that, for a few weeks now, there has been  a momentum in favour of  transparency all over the country.  I think it goes  against the  required transparency to say that some documents will remain confidential to protect  the competitiveness of businesses. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know very well that competitiveness, if  it is necessary, can  also be the source of extremely serious abuses.  People  can deliberately hide things they know are  tremendously harmful just to continue raking in the profits. We have seen some  recent examples of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was very young, people smoked and it was not dangerous;  it was sort of trendy, fashionable and everybody did it.  Now, as we know, the situation is quite different.  U.S. companies, and maybe even some Canadian companies, have been sued for having caused cancer.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we are not careful about the whole pesticide issue, if we do not invest more in  research to find  natural agents to  control pests and parasites,  one day  we will have to deal with major health problems,  there will be lawsuits and, in the end, the public  will pay for the government's bad decisions.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-53 which is now before us is good legislation.  It is not perfect, but, thank God, I am a Quebecer and happy to be one because  Quebec has, in this area as in many others, legislation which is slightly  ahead of Canadian legislation. Therefore, the    gaps we see in Bill  C-53 will be   filled in a responsible and intelligent manner by the Quebec legislation, which meets the public's expectations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no accident that a small suburban community west of Montreal was the first to ban lawn care products. Mr. Speaker, I do not know if you have ever been to Hudson, but there you will find fine homes on beautifully landscaped lots. In this small community, they have perhaps understood that health is far more important than a manicured lawn and that weeds are not really all that ugly. After all, they are a life form.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Hudson did a service to Quebec and Quebecers and I think this community also helped open the eyes of the rest of Canada since, as my colleague said and everyone knows, the supreme court confirmed that Quebec municipalities were entitled to regulate the use of pesticides within their boundaries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I would like to make the connection with the famous GMOs, genetically modified organisms. There was a lot of talk about these products, but we have not talked about them for some time  now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</b> Are we talking about the Liberals?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</b> No, we are not talking about the Liberals, because if they were genetically modified, it did not work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public is askin for safety and has left this up to the men and women who were elected here. If we are able to work properly with regard to pest control products, I greatly hope that, with regard to GMOs, we be able to stand up  in Quebec and Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the hon. member representing New Brunswick, who is looking at me and is very concerned about health issues, will applaud what I just said. I am watching him.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who have spoken to this issue. I know I do not have much time left, although you will probably give me extra time to finish my speech after oral  question period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years, I was the environment critic for my party. Other colleagues have since acted in that capacity. As we know, the pesticide industry is a very big industry here. Jurisdiction over the industry is shared by the two levels of government, the Government of Quebec and the federal government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the pesticide industry, registration is left entirely to the  federal level. In some regards, I am very happy that this bill has been introduced because the two levels of government will have to find a way to co-operate more closely and in a more harmonious way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, many pesticides are registered on an almost industrial  basis, while there are significant difficulties concerning the use of pesticides all over the country and Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, let us look at the small municipality  where I live, Prévost, which has taken important decisions on pesticides. If you live within a certain distance of a lake, pesticides are absolutely prohibited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, this  is not always easy. I live very close to a lake and I am not allowed to use pesticides on  my lawn. As the member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes, who does not like dandelions, was saying, we are sometimes forced to make do because there are laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An  hon. member:</b> Dandelions are good in salad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Monique Guay:</b> Yes, they ares very good in salad. I will have him taste some. However, we must abide by the law and this forces us to use the lawnmower more often and to treat our lawn differently. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are  increasingly  focusing on the development of environmentally friendly technologies. Those technologies are better for the environment and offer better alternatives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the time I have left before members' statement is running out, I will stop here and continue after oral question period.</p>

I vividly recall the wide eyes, the flushed cheeks, the dusty faces, the skinned knuckles, elbows and knees, the broad smiles and the high fives after a difficult catch or a good hit.  Many had dreams of the big leagues, but as they matured, followed other successful paths in life.  I still see them today, now fathers themselves, some coaching their own children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Loewen is one of the rare few who, through dedication and hard work, have brought that boyhood dream within reach.  We wish him success and look forward to that day when the dream is fully realized, the day he throws his first major league pitch.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court ruled that the House is obliged to ensure that our debates are available in English or French as per every Canadian's choice. I hope the House will accept the wisdom of this decision and proceed to its implementation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say bravo to Mr. Quigley, an exemplary Canadian.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  two choirs, the Petits chanteurs de Laval and the Voix boréales, have once again had a hugely successful season both in Canada and abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After China and Japan, the Petits chanteurs de Laval and the Voix boréales will be in concert throughout the summer, in just about every part of Canada, performing numbers from their 20 years of repertoire.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their performances feature songs in French and in English, but they also have songs in numerous other languages, such as Chinese and Zulu.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fall, these young singers from Laval will perform for New Yorkers in Carnegie Hall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These experiences provide the young people with a great deal of pleasure as well as the opportunity to be part of a group.  These experiences will prepare them to be Canadian citizens who are well prepared to take an active part in the life of our beautiful country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, three years ago I tabled a bill that would protect the rights of professionals and good Samaritans who risk contracting a disease when exposed to someone else's bodily fluids.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isobel Anderson, an Ottawa police officer, was one of the bill's earliest supporters.  At committee meetings, community events and press conferences she told the heart wrenching story of how she was stabbed with a blood filled needle. Yet there was and is no law that compels a suspect to give a blood sample to help determine a course of medical treatment. Her efforts helped push the good Samaritans act to the committee stage twice and onto the agendas of the Attorneys General of Canada and the Uniform Law Conference of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other police officers, Ms. Anderson does more than just enforce the law.  Her colleagues look up to her and she is often a source of advice and comfort for others facing similar nightmares. Her outstanding achievements have been recognized by her peers and she has now been nominated for the Ontario Women in Law Enforcement Award.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish Isobel Anderson the best during the selection process, but more important, we thank her and thousands of other police officers who give of themselves every day to make our lives better.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw attention to an event that occurred last fall with virtually no media attention and no opposition questions here in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That event was the beginning of a new era as far as Canadian search and rescue is concerned.  Last October, the 442 Squadron of Comox, British Columbia, officially accepted the first of a series of helicopters, the Augusta-Westland CH-149 Cormorants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cormorants will provide Canada with one of the best search and rescue capacities in the world.  Their acquisition will greatly enhance the capacities of our armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military experts are unanimous in their praise of the Cormorant, citing its utility in a country where extreme climatic conditions make search and rescue operations  the most difficult in the world.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crews testing the CH-149 were quick to realize its virtues and its great suitability for emergency situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition from the Labrador to the Cormorant will be a gradual process, with the last Labrador phased out in 2003.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First proclaimed ten years ago during the United Nations Earth Summit, the World Oceans Day is seen as a means to educate people about the health of oceans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the riding of Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, the Norjoli school and  les Jardins de Métis have come together to develop a project to highlight the importance of the St. Lawrence River and the oceans. The objective of the project is to raise awareness among youth and the public of the resources found in the river and the oceans and of the need to preserve and protect them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The St. Lawrence River, estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence contain a great diversity of animals and plants. The resources and the majestic lands along its shores   influence the lives of thousands of people and provide for a variety of activities: fishing, swimming, boating, industry and ecotourism.  It is the responsibility of each and everyone of us to preserve their beauty and health.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, next week five farmers will go on trial in Lethbridge, Alberta for exporting their own grain into the United States.  The sad and hypocritical fact is that if they had lived in Ontario or Quebec they would not have broken any laws. On March 4 a <i>National Post</i> editorial titled “Prairie Injustice” pointed out the real problem:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It is unconscionable that farmers may not legally sell the fruits of their labour to whomever they please--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government simply overrides fundamental property rights whenever it suits its agenda and fails to understand the concept of freedom of contract.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is another outrageous example:  Organic farmers in the prairies are forced to sell their grain to the wheat board and buy it back before they can sell it to their customers. This, despite the fact that the board does not even market organic grains.  Bill and Myrita Rees in my riding estimate the cost to them on a 1,000 bushel load of grain is $2,800.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is this government going to start treating prairie farmers just like other Canadian farmers?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand here today to represent the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and  share with the House some of the successes of our province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in Atlantic Canada, with its annual rate of growth outpacing all traditional sectors.  It is estimated that tourism salaries and spending inject some $3.8 billion into the economy of our region each year.  That is why the ACOA agency has made tourism a strategic priority and supports local initiatives such as the root cellar project in the town of Elliston in my riding of Bonavista--Trinity--Conception.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elliston is a small community of approximately 400 people located on the northeastern tip of the Bonavista Peninsula.  Once a busy fishing settlement, it is now a popular tourist destination known as the root cellar capital of the world.  With 135 documented root cellars, some of which have survived nearly two centuries, Elliston is a cultural centre for those who want to understand early Newfoundland subsistence.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion of the cellars has resulted  in national and international recognition. Each summer Tourism Elliston Inc. hosts a four day festival which attracts up to 14,000 visitors--</p>

From 1993 to 1997 that average started to drop once the government got in power until there were 58 sea surveillance missions and 475 air surveillance missions.

	Mr. Speaker,  for two years the Prime Minister's office  knew of the problems with the sponsorship program. As soon as the internal investigation was launched in 2000, the PMO could have put an end to the shenanigans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Prime Minister's close advisers preferred to spend their energy covering up the affair instead of ordering a real administrative reform and dealing with the guilty parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Deputy Prime Minister, who is strangely silent in defence of the Prime Minister today, still say that an independent public inquiry is not necessary, when clearly it is the only way to truly find out what really happened, and more importantly, who was pulling the strings?</p>

However the minister also knew if he did not, the Liberals likely would have voted down his bill, not only costing the bill but likely his cabinet position along the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the minister is willing to table amendments, why will he not table amendments to  have more clarity with the compensation regime?

	Mr. Speaker, the following questions will be answered today: Nos. 152 and 154.</p>


	<p>[<i>Text</i>]</p>


	<center><b>Question No. 152--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the submarine Victoria: (<i>a</i>) when did the Minister of Defence first learn of the structural dent in the submarine; and (<i>b</i>) what structural assessments of the hull of the submarine were undertaken prior to its purchase, and by what firms?</p>


	<b>Hon. John McCallum (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A briefing note on various submarine issues, including the structural dent, came into the possession of the Minister of National Defence between 11-16 April 02.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Canada accepted the Victoria based on Royal Navy standards, as reflected in the UK ministry of defence’s certificate of safety. This certificate included a structural strength assessment and hull surveillance documentation based on inspections and surveys conducted April 1999 to March 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BAE systems, the original manufacturer, conducted the hull examinations when the submarine was docked during reactivation. This was done with UK ministry of defence oversight, as well as Canadian project staff observation and review.
</p>


	<center><b>Question No. 154--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mr. Richard Marceau</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the full decision-making process that led the command at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier to consider closing down entirely downhill skiing at the Castor Centre; and in regard to this: (<i>a</i>) from what budget envelope were the funds for construction and development of the infrastructures at the Castor alpine ski centre originally taken; (<i>b</i>) from what budget envelope were the funds used to operate the Centre (e.g. electricity, heating) taken; (<i>c</i>) how and when was the public, both military and civilian, consulted, and using what sampling; (<i>d</i>) what recommendations were considered to avoid the decision to close; and (<i>e</i>) at what point did the Minister of National Defence endorse the decision?</p>


	<b>Hon. John McCallum (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was recognized in the early 1990s that a problem existed with aging downhill ski equipment at the Castor Centre, and that without significant investment, final closure of the facility would take place within six to eight years. However, there were insufficient non-public funds at Canadian Forces Base, CFB, Valcartier to allow for measures to extend the life of the equipment or to plan for its replacement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the commander of 5 area support group and the personnel support program manager produced a business case on the long term future of downhill skiing at Valcartier. The business case identified two options for the future of the Castor Centre involving either a massive investment of financial resources or closing the centre in the short to medium term.  From a financial standpoint, the most optimistic scenario envisaged the need for a $1.1 million grant from a source outside the Castor Centre and the only outside source was the non-public funds at CFB Valcartier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 the double chairlift was repaired at a cost of roughly $150,000 to correct problems noted during inspections.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, 503 Canadian forces members were surveyed on various personnel support program services and plans for the future. Downhill skiing ranked ninth of the fifteen projects presented, in terms of priority. Upon receipt of the survey results, the executive committee for non-public funds at CFB Valcartier, composed of officers and senior non-commissioned officers, requested an analysis of the options.  This analysis was carried out by the construction engineering officer, the personnel support program manager and a senior officer of the ranges and training areas.  Several possible replacement options were analyzed and the committee’s ultimate recommendation largely correlated with the conclusions of the 1998 business case. Another option, managed downsizing, was also analyzed, however the committee concluded that further extending the downhill ski operation would cost the base non-public fund roughly $80,000 a year and that the situation would probably have to be reassessed on an annual basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis prepared in 2000 was submitted to the executive committee for consideration in 2001. The executive committee decided that funds should not be invested to replace the mechanical lift.  The committee also decided that it was not prepared to spend $50,000 to $80,000 a year to retain downhill skiing. This decision was supported by the Conseil d’orientation des fonds non-publics Valcartier, Valcartier non-public fund advisory board. This decision meant that downhill skiing would cease almost immediately, since the existing lift cable had failed to meet industry safety standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The co-chairs of the Conseil d’orientation, that is the commander of 5 area support group and the commander of 5 corps mechanized brigade group, were aware of the impact this decision would have on the community and referred the decision to the Commander Land Force Quebec Area before making the closure official.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commander Land Force Quebec Area supported the local decision to close the facility, but at the same time decided to extend the operation for one more year to allow alternative solutions to be developed and to mitigate the impact on the community. Implicit in this decision was the need to purchase a new lift cable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community was informed of the decision in late 2001 and the various alternative solutions were outlined in the local newspaper.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Non-public funds were originally used for the construction and development of the infrastructures at the Castor alpine ski centre.  Non-public funds are a type of crown controlled funds established pursuant to sections 38 to 41 of the National Defence Act and to which the provisions of the Financial Administration Act do not apply.  These funds are non-appropriated crown moneys that are separate and distinct from appropriated funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The electricity and heating are paid for by the Castor Centre.  The Castor Centre is a non-public agency of CFB Valcartier.  With respect to the downhill ski operation, the necessary funding was obtained through fees charged to the customers. These revenues, however, were insufficient to effect repairs or to make major investments in the facility. The major repairs of recent years had to be subsidized by the Valcartier fund. These non-public funds were procured through other non-public activities, such as the Canex stores and the Sport Loisirs plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In 2000, 503 Canadian forces members were surveyed on various personnel support program services and plans for the future.  Downhill skiing ranked ninth of the fifteen projects presented, in terms of priority.  In addition, the executive committee for non-public funds at CFB Valcartier consulted the members of their respective units regarding their needs to gain a clear insight into the views of the group they represented and to make informed decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Two options were entertained: either the replacement of the mechanical lift, which would have generated deficit of roughly $80,000 per year, or an average annual investment of $50,000 to $80,000 to prolong the life of the existing equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The decision did not require the approval of the Minister of National Defence.

	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me these eight minutes to address the issue of pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, this issue is very important to us. I am very pleased that we are revisiting the legislation through Bill C-53. It gives us the opportunity to better protect not only our environment but also, as I mentioned, the health of our children and pets, because pesticides are often used on lawns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this issue affects several jurisdictions, we need to find a way to work in co-operation with the various levels of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I mentioned Hudson, the first municipality to make an important environmental decision to ban the use of pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned that, in a riding like mine, if there is one priority that municipalities must have, it is to protect lake waters. It goes without saying that lakeside residents, those who live around lakes, love to have a beautiful lawn. They often use pesticides that can be extremely dangerous, not only for the water in our lakes, but also for the health of bathers and fishers who eat the fish that lives in these lakes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we pollute the environment with pesticides, we also pollute lakes,  fish and ourselves, because we eat the fish. We must take this into consideration. We must  have bylaws that protect the land around lakes. This is the case in several municipalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the good fortune of living on the shores of a lake where the municipality  passed a bylaw banning the use of chemicals, not just pesticides, but also fertilizers, so as to protect the quality of our lake water. Very stiff fines are levied if people do not comply. This is one way to ensure that regulations and bylaws are well respected. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was worrisome to see how the registration of pesticides was done here on the Hill by the agency responsible. An incredible number of pesticides have been registered in recent years. In this regard, we must be careful, because when a pesticide is registered, its impact is not always measurable in the short term, but often only in the mid term or the long term, with the result that we often realize after the fact that a product that was registered is in fact very harmful to health, or even to the environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we must be very careful when registering products. I think we should also invest in research to find products that will be  less harmful to the environment and to health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know people who work in this area and they are increasingly looking at natural sources, at environmentally friendly products. Let me give an example. Some environmentally friendly products are now sold on the market to treat plants and rose bushes. These products are much less harmful to health. I have personally used them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can go to a garden centre and ask for these ecological products. Unless we do, nothing will happen. I think that there will have to be a new vision in the future with respect to pest control products. We have relied on them too much and now we must think of our children's future and go back to much more ecological products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example. Just a few short years ago, in regions such as mine, I remember that it was very popular for golf courses to have absolutely perfect greens, and that is understandable. In fact, at one point, this was all the rage in the Laurentides, where people went for lawn care packages involving four or five treatments with just as many pesticides as fertilizers.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall vividly how, when these companies came to treat your lawn, they left little signs with the following warning “Keep  pets and children off the grass for the next 24 hours”. If they leave a warning like this and instruct people not to use the lawn, there is some sort of risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself remember that my children had rashes after the lawn was treated, because the products used were very strong and could cause nausea or even rashes. One cannot keep children from playing on the lawn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention all of this to make the point that it is high time that this legislation be reviewed. However, we said that we agreed with the bill, but that we would not support the amendments. Those listening already know why. My colleagues have spoken at length about this and I do not think that it is up to the Senate to make decisions. It is the job of those who have been legitimately elected to this chamber to make decisions, and to do so in consultation with the public. We are here to represent the public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also take into consideration the fact that the production of pesticides is a big industry. There will be a lot of lobbying. We will have to stand fast and stand together to make sure this lobbying will not have an impact on our decisions on health and environmental issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short while ago, Quebec was mentioned. Personally, I would really like us to work together and harmonize all regulations. Quebec has made regulations and passed laws in this area. There are also regulations or laws at the federal level and bylaws in many municipalities. I hope that municipalities in the regions, which have lakes, rivers and other important environmental assets, will eventually have similar regulations to really protect our environment in a consistent manner. We will have to work in harmony.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see more and more products on which the public wants information. Somebody talked about GMOs earlier. People want to know what they are eating. More and more, they want to know about the mid term and long term impact of the products they buy. With a review of the legislation and Bill C-53, we will be able to deal with this  in a practical manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government members can count on our support for this bill, but we will vote against the amendments.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-276335"></A><a HREF="#Int-276353"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-276316"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part  in this debate as the member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, but most of all as a citizen concerned with the future. I am 55 years old, but there are also younger people than us, and also our children who are the future of our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about hazardous products and while  the risk of using them is not always scientifically proven, I think we have an obligation to use products which we know for sure are not dangerous. In a way, this is the principle we should use for the consideration  of  this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, I replaced my colleague from Jonquière at a meeting  of the Standing Committee on the  Environment during which we reviewed the committee's report on this matter. The evidence we heard and the documents  tabled on the risks of those products convinced me of the necessity to have more stringent legislation on pesticides. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, supporters or participants of the Liberal Party tell us “Members of the Bloc Quebecois are always against everything”. Amazingly, we are against things which are not right. In this case, we support the bill although we are against the amendments suggested. So, we can agree. We are not against everything as a matter of principle. First, we look at a bill and we assess its importance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one believe that there are always two  or three criteria. I admire my colleague from Hochelaga--Maisonneuve who, during the little   time he has left in a week, studies law. The most remarkable thing in his case is that he often shares his knowledge. He truly does it by solidarity, and I say this because it is very nice to work as a team with people who have the desire to share.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, speaking about sharing and solidarity, if we believe in sustainable development, we have to be very vigilant and very cautious about products which can pose  a health hazard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a subject that concerns the current Bloc Quebecois environment critic, the member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, as well as my colleague, the health critic. We must rise above party politics on this issue. It is extremely important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from an agricultural region, and my father was a farmer. I worked with the former minister of agriculture in Quebec, Jean Garon—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard:</b> He is the mayor now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</b> —now mayor of the new city of Lévis—whom  I would like to greet in passing—which makes up 95% of my riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the agricultural sector is said to have reservations about this, because they need pesticides, and I believe the bill allows for this. It is not about getting rid of, or restricting them altogether. Once again, caution must serve as our guide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of new cities, my area is now an urban area, with the exception of the municipality of Saint-Henri. In urban areas, is it really necessary, in terms of aesthetics, to use so many pesticides on lawns?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was in charge of parks and recreation in Saint-Nicolas, there was a contest for cities and towns in bloom.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, in fact, support ornamental horticulture. I support beautifying cities, but at the same time, one has to weigh  beautiful lawns against the health of children and the public. I may be a golfer, but I do not believe we should sacrifice our health for beautifully green golf courses. Some may criticize me, saying that I am forgetting certain allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this issue seriously. As  legislators, when an important issue is raised, we must rise above purely electoral considerations. Yes, we must consider opposite views, but we must also return to real values and principles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, two very important values frame this bill. First, there is the environment and why we want it to be healthy. This is first and foremost for the health and survival of planet Earth.  Yes, we are talking about lawn pesticides. I do not remember who wrote this, but there is a saying. Think globally, act locally. We have to make our contribution to the environment. Every action, however small it may be, is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an urban setting, there is an analogy to the situation with the recycling of paper, plastics and other materials.  This is very important.  During the Montreal municipal election campaign, some candidates got in trouble for not complying with the recycling bylaws.  This is kind of the same situation.  Everyone must make an effort.  If we recycle,and if we are careful about pesticides, we are contributing to a better environment and a sustainable environment.  We are helping to leave a clean environment for  future generations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as health is concerned, we know how costly this is to society.  I do not want to get into unsubstantiated claims, but it is a cause of considerable concern that so many people have cancer or other serious conditions.  I am not saying that there is a link with pesticides, but neither has it been proven that certain pesticides do not play a role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> It is in the food chain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</b> As my colleague says, it is in the food chain. At a certain point it is not just a matter of breathing in pesticide residue, it can go as far as to involve the foods we eat.  Our health can be affected by what we eat.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to congratulate my colleague from Rosemont—Petite-Patrie for his work on the environment, as well as the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  They informed us in caucus and raised our awareness of the issue.  I would not go so far as to say that they harassed us, but they were pretty tenacious.  They explained that it was worthwhile supporting this government bill. Of all the provinces in Canada, I think Quebec has the best legislation in this area.  Quebec's municipalities are very concerned about this aspect.  When it comes to federal legislation, in this case, the shared responsibility must be recognized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objection to voting in favour of this bill because, even if it is not perfect, our colleagues will try to improve it.  The values involved, that is health, the environment and sustainable development, are important to the Bloc Quebecois.  We have therefore decided to vote in favour of this bill. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Madam Speaker, first, I thank my colleague from Laurentides for her support in bringing forward this motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I am very pleased to rise today to debate the important issue of defending the deaf and hearing impaired. This is a problem that has been dear to my heart  for many years and that I have raised several times here in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of motion before the House is to implement various measures to correct a very complex situation  that directly affect the daily lives of millions of people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, more than 3 million people, including 750,000 in Quebec, have a hearing problem. Hearing impairment is the handicap that is suffered by the greatest number of people and the worst thing is that this handicap is invisible.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person in ten now suffers from this problem. In the face of alarming figures like these, we cannot remain indifferent. And as the population continues to age, matters will only grow worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ever, we must address this phenomenon and take tangible action. Last week, as part of  Hearing Month, I organized a press conference to draw attention to  the magnitude of the problem. I had the pleasure of sharing the podium with Richard McNicoll, general manager of the Regroupement québécois pour le sous-titrage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization, which is devoted to the defence of closed-captioning, is doing a remarkable job. Mr. McNicoll and his team are extensively involved in efforts to move things forward. It is now up to the federal government to get involved as well and to ensure that tangible progress is made for the deaf and hearing impaired.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has certainly had plenty of opportunities. In the past, we suggested a number of possible solutions. Despite two motions passed unanimously in the House,  these motions have not resulted in any legislation or action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House will recall, in May 1999, parliamentarians ruled unanimously in favour of a motion recognizing the importance for the public and private sectors to provide deaf and hard-of-hearing persons with the tools required for them to take their place in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 30, 2001, parliamentarians again gave their unanimous consent for a motion which I introduced through the adoption of the Report on the Broadcasting and Availability of the Debates and Proceedings of Parliament in Both Official Languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report recommended closed-captioning in French of oral question period in the House of Commons, as is already done in English. A year will soon have passed and there is still no closed-captioning in French. Yet there are 750,000 Quebecers, most of them francophones, who are not entitled to the same service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is completely inconceivable that in a country which claims to respect its two official languages, and worse still, in parliament, that  it is taking so long to get closed-captioning in French.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the magnitude of the problem. It also shows that, despite the unanimity of parliamentarians, the federal government has still done nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is certainly no lack of suggestions. This is the purpose of my motion, which calls on the government to take all measures necessary to encourage, facilitate and actively support the right to communications of the deaf and hearing impaired. One such measure is closed-captioning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, I urge the federal government to draft a bill to amend the Broadcasting Act to oblige all broadcasters to carry visual programs with closed-captioning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it necessary to repeat that television plays a major role in the lives of a great many people who are deaf or hearing impaired?  For some of them, it is the only means of communication; not everyone can afford a computer and access to Internet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depriving these people of this  source of information and entertainment  can isolate them, and I am not even talking about the safety aspect of the issue.  Since they cannot listen to the radio,  television remains their only source of real time information. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only a few examples showing the complex differences between someone who can hear and someone who cannot.  I remain optimistic in spite of everything.   My goal is to obtain full 100% closed captioning  of all  television broadcasts, both in French and in English, for the deaf and the hearing impaired.</p>


	<A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem with French programming.  The CRTC requires that English television channels provide closed captioning for their programs but does not impose the same requirement on French television. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the French speaking deaf and hearing impaired  have access to a mere 40% of the SRC programs whereas the English speaking public in the same situation has access to 90% to 100% of the programs being shown on TV.  This is the type of justice and equity we get from the federal government.  Those are highly troubling statistics. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a country which claims to respect both official languages, it is unthinkable that  French closed captioning should be so far behind closed captioning for English programs.  In my opinion, some  legislation is required; we need measures to solve once and for all that complex problem of  access to communications for these three million individuals  and 750,000 in Quebec.   The federal government can easily and quickly enact  legislation to solve that problem.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is only a start. It is only one way to truly promote the integration of the  deaf and the hearing impaired in our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to beyond that, and another important element of my motion refers to the promotion of  research and development of technologies relating to closed captioning, particularly through a real   funding program. This would help  make technology more available and affordable. For example, the Centre de la recherche informatique de Montréal has launched a research program on speech recognition. This project will allow live closed captioning. The Quebec government has offered financial assistance, but to this date, the federal government has not shown any interest in supporting this research project. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as though the government did not have the means to do so. This would really not be much compared to the huge surpluses in the federal budgets year after year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I call upon my colleagues to support my motion so that we can send  the government a clear and unequivocal message that the will expressed by parliamentarians has to be translated into government policies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In supporting this motion, I ask the federal government to be consistent and to turn commitments into action.  The government can do something, and more than three million people are counting on it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight will not be over until these three million Canadians  have access to policies ensuring their complete integration into our society. But more than anything else, the fight will not be over until the federal government understands that closed captioning is not a privilege but rather a right, and that it allows the deaf and the hearing impaired   to read what others hear. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is urgent. The will is one thing, but without action, we are going nowhere. I therefore call upon my colleagues to support this motion. </p>

	Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my support of the motion. I wish to commend my colleague for introducing it.  I also wish to commend the Parliament Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage who  worked  diligently on  encouraging as many of her colleagues to support this  important initiative. The parliamentary secretary has asked me whether or not I would support the motion.  She encouraged me to do so, and I am willing to support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion would support the right to communications of the deaf and hearing impaired and set up a fund to research and develop the technologies required to assist in this endeavour. The government  is already committed to ensure that all Canadians have access to our broadcasting system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television has become an integral part of our lives and one of the primary sources of information for all Canadians.   Can members imagine seeing an important event on television but not being able to hear what was being said or reported, or hearing the newscast or program but not seeing the visual images? This was the world for many hearing and visually impaired Canadians until the discovery of closed captioning and voice print.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is closed captioning  and how does it work?. Closed captioning translates the audio portion of a television program into subtitles, also known as captions. These captions usually appear at the bottom of the television screen and generally scroll in unison with the program being viewed. To view closed captioning the viewer requires a caption decoder chip in the television set or a separate decoder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the National Broadcasting Reading Service and La Magnétothèque.  They are providers of services for the visually impaired, also known as voice print. Voice print is provided by the National Broadcasting Reading Service  and La Magnétothèque via a  newspaper reading service 24 hours a day, along with other programming to assist persons who are blind, visually impaired or print handicapped. Generally voice print is delivered over a secondary audio programming service, SAP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we ensure the growth of these important services? We do so as we implement a variety of tools to ensure that our hearing and visually impaired citizens have access to our diverse stories. It only makes sense that as the dependence on television increases so should our resolve to provide the hearing and visually impaired with access based services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of this resolve is included in subsection 3(1)(p) of the Broadcasting Act which states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>programming accessible by disabled persons should be provided within the Canadian broadcasting system as resources become available for the purpose;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end the Government of Canada has undertaken many initiatives to ensure that this service continues to grow in both official languages. Currently closed captioning is a mandatory  requirement to obtain funding from the Canadian television fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CRTC, the body which regulates our broadcast airwaves, makes it a requirement to provide these services and has set out  clear goals that Canadian broadcasters are expected to meet. For example, major broadcasters such as CBC, CTV and Global must caption at least 90% of all programming during the broadcast day as well as local news, including live segments.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium size broadcasters and smaller stations are encouraged to meet the same standard while specialty services must also work toward that 90% goal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenges for captioning in French include a small market base and the fact that captioning technology was initially developed for the English language market.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples of resolve  include the simplification of the Canadian film or video tax credit as announced in the February 2000 budget.   The Department of Canadian Heritage now requires that all certified productions be closed captioned for the hearing impaired.  This is an especially important point because now  even more  Canadian stories that are set to film are shared with even more Canadians, thanks to services like closed captioning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note as well that even with these positive measures in place, we face challenges that call for even more resolve.  For instance, closed captioning in French is within a small  market base that was originally designed to facilitate an English language market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that television has become an essential tool in the debate and exchange of free ideas.  These ideas are the very same ones that help sustain and grow a democratic society such as ours without exclusion.  All Canadians, including those who are hearing and visually impaired, deserve to be joined in debate and exchange ideas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the initiative to commence with discussions on the important issue of closed captioning. I suggest to everyone that they make their concerns known to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage in the course of its review of the Canadian broadcasting system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude by congratulating the minister and her very  able parliamentary secretary who have brought this issue to our attention, as well as the member of parliament who proposed the motion.  It is my hope the motion will be adopted unanimously  by  members of  parliament.</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased  to address the issue in the House for a number of reasons.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that  every member in the House as a member of society comes across people who are hearing impaired.  I remember one of my first personal experiences was with a friend who had grown to adulthood with a deaf parent.  I was quite intrigued as I observed him using the American sign language as a communication tool.  In his family that was the norm.  He and his siblings all used sign language to communicate with their father .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject today is not about American sign language, it is  about closed captioning on television. However   it does bear considering the needs and the concerns of the deaf and being sensitive to those who are hearing impaired in our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have been very impressed with the American sign language. If I may be allowed, I will   go on for a moment about that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing impaired  are able to communicate very well using sign language. On a ferry trip from Nanaimo to Vancouver  I remember seeing a group of people who turned out to be constituents communicating using sign language.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite keen to have someone do signing at  our town hall meetings.  We explored that  possibility but were not successful in arranging it.  We are still working on it.  If there are people out there in my riding who have the skills to do that, I am looking for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication is  a privilege that we enjoy as human beings.  We like to think we are intelligent human beings, but even that can be the subject of debate in the House. It is  a privilege to be able to paint a picture with words, to be able to discuss a subject such as the one we are debating  today that  does not involve   those of us here who are not hearing impaired but we are able to identify with, that takes us into the lives,  the hearts and the minds of people who have a disability that we do not have. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if we do not take our communication skills for granted sometimes.  What a tremendous advantage it is for us to be able to communicate  intimate thoughts, our thoughts about beauty and  the wonderful world we see around us, to be able to describe what we see  when travelling along the coast, a tide pool,   a sunset or a wave breaking on the shore.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication is such a wonderful tool.  It is such a wonderful opportunity that we have to express ourselves and to receive fulfillment in this world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue the motion  addresses is about access to information. It is about opportunity to engage in society and  understand what is going on in the world. It is about inclusion. It is about personal development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few facts were presented by the hon. member for Longueuil and we appreciate that.  She mentioned there are about three million people in Canada who are hearing impaired.  I have some statistics that include the United States. Approximately 28 million people in the U.S. have some degree of reduced hearing sensitivity. That puts us at about the 10:1 ratio, which seems to be standard in so many issues between Canada and the United States relative to our populations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over one million children in the U.S. have a hearing loss.  One in 1,000 infants born in the U.S. has a severe or profound hearing loss.   In the first instance we are talking about  the one in 1,000 infants born with a severe or profound hearing loss, but by the time they are school age children, a severe or profound hearing loss occurs in about nine children out of every 1,000.</p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the information I was able to glean in trying to enter the world of the deaf and understand it a little better was information I  received from Deaf and Mental Health Services in British Columbia.  It did a survey recently. It gathered information by reviewing relevant literature on previous reports.  It consulted with a community advisory committee and interviewed over 160 community members, family members and service providers individually and in small groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics showed that of the target population of British Columbia, 8,000 children and adults from all ethnic and family backgrounds  are deaf. I will quote a paragraph from its conclusions:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Although all Deaf people face tremendous communication barriers in a world designed for people who hear, this small population is very diverse in terms of pattern of deafness,  communication preferences,  signing skills,  speaking skills, educational experiences, literacy, and  abilities.  About two-thirds of the Deaf population (about 5,000 BC residents) communicate primarily through American Sign Language (ASL) and are more or less oriented toward...the Deaf community.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recognize that it is not just the deaf person that is involved.  Family members are also influenced.  There are probably four people in an average household who are affected along with the deaf person.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just one more set of statistics to offer.  About 90% of deaf children  are born to parents who can hear and about 90% of children born to deaf parents can hear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another segment of society that is very much influenced by this and it is those  who suffer from adult onset hearing impairment.  In my riding there are many people with  this. There is a huge retirement community on Vancouver Island.  Also affected are many of our  World War II veterans, Korean war veterans, many of our mill workers who have been exposed to industrial noise, our bush workers, forestry workers and operators of heavy duty equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke with one audiologist in my riding. I was interested to find out  that it takes between 80 decibels and 90 decibels for  eight hours  to create a hearing loss.  I was surprised that something as innocuous as a hair blow dryer produces 90 decibels.  We have to wonder about  other noises we are exposed to in society.  Perhaps we should consider having a debate on noise pollution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the young people that I see driving down the street with  boom boxes blaring in their cars that rattle not only their own vehicles but those across the street and perhaps even people in buildings across the street.  I remember being in my office in Parksville, a small community on Vancouver Island, and actually feeling the building tremble.  I went out to see what  was causing it.  It was a  boom box in a young person's car out in the back lane.  The noise was actually shaking the building.  My receptionist and I were quite surprised to feel the impact of that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the noise level from a boom box is about 140 decibels. At 140 decibels, that puts it right up there with what we might experience if we were standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier or if we were  within 25 metres of a jet taking off, which is about 150 decibels.  At those levels a person's eardrums can actually rupture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious  issue that the member has raised.  The issue  is very important to members of our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across some information from the Canadian Hard of Hearing Association.  It did a study in June 1999. It identified three main issues associated with closed captioning on television:   accessibility;    quality of   programming available to the hearing impaired; and awareness.  Regarding quality, there are still some technical difficulties with closed captioning.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  As far as  awareness issues, one-third of the Canadian general public cannot describe what closed captioning is and therefore are unaware of the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing,  any day that we learn something new is a good day.  I appreciate that the member has brought this motion forward  to raise the awareness of the issues relating to the deaf.  The member's motion  is about learning and opportunities to learn.  It is about inclusion. It is about development.  It is about helping  people achieve satisfaction in life. It is about   relieving a sense of isolation.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may be allowed, just in a nutshell,  there is another metaphor that I personally have found  very fulfilling. It has to do with learning. Being an islander, I  relate to this: “The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about sharing knowledge and communicating knowledge.  It is about helping a segment of our population enter fully with the rest of us into this marvellous experience in life of learning and growing together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to support the motion.  I encourage all other members of the House to raise awareness of the deaf and the hearing impaired in our society.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I too am extremely pleased to join in this debate today.  I want to acknowledge my colleague from the Bloc who over the last number of years on a regular basis has tried to remind us of some of the difficulties  some people face in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still recall the very first time that she took the time to sign in the House. Quite frankly,  I was totally amazed that she had any type of disability whatsoever.  It was not until that very day that I realized she did.  She obviously has worked really hard to overcome her difficulties and she has been instrumental in having a good number of us recognize  disabled people in Canada. I have  a hard time  even recognizing my colleague under the terminology disabled, because she certainly does not seem to have any greater problem in getting her message out  than any of the rest of us, her message being to make us aware that there still are issues out there.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As technology has developed over the years there are those of us  who have a tendency to think there are no problems  for disabled people any more. There are organizations that represent the blind.  There are organizations that represent other disabled people, whether they have ambulatory disabilities or otherwise.  There are organizations that represent the deaf.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend to think that everything is  looked after.  There is tremendous technology in this day and age. We  can send people to the moon. We can  transmit from one community to another what a human body looks like  so that a doctor can see it and decide what type of treatment should be proceeded with.  Medical operations can be performed with robotics and tiny little instruments.  Tremendous things are happening in the world of technology, so it is hard for some of us, unless we are affected, to realize that everybody does not have the same opportunities.  It is hard for us to understand that not every program has closed captioning.  If we do not need closed captioning, we just do not realize the need for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that until the motion came up  I did not realize all the specific things that are available to assist people, but I also did not recognize that they were not available to everyone. I did not realize that it was not something that was already happening, whereby every program would have closed captioning.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good time for the member's motion to come forward.  My colleague from Dartmouth has been our representative on the disabilities committee and also on the heritage committee of the House.   She has tried on an ongoing basis to keep us abreast of different things that are happening. She has made it very clear  that the heritage committee has been dealing with  a lot of issues on the Broadcasting Act. She feels that this is an extremely timely moment for the motion to be coming forward, because the committee is making recommendations for changes within the Broadcasting Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great to hear today from my colleagues on the government side that the government is open to addressing these concerns. I hope they are not just  voicing their concerns and recognition but are going to make  an honest to goodness effort to address the issue and ensure  that recommendations and some legislation are put in place  requiring broadcasters to bring forth closed captioning in all programming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Dartmouth also indicated that  one of the thoughts out there for broadcasting companies  is that they may not be open to legislation ensuring  closed captioning.   Right now  they sell the service of closed captioning to advertisers so they  are able to make some money from it.  That is not to say that it is not wonderful to make money. We recognize that  things need to be sold and  that people  want to buy them. There are business opportunities and there are entrepreneurs, but there are entrepreneurs and then there are those who want to make a profit from others' hardship and at their expense.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly,   it is important that we not only do research,   promote technology and    make legislation for profit but that we  make it because it will be  beneficial  for society and for individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial that the government, with the support of all parliamentarians and in recognizing  that   we represent Canadians who  would support this as well,   is given the dollars   needed to promote   technology and   research in the area of providing more broad scoped closed captioning and other specific improvements that would benefit those less fortunate.   It should not just  be done on the basis that someone will not   be able to make a dollar.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been serving on the industry committee and I have a bit of a hard time because I, quite frankly,   think there are some things that people   should not make a profit from.  It is a matter of doing something because it is the right thing to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder where we would have been in our society if Banting and Best had only been doing  research   to make a profit.  Would they have    really  gone forward?  I think they did their research  with the intention    of improving the lives of people in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not recall his name, but about    a month or so ago I read about the fellow who first brought about canola production and the changes to the plant that we now know as canola.  He did so without making a single penny.  That was an issue of principle on his part.  He was improving this crop to benefit people, not to make a buck. He has much higher regard in my books than a company that would go out  and make a crop   from which we could not grow   from its seed.   They could restrict who bought  it and who could  produce it so   they could make a profit. I do not see this as beneficial to society.  I do not see that as where the government should be going.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reflect again on the issue of investing  in research and technology.  It is important that the government look at   investing in those areas but not solely on the issue that if we invest in those area we will     make a profit.  The  profit  we make will not just be   in dollars.  It will be in the fact that we will be    providing   people who are less fortunate with the opportunity to   broader knowledge education and   to become equal partners in all aspects of society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate    my colleague from the Bloc for bringing forward this  very good motion.  I certainly hope she gets the support of not only the majority of the House but all the House.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed captioning involves printing on the screen, in sub-title format, the oral part of a television program, that is the dialogues and the narrative. This allows hearing impaired viewers to read what they cannot hear. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To access closed captioning, they have to decode a broadcasting  signal known as “line 21”. To that end, the television receiver has to be equipped with an integrated closed captioning decoder for the hearing impaired or  be upgraded by the installation of an external decoder. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is important to specify that parliament has made  the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission the independent public authority responsible for regulating and monitoring the Canadian broadcasting system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CRTC has already issued specific requirements for closed captioning because it is convinced, just like you and me, that television has a fundamental role to play in the public debates and the free circulation of ideas that enrich a democratic society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Broadcasting Act, and I quote:</p>


	<p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is important to remind the House that because of the higher cost to closed caption French language programming, private sector French language broadcasters do not provide the same level of closed captioned programs as English broadcasters. Even though they do not have the same requirements as English language television stations, they have always been encouraged to increase the number of hours of closed captioned programming that their station airs per year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to explain the reasons behind the difference between English and French broadcasters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike their English counterparts, French broadcasters cannot purchase foreign programs that have already been closed captioned, because the closed captioning technology used in many French speaking countries is incompatible with the technology used in Canada. Furthermore, the cost of closed captioning in French is approximately 2.5 times greater than the cost of closed captioning in English.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, given the small size of the French market, the limited use of the service generates very few sponsors, and as a result, a weak return on investment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to many broadcasting specialists, these numerous obstacles mean that this type of service, despite its benefits for the hard of hearing, does little to benefit the competitiveness of French broadcasters.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw attention to the fact that the member for Longueuil, in the press release she issued on the day the motion was brought forward, said, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--French networks, which are not required by the CRTC to meet the same closed captioning criteria as English networks--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its 1999 television policy, the CRTC recognizes explicitly that the closed captioning requirements should be the same for both French and English broadcasters and is now applying this principle when renewing licences for French broadcasters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, the CRTC expects French broadcasters  to gradually reach closed captioning levels similar to those of English broadcasters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing its overall strategy with regard to closed captioning, the CRTC considered the fact that all licensees do not have the same financial resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the requirements that may be just fine for a large station in an urban market could be a heavy financial burden for a station in a smaller market.  So equality with regard to closed captioning will come gradually, slowly but surely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, since 2001, the largest French private television network, TVA, knows that it will have to raise its closed captioning levels to 100% for its news programming by September 2004 and to 90% for all its programming by 2007.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the requirements of the Canadian Television Fund, closed captioning is compulsory for a production that includes narration, dialogues and songs, unless the program is intended for children under five, or is in an aboriginal language that does not use the roman alphabet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is committed to social inclusion and  access for all Canadians to a broadcasting system that meets their needs. The principles underlying Motion No. 367 are unquestionably very laudable, but they do not, in the opinion of this government, require additional legislation or an amendment to the existing act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would invite the hon. member for Longueuil to inform the members of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage of this important issue. It would be very appropriate for the author of Motion No. 367, to make representations and present her arguments to this committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate the hon. member for Longueuil. I get the impression that a number of members of parliament have family members who are hard of hearing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, many people know that, in his last years as governor general, my father had a lot of problems hearing from his right ear. When I go home, to New Brunswick, and  my father is there, the volume of the television set is turned quite high.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, like many of us, that Canadians who live with these difficulties and handicaps must have access to television and be able to learn from,  to hear and to enjoy a society that they are also a part of.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate in support of Motion No. 367 brought forward by the hon. member for Longueuil.  I commend her for  raising  public awareness of those individuals with disabilities,  particularly people with disabilities related to hearing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity last week to participate in a forum during disability week in my own province of New Brunswick.  I was escorted around in a wheelchair throughout the upper Saint John region.  We are  aware of the necessity to ensure that we have the appropriate accesses to rooms and elevators for those individuals who are physically challenged.  We think we have made great inroads in our society, and the truth is  we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there is  an awful lot that we must do.  Any motion that we have before the House helps raise the awareness that there are initiatives the Government of Canada must take and that we as a society must take to ensure that those persons with disabilities have the right to participate in our society to their fullest capacity because they want to as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion we are debating states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should: (a) take all measures necessary to encourage, facilitate and actively support the right to communications of the deaf and hearing impaired; (b) act without delay to set up a real program to fund the research and development of technologies relating to closed captioning; (c) draft a bill to amend the Broadcasting Act to oblige all broadcasters to carry visual programs with closed captioning.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Statistics Canada hearing loss and deafness affects millions of Canadians with 2.9 million Canadians experiencing some form of hearing loss.  That is one in ten.  The statistics are probably on the low side since most of the research and statistics gathering rely on self-identification and inconsistent use of terms and definitions.  It is common for people to deny their hearing loss, as we might understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Hearing Society along with other groups supports the motion and so does the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.  The reality is that deaf, deafened and hard of hearing Canadians continue to experience violations of basic human rights without regard to public broadcasting. Let us be clear.  The need for and right to communications and language is fundamental to the human condition.  Without communication an individual cannot become an effective and productive adult or an informed citizen in our democratic process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have proven conclusively and repeatedly that captioning assists both children and adults in learning literacy skills and in developing second-language skills.  In 1987 the Canadian Association of the Deaf estimated that one-third of the populace could benefit directly from captioning. Considering this, one might  assume that captioning is presently being provided by all television broadcasting as a matter of course, a matter of self-interest by broadcasters or a matter of regulatory requirements by the CRTC.  This is simply not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2000 the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the CBC had indeed discriminated on the basis of disability or deafness and ordered the CBC to caption everything it broadcasts on the first reasonable occasion. The CBC has chosen to challenge the decision.  It will likely argue that the Canadian Human Rights Commission has no jurisdiction in the matter because the CRTC is legally mandated to rule on broadcasting.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have our cake and eat it too.  The industry cannot be exempt from the Canadian Human Rights Act and have the CRTC stripped of the power to regulate and require captioning. However it is important to note that the CBC and CTV are the best achievers among  Canadian broadcasters as far as captioning is concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology is not only capable of supplying the demand but it is already in the hands of the broadcasters.  Even community cable channels have access to the equipment itself. It is important to point out that the Liberal government itself has agreed that closed captioning is of vital importance.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 30, 2001, parliamentarians gave their unanimous consent to a motion to adopt the report on the broadcasting and the availability of the debates and proceedings of parliament in both official languages. This report recommended, among other measures, the closed captioning in French of oral question period in the House, as is already being done in English. However, the government, as per usual, did not take any action.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is another chapter in the book called the Liberal government that does nothing and it is  Canadians that pay. In this case there are individuals who have hearing losses or deafness and do not have the opportunity to participate to the degree that they should.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to all members of the House that this is a mere motion.    It is not a bill.  It is not an actual piece of legislation.  When the House approves a motion, Madam Speaker, and you are  well aware of this particular aspect, it is expressing the will of the House to move in a direction to meet the intent of the motion.  It may not be exactly as the member has worded it in the motion itself but the principles are followed through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canadians are concerned, not just in principle but in reality, and if members of parliament are  concerned beyond supporting the principle of the motion but not liking one comma that is in the sentence, then I ask all members of the House, regardless of what party stripe they yield from, to support Motion No. 367.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend the member for Longueuil for her ongoing commitment to this most worthy cause.  I ask all members to support the motion.  The best way to do that is to put it to a vote.  We can end the debate right here and now.  Let us not filibuster  this issue.  There is no need to do that.  I suspect that we  have the support of the mover of Motion No. 367.  If all members  are  concerned about this particular issue I would ask them to stay in their seats.  Let us end the debate now and put it to a vote.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-276416"></A><a HREF="#Int-276420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-276412"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Longueuil urges the government to take all measures necessary to encourage, facilitate and actively support the right to communication for the deaf and hearing impaired.  I am  pleased  to speak to the importance of closed captioning for hundreds of thousands of Canadians and to inform the House of some of the steps being taken to meet their needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may interest members to learn that while service to the hearing impaired community was the impetus for closed captioning, it is not the only community that benefits from the service.  Educators have discovered that captioning can help children learn to read by assisting them in word recognition and comprehension.  In addition, for the nearly five million Canadians who are functionally illiterate the service is a valuable tool in helping them learn to read. For many new Canadians for whom neither English nor French is their native tongue,    closed captioning is an exceptionally useful tool in learning the idioms of  the language as well as pop culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a tribute to previous members of the House that subsection 3(1) of the Broadcasting Act sets out that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(p) programming  accessible by disabled persons should be provided within the Canadian broadcasting system as resources become available for the purpose--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3 of the act also indicates that the needs and circumstances of all Canadians should be taken into account by the broadcasting industry through its programming and through the employment opportunities that arise out of its operations.  Broadcasters' actions as they relate to employment equity and closed captioning must reflect this policy objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past four years there has been a requirement for all television stations with more than $10 million in annual advertising revenue and network payments to provide closed captioning on all local news including live segments.  This is relatively recent. It is a clear indication of the importance of continuing  to expand and improve this service.  It  is no easy task. Our broadcasters should be commended for  the  efforts they make to fulfill this requirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a program is produced well in advance and the actors or performers use a script it is relatively easy to take the words and time their appearance on the screen so it corresponds with what is seen.  This is often called off-line or post production.  For much of the programming produced for the mass market this can be done with relative ease. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the challenge facing local or live action broadcasters is very different.  They must do what is called real time captioning.  This involves stenographers who transcribe live programs such as news or sports events as they are broadcast.  It  is a tremendous challenge as well as a wonderful achievement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some programs use what is called live display.  This is a subset of real time. It allows scripted portions of a program to be fed into a computer for translation into captions but omits any spontaneous or unscripted segments.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, steps are being taken to ensure that as technologies   evolve and opportunities arrive so too will services to Canadians with hearing impairment   evolve and improve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the services being provided to Canadians is a source of pride to all of us, but that does not mean we can rest on our laurels.  As we know, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage is currently studying the relevance of the Broadcasting Act.  It is a most opportune time to revisit the quality of the services being provided and examine ways they  can be improved. I therefore applaud the initiative to discuss the important issue of closed captioning. I urge all who are concerned to let their concerns be known to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own community I spent seven years with the independent living centre as a puppeteer  with Kids on the Block.  One of the puppets was hearing impaired.  At the time I was able to do sign language.  It struck me what an important communication tool it was  and how important it was to we make sure that when we provide services in Canada they benefit all Canadians.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member opposite and I were elected in 1997. For one of the statements she made in the last session of parliament the hon. member for Longueuil got up and gave her S.O. 31 in sign language. It was the only time in the history of parliament it had been done. It was quite commendable. I thank her for that and for her work in this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been dealing with the issue at the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage as part of our review of the Broadcasting Act. Last week at  the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages the issue was raised by Senator Gauthier of the other place when Mr. Rabinovitch of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation appeared before us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important issue. The member's motion is  timely because we are in the process of amending the Broadcasting Act. Her motion provides impetus to our study. We hope to be able to come out with a solid recommendation that keeps very much in mind what the hon. member has brought before us today by way of her motion.</p>
