	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak today at the third 
reading stage of Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists 
Registration Act. As the House knows, the government made 
this bill an important part of its broader strategy aimed at 
restoring confidence in its integrity.
<P>
	Bill C-43 was one of the measures proposed by the Prime 
Minister last June so we could keep our red book promises. Hon. 
members will remember that, on the very day this bill was read 
the first time, the Prime Minister announced in the House the 
appointment of the first ethics counsellor in Canada, whose 
mandate is to administer a revised, more comprehensive 
conflict of interest code.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also announced that he wanted someone 
he could consult on conflicts of interest and ethics. The ethics 
counsellor deals with ethics issues within the government. Bill 
C-43 proposes that the ethics counsellor be entrusted with more 
responsibilities. He would be responsible, among other things, 
for developing a lobbyists' code of conduct and would be given 
considerable powers to investigate alleged breaches. In other 
words, this code would provide for outside supervision of 
lobbyists' activities.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister stated, by combining these functions, 
the ethics counsellor would be better able to monitor the 
situation, because he would have real powers allowing him to 
conduct in-depth investigations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another measure introduced last June dealt with federal 
contracting policy. This was modified to prohibit the use of 
contingency fees for lobbying on all government contracts, 
grants and contributions.
<P>
	The Prime Minister told the House that a code of conduct for 
members of Parliament and senators would be created. It is the 
intention of the government to soon strike a special joint 
committee to begin this important work. As recently indicated 
by the House leader, a motion to establish a special joint 
committee will be presented within the next several days.
<P>
	These steps are in keeping with the promises the Liberal Party 
made to Canadians in the general election of 1993. We told 
Canadians that we would restore trust and confidence in the 
decision making process. What is more, we promised in the red 
book that a Liberal government would give members of 
Parliament a greater role in drafting legislation through House 
of Commons committees.
<P>
	That is why I am doubly proud of the legislation before us 
today. It represents a fulfilment of our promise to Canadians not 
only with respect to the content of the bill but also to the process 
by which these amendments to the Lobbyists Registration Act 
were brought about. I would particularly like to congratulate the 
hon. member for Fundy-Royal for the leadership he 
demonstrated as chairman of the industry subcommittee that 
dealt with the bill.
<P>
	The bill before us provides Canada with the most far reaching 
lobbyist registration laws in the world. For example, the U.S. 
federal law on lobbying disclosure dates from 1946 and covers 
only senators and members of the House of Representatives. 
Congress unsuccessfully attempted last year to bring the 
legislation up to date, to include the executive branch and 
congressional staff.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	No legislative provisions for lobbying disclosure exist in the 
U.K. or in the European Parliament. There is only a listing of 
association representatives who lobby the German government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11924"> 11924 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation was referred to the subcommittee before 
second reading, before the House voted to approve the bill in 
principle. Therefore, the hon. member for Fundy-Royal and 
his colleagues had a very real say in amending the bill. They 
enjoyed a flexibility that I believe will become a hallmark of 
many committees studying legislation in the years to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All in all, committee members made 13 improvements. I want 
to congratulate them on the great precedent they created by 
working under the new system. Their work has resulted in a 
much better bill and a committee report which is a first, just like 
the parliamentary process it stemmed from.
<P>
	This report describes the process that led to the amendments 
being made. It also contains minority reports stating dissenting 
opinions on certain issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very pleased to announce that under Standing Order 109 
of the House of Commons, the government will be tabling today 
its comprehensive response to the committee's report 
``Rebuilding Trust''. The government was pleased to be able to 
accept all of the amendments proposed by the committee as well 
as its recommendations. I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the committee and its members on the excellent 
work they have done.
<P>
	The committee made important improvements to all parts of 
the bill: the disclosure requirements, the lobbyists code of 
conduct, the ethics counsellor's reports, the registration system 
and enforcement. Let me provide the House with a few examples 
from each category.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With respect to the first broad area, namely information to be 
disclosed in returns, the committee considered thoroughly and 
at length the issue of grassroots lobbying campaigns, where a 
large number of members of the public may be persuaded to send 
letters or make telephone calls.
<P>
	Such campaigns are sometimes organized by lobbyists. Under 
Bill C-43 as amended, lobbyists will be required to indicate if 
they used or expect to use grassroots communication in an 
attempt to influence the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned a few moments ago, under changes made to 
federal procurement rules last spring, lobbyists are not 
permitted to charge contingency fees when lobbying for federal 
government contracts, grants and and contributions. Under Bill 
C-43 amendments, consultant lobbyists will have to indicate if 
they are paid on a contingency fee basis for all other types of 
lobbying. As well, any organization that lobbies the government 
will have to reveal the sources and amounts of funding from any 
government.
<P>
	Two further amendments proposed by the Reform Party were 
made to the bill at report stage. The hon. member for Elk Island 
moved that government funding of clients of consultant 
lobbyists as well as corporations also be disclosed. I am 
personally very pleased to see these additional improvements to 
the bill.
<P>
	The second broad area of amendments made by the committee 
involves the lobbyists' code of conduct. Bill C-43 mandates the 
ethics counsellor to develop a code for those who deal with the 
government. Under the amended bill, the code of conduct will be 
reviewed by a committee of the House before it becomes 
effective.
<P>
	As well, it will now be mandatory for lobbyists to comply 
with the code. The ethics counsellor will be required, rather than 
just empowered, to investigate breaches of the code. He will act 
independently in deciding whether to investigate and his report 
will be tabled in Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	The ethics counsellor's reports are the third broad area where 
improvements have been made to the bill. In the report of an 
investigation into a breach of the code of conduct the ethics 
counsellor will have the power to disclose information on fees 
and disbursements associated with any lobbying activity, not 
just government contracts.
<P>
	A further amendment requires that the ethics counsellor's 
report of an investigation include his findings, conclusions and 
reasons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The ethics counsellor will submit to the House a separate 
annual report on his or her activities regarding lobbying.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to clear up what appears to be 
some confusion about the ethics counsellor's reports. The ethics 
counsellor must report on every investigation and must also 
make an annual report. These reports must be submitted to the 
registrar general. Then the registrar general must, and I quote 
from the bill, cause a copy to be laid before each House of 
Parliament on any of the first 15 sitting days after it is received. 
There is no discretion in the tabling of the report whatsoever. All 
of the ethics counsellor's reports will be submitted in their 
entirety to both Houses of Parliament and those concerning 
investigations must provide details on the findings, conclusions 
and reasons.
<P>
	The fourth broad area involves improvements to the 
registration process. Bill C-43 recognizes the importance of 
maintaining an active exchange and dialogue between 
Canadians and their government. Formal government initiated 
consultations will be exempted from the activities triggering the 
need to register as a lobbyist. This exemption responds to many 
associations' concerns that if they had to register each time they 
were consulted by government they would spend all their time 
on  paperwork. The committee was aware that the exemption 
should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11925"> 11925 </A></B>
<P>
not be so wide that it defeats the very purpose of the Lobbyists 
Registration Act.
<P>
	I have heard some fairly ridiculous comments from the 
opposition on this point. What needs to be understood is that we 
need to strike the appropriate balance. The notion proposed by 
some members opposite that this meant a phone call returned by 
a public official was not lobbying is ridiculous and simply is not 
sustainable by the wording of the bill. The exemption applies to 
those consultations frequently initiated by government to ensure 
that in proceeding on legislation it has received the views of 
stakeholders from all parts of Canadian society, a practice which 
is not only normal but which should be welcomed by members 
of Parliament, opposition and government alike.
<P>
	Its report says the registrar should issue an interpretation 
bulletin to precisely define these circumstances. As well, the 
registrar will have the authority to issue interpretation bulletins 
to clear up any other questions as they arise. Therefore the more 
extreme examples proposed by the opposition, which might lead 
to the act not being applied as it was intended, can be taken care 
of through the simple administrative exercise of issuing 
interpretation bulletins to cover the cases in point.
<P>
	The 30-day updating requirement has been changed to 
six-month filings for associations. This will reduce the 
paperwork for these organizations, given their lobbying goals do 
not change much over the course of a year. Furthermore, 
electronic filing will be available and will improve the 
efficiency of the registration process both for lobbyists and the 
registrar.
<P>
	Finally, changes have been made to improve the enforcement 
of the act. The registrar will have the authority to conduct 
random checks of the information in the registry, and the 
limitation of proceedings under the act has been extended from 
six months to two years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure that all the hon. members will agree with the Prime 
Minister and myself that we need to restore public confidence in 
our institution.
<P>
	This confidence is essential, if we want our efforts to redirect 
and redesign the role of government to be successful.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In all of these matters what I think Canadians and 
parliamentarians need to preoccupy themselves with is the 
existence of due process and rule of law.
<P>
	If we are truly concerned about the maintenance of respect for 
our institutions, parliamentary, judicial or otherwise, what we 
need to ensure is that the processes pursued respecting them are 
at once transparent and subject to due process.
<P>
	It is the easiest thing in the world to stand in the House of 
Commons, protected against the laws of defamation, and 
impugn the integrity of other individuals, whether members of 
Parliament, public officials or otherwise. It is impossible to ever 
remove the doubt that aspersions cast impose on the integrity of 
an individual.
<P>
	I say to members opposite that when they tread on the grounds 
of issues of ethics they look to the questions of process, to the 
rule of law, because anyone of us at any time may stand accused 
wrongly. To stand in the House, as we have seen members do in 
the last few days, and make accusations without foundation, 
without fact, based on innuendo and circumstance, is to at once 
impugn the integrity of the people involved as well as to impugn 
the integrity of these institutions.
<P>
	Process, rule of law, these are the things that have made this 
country one in which we are all pleased to live, safe from abuse. 
This is a case surely we ought to be able to debate. I refer 
directly here to the issue of satellite broadcasting and the DTH 
panel report. We surely ought to be able to debate in the House 
the substance of an issue.
<P>
	Over the last few days I have seen members opposite try to 
make this into a case of ethics. Why? For nothing but sheer 
political expediency without a single fact, without a single issue 
being raised of any substance whatsoever; shameless casting of 
aspersions. That is the old politics and that is the way it is has 
been practised in the House by the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois in the last few days.
<P>
	I want to refer exactly to this case. It is a demonstration of 
why process is so important. In the case of DTH satellite 
broadcasting the government was put in the position that many 
interested parties were looking for a review of an exemption 
order issued by the CRTC on August 30 of last year.
<P>
	Let it be understood the initiation of the review of the policy 
was a response to clearly articulated interests quite outside 
those of parties that may or may not benefit. It was made clear to 
the government by many parties, and events since then have 
borne that out, that the effect of the August 30 order was the 
creation of an effective monopoly in this service in Canada.
<P>
	What was the government to do about that? Within days we 
announced the policy was subject to review. The order was 
issued August 30. By September 12 that had been made clear 
publicly. Major policy is made by government. That is the 
reason people elect governments, to make policy decisions. It is 
the responsibility of government to make policy decisions. We 
would have abrogated our responsibility if we had refused to act, 
so we did act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11926"> 11926 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	We established a transparent process. We chose three former 
deputy ministers, non-partisan appointments but truly people 
whose opinions we would respect; whose capabilities, honesty 
and integrity had never been questioned. However, members in 
the House were free to stand and impugn the integrity of persons 
who were providing a service to the government and to the 
people of Canada. Without fact and without any information 
they could stand up and say these people, because they were 
named to the panel, there is something wrong with them. That 
should not happen in a democratic society. If it can happen to 
those three individuals it can happen to me, to you, Mr. Speaker, 
and to members opposite without facts.
<P>
	They made a report and nobody on the opposite side of the 
House has yet offered me a single substantive criticism of the 
recommendations made. On the contrary, ACTRA, the Canadian 
conference of the arts, the Canadian Consumers' Association, 
the Globe and Mail, the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, the Toronto <I>Star</I> have 
all said to adopt the recommendations of the report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> How does C-43 fix this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> The hon. member for Elk Island cannot wait for 
his chance so he is talking away over there. I am trying to answer 
his questions.
<P>
	We put this direction on the table in the House of Commons on 
Wednesday. It launches a process. Throughout this every step of 
the way we have followed the principles of transparency and 
legislated authority. The authority to issue a direction is clearly 
established in the Broadcasting Act. It has a process attached to 
it. That is the rule of law. It is open and transparent.
<P>
	I invite members opposite to criticize the content of the 
direction and the expert panel report. Instead, repeatedly they 
choose to cast aspersions and raise innuendo about integrity.
<P>
	This bill is about ethics, lobbyists and transparency. It creates 
principles by which government can function in a real world. I 
do not understand the notion that governments should exclude 
all outside influences.
<P>
	Some of the proposals put before us both in committee and in 
the House would have the effect of ensuring that no official or 
minister would ever talk to anyone outside government. It would 
create a freeze in the kind of dialogue and openness that ought to 
exist in a free and democratic society.
<P>
	The bill is about creating the appropriate balance. If we start 
from the presumption, as I believe some members opposite have 
done, that all officials, all elected representatives and all 
ministers are likely to be dishonest then the bill will surely 
prove inadequate. The government does not start with that 
assumption.
<P>
	The government starts with the assumption that virtually all 
public officials are honest and motivated to do the things in the 
best interest of the country.
<P>
	One of the things Canadians sometimes fail to appreciate 
enough is that many businesses that speak to me about their 
efforts to trade around the world tell me that throughout the 
world countries like Canada which have a political and 
bureaucratic system almost entirely free of corruption are very 
rare. This is something we have for which we should be 
eminently grateful. The purpose of this bill is to try to ensure 
that at the same time as preserving and protecting the 
fundamental honesty of our government system, we are also 
recognizing the fact that government needs to be open in a 
democratic society. People need to be able to consult and to 
contact their government.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	It also operates on the assumption that all lobbying is 
therefore not bad, that lobbyists are not evil people. Some 
members opposite think that word just by its very nature has a 
negative connotation. In listening to some of the debate, I think 
in some cases they would like to eliminate lobbyists. That is fine 
and dandy for the large corporations, because they can always 
find other ways to get their messages across. But for the small 
firm, say in Saskatoon, that cannot have ready access to 
government in Ottawa or wherever, it is sometimes necessary to 
get professional advice and assistance. It is a useful function. As 
I said, often governments need to consult.
<P>
	Having an open system requires achieving the right balance. 
This bill is about balance. It is about achieving the proper 
equilibrium. If we do not want any lobbyists at all, I am quite 
prepared to admit that the bill does not go far enough, because it 
does not outlaw lobbying. But it is intended to ensure that the 
activities of lobbyists are sufficiently transparent to assure the 
integrity of our system and yet do not impose upon officials or 
bureaucrats obligations that are so onerous that they would 
rather not talk to anybody in the outside world, but just stay in 
their glass towers here in the city of Ottawa.
<P>
	Striking a balance is open to debate. Have we erred too far one 
way or the other? That is a point of legitimate debate. But to 
suggest at the extreme that we need a process that shuts the 
system down I think is wrong. I believe we have struck the 
appropriate balance in this bill.
<P>
	I think that also pertains to the issues of integrity and honesty. 
The system must speak for itself. We ought to be trying for 
transparency and then when issues of integrity or ethics are 
raised we will have the facts to deal with that.
<P>
	I implore members of the House of Commons to remember 
always that today's accuser may tomorrow stand accused. To 
make accusation without fact, on the basis of circumstance or 
innuendo, and thereby impugn a person's reputation-which in 
the final analysis is all that  any of us have that is worth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11927"> 11927 </A></B>
<P>
preserving, our reputations-is something members of the 
House should be reluctant to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am convinced that members from all parties represented in 
this House will welcome the legislation before us, which is 
about to be read the third time.
<P>
	Bill C-43 is the result of the work of previous committees and 
the testimony of all the stakeholders. Bill C-43 will improve 
government transparency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It will significantly strengthen the powers of the ethics 
counsellor. But perhaps most important, we have given the 
elected representatives of Canadians more say in creating the 
laws that will restore the people's trust and confidence in 
government.
<P>
	I hope all members will join me in voting in favour of Bill 
C-43.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the government announced its intention to amend 
the Lobbyists Registration Act, we thought that it was sincere. 
We thought that those who, for almost ten years, took the 
Conservatives to task about their integrity, their way of doing 
things and their decision-making processes, would table a bill 
that would shed some light on what goes on behind the scene in 
this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Yet, on June 16, 1994, when Bill C-43, an Act to amend the 
Lobbyists Registration Act and to make related amendments to 
other Acts, was tabled, we were forced to change our thinking. 
The Liberal government, that is those same Liberal members 
who, in opposition, denounced the cosy deals being hatched in 
the inner circles of the Conservative regime, now seemed 
prepared to condone such practices by tabling legislation which 
contains nothing but good intentions.
<P>
	We figure that, once the Liberals gained access to the pork 
barrel, they forgot what they were saying during their days in 
opposition. This bill has neither teeth nor substance; it is exactly 
the opposite of what we expected. The credibility of our 
democratic institutions is currently being questioned by the 
public. Never, in the short history of our democracy, have public 
officials been looked upon with such cynicism by voters. 
Everyone agrees that a climate of confidence must be restored 
between the governments and the public.
<P>
	During the last federal election campaign, the Liberal Party of 
Canada pledged to reform our institutions and make their 
operations more transparent. In fact, the Liberals' red book, 
which we hear so much about, contains the following on page 
94: ``The integrity of government is put into question when there 
is a perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists 
exercising undue influence away from public view''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, once it took office, the Liberal Party 
considerably watered down its commitments. Such an about 
face makes the population wonder, and rightly so, how 
committed the Liberal government really is to bringing in 
legislation to control influence peddling. When we compare the 
campaign promises and how they translate into legislation, we 
can only conclude that the lobbyists undoubtedly determined the 
final version of Bill C-43 and the resulting reversal of the 
Liberals' position.
<P>
	I believe that the first thing a government has to do to restore 
the integrity of our democratic institutions is to stop buying 
votes with empty promises. It must also make the administration 
of the state's affairs more transparent, above all so that we can 
clear up all grey areas and reassure the population that public 
policy decisions are made in the public interest and not in the 
interest of powerful lobbies.
<P>
	Everybody recognizes the need to restore the public's 
confidence in our institutions. Unfortunately, after only 18 
months in power, the Chrétien government's track record on 
transparency is dismal. For example, on September 26, 1994, 
the Canadian press reported that documents obtained under the 
Access to Information Act showed that, in the months preceding 
the introduction of Bill C-43, there was a marked increase in the 
number of meetings with lobbyists and that some of them had 
threatened to take the government to court if the new legislation 
forced them to disclose their political ties.
<P>
	As has often been the case, the lack of transparency in the 
process kept the public in the dark regarding the scope and the 
nature of the lobbyists' workings on Bill C-43 until the news hit 
the press. The daily newspaper <I>La Presse</I> eloquently summed up 
the situation in its headline on the issue: ``Ottawa's plans to 
shackle lobbies foiled''. Bizarre situation-lobbyists 
influencing the very legislation that was supposed to reduce 
their influence. Given this situation, the need for transparency 
has never been greater.
<P>
	One cannot treat the public like a doormat, Mr. Speaker. The 
public remembers quite clearly the promises made by the 
Liberals in the red book and elsewhere. Duff Conacher, 
co-ordinator of the organization Démocratie en surveillance, 
appeared before the committee to refresh the Liberals' memory 
regarding their statements on this issue. I know that the 
members opposite do not like being reminded of some of the 
things they have said, especially when they are being 
hypocritical on such an important issue, but I will nevertheless 
subject them to a quote from this person, who has studied the 
issue in depth and monitored the government. Mr. Conacher 
said: ``We would like to remind you of those promises and the 
requirement. We hope you will not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11928"> 11928 </A></B>
<P>
only take the opportunity but also keep those promises and fulfil 
that requirement in your deliberations on Bill C-43.''
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	There is also a legislative history to be acknowledged. The 
Cooper committee and the Holtmann committee have preceded 
you. Both proposed measures that go beyond the provisions in 
Bill C-43. And now the Liberals are going to brag that they went 
further than anyone else.
<P>
	Nevertheless, Bill C-43 does make certain improvements to 
the system for providing a framework for lobbyists. Of course it 
was not that difficult to improve the present legislation, since it 
was so permissive, smart lobbyists could easily get around it.
<P>
	Government members, however, will have to admit that the 
commitments of the red book have been vastly watered down 
and that Bill C-43, in its present form, will be unlikely to 
prevent such troubling events as those surrounding the 
privatization of Pearson airport or the ``Dupuy affair'', both the 
first and the latest version. We will not be able to find out more 
with Bill C-43 than we can under the current legislation.
<P>
	What is worse, Mitchell Sharp-Who is this guy? The senior 
advisor to the Prime Minister on ethical issues-admitted 
before the committee that, even if the statute arising from Bill 
C-43 had been in effect at the time of the negotiations for the 
privatization of Pearson airport's terminals I and 2, the public 
would have learned nothing more.
<P>
	So what use will Bill C-43 be? What use is the statute arising 
from this bill if we cannot even find out about the administrative 
irregularities and the scandals around all this? The government 
drafted Bill C-43 because of certain events, including the 
Pearson affair. It has drafted a bill that will not give us any 
additional information. What are they doing? Why do they 
bother?
<P>
	What the public has a right to know, legislators and members 
of this House are unable to tell them because of the 
government's attitude and the attitude of the Minister of 
Industry.
<P>
	The public has the right to know, for instance, who influences 
the government, who in government is being influenced, why, 
and especially, for how much. The Liberals are denying the 
people's, the taxpayers' legitimate and democratic right to 
know.
<P>
	The official opposition has been diligent. We were on the 
alert. The opposition was quick to condemn the Liberals' lack of 
courage in their proposals for providing a framework for 
lobbyists' activities and for ensuring the greatest possible 
openness in the administration of government affairs. I imagine 
the Liberals are upset because we were on the alert and did our 
job as the official opposition.
<P>
	To try and change the object of this bill, I personally proposed 
more than 24 amendments in committee, amendments that were 
motivated only by a concern for transparency. The Minister of 
Industry ordered his second string to defeat all the amendments 
moved by the official opposition. I use the term ``second string'' 
because the Liberals who were present on Tuesday, March 14 
voted against my amendments without being able to explain 
why.
<P>
	We reached the height of absurdity when these same Liberals 
were unable to explain their own cosmetic amendments. It was 
department officials who explained the Liberals' amendments. 
Does that not take the cake. I used to know the House jester, I 
know the Prime Minister's ministerial puppets, now today I get 
to meet some of the pawns of the Minister of Industry. Nothing 
in this situation enhances the role of the members of the 
government.
<P>
	On Tuesday, April 25, the opposition, again at the report 
stage, presented over 30 reworded motions in amendment in an 
effort once again to improve the bill. We were trying once more 
to give the government the opportunity to amend the bill in order 
to achieve the objectives that had been set.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	All of the amendments were once again defeated by the 
Liberal government. We have presented over 60 amendments to 
this bill. They have all been rejected. Sixty amendments have 
been systematically rejected by the government. The Liberals 
have therefore said ``no'' 60 times to transparency. They have 
said ``no'' 60 times to government integrity. They have said 
``no'' 60 times to shedding light on the activities of influence 
peddlers. I will let you draw your own conclusions.
<P>
	The attitude of the government is incomprehensible, since the 
aim of the Bloc Quebecois' amendments was, in the end, simply 
to enable the government to fulfill its own campaign 
commitments. The Prime Minister in fact reiterated them last 
June saying that Bill C-43 would give the federal administration 
unprecedented transparency. Unfortunately, I have to assume 
that we have had the wool pulled over our eyes. I am not alone in 
thinking this. Both the francophone and the anglophone press is 
making this point.
<P>
	Gilles Lesage, editorial writer for <I>Le Devoir</I> made the 
following comment a few months ago. I will read it for you: 
``The Bloc Quebecois is right in believing that Mr. Manley's bill 
is watering down hugely the commitments made by the Liberals 
in their famous red book. Now that they are in power, they must 
do everything possible to keep their promises. As the opposition 
is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11929"> 11929 </A></B>
<P>
pointing out, the lobbyists' activities must be better regulated to 
ensure greater transparency in government decision-making 
and to ensure that the more fortunate do not have undue access to 
decision-makers through the actions of the influence peddlers''.
<P>
	In his editorial, Mr. Lesage accurately identified the issue of 
the bill currently before us. From the time the bill was tabled to 
when it reached third reading, the government added nothing to 
give more teeth to the legislation this bill will become.
<P>
	It simply fussed about, adding cosmetic amendments here and 
there throughout the bill, without substantially altering the bill 
in any way.
<P>
	After it studied the bill, the Bloc Quebecois identified eight 
major flaws in it and proposed legislative solutions to them. As 
you know, the government often accuses the official opposition 
of criticizing without making any constructive suggestions. Yet, 
as I said earlier, we proposed 60 amendments aimed at 
improving this bill. These improvements had a very specific 
goal: to correct the eight flaws in this bill that we had identified 
very quickly.
<P>
	I will start by listing these eight flaws, before outlining them 
in more detail later. The first, very important flaw concerns the 
ethics counsellor. The other flaws have to do with the types of 
lobbyists, the requirement to disclose contracts, lobbyists' fees, 
the contacting of ministers and senior officials, the lobbyists' 
political ties, coalitions, contingency fees, and tax deductions 
for lobbyists' fees.
<P>
	This bill has no avoidance rule or code of conduct for public 
officials. Finally, this great code of ethics will be practically 
unenforceable, as I will explain in my last point.
<P>
	There are eight major shortcomings in Bill C-43, either 
because it does not go far enough or because it does not even 
mention the problem.
<P>
	I could go on for hours about this bill, mostly about the 
expectations and concerns of taxpayers, because I followed 
committee proceedings closely, because my mind was not made 
up before I heard the people's concerns, because my only goal 
was to answer the questions raised by English Canada and 
especially by the Quebec people, instead of trying to please the 
lucky few who can afford to send lobbyists to Parliament Hill by 
exempting them.
<P>
	Within the time allocated to me, I will try to explain clearly 
each of the flaws I identified in this bill. As I said earlier, the 
first flaw concerns the ethics counsellor. Need I remind the 
House of the Minister of Canadian Heritage's troubling 
interference in CRTC business or the Ritter affair involving a 
senior official at the Department of Health who, while still on 
the department's payroll, was lobbying his coworkers, trying to 
sell them on the merits of bovine somatotropin?
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Also, when we look at Pearson International Airport, the 
helicopter acquisition contract, the Augusta affair as well as the 
recent damning positions taken by the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet ministers to benefit Power Corporation and, at the same 
time, the Prime Minister's own son-in-law, when we look at all 
that and at the government's attitude regarding the heritage 
minister's quiet trip to Los Angeles to visit Edgar Bronfman, 
owner of the Seagram Company, one can only wonder and be 
concerned.
<P>
	Especially when the Prime Minister does not even consult his 
ethics counsellor or when he does but systematically refuses to 
tell us what advice he was given, when he will not tell the elected 
representatives sitting in this House what his ethics counsellor 
has recommended.
<P>
	This deplorable window dressing clearly shows that the ethics 
counsellor is not independent enough to assume as crucial and 
fundamental a role as that of transparency watchdog in the 
federal administration. The Prime Minister probably just 
wanted to have an extra advisor on his staff. Smoke screens only 
hide the truth.
<P>
	This appointment is therefore nothing but a sham to fool the 
public into believing that the government is actually doing 
something, taking concrete action to restore integrity in 
Canadian institutions. In actual fact, the counsellor conducts 
only secret investigations and accounts only to the Prime 
Minister. What does that give us, the elected represeantatives? 
And what does it give the people of Canada? Absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	So, we, in the Bloc Quebecois, believe that ethics, 
transparency and public confidence in democratic institutions 
and government management are not matters to be left in the 
hands of a political party, a government or a Prime Minister, but 
rather to be decided on by democratic institutions, the House of 
Commons and the elected representatives of the people.
<P>
	In that regard, one of the government's star witnesses, Simon 
Reisman, the president of Ranger Oil Limited, supported the 
Bloc's views on the subject. Let me quote him because what he 
told the chair of the committee, who was a Liberal and had to 
submit a report to the minister, was extremely important. He 
said: ``If we get into the business of a code of ethics to govern 
the behaviour of the members of this industry, it ought to be kept 
out of partisan politics as far as you possibly can. I think one 
good way of doing that is to make the appointment an 
appointment by Parliament, rather than by the government of 
the day. You are more likely to get someone more objective. If 
he is appointed by Parliament, I think he should report to 
Parliament-which is the recommendation in any event''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11930"> 11930 </A></B>
<P>
	And he added: ``There is another reason I think he should be 
reporting to Parliament and should be subject to accountability 
to Parliament. Members of Parliament, who are elected under 
a democratic process, have the mandate to legislate and they 
have the right to review legislation. In our democratic society, 
they are in the best position to prevent any abuse of power. The 
ethics counsellor will undoubtedly be a very powerful official''. 
That statement was made by a government star witness, who 
testified at the committee's request. Yet, nothing in Bill C-43 
reflects the recommendations made by that witness.
<P>
	Do you really think that the ethics counsellor, who will work 
for the government and look after its interests, will be very 
powerful? I do not think that this is what taxpayers were hoping 
for when they heard the Liberals' election promises. An ethics 
counsellor, sure, but one who has some investigative powers and 
who is not under the Prime Minister's thumb. This is what the 
public wanted. What we need is a totally independent ethics 
counsellor who is accountable to Parliament. This means that he 
can hold public inquiries and report on his work, on his findings 
and on the reasons supporting his conclusions to the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I am also very concerned by the fact that Bill C-43 does not 
delegate any enforcement powers to the ethics counsellor. I fear 
that the counsellor will end up being like a traffic cop with no 
authority to give tickets. If you listen to the Liberals these days, 
you get the impression that they simply want to set up a system 
which will be administered behind closed doors, so that 
patronage can still go on without anyone really knowing what is 
happening. In my mind, that is what is going on right now. Is it 
not strange that the tabling of Bill C-43 would coincide with 
such a scandal?
<P>
	A second flaw, equally significant, shows how the Liberals 
reversed their position on the tier system for lobbyists. In June 
1993, after examining the Lobbyists Registration Act, a 
committee of the House of Commons recommended eliminating 
the distinction between first tier and second tier lobbyists. In 
fact, this was the first recommendation in the Holtmann report. 
The members who signed this report, including the hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the hon. member for St. 
Boniface, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands and the 
hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood, who were all in the 
opposition at the time, agreed with the principle of eliminating 
the tier system. I assume they are not going to deny that. You are 
not going to deny you signed the Holtmann report. You signed it, 
and you agreed with its recommendations. Today, those very 
same members who are now government whip, Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue, Deputy Leader 
of the Government and lastly, Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry, are no longer on side.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> What they said when they were in the 
opposition is not what they are saying now, and I find this very 
disturbing.
<P>
	In fact, they all voted against the amendment I proposed to 
eliminate all distinctions between lobbyists. I do not understand 
the Liberal's retreat from their own position and the promises 
they made during the election campaign. What was not 
acceptable two years ago is still unacceptable today. Witnesses 
made this clear to the members of the committee that examined 
Bill C-43. A lobbyist is a lobbyist, whether they belong to the 
first, second or third tier. That is why Bill C-43 should provide 
for only one tier for all lobbyists in Canada.
<P>
	I imagine this position was not palatable to the lobbyists and 
the financial backers of the Liberal Party. That is probably the 
only explanation we have for the current flexible conscience we 
note among government members.
<P>
	Another flaw in this bill is its disclosure provisions. Here 
again, I proposed amending the bill to oblige lobbyists to 
disclose their real business, the real facts we could then 
investigate, so that we could see what is going on in this 
government.
<P>
	The scandal surrounding Toronto's Pearson airport has amply 
demonstrated the lax nature of the current disclosure rules. The 
privatization contract, it will be remembered, was signed in the 
middle of the 1993 federal election campaign and an inquiry was 
instituted to shed light on the transaction. The Nixon report was 
submitted to government on November 29, 1993 and revealed 
misconduct on the part of the lobbyists, public servants and 
political assistants. However, the report raised a number of other 
questions to which we have not obtained answers: Who were the 
lobbyists who failed to comply with the most elementary rules 
of ethics? When did these events occur? In what way were their 
actions either illegal or improper? Bill C-43 will still not give us 
the answer to these questions.
<P>
	I see that my time will be interrupted for question period.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes, the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm may continue after question period and 
routine proceedings. At the resumption of debate on Bill C-43, 
he will have 15 minutes to complete his remarks.

Speaker, discussions are now under way to extend the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty.
<P>
	The non-proliferation treaty came into force in 1970 and was 
given a life of 25 years. The non-nuclear states, like Canada, 
that signed the treaty made a commitment not to develop nuclear 
weapons. The nuclear states, like the United States and the 
Soviet Union, made a commitment under article VI to reduce 
their nuclear arsenals. That was not done. While the 
non-nuclear states respected the treaty and did not develop 
nuclear weapons, the nuclear states did not respect article VI.
<P>
	In 1970 the nuclear states had 8,000 nuclear weapons. By 
1990 they had 50,000. Now the nuclear states and their allies 
want to extend the treaty indefinitely without any mechanism to 
ensure compliance with article VI. As a result, several 
non-nuclear states do not want to extend the treaty on that basis. 
This important treaty is now in jeopardy.

position and to be more flexible. The world cannot tolerate 
another nuclear arms race.

should earn the right through good behaviour and 
self-improvement. They could then be transferred to medium 
security institutions.

	In Canada, on average, a compensable work injury occurs 
every 38 seconds. One out of thirteen workers is injured at work, 
and two workers are killed every day. This is not acceptable. The 
human loss and the pain are devastating. Workplace injuries rob 
us of more than 10 times the number of work days lost due to

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on December 14, 1993, a constituent of mine, Carol Goldie, was 
stabbed six times by her former husband after he had stalked her 
for five years. He was charged with 10 separate offences, among 
them attempted murder, criminal harassment, and stalking, 
under section 264 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	After a long process of plea bargaining, in February of this 
year the assailant pleaded guilty to mere assault and received a 
sentence of just two years less a day. All other charges were 
dropped, including, as usual, the weapons charges.
<P>
	I find it difficult to express in strong enough terms the outrage 
of this sentence. It makes a mockery of the entire legal process. 
This precedent setting verdict renders the new stalking law 
impotent. Women who are harassed and intimidated remain 
unprotected by our justice system. The laws are in place but they 
are not enforced because justice is bargained away behind 
closed doors. No wonder Canadians are losing faith in our 
toothless system of justice. While the system can only bark, the 
criminals continue to bite.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address the matter of the privatization of Canadian 
National Railways, which the Minister of Transport has so 
recently announced and which I personally applaud.
<P>
	I would like to indicate the fact that Canadian taxpayers, for 
over half a century, have put billions and billions of dollars into 
this rail system, and for many people it represents a symbol of 
Canadian nationalism: a road that links both oceans together in 
this great country. In view of that, I would like to caution the 
government and advise that any sale should include the 
recognition of this great tradition and heritage. For that purpose 
I suggest that any sale include terms that the company which 
owns and operates these assets must use the symbol and name 
identification which reflects Canadian heritage. For greater 
certainty that said name must include the name ``Canadian''.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
150 years ago, on February 20, 1845, Sister Élisabeth Bruyère, a 
Grey Nun, arrived in Ottawa. She promptly established the 
Order of the Sisters of Charity, giving it the mission of caring for 
the sick, teaching children and coming to the aid of poor 
immigrants.
<P>
	Today, the Sisters of Charity of Ottawa are very active in 
several missions throughout the world, in Haiti, Brazil and 
Lesotho to name but a few. In addition, they run Saint-Vincent 
Hospital and the Elisabeth- Bruyère Centre, two institutions 
with the mission of caring for the sick in the Ottawa region.
<P>
	On February 18, the opening ceremonies kicking off the 150th 
anniversary celebrations of the Sisters of Charity of Ottawa 
were held. There will be several other ceremonies and events 
throughout the year and in the beginning of 1996 
commemorating this century and a half of service.

Speaker, on this day of mourning, I join with all my colleagues 
in extending my heartfelt sympathy to the many families who 
have lost loved ones to work accidents.
<P>
	In 1993, there were 758 work-related deaths in Canada. It is 
difficult to understand how workers can still risk their lives on 
the job in this day and age. Yet, thousands of workers still face 
this reality, especially in the construction, transportation, 
mining and manufacturing sectors, which still account for over 
60 per cent of workplace fatalities.
<P>
	We cannot be satisfied with the recent decline in the number 
of industrial accidents in Canada. Occupational safety is one of 
the most important social objectives of this century and must 
remain so as long as people continue to die on the job. In this 
regard, I can only urge the Canadian government to adopt 
occupational health and safety practices and policies based on 
those in effect in Quebec.

<P>
	Canadians remember and mourn the 26 miners tragically 
taken in the Westray coal mine explosion. This disaster only 
serves to underline the brutal reality of certain types of work.
<P>
	Today is a day of mourning for persons killed or injured in the 
workplace. Canadians must learn from the mistakes of the past, 
take action in the present and ensure their health and safety are 
protected in the future.
<P>
	Occupational health and safety should be foremost in the 
minds of management, labour and governments when decisions 
are made. A safe workplace translates into a productive 
workforce and a strong and vital economy. From the farm, to the 
mine, to the factory, to the lumber mill the Reform Party pays 
respect to all who put their lives on the line to make ends meet.

<P>
	In February 1991, a private member's bill tabled by my

28 as an official day of mourning for those killed or injured at 
work. There are four workplace fatalities every working day in 
Canada, while a serious injury occurs every seven seconds of 
every working day.
<P>
	Every year, workers develop occupational diseases which, 
very often, are neither declared nor covered by any 
compensation plan. Governments here and abroad continue to 
ignore health and safety standards and their enforcement. We 
continue to work with our counterparts at the national and 
international levels to set global health and safety standards.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two weeks ago, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
quietly took a trip to Los Angeles, where he met with Edgar 
Bronfman, the owner of Seagram, at the very moment that the 
acquisition of communications giant MCA by Seagram was 
announced. The possibility of such a transaction, involving 
several Canadian interests in the book, film, record and 
distribution industries, had been in the news for a few weeks.
<P>
	In this context, how can the acting Prime Minister explain that 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage placed himself in a conflict of 
interest situation by happening to be in Mr. Bronfman's suite 
just as Mr. Bronfman announced this transaction, given that the 
deal will have to be approved by Investment Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member reveals a lack of understanding of 
what the Investment Canada review process consists.
<P>
	First, Investment Canada is located in the Department of 
Industry. Second, the threshold issue will be determined by an 
official, the acting president of Investment Canada, on whether 
or not Seagram is a Canadian controlled corporation. If it is, 
there is no Investment Canada review required.
<P>
	This indicates his hypothesis is incorrect. The review is based 
on an application initiated by the purchaser, which in this case is 
Seagram, rather than by the acquired company.
<P>
	There is no real or apparent conflict in the visit that the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage paid to producers in Los Angeles.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a well known fact on the hill that no one 
understands anything, except the Minister of Industry, who 
understands everything. In fact, everyone in Canada and Quebec 
understands that there was a minister of this government in Mr. 
Bronfman's suite, when the most important deal in media 
history was struck. Everyone can understand that. The only one 
who does not understand is the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	I would like to ask the acting Prime Minister how he can deny 
that the Minister of Canadian Heritage put himself in a conflict 
of interest situation since, by a pure coincidence once again, 
input from the Department of Canadian Heritage is required to 
help Investment Canada analyze the transaction between 
Seagram and MCA and its implications.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand the Minister of Canadian Heritage will be 
present later in question period if there are questions regarding 
the details of his visit to Los Angeles.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	There is neither an apparent nor a real conflict of interest in 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage meeting with a group of film 
makers and producers, all of whom carry on business in Canada, 
and representing the interests and views of Canadians in that 
milieu.
<P>
	No review is under way at the present time. No application for 
review is under way at the present time. In fact, the threshold 
determination of whether or not Seagram is a Canadian company 
has yet to be made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what are we to believe: that when the heritage minister 
visited Los Angeles two weeks ago, he did so as a Canadian 
government emissary announcing to Liberal friends that the 
approval of Seagram's deal by Investment Canada would not be 
a problem, or did he travel to Los Angeles just to discuss the 
smog problem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the event of a review of the transaction by 
Investment Canada, it would be the objective of the government 
to improve on the existing undertakings with respect to the 
corporation MCA.
<P>
	It is clear that in the interests of Canadians, any review of that 
transaction, if it were favourably disposed of, would result in 
benefits to Canada pursuant to the Investment Canada Act.
<P>
	The government has an obligation to have the best possible 
understanding of the business and of the undertakings of the 
acquirer as well as the acquiree corporation in Canada. That 
does not create a conflict of interest.
<P>
	If there is a conflict of interest, I do not know where it is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not suppose it was a cultural exchange between 
Mickey Mouse and a representative of the federal government, 
when the Minister of Canadian Heritage, unbeknownst to the 
taxpayers, went to Los Angeles two weeks ago. That just does 
not make sense.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. 
Considering the conflict of interest guidelines that apply to 
members of this government and considering that the case of 
Power DirecTV has shown there is a very close relationship 
between this government and influential Liberals in the business 
community, including Mr. Paul Desmarais, father of the Prime 
Minister's son-in-law and member of the board of directors of 
Seagram, does the acting Prime Minister realize that the conduct 
of the Minister of Canadian Heritage raises questions about the 
integrity of the Liberal government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we have seen in the House over the last few days, 
members like the one opposite are prepared to make allegations 
founded not on fact but simply on innuendo.
<P>
	In the preamble to his question he tries to link the decision to 
table a direction with respect to direct to home satellites to some 
kind of apparent conflict. As recently as this morning's 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, we have yet another editorial opinion saying: 
``The government in overruling the CRTC has made its future 
decisions easier. The guiding principle for the CRTC is that all 
its decisions reflect the best interests of consumers and that 
includes competition in choice''.
<P>
	I can understand that perhaps the member opposite is not in 
favour of competition in choice and is not interested in the 
affairs of consumers. That is for him to say. But to suggest that 
acting in the interest of consumers is somehow motivated by a 
conflict is an entirely unfounded, improper and irrelevant 
allegation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how surprising that The <I>Gazette</I> should support the 
Liberals. Very surprising indeed.
<P>
	After seeing the way his minister proceeded in the Ginn 
Publishing affair, the disturbing letters he wrote to CRTC, his 
betrayal of his commitments to the CBC and his abdication of 
his mandate in the case of Power DirecTv, would the acting 
Prime Minister, leader in this House and defender of his 
government's integrity, agree that the Minister of Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11937"> 11937 </A></B>
<P>
Heritage is no longer capable of performing his duties and that 
consequently, he will have to ask for his resignation?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, actually this is a worthwhile question. It reveals the 
real motivation of the Bloc Quebecois in this, which is to malign 
personally the integrity of a minister of the government without 
fact, without any basis in policy or otherwise.
<P>
	The government stands prepared to debate its policy with 
respect to DTH satellite broadcasting, to review the issue of the 
acquisition of MCA, in fact its review under the Investment 
Canada Act and to respond to questions concerning the 
objections or otherwise of these decisions.
<P>
	For the hon. member to stand up and make the ridiculous and 
absurd allegations that he is making today, totally unfounded, 
demonstrates the political motivation. That is all there is behind 
this.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Canadians have no tolerance for governments that conduct 
public business behind closed doors.
<P>
	First we had a backroom deal and an unprecedented use of 
cabinet powers to benefit Power Corp. and the Desmarais 
family. Now we have the makings of a backroom deal to benefit 
Seagram and the Bronfman family. It is this type of thing that 
undermines Canadians' confidence in their elected officials.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that his Minister of Canadian 
Heritage has committed yet another grave error in judgment by 
meeting with Edgar Bronfman prior to Seagram's takeover of 
MCA?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe what undermines Canadian confidence are 
unfounded allegations.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that those in this House who stand 
to accuse others may one day have to stand to defend 
themselves. I suggest that she should be a little more sensitive.
<P>
	I will give her a suggestion of what the popular media is 
saying on this. I offer her at this time today's <I>Financial Post</I> 
which states: ``Rather than being politically motivated the 
cabinet decision is clearly based on the desire for competition 
and not the creation of a monopoly in DTH satellite service''.
<P>
	If the Reform Party is interested in competition, then the hon. 
member would be saying something about the content of the 
report, rather than making the silly allegations that she has made 
this morning. In fact what I observed on ``Canada AM'' 
yesterday was that the spokesman for the Reform Party said he 
could not comment on this because he had interests with 
Expressvu.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday and again today the industry minister denies that the 
heritage minister knew anything about Seagram's acquisition of 
MCA at the time of his meeting with the Bronfmans.
<P>
	In fact the Minister of Canadian Heritage was informed of the 
takeover by Allan Karp, the CEO of Cineplex-Odeon, more than 
two weeks before the backroom meeting. That makes the 
minister's actions even more reprehensible.
<P>
	Why was the industry minister not briefed on the heritage 
minister's meetings with Seagram?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not in the habit of seeking briefings on the 
heritage minister's meetings.
<P>
	Let me advise the hon. member that this infamous luncheon 
she is making a great deal of seemed to have quite a few people 
at it who are associated with a variety of companies in the Los 
Angeles area. Yes, Mr. Karp was present, as were officials from 
Canada. Also present were Mr. Jack Valenti of the Motion 
Picture Association of America; Lew Wasserman, chairman of 
the board of Music Corporation of America, Universal; Sid 
Scheinberg of Music Corporation of America, Universal; Bill 
Baker of Motion Picture Association of America, and on it goes. 
There were quite a lot of people at this secret meeting to 
somehow influence the decision of Investment Canada.
<P>
	These allegations are really not worthy of the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Industry has accused the opposition of focusing 
on personality because we cannot criticize the process.
<P>
	Let us look at the process. We have seen an unprecedented use 
of cabinet power. We have seen secret meetings and unlimited 
access being given to a favoured few.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Whether we look at Pearson, direct to home satellite or the 
Seagram takeover, the major players are all the same: 
Desmarais, John Rae, Bronfman, Rabinovitch and Goldenberg. 
The family compact indeed is alive and well.
<P>
	How can this government reassure Canadians that Investment 
Canada's decision will be free from political influence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us set a few facts straight from the beginning. Yes, 
the use of the direction by the government is unprecedented. It is 
a relatively recent power contained in the Broadcasting Act, as 
the hon. member knows.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11938"> 11938 </A></B>
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with the government having power to 
make policy. That is what we are elected to do, to establish 
policy. That is what our responsibility is, to establish policy, 
yes, for Canadians. That direction does not give anyone a 
licence. What it does is create a level playing field for 
competition where companies can apply to get a licence on fair 
terms.
<P>
	The government does not direct who gets a licence. The 
government does not tell the CRTC what to do. The government 
sets the policy direction. That is what our responsibility is.
<P>
	If the Reform Party is against competition, if Reform Party 
members do not care about the interests of consumers, let them 
stand up and say so. If they are interested in competition, let us 
hear one, just one, solitary, useful suggestion as to how we get 
competition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before he lost his temper, the Minister of Industry 
advised us to put our questions to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage when he arrived in the House. That is now the case.
<P>
	Therefore, considering the conflict of interest guidelines 
governing members of this government, the fact that the Power 
DirecTV case has indicated the existence of a very close 
relationship between this government and influential Liberals in 
the business community, including Paul Desmarais, father of the 
Prime Minister's son-in-law and a member of the board of 
directors of Seagram's, does the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
realize that his conduct has cast doubts on the integrity of the 
Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think we have explained many times why 
the government decided to table its proposed directives to the 
CRTC. We are talking about competition, Canadian content, 
transparency and the structure of the information highway. 
These are fundamental aspects of policy, and all interests in the 
information highway applauded this decision. They felt we were 
being open, frank and transparent, and by putting this before the 
House, we are giving all members of this august assembly an 
opportunity to express their views during a forty-day period, 
when there will be a discussion on DTH satellite services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is again directed to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. I hope the Solicitor General, who wanted to 
answer on his behalf, will let the minister answer the question.
<P>
	There is a lot to ask, but this question concerns the trip to Los 
Angeles and a visit to Mr. Bronfman's suite when the transaction 
took place. And we want to hear what the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage has to say about that.
<P>
	After his performance in the Ginn Publishing case, after the 
disturbing letters he wrote to the CRTC, after making certain 
statements that came back to haunt him, after his betrayal of 
commitments he made to the CBC and his abdication of his 
mandate in his handling of the Power DirecTV case, does the 
minister still have the courage to do the honourable thing and 
resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's performance is 
reminiscent of the best horror movies.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	What the Minister of Canadian Heritage was doing in Los 
Angeles was defending and promoting the interests of the film 
industry in Canada. I have always said that content was 
important on the information highway, and I am responsible for 
promoting that content.
<P>
	In the past few months I conducted extensive consultations 
with the industries concerned in Canada, and our conclusion was 
that it was advisable to meet the main competitors and also to 
look into opportunities for co-operation. That is what I did when 
I went to Los Angeles.
<P>
	I may add that I never was in the suite next door to a certain 
gentleman referred to by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister stated that the heritage minister has no 
role to play regarding the Seagram acquisition and that Industry 
Canada is dealing with the issue on its own. Despite this, 
Investment Canada officials confirm that they have already had 
discussions with heritage officials regarding the Seagram file.
<P>
	If Investment Canada is to work on its own and if heritage has 
no role to play, why are this minister's officials consulting with 
heritage officials? Why is it the minister does not seem to know 
about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I gave that impression in my answer yesterday, then I 
was wrong.
<P>
	To be exact about it, on the issue of whether Seagram is a 
Canadian corporation, heritage has no role to play. That is a 
determination made by the acting president of Investment 
Canada. If the transaction is reviewable by Investment Canada, 
then it does become an acquisition in the cultural sector. With 
respect to that decision, which is a decision I would make, I 
would consult in the normal manner with the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and officials would consult with each other.
<P>
	What I was endeavouring to explain was that at this stage we 
do not have an application under review because we are still at 
the stage of satisfying ourselves as to whether or not Seagram is 
a Canadian corporation.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="11939"> 11939 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps we should mark this day on the calendar. It is 
the first day I am aware of that a minister across the way has 
admitted to being wrong.
<P>
	Given the talks with heritage officials and given the heritage 
minister's meeting with the Bronfmans, how can the minister 
deny that he has allowed Investment Canada's decision to be 
tainted by the appearance of undue influence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not see it as a tainting of the transaction 
whatsoever.
<P>
	As I indicated in my earlier answer, as did the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, a visit to a group of industry people in Los 
Angeles is in the normal course. I must say that as industry 
minister it is common for me to meet with representatives of 
companies and industrial groups on a daily basis. It is part of our 
normal activities. It is one of the ways in which we do our jobs. 
That is normal. The fact that a transaction may come forward is 
still hypothetical.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member, as I did earlier, that our 
objective as a government, in the event the transaction is 
reviewable, will be to secure improved undertakings on the part 
of MCA to make the transaction of greater benefit to Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the heritage minister put himself in a conflict 
of interest by making a secret trip to Los Angeles, to meet 
Liberal friends conducting a megatransaction which involves 
Canadian cultural interests and which will require Investment 
Canada's approval.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage tell the House if he 
used a government aircraft and will he also tell us who 
accompanied him on that trip out west?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for this opportunity 
to provide him with answers on issues which seem to concern 
him a great deal. I certainly did not use a government aircraft. In 
fact, I always avoid doing so, for financial reasons.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	When in Los Angeles, I had no contacts with Canadian private 
interests trying to conclude a transaction to take over MGM. 
True, I did go to Universal studios with officials from MGM, 
Disney, Sony and Motion Picture Association of America, 
including its president, Jack Valenti. The purpose of my visit 
was strictly to explore possibilities with the heads of these 
American majors. Neither the agenda of this meeting, nor the 
discussions which I had with these American studios had 
anything to do with a transaction which I did not know about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
answer just provided by the Minister of Canadian Heritage, I 
will direct my supplementary to the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	How does the Minister of National Defence explain the fact 
that, this morning, his department refused to release 
information concerning the use of Challenger jets by cabinet 
members during that period, this at the specific request of the 
Prime Minister's office? What is the Minister of National 
Defence also trying to hide?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member obviously does not know the procedure for reporting 
the use of government jets. Every month the use of jets is made 
public.
<P>
	We have lots of calls on lots of issues. That information will 
be public within 30 days. There have been no complaints about 
the procedure.
<P>
	I find it rather odd the member would raise it in this context. 
My officials were absolutely correct in saying to the member 
that they could not give the information to him today, because 
there is an established procedure and it is working.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
process in the Seagram deal stinks to high heaven.
<P>
	The ADM for heritage responsible for the file is linked to the 
Bronfmans through family ties. Investment Canada has 
confirmed that Rabinovitch's people have contacted it on the 
issue. This is a blatant conflict of interest.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Canadian Heritage fail to see that 
his department's continued contacts with industry officials and 
with the Bronfmans jeopardize the integrity of the process and 
of the Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should like to make clear in the House that 
I never met Mr. Bronfman on the occasion of the visit I paid to 
Los Angeles.
<P>
	I learned of the transaction as I was walking from the aircraft. 
My meeting was an hour or two afterward. It is not unusual, 
bearing in mind that these transactions are highly secretive 
because of market conditions.
<P>
	As to the responsibility for Investment Canada and a 
declaration on whether a certain company is Canadian or 
American, this is entirely within the responsibility of the 
Minister of Industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11940"> 11940 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
is an amazing coincidence and probably one without precedent 
in the country.
<P>
	The minister has denied that there has been any wrongdoing 
on the Seagram file. Yet his officials have been in contact with 
industry officials and are still in contact with and linked to the 
Bronfmans. Surely the minister has been briefed on the contacts.
<P>
	Is the minister suggesting that it is appropriate for his 
officials to continue contacting industry officials who are in 
constant contact with principals of the Seagram deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is difficult to understand an allegation of wrongdoing 
``on the Seagram file'' when so far nothing has been done on the 
Seagram file.
<P>
	I state again very clearly that the threshold issue is whether or 
not Seagram is a Canadian controlled corporation. That is a 
matter entirely within the determination of the acting president 
of Investment Canada, based on criteria set out in the act. That 
determination will be made based upon information we obtain 
from Seagram or its counsel. The next stage would be a review 
under the Investment Canada Act of whether the transaction is 
of net benefit to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I suspect the hon. member wants to say that he does not think 
Heritage Canada, Investment Canada and Industry Canada will 
act in the best interest of Canada in reviewing the transaction. 
That is an extreme allegation. I invite him to make such 
allegations in a public forum where he is subject to all 
disciplines of civil law. I would ask him, if he is going to say 
things like that, to provide real evidence rather than just 
innuendo.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am feeling sick to my stomach, but I will nevertheless 
put my question to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	In the endless series of intimate relations this government has 
with the extended Liberal family, the matter of Power DirecTv 
continues to raise a number of questions about the actual 
involvement of the Prime Minister and his entourage.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Industry, the self-styled champion of 
transparency, tell us clearly when the Prime Minister informed 
him that he did not want to be involved in any way with Power 
DirecTv in which his son-in-law has interests? When did the 
Prime Minister tell him, about that, exactly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	It bears repetition that the Prime Minister has restated in the 
House, as he did among ministers, that he did not wish to be 
involved in the file or have any knowledge directed to him about 
it. That being the basis upon which the entire transaction has 
occurred, I have never had a discussion with the Prime Minister 
about the file.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to understand that these are the kinds 
of indications we are receiving from disinterested people who 
are concerned about the issue. The Consumers' Association of 
Canada: ``I am writing to you on behalf of the Consumers' 
Association to urge the government to act upon the 
recommendations of the policy review panel''; ACTRA: ``We 
are pleased with the recognition of the need for competition 
among services. We hope the government will move quickly''; 
the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting; the Canadian Conference 
of the Arts; and all the others.
<P>
	The simple point is that the Prime Minister has acted with 
entire integrity, discretion and care in the matter to avoid any 
appearance of potential conflict. For the government to have 
failed to take its responsibility-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I must ask that 
both the responses and the questions be somewhat briefer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Industry would surely be held in higher 
esteem if he answered the question.
<P>
	And so I ask him: Given that the government decided on 
September 12, 1994 to overturn the decision of the CRTC, which 
did not serve the interests of the Prime Minister's son-in-law, 
-and I want it to be very clear-would the Minister of Industry 
show us today, from his seat, the memorandum he received from 
the Prime Minister asking to be completely kept out of the 
government's decisions in this matter?
<P>
	Can the sponsor of the Lobbyists Registration Act table the 
memorandum that will enable us to understand and shed some 
light on this matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I never had any discussions with the Prime Minister 
about the file. There was nothing to visit.
<P>
	Let me complete the statement I was making. In the face of the 
urging such as I was indicating to the hon. member, the 
government would have failed many groups in society, many 
consumers, all the interests crying out for competition and 
choice in the area, if it had failed to act.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	On Wednesday major oil companies raised the price of gas 
again, this time by 5 cents per litre in the national capital region. 
This makes for a 20 per cent increase in just one month.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These unacceptable increases in the price of gasoline in the 
Ottawa region worry and shock local MPs and consumers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What does the minister intend to do to stop the constant abuse 
of price hikes by major oil companies in the national capital 
region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my day again.
<P>
	I am pleased the hon. member raised the issue with respect to 
the national capital region. However, whether it is in the 
national capital region, remote communities of northern Ontario 
or the farmers of Saskatchewan, everywhere across the country, 
même au Québec, même dans l'Ouest, consumers are concerned 
that gasoline prices seem to go up without explanation.
<P>
	The best solution in this sector as well as in others that we 
have talked about is competition, real competition. As we 
complete our review of some of the useful proposals we received 
on whistleblowing legislation and other measures, I hope we 
will find tools to ensure oil companies and distributors of 
gasoline products are respectful of the need for real competition 
in the sector and the need of consumers to have cheaper 
gasoline.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the simple point is that this is not an issue about competition. 
This is an issue about ethics, about Liberal friends helping 
Liberal friends and family. It is the family compact.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Did he 
meet with the principals of the Seagram deal and Investment 
Canada officials prior to the announcement of the acquisition? 
Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had absolutely no contact or anything to do 
with whatever the Seagram corporation wants to do in the 
United States.
<P>
	This is of no concern to me. They have proceeded with the 
appropriate secrecy and the risk taking involved. I only heard 
the rumour that there might be an acquisition a day or so before 
the acquisition was announced. It was from the press that I 
learned of such an acquisition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
asked the hon. minister for an answer of yes or no. I did not get 
that answer.
<P>
	I will ask the question again. Did the heritage minister meet 
with the principals of the Seagram deal and Investment Canada 
prior to the acquisition? Yes or no.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister maintains that he did not put himself in a 
conflict of interest regarding Power DirecTv and continues to 
purport that he stayed at arm's length of the deal.
<P>
	Now, the Minister of Industry said, in reply to my colleague's 
question, that he did not discuss the issue with the Prime 
Minister. That is what he claims. But we now know, and the 
Minister of Industry himself even admits it, that Eddie 
Goldenberg, the Prime Minister's senior policy advisor, was 
kept abreast of developments on the matter.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry confirm that the departments of 
Canadian Heritage and Industry sent copies of all of the 
correspondence they exchanged regarding the Power DirecTv 
deal to the Prime Minister's senior policy advisor, Eddie 
Goldenberg?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Really, Mr. 
Speaker, so what? Management of an important file would be 
expected. In the context of conversation it would be normal, 
among other things, that what the government is doing with 
respect to a file would be told to the Prime Minister's office.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	What I think is important here and the question the member 
should be asking is whether on behalf of the Prime Minister the 
principal secretary endeavoured to influence the decisions 
ministers were taking.
<P>
	Mr. Goldenberg communicated two things, that the Prime 
Minister did not want to be involved in any way in the file, and 
neither did he.

the way the minister acknowledges the direct link between the 
Prime Minister and his information sources is just incredible.
<P>
	Given the admission that the Prime Minister's senior policy 
advisor, Eddie Goldenberg, was kept up-to-date on the matter 
affecting the Prime Minister's son-in-law, will the Minister of 
Industry admit that he and the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
were players in the Prime Minister's charade, in which he used 
his senior policy advisor to achieve indirectly what the law 
prohibits him from doing directly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had a little trouble hearing the member's question.
<P>
	If I recall, the hon. member is a former or perhaps a 
continuing actor. I would like to read to him what the president 
of ACTRA wrote to us on this: ``We are particularly pleased with 
the recognition of the need for competition among services and 
for an equitable contribution from revenues to be directed 
toward production and administered at arm's length from 
carriers. We hope the Government of Canada will move quickly 
to enunciate policy which will lead to the implementation of 
these principles''.
<P>
	In this case we have initiated a process which is open and 
transparent and subject to discussion in Parliament. Process is 
the rule of law and it is the way to ensure avoidance of conflict of 
interest, which is what we are doing.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

affairs in the Department of Canadian Heritage is Victor 
Rabinovitch.
<P>
	Mr. Rabinovitch is directly responsible for the Seagram's file. 
His brother Robert, who wrote the DTH satellite directive, 
works for the Bronfmans.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of Canadian Heritage allowing this 
sensitive issue to be handled by someone who is in a direct 
conflict of interest?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of a Seagram's file in my 
department. The issues are related to Investment Canada, not to 
Heritage Canada. Therefore, there is no reason our colleague 
should be so concerned.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry keeps saying 
nothing is being done on the Seagram's file. We hear the 
heritage minister denying there is even a Seagram's file.
<P>
	If that is the case, why is Investment Canada seeking a legal 
opinion of the Seagram's acquisition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Investment Canada Act creates a regime under 
which certain transactions are reviewable. The first requirement 
is that the acquiring corporation be non-Canadian.
<P>
	Therefore, we do not know until we determine in this 
particular case whether Seagram is Canadian or non-Canadian 
and whether there is a reviewable transaction under the 
Investment Canada Act.
<P>
	What I said was not that nothing was being done on this file 
but that nothing has been done because her colleague accused 
the government of wrongdoing on this file. Nothing has been 
done. The issue is open and under consideration by the acting 
president of Investment Canada. We will be obtaining 
information from the file in Investment Canada that will deal 
with it because the transaction is located in Investment Canada.
<P>
	However, until all of the facts have been obtained we cannot 
say there is a reviewable transaction. Therefore, the issues of net 
benefit to Canada are not yet under discussion.

there may be loopholes in the regulations governing the goods

for the continued interest she shows in tax fairness.
<P>
	There are specific provisions in the GST legislation which do 
provide for a notional input tax credit. This credit in turn allows 
registered car dealers to compete at the same level as private 
sellers who are not GST registrants.
<P>
	The department monitors and investigates any indication or 
reports of any abuse of the notional input tax credit and I can 
assure the hon. member that we have, as a result of her

scandal, because it is also a scandal for women.
<P>
	All Canadians and Quebecers are going to look a little silly 
this week-end. The Minister of Immigration's stubbornness will 
prevent Ms. Hafsa Zinaï Koudil, a filmmaker of Algerian origin, 
from participating in the Montreal festival ``Vues d'Afrique'', 
which will feature her movie ``Le Démon au féminin'' decrying 
the violent way religious fundamentalists in Algeria treat 
women.
<P>
	How can the acting Prime Minister justify the Minister of 
Immigration's obstinate refusal to grant a visitor's visa to 
filmmaker Koudil?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, officials 
must follow the law when making any decision to accept or 
refuse a request for visa. This is something the hon. member 
knows well.
<P>
	I have been asked by the minister to encourage both the 
member and the person in question to reapply, to submit any new 
information. Departmental officials are bound to uphold the

my question is directed to the Minister of Industry. Over the past 
few days gas stations across Canada have increased their prices 
by as much as 10 cents a litre without justification.
<P>
	This is the sixth price increase in the last 11 months, 
representing more than a 25 per cent increase to consumers and a 
40 per cent increase to oil companies' revenues after record 
profits last year. These increases will cost Canadians over $3 
billion each year and will hurt business, agriculture and 
consumers, basically our entire economy.
<P>
	Failing a voluntary rollback by the oil companies of these 
unfair increases, will the government act to protect consumers 
by rolling back these costly increases until a price review can be 
conducted to see if these price increases are justifiable?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question and I recognize the 
continuing work he has put into this matter of raising the 
attention of the Canadian public to the level of gas prices in 
Canada. He has worked very hard.
<P>
	As he knows from the answer I gave to our colleague from 
Carleton-Gloucester, I share his concern about the apparently 
inexplicable increase in prices that Canadians have experienced 
and from coast to coast are complaining about.
<P>
	As to his suggestion of regulation of prices, this is not 
something I favour. I do not believe that to regulate prices, 
either to roll them back or to tell companies what they should 
charge for the goods or services they provide, is the best way for 
consumers ultimately to enjoy lower prices.
<P>
	The real solution is real and sustained competition.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LOBBYISTSREGISTRATIONACT">LOBBYISTS REGISTRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act and to 
make related amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before question period, I started pointing out the flaws 
in Bill C-43. I mentioned the staging of the ethics counsellor's 
appointment and the authority he was supposed to have. I 
highlighted the discrepancies in the Liberal position and their 
about face regarding several points, including the different 
categories of lobbyists.
<P>
	One will recall that the Liberals, when they were in the 
opposition, wanted to have only one category for lobbying 
because, in their opinion, lobbying was lobbying.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	But once they came to power, their friends, probably the ones 
who fund their electoral campaigns, told them: ``No, no, no! We 
would rather it stay the same, with three different categories''. 
So, the Liberals reviewed their position and now, Bill C-43 
meets the lobbyists' demands, maintaining three categories.
<P>
	Before question period, I was dealing with the third flaw I 
found in Bill C-43. In total, there are eight major flaws which 
were deliberately introduced with a view not to reach the stated 
goal of Bill C-43, which is transparency. The third flaw I found 
has to do with the compulsory filing of a return. As I mentioned 
earlier, the scandal regarding Pearson airport, in Toronto, is 
ample proof of how lax the present rules are in this area.
<P>
	One will recall that the privatization contract was signed at 
the height of the federal electoral campaign, in 1993, and that 
subsequently an inquiry looked into that deal. The Nixon report, 
issued on November 29, 1993, revealed several instances of 
misconduct on the part of lobbyists, officials and political aids 
to the ministers concerned. The report raised several other 
questions which have remained unanswered to this day. For 
example, who are the lobbyists who contravened the most 
elementary rules of ethics? When did these events occur? How 
did they act illegally or unlawfully? Who are the officials and 
political staff members who went too far in this matter?
<P>
	The Liberal government did not answer those questions. They 
chose to close their eyes to such stratagems which undermine 
the credibility of our democratic institutions. Most 
unfortunately, Bill C-43 offers nothing new. We remain totally 
in the dark. The clique exercising such undue influence will 
continue to have its way, and that is terrible. While they were in 
the  opposition, members of government had promised they 
would bring transparency into this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11946"> 11946 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Liberals were serious about transparency for all 
government undertakings, why do they now refuse to force 
lobbyists to indicate which contracts they are trying to 
influence the federal administration on? Furthermore, why do 
they refuse to disclose which contracts are attributed in a 
discretionary fashion, without any call for tenders? I regret that 
the Liberals absolutely refuse to shed any kind of light on this 
issue.
<P>
	If the Liberal government were really serious when it talks 
about integrity and transparency, would it not demand that 
lobbyists also disclose their fees? I learned, through the 
Minister of Industry, that in Ottawa, some lobbyists charge up to 
$5,000 a day to negotiate small arrangements with government.
<P>
	In such a case, people have the right to know who is paying 
this kind of money, who has an interest great enough to pay up to 
$5,000 a day to have a minister or the government change its 
position or decision. But no, Bill C-43 says nothing about that.
<P>
	When they were on this side of the House, the Liberals were in 
favour of such disclosure. They thought, quite appropriately, 
that lobbyists should disclose their fees. I will give you specific 
examples of Liberal members who have changed their tune since 
they took office.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, and 
government whip, said on February 2, 1993: ``In other words, 
the public has the right to know who does what and for whom, 
and at what cost''. When in opposition, that is what they were 
asking the government. Put even more eloquently, on February 
16, 1993, the current Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry said, about the disclosure of lobbyists' fees: ``One of 
the reasons I stand firm on the issue of disclosure is that your 
organization does not work only in the area of politics. You now 
have a polling department and a media relations unit. Your 
organization''-he was answering someone in committee and 
knew what he was talking about-``has a strong influence not 
only on consumers but also on government and the media. In a 
town like ours you only have to be a few days in the press centre 
to have almost any idea accepted. One of the reasons I believe 
your fees must be disclosed is that it sometimes happens-Take 
the referendum for instance: millions of dollars have been put in 
the system by lobbying firms advocating a position while we 
knew almost nothing about them''.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the minister said only a few 
months ago that lobbyists fees had to be disclosed. Today in Bill 
C-43, the minister says that fees will not be disclosed. What did 
members say? What did the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister mention? I will not answer that question. I will not 
answer it because I find it deplorable that a member did not raise 
to express his concerns and or defend the ideas he had when he 
was  in the opposition. Power corrupts and gives Alzheimer's to 
Liberals.
<P>
	I would now like to refer to another issue over which the 
Liberals ranted and raved when they were in the opposition, and 
that is the contacts initiated by lobbyists with ministers and 
officials. They seem less concerned about that issue today, 
although the problem remains unsolved.
<P>
	Suppose that Bill C-43 had been in force during transactions 
which led to the contract to privatize Pearson airport. I often 
choose that example because it was a scandal known to all 
Canadians and to the Liberal themselves. The new registry 
would have told us on what contract a consultant lobbyist had 
worked, and that this lobbyist contacted the relevant 
department, in this case the Department of Transport. So what? 
Such are the changes brought about by Bill C-43. That is the 
information we would have.
<P>
	This new obligation to disclose is being presented as a bold 
move by the government and the Liberal majority in the 
committee. It goes without saying that, for the Bloc Quebecois, 
it is essentially pointless. It is obvious that a lobbyist trying to 
influence the government on an issue relating to the 
privatization of an airport would contact the Minister of 
Transport. That is obvious, we do not need a bill to know that; 
one does not have to be a rocket scientist to guess that.
<P>
	To really have transparency in its dealings, the government 
should have agreed to lobbyists revealing their meetings with a 
minister and the names of the senior officials involved. Bill 
C-43 should have required lobbyists to say they had contacted a 
given minister or a given senior official at a given time, that they 
had discussed a given issue, that they wanted the government to 
make a decision on a given subject. Bill C-43 does not say 
anything about that; it does not give us what we wanted.
<P>
	Such transparency would have helped to restore the integrity 
of institutions in people's minds. Once again, the government 
missed the boat. Once again, we proposed some amendments to 
this end, but the government said no to the transparency and the 
integrity proposed by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Also, why not require lobbyists to reveal their political ties? It 
would be interesting to know that a given lobbyist is employed 
by a given political party. It might be interesting to know that a 
given lobbyist had once been a candidate for a political party. It 
might be interesting to know that a given lobbyist is the 
president of an association or was a minister's chief campaign 
organizer. It might be interesting to know also that a given 
lobbyist gave $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000 to the Liberal Party's 
fundraising campaign. It would be interesting to know that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11947"> 11947 </A></B>
<P>
	But no. When the Liberals had trouble collecting a nickel, 
that was required from the government, the lobbyists had to 
reveal that. But now that they are in office, now that they have 
cocktails and luncheons at $1,000 and $2,000 a plate, they do 
not want this information. They have changed their tune.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Since time flies, I will not deal at length with the contingent 
fees some lobbyists ask from those who hire them. They say: I 
will charge you $5,000 an hour-as in the example given by the 
minister-to make representations to the government, and if 
you win your case, you will pay me $250,000 on top of my fees. I 
am using large figures to put my point across more clearly, but 
that is what is meant by contingent fees.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois thinks Bill C-43 should prohibit 
contingent fees. Of course, as you have seen, Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals rejected that amendment. However, witnesses who 
appeared before the committee said that contingent fees lead to 
scandals and influence peddling. The higher the contingent fees, 
the more forceful lobbyists will be in their representations to the 
minister and the more they will use all kinds of tactics. Today, 
the Liberals find that quite acceptable. It is not. Those are the 
kind of things they criticized when they were the opposition, but 
now that they are in power they are too busy at the trough and 
feel everything is fine. Such smoothies.
<P>
	I repeat that I could keep talking for hours on this important 
issue. As a matter of fact, it is so important that the committee 
heard about 80 witnesses. We received brilliant briefs. This was 
the third time a group of parliamentarians reviewed this issue. 
We have had the Cooper Report, we have had the Holtmann 
Report and now you have before you today the Zed Report.
<P>
	Three times, parliamentarians have said: ``We have to give 
teeth to the Lobbyists Registration Act''. And what do we have 
before us? A toothless bill, a spineless bill, that will not reach 
the goal of openness that had been set. There is nothing new in 
this bill, and scandals will occur again.
<P>
	Talking about scandals, about current events also, as you 
could see during question period, all kinds of revelations are 
being made. These issues have been raised for weeks now. We 
are not the only ones saying that there is something strange 
going on in the government machinery, something that is going 
wrong. Except of course for <I>The Gazette</I>. But nobody wonders 
why <I>The Gazette</I> is supporting the government.
<P>
	What all these elements are showing us I think is that there has 
never been such an urgent need for a bill to closely regulate the 
lobbyists. That is what current events show us, with the saga of 
patronage by the Liberal government in its policy on direct to 
home satellite broadcasting.
<P>
	Here is what Jean-Robert Sansfaçon wrote in today's <I>Le 
Devoir</I>: ``Seldom has the federal government been more 
obviously under remote control than with this decision to 
suspend the rules set out by the CRTC. This is an action whose 
only purpose is to allow onto the scene a certain player, none 
other than the company run by the Prime Minister's son-in-law, 
André Desmarais. Once more, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, Michel Dupuy, looks like a puppet, unable to apply 
either the letter or the spirit of the Canadian Broadcasting Act''.
<P>
	All that has been done through lobbying, meetings and visits 
with the minister. And all that is the doing of the powerful 
PowerCorp lobby.
<P>
	We now have Bill C-43 before us. It could not have come at a 
more appropriate juncture. We have the proof we need to say 
that with Bill C-43 as enacted, as drafted, nothing will change 
and scandals as those we have witnessed this week will occur 
again, and our questions will never get answered. We will never 
really know what guided the minister in his decisions, his visits, 
his meetings, etc. That is a true scandal.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an 
honour to be able to rise in this esteemed House, the one to 
which all of us were elected to represent the people of Canada, to 
address the question of lobbyists.
<P>
	I will begin by commending my colleague from the Bloc who 
just spoke. He presented a very good case and I very much 
appreciate the points which he raised.
<P>
	I would also like to comment briefly on the process we went 
through. As most members know, this was the first bill that went 
through the new process of going to committee after first 
reading. As I have said previously in this House, I found that 
experience both frustrating and rewarding.
<P>
	It was rewarding in the sense that we had a very amiable 
chairman. I have said that before and he usually grins when I say 
that, and I give him that compliment again. I also got to know 
and to like all of the members on the committee. It was a very 
good, free and easy exchange.
<P>
	We were assured during that process that we could think out 
loud. We could bring out ideas which perhaps we did not really 
espouse but we wanted to raise as questions. What would happen 
if we did this or what would happen if we did that? Being a 
neophyte, I thought that was a wonderful way of discussing and 
debating. I thought that we were going to get a really good bill 
out of this process and I was very enthused for most of it.
<P>
	We had excellent witnesses. Again, I would like to go on 
record as commending them. They did a good job in presenting 
their cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11948"> 11948 </A></B>
<P>
	Underlying all if it, I always wondered whether we really 
needed the lobbyists. As a matter of fact, if I can express my 
naivety, I came to Ottawa as a new MP in the fall of 1993 
thinking that strictly speaking lobbyists are redundant and they 
should not be here. To a large degree I still think that way.
<P>
	That reminds me of a story my assistant shared with me about 
a problem with some ravens that apparently had pretty well 
taken over the city of Ottawa. The ravens were becoming a real 
nuisance. They not only messed up cars, they occasionally 
attacked children and on occasion even, shall we say, bombed 
some public officials. That is when action had to be taken.
<P>
	The mayor of this esteemed city put out a call saying that there 
would be a $5,000 reward for anyone who could get rid of all of 
the ravens. Lo and behold someone from the country said to the 
mayor: ``I will solve your problem but it will cost you $5,000''. 
The mayor said that very well, it was worth it because when that 
last official got bombed by one of the ravens that was the end of 
it.
<P>
	The young man had a cage which contained a blue raven. He 
went to where all of the other ravens were, opened the door and 
let the blue raven out. That blue raven somehow attracted all of 
the other ravens and they flew together out of town and were 
never seen again.
<P>
	The mayor said to the person: ``Here is your $5,000, but I have 
a question for you: Do you have any blue lobbyists?''
<P>
	That is a question. Should we get rid of all of the lobbyists? 
Should we get one of them to take the rest of them out of town?
<P>
	I will admit that I underwent a minor change in my thinking 
during the work on this committee. I met different people and 
different groups and particularly, certain professional 
associations, business and industry associations which came to 
make presentations before us. In fact, they were quite successful 
in convincing us of their importance. I will not mention any of 
them specifically by name.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Certainly, just as what happens in this place deeply affects 
citizens, it also affects groups of citizens, businesses and 
different professions. Therefore, for the government to have 
some kind of an interface with an association of all of the 
dentists in the country instead of having to deal with each one 
individually probably has some merit.
<P>
	Another one that comes to mind is a presentation that we had 
from an association of the forestry industry. In this particular 
instance public policy measures of taxation, environment 
protection and so on impact greatly not only on the industry's 
ability to do business in this country but also on its ability to 
compete worldwide, a factor which is ever more present with us.
<P>
	Consequently, I came to the conclusion after thinking about 
this that there probably was some justification for these people 
to be represented by a smaller association which would 
specialize in making their views known to the government.
<P>
	I still think though that for the bulk of public policy issues, 
lobbyists should be unnecessary. As a matter of fact, as a 
member of Parliament I am frequently asked whether I will meet 
with this or that group. I have several rules. One rule is that I 
usually respond by saying that I do not meet with lobbyists. My 
constituents, the people who elected me, are my lobbyists. They 
are the ones I am here to represent.
<P>
	I have a few little subrules as well. If a lobbyist group comes 
to see me and one of the delegation members comes from my 
constituency, I do not care what their issue or cause is, they 
automatically have an in. I will never refuse to talk to any 
member of the Elk Island constituency for any reason.
<P>
	I also have a couple of other little subrules. Occasionally 
there are groups that have done a lot of research and are 
specialists in their field. If they can increase my understanding 
from a technical point of view or from the government impact 
point of view on the wider population not just in my 
constituency but throughout the whole country and I have an 
opportunity to learn something, I will not deny that opportunity.
<P>
	Therefore, I have had the opportunity to deal with a number of 
lobbyists directly. In most instances I have appreciated this.
<P>
	We need to talk about this bill because it seems to be a 
foregone conclusion that the work of the MP is not effective. I 
hate to stand up and say this. I know that in a way I am 
impugning all of my colleagues, myself included, and certainly 
all of the backbenchers on the government side. It is true that our 
access to the decision making loop really is limited.
<P>
	I was interested and paid close attention to the minister's 
speech this morning. I am going to respond to a few things he 
said. Among other things, he indicated that it was the 
government's goal to give MPs a greater role. I wrote that down. 
I remember reading that in the red book during the election 
campaign. I must confess that I never did read the whole book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> That was your first mistake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> I read enough to get the gist of it. However, I do 
remember reading this part. I was afraid that perhaps we would 
not win the election. If the Liberals had as their platform a 
greater role for the MPs and limiting lobbyists and so on, they 
were stealing our platform and maybe the people would believe 
them and elect them and then we would not win.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11949"> 11949 </A></B>
<P>
	Well it so happens that despite that, I did in fact win in the Elk 
Island constituency. When I was asked to be on this committee it 
was great. It was something I really believed in and would be 
able to work on.
<P>
	The minister this morning made reference to the specific 
statement that there would be a greater role for MPs. Frankly I 
have not observed it. I observe that decisions are still made 
mostly in the offices of upper level government officials in the 
departments, the top bureaucrats, in consort with deputy 
ministers and ministers. For ordinary people, including 
members of Parliament, to break into that loop is difficult. I 
understand it is almost as difficult for members on the 
government side as it is for those in opposition.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	We all have influence. I am aware that Liberal members have 
influence in their caucus. However there would be no lobbyists 
if the people were able to successfully promote their views of 
what kind of country they would like and what our public 
policies should be. Their MPs are free. Well, they are not free. 
Taxpayers pay very handsomely for them, including the MPs' 
pension plan to which the government so eagerly hangs on. 
There is no additional or incremental cost to someone who wants 
to send a message to government if they do it via their member 
of Parliament.
<P>
	That lobbyists exist is mute testimony to the fact that many 
people, being pragmatic, recognize that if they want to have 
their issues heard, they know that is how they have to do it.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about the changes we have 
produced to the bill. It was a good experience in the committee 
to propose amendments and to talk about them. Many of them 
were done before there ever were any clauses.
<P>
	The final clauses were done quite unofficially without formal 
amendments. Then we began the process of formal amendments. 
You must remember, Mr. Speaker, as in the House, the 
committee is made up of a majority of members from the 
government side. The member for the Bloc and myself 
representing the opposition were, shall we say, considerably 
outnumbered.
<P>
	I will say to the credit of the government members there that 
we did have an open discussion. We were heard. For the most 
part there was a high level of respect. I really appreciate the 
relationship that developed and the ease with which we were 
able to discuss things.
<P>
	Then my hon. colleague from the Bloc, as he mentioned in his 
speech, proposed a large number of amendments. Those 
amendments were uniformly declined by the members on the 
government side. I was very disappointed. The House has 
already heard the member for the Bloc speak today. He 
described his amendments and their justification. Certainly 
there was justification for that. The government lost a great deal 
because it failed to put those into the bill and therefore they will 
not become law. That was very frustrating.
<P>
	Then I brought in a number of amendments. As you know, 
Madam Speaker, we voted on those several evenings ago. I felt 
badly about it. It was due to the many amendments we brought 
forward from our party that all of us had to sit here for about an 
hour doing all of those votes. In order to maintain my integrity I 
had to bring those forward. I had to make sure that the 
government would go on record as saying ``yes, we want these'' 
or ``no, we do not'', just so the lines could be clearly defined.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased. As far as I know it is a record that two opposition 
amendments were accepted. I believe it is the first time that 
opposition amendments at report stage in this Parliament have 
been accepted. They were very good amendments, not because I 
brought them but because they were well supported. It shows 
they were logical and represented the wishes of the people. It 
was very gratifying to have those amendments passed.
<P>
	A number of the amendments we made were declined by the 
government. Unfortunately this is going to be the proof of the 
pudding. This is going to be the Achilles heel of the government, 
where given an opportunity to really increase openness and 
transparency it declined the opportunity.
<P>
	I do not want to be only negative. I said when I was elected a 
member of the opposition, not only would I criticize when 
things were wrong but that I would also try to give accolades 
when things were good.
<P>
	Some things in the Lobbyists Registration Act are fairly 
positive, for instance, the increase in the disclosure 
requirements. If people now want to know who is lobbying who, 
they will know more than before Bill C-43 is passed. I presume 
it will be passed next week because of the Liberal majority.
<P>
	The Reform Party thinks it is important for members of 
coalitions to be represented and registered so that if there is an 
association, its registration indicates all its member 
organizations.
<P>
	We believe it is important, and this was our amendment, a 
very significant one, that when a lobbyist or association or 
corporation they represent receives direct government funding 
it also be disclosed.
<P>
	I was asked about that not long ago by a member of the media. 
I said it really is stage one. Once Canadians find out that they are 
funding groups whose business it is to step in front of ordinary 
citizens in order to try to influence government, that funding 
will soon cease because of public pressure. Obviously there has 
not been the political will to stop funding lobby groups at this 
stage. Now that will be disclosed and people will be able to 
know exactly how much the government is spending on funding 
these various organizations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11950"> 11950 </A></B>
<P>
	When people know I am sure they will start sending their 
politicians a message that says stop funding them. That is our 
goal. There is no doubt in my mind that a lobbyist group should 
be funded by the people they purport to represent. If they do, 
they have full legitimacy.
<P>
	A group whose first lobbying function is to lobby the 
government for its own funding so that it can continue to exist 
and then purport to represent a whole bunch of people is just not 
authentic. It totally minimizes its effectiveness and is a waste of 
money, besides being an aberration in the democratic process.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the bill provides for the electronic 
filing of returns. One of the things we heard is that more and 
more government is intruding on our lives. It is making report 
filing more difficult. Certainly Canadians are very aware of that 
at this time of the year.
<P>
	Under the Lobbyists Registration Act lobbyists can register 
and complete their information electronically so it is less 
onerous. It was a very fine idea to have the time of registration 
extended. Most of the time it is not urgent for these registrations 
be filed immediately, when the activity is taking place.
<P>
	To ask for a final disclosure does two things. It is now 
required that every six months they bring their file up to date. 
What makes this good is knowing that it has to be disclosed is in 
itself a form of control. I think of it the same as when I do my 
work as a member of Parliament. I try to keep in the back of my 
mind the objective that we need to write and behave in such a 
way that anything ever made public will not bring us into 
disrepute. If we adopt that attitude, ultimately the people of 
Canada will be the judges. Then we will have a good process.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I need to criticize a little bit. The minister took the occasion in 
his speech this morning to deal at length with the question of 
restoring trust and confidence. He talked a bit about some of the 
current issues. I asked a question and he made a comment that: 
``The member for Elk Island cannot wait to have his say''. It is 
true. I was trying to get his attention. He was talking about the 
current problem and giving the government's point of view.
<P>
	I was trying to get something from the minister but 
unfortunately he did not respond. How does Bill C-34 solve the 
problem? I was not heckling him. I was simply trying to get his 
attention. The minister ignored that and proceeded with his 
statement, which is fine. In his speech time he is entitled to 
finish what he has to say.
<P>
	The reason he could not answer is because Bill C-34 will not 
solve the problems that come before the House from time to 
time, including the current questions before the House. We all 
know what they are.
<P>
	Issues that are important here are openness and 
accountability, showing that things are being done right. We 
could have a situation where things are not being done right and 
if people never find out about it, they will continue to be done in 
the wrong way. If we have an openness, a transparency-that is a 
word which means we can see through things, we can see right to 
the back of it-then these kinds of problems and issues could be 
put to rest reasonably quickly.
<P>
	I do not believe there is sufficient meat in Bill C-34 to achieve 
the goal. That is regrettable because it was an opportunity for all 
members of the House to assure the Canadian people that, in 
fact, their government is honest. I am not implying it is not. I am 
talking about the assurance part of it. Even if it is honest and if 
the people perceive differently, then the battle has not been won. 
It needs to be correctly communicated in such a way that it has 
credibility.
<P>
	Bill C-34 fails to do that for a few reasons. I will only have 
time to state a few of them. I want to use my time to talk later on 
about the big issue.
<P>
	First I would like to point out that the red book promised in the 
1993 election that the Holtmann report on lobbyists would be 
enacted. There are a number of areas where that has not been 
done. One explicit recommendation of the Holtmann report on 
lobbying, which was a couple of years ago, was that there should 
be an elimination of the tiers.
<P>
	I suppose a lobbyist is a lobbyist is a lobbyist. If the purpose is 
to either procure a government contract or to influence 
government policy, then they are lobbyists. From the taxpayers' 
and voters' point of view, it really does not matter whether the 
association hires an external lobbyist who goes to government 
or whether the association or organization sends one of their 
own. That tier distinction for most groups is irrelevant. In every 
instance a lobbyist is out to influence a government decision. 
We felt very strongly that the distinction between the tiers 
should be removed.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I will admit again that I went through a metamorphosis here. 
At one stage I thought that very strongly, and then for a while I 
was thinking there is some justification for having a 
differentiation and perhaps less onerous reporting requirements. 
However, with further reflection, thought, and analysis, I came 
back to the conclusion that indeed there should be open and full 
disclosure of all of them equally.
<P>
	Another problem is the definition of lobbyists. It is quite clear 
for association lobbyists and is included in the act that if they do 
lobbying for pay they are lobbyists and are required to register. 
However, the way C-34 is written for tier two lobbyists, the 
association ones, those who represent an organization from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11951"> 11951 </A></B>
<P>
within are only required to register if the lobbying activity, by 
some undefined definition, is significant.
<P>
	We think the word ``significant'' leaves it wide open. In fact, 
people could be lobbying for a fair amount of time, but if they do 
very much other work then this two or three day amount of 
lobbying could be interpreted as insignificant. But if that 
lobbying is done by a person who has high government contacts, 
perhaps just a one-hour or two-hour luncheon meeting could 
have tremendous impact on a government decision. For that not 
to be disclosed is again a breach of the confidence that Canadian 
taxpayers are expecting.
<P>
	Another issue we thought was very important is that there be a 
disclosure of political ties. This always comes up: So-and-so 
talked to so-and-so and got this achieved. Who did he or she 
know? What was the connection?
<P>
	I know we also attract a large number of people. Just as the 
Liberals have a large number of supporters, party members, 
people who work on campaigns, so do we. Anticipating that not 
long from now we are going to be on the government side, I 
welcome the disclosure; I welcome the fact that if some time we 
are over there, there should be a total disclosure of someone who 
has worked on our campaigns. What's to hide? Why should we 
try to deceive the Canadian people on an issue like that? That 
should have been included in this bill.
<P>
	We also believe that significant political contributions should 
be registered. We just pegged $1,000 as an arbitrary amount; 
that could be changed from time to time. But usually, if someone 
will put down a cheque for $1,000 they are more than just a 
casual supporter; they are usually people who are highly 
influential, or at least more influential in the party.
<P>
	We can see that following the election it could happen that 
those same people want to try to influence the government. I 
would like to recommend very strongly that this should be 
disclosed. Again, what's to hide?
<P>
	It has been a while since I have conducted 55-minute classes, 
so my voice is getting a little raspy. The difference is that when I 
used to teach at the technical institute my students paid attention 
and learned something. Now that was an unkind statement.
<P>
	There is one more flaw to discuss before getting to the next 
section. Another considerable flaw in this bill is that there is no 
requirement to disclose the name of the government official 
being lobbied. We require the name of the lobbyist; we require 
the name of the groups or associations that are represented. But 
all that needs to be said is that, for example, in the Pearson 
airport deal the Department of Transport was being lobbied, and 
I think it would be very useful for Canadian people who judge 
matters like this if they could have a clear indication of who in 
the department was being influenced.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about the ethics counsellor. There are 
other issues, but I am going to run out of time.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	To me, the ethics counsellor is the pivotal point of this whole 
bill. I would like to begin by commending the government for 
bringing in the position of an ethics counsellor. It was long 
overdue. I suppose we could applaud that and say to the Prime 
Minister and to the government that this is a step forward. 
Unfortunately, the position of the ethics counsellor will end up 
being the weakest point of the bill, and it did not have to be. This 
is most regrettable.
<P>
	The only time the ethics counsellor is needed is if there is a 
suspicion. Normally, if there are good relationships between 
companies or between associations and government, and there is 
no allegation of wrongdoing, the ethics counsellor can just sit in 
his office and go about his usual duties.
<P>
	I would reflect on what the minister spoke about this morning. 
He talked about the deal with the minister of heritage. He 
mentioned it at length this morning. When I was trying to get his 
attention as to what Bill C-43 would do about it, I was hoping he 
would say that the ethics counsellor will investigate and put the 
matter at rest. I was trying to give him an out, and he did not bite 
at the bait; he ignored it.
<P>
	That is a demonstration of the flaw in this bill. The minister 
did not recognize that in this particular case, where he claims 
over and over again that the minister did nothing wrong, the 
government did nothing wrong and the Prime Minister did 
nothing wrong, it is not convincing. It is the fox declaring 
loudly, ``I did not eat the chicken'', while the feathers are 
dangling from his mouth. Even if it is right, it requires 
independence to have credibility.
<P>
	When we form the government I will welcome an independent 
ethics counsellor. I want one. If there are allegations that are 
untrue, I want an ethics counsellor to be able to investigate and 
to declare to the Canadian people beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that there was not any kind of influence or pressure and that he 
has investigated and has found nothing wrong in order to clear 
the name.
<P>
	Under this bill the ethics counsellor is appointed by the Prime 
Minister, he answers to the Prime Minister, and he reports to this 
House through the registrar general. Everything is done through 
the government. Usually the allegations are of wrongdoing 
between a member of the government or a member of the 
bureaucracy. Any thinking person can see that if the ethics 
counsellor is appointed by and answerable to and through the 
government, any minister or the Prime Minister, he is basically 
unable to do his job. That is most unfortunate. It is most 
regrettable. That is the greatest missed opportunity in this bill, 
and it is the one I emphasize the most.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11952"> 11952 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to talk about both sides of this issue. When there 
is an allegation of wrongdoing there are really only two 
possibilities, with perhaps some interpretation along the 
spectrum in between. Let us consider the current issue that is 
before us in these dealings we have had during question period 
and in all of our debates this week. Either there is nothing 
wrong, as everybody over there keeps saying, or there is 
something wrong.
<P>
	First, I would like to deal with a supposition. Here is a 
hypothesis. Let us suppose that in fact there was something that 
was not right. I want to have an ethics commissioner who has 
total freedom to investigate and to declare to the public via this 
House directly that he has investigated and this and this and this 
is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The other hypothesis is that there is no wrongdoing. Under 
our present system and under the one proposed by this bill, if the 
ethnics counsellor investigates and then says there is nothing 
wrong, the people of Canada will say we are not really sure we 
can trust him. It is not because he has not done his job. The 
current person who holds that office is a person of high esteem 
and honour. I have no reason to be suspicious of him. However, 
the man is hampered in his ability to convince the people simply 
because he lacks the independence of being able to give an 
independent report. Even if he has done his very best, he is still 
seen by the people as possibly having been pressured or 
organized by the Prime Minister, because he is appointed by him 
and is answerable to him.
<P>
	We have had a number of cases in which we have asked for the 
ethics counsellor to investigate. The answer has been no, I am 
not going to ask him. We have gone on several occasions to the 
ethnics counsellor directly: ``Were you consulted? Have you 
investigated?'' The answer was ``No, I have not been asked''.
<P>
	It is true that right now the counsellor is somewhat inhibited 
because this act has not yet been proclaimed. When it is, I 
believe that his role will be somewhat strengthened. He will then 
be empowered to investigate, so that will strengthen his role 
compared to what it is right now. There is a plus, and once again 
I applaud the government for that plus.
<P>
	The negative end of it is that he is still required to table his 
reports, both the annual report and the reports as a result of an 
investigation, through the minister, the registrar general. This is 
ironic. I just point out a possible future flaw, a trap that will 
catch us. What happens if the registrar general, who is a member 
of this House, becomes the object of a suspicion and if the ethics 
counsellor does an investigation of that and then presents his 
report to the very minister he is investigating? Who will believe 
him? It does not matter what he says. He could say that 
everything is okay and no one will believe him. If he says that 
there is such and such a problem, of course that would be great. 
Then he would be believed.  But it would have greater 
authenticity if he could have the freedom to answer both ways.
<P>
	When I plead for the defeat of this bill based largely on the 
fact that the ethnics counsellor lacks independence, it is because 
I am looking forward to the day when I want him to have total 
freedom to convince the Canadian people that the allegations of 
wrongdoing are false. That is the motivation. There is nothing 
that is more important than that.
<P>
	We need to do everything possible to strengthen the 
legitimacy of the role of the ethics counsellor. I would like to 
add that the annual reports also should be given directly to this 
House.
<P>
	I think of a perfect analogy. When I go across the 
country-and I have not done too much of that, I have done most 
of my work in my Elk Island constituency-I visit other people 
in Saskatchewan and also in Manitoba. When I talk to them, one 
government official who has almost universal recognition and 
respect is the auditor general. The auditor general, because of 
the way he is appointed and the way he reports, is believed. 
There is no doubt that the flaw in this bill is that the ethnics 
counsellor will be hampered in his ability to provide believable 
reports simply because he lacks that independence.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my statements, Mr. Speaker, by 
saying simply that this to me is a broken promise. It is an 
opportunity missed. It is regrettable because, among other 
things, the red book stated it explicitly. On page 95 it states the 
ethics counsellor will report directly to Parliament. Had the 
government fulfilled its red book promise in this legislation it 
would have been a good response.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I know I cannot comment on votes. Therefore I will not say I 
regret my amendment was not passed. However, I really 
commend the positive parts of this bill but I regret we will not be 
able to support it because of these tremendously important flaws 
in it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened carefully to everything that has been 
said until now during the debate on the lobbyists registration 
system and I caught myself thinking that it is quite a paradox 
that, on this day, Friday, April 28, the House is at third reading 
of a bill which is at the very heart of our democracy while the 
government is linked to numerous nepotism and patronage 
scandals.
<P>
	This is really something else. I see that the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands wants to take part in this debate. It is 
also a paradox that he is allowed to speak without ever rising 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11953"> 11953 </A></B>
<P>
from his seat. Of course, Mr. Speaker, it is only through your 
kindness that we can hear what he is saying.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the importance of the 
lobbying issue. We are not saying that this is an easy question. 
We are not saying that this is a trivial issue. We are not saying 
that this is a futile issue, because it deals with the degree of 
openness the government is ready to allow.
<P>
	We must remember the words of the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm whose contribution to this debate was so 
enlightening.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Enlightening?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Yes, enlightening, and I am weighing my 
words. I want everyone to know that, were it not for the 
painstaking, relentless and honest work of the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm, this debate would never have reached the 
level of honesty, integrity and perceptiveness it has reached in 
this House.
<P>
	All this to say that the lobbying issue, as we all know, is linked 
to the willingness of our Parliament to ensure that government 
decisions, policies and guidelines are developed in the open. No 
wonder the public is asking for such a piece of legislation, for a 
tougher law, because the voters generally are much more 
interested nowadays in public affairs.
<P>
	Not only are people more interested in public affairs, but this 
reflex of our fellow citizens to want to know who makes the 
decisions, on whose behalf they are made and, of course, lastly, 
who tries to influence them is a very positive sign, a sign which 
we should welcome with great joy. In short, this bill ensures that 
all political decisions are taken openly and publicly.
<P>
	I had a friendly talk a little while ago with the government 
whip who is, it must be said, a seasoned parliamentarian, an 
experienced parliamentarian. This man, the governement whip, 
who is my friend notwithstanding, reminded me that he had 
spent 12 years in the opposition, a claim that not all 
parliamentarians can make. Remember the fight he waged when 
he was in the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I remember seeing him, of course, I was very young then, but 
being young is not a life long condition. I remember seeing him 
intervene virulently in this House and ask the government, 
which of course was Conservative at the time, as we know, to 
give Canadian democracy a tougher lobbyists registration act.
<P>
	What happened in the meantime, since we know that the 
government whip and his colleagues have not changed? How did 
these people who, when they were in the opposition, fought so 
hard for such a bill, come to present such a watered down 
version now that they form the government? This is a bill that 
could even be called insignificant.
<P>
	What happened? Of course, the Liberal Party, which is a 
continental party, formed the government. As we know, it is 
taboo for the Liberals to talk about adopting legislation on 
popular financing of political parties even though, for the sake 
of fairness, we would have been entitled to expect them to be 
logical with themselves. Considering the dynamics of politics, 
we can accept that the government would not bow to the wishes 
of the opposition, but it is beyond understanding that the 
Liberals would go so far as to disown their own past.
<P>
	It is beyond understanding and saddens us. Of course, we 
could argue that the role of the opposition is to criticize, but you 
know how the opposition has been responsible, enlightened and 
forward looking since October 1993. Finally, we turn to 
independent sources to see what is being said of the bill.
<P>
	I would like to quote someone who is very influential in 
Quebec, a journalist-and journalists, like lawyers, command 
some respect in our society-an intellectual and a graduate of 
ENAP who began to take an interest in questions of 
accountability.
<P>
	Let me quote Gilles Lesage, journalist at <I>Le Devoir.</I> He is a 
reporter for <I>Le Devoir</I>, a newspaper that the member for 
Kingston and the Islands should read more often. You will 
understand that a reporter for <I>Le Devoir</I> has no political 
ambitions. His criticism is essential to our democracy. I would 
like to read the first five lines, or so, from his article.
<P>
	Here is what Gilles Lesage, a moderate and respected figure, 
had to say. Allow me to quote him particularly for the benefit of 
the member for Kingston and the Islands. He said: ``As 
well-inspired as it may be, the bill does not even come close to 
fulfilling the promises made by the Liberals, even though the 
Liberal action plan for Canada was clear on the need to restore 
integrity in our parliamentary institutions''.
<P>
	Mr. Lesage was no doubt referring to the red book and to all 
the speeches made by the Liberal Party's big guns during the 
election campaign. They talked freely and openly about 
democracy, parliamentary integrity and transparency.
<P>
	But let us go back to what Gilles Lesage had to say. He said, 
and I quote: ``The action plan-still talking about the red 
book-suggested that Canadians should have the right to meet 
with ministers and senior officials or to be represented in their 
dealings with the government without having to pay lobbyist 
fees. It also promised a code of ethics, the appointment of an 
ethics counsellor reporting to Parliament and the 
implementation of the Holtmann parliamentary report from 
June 1993''.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	None of this is in this bill, except of course for the code of 
ethics. That is why Canadians are disappointed and that is why 
our institution is losing its credibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11954"> 11954 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals have always talked from both sides of their 
mouth, saying one thing when they are on the opposition side 
and something else when they are on the government side. This 
runs through the party's history. I could give other examples, but 
that is the kind of thing that has done the most damage to our 
democracy.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, being responsible in its role as the 
official opposition, has studied this issue with an open mind and 
with great interest. I think it is worth reminding my colleague, a 
newly elected member who will surely gain a lot of experience 
in this House, of the five points proposed by the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm who, as we know, did a superlative job on 
this issue. He was even quoted by journalist Gilles Lesage, who 
wrote: ``Mr. Michel Bellehumeur is suggesting five main 
amendments''-I hope the members of government are 
listening, especially their whip-``that is: the ethics code should 
be recognized as a statutory instrument; the ethics counsellor 
should be appointed by the House of Commons, not by the prime 
minister; lobbying fees and meetings with ministers and 
officials should be divulged; tax deductions for lobbying fees 
should be eliminated; and-last but not least-the distinction 
between categories of lobbyists should also be eliminated''.
<P>
	This is an outline of the legitimate claims put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois. For the main part, these claims also appeared in 
the red book, which fast became the black book to Canadians. 
Yet, all these undertakings did not last beyond the official 
opposition's coming to power.
<P>
	Let us examine each of these points more closely. As regards 
the ethics counsellor of course we should remember that the 
opposition had acquiesced to the suggestion made by the prime 
minister concerning the incumbent. We contributed and 
supported that appointment. The problem with the ethics 
counsellor is that we would have wanted him, considering the 
importance of his position, to be directly accountable to 
Parliament. That is neither unreasonable nor unrealistic and it 
would not require the government to go against its principles. 
Things are done that way in many situations where you want to 
give added importance to a certain position and elevate the 
debate.
<P>
	Take for example the Chief Electoral Officer who has to be 
appointed by the House on the basis of a large consensus. We 
should also recall that in most true parliaments ombudsmen are 
appointed by the very parliament to which they are accountable. 
Why does the government insist on making the ethics counsellor 
work in isolation? Why has the government not taken advantage 
of what could have been a genuinely democratic measure and 
could have reconciled us immediately with the government, 
although momentarily? Why did the government fail to take 
advantage of such an auspicious situation by making a true 
democratic gesture? We know the answer. In fact, Liberals are 
not prepared to do that much in matters of  lobbyist registration. 
They are certainly not prepared to submit a firm policy 
concerning their influence.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	We would have liked the ethics counsellor to be accountable 
to Parliament appointed for a seven-year term, with the 
possibility of being reappointed one more time. We would have 
liked-which is certainly not trivial nor asking too much-the 
ethics counsellor to have much broader enforcement powers 
than he now has. As a matter of fact, what is it that is posing a 
threat?
<P>
	Let us take very recent examples of government activities, for 
example what happened to the minister of heritage. Despite 
being indisputably a noble-hearted man, we must recognize that 
he is certainly not the most clever minister in this government. 
Between the moment the Prime Minister suggested that his 
ethics counsellor be consulted and the moment he advised the 
House of this decision, three weeks had gone by.
<P>
	Let us now consider, Mr. Speaker, what is presently 
happening in the Prime Minister's own circle. Of course, in the 
last two days, I have come to understand a lot better why the 
government is standing up for the family. Recently, I had the 
pleasure of tabling a motion, and I had a hard time 
understanding why the government was so stubborn. Now I 
understand that, when the Liberals talk about defending family 
values, they also mean the importance of defending the close 
ties between the Prime Minister and his family and friends.
<P>
	On the whole, the member for Ottawa-Vanier will agree that 
this bill has no teeth and would have gained from being 
strengthened. In matters of disclosure for instance, the bill 
provides for a number of things. A lobbyist must state the role 
played in the development of legislative proposals, the 
influence used in the tabling of bills, the making or amending of 
regulations, the development or amendment of any federal 
program, the awarding of grants, etc. There are about seven such 
duties.
<P>
	Why are lobbyists not required to reveal the special ties they 
may have with public servants, senior officials and ministers? 
The government has trivialized things to such a point that 
lobbyists have to declare the department they had dealings with. 
As if even the dullest of minds could not guess from the 
lobbyists' area of activity with which department they had 
dealings.
<P>
	The government whip, who waged a hard battle in the past, is 
now, as the father of psychoanalysis would say, a polymorphous 
pervert, which means that he changes form with the debate. How 
is it that no minister, no member stood in the House to demand 
that lobbyists be required to disclose the names of public 
servants, senior officials and ministers that they meet?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in political life, as you know very well since you 
are a wise man, there are some tests of truth. The Lobbyists 
Registration Act is such a test of truth and we would have 
wanted the government to be strong. We would have wanted the 
government, for once in this  mandate, to not only be strong, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11955"> 11955 </A></B>
<P>
to work hand in hand with the opposition parties, since this is not 
just anything. As a Parliament, as parliamentarians, we could 
have built a wonderful consensus which would have allowed us 
to send a clear message to the population, saying: ``We, as 
parliamentarians, agree that public policies which are our prime 
concern may be developed openly and publicly''.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say how I am disappointed in the 
emasculated bill that the government is proposing and how 
much better it would have been had the government been 
stronger.
<P>
	It is still time for the government to rally to the arguments of 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will certainly agree with me that the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve really understands the problem. 
This man has exceptional assessment skills. He made extremely 
fair comments on this debate and on certain qualities of the men 
and women in this House.
<P>
	That said, what struck me in the hon. member's speech-and I 
think his speech is justified-is that he highlighted the 
differences between what government members said when they 
were in opposition and what is in Bill C-43 on lobbyists 
currently being considered at third reading. Moreover, the 
Liberals even tabled in this House the so-called Zed report, 
entitled ``Rebuilding Trust''.
<P>
	Given what I hear from the Liberals, I think the title should be 
``Imposing Trust'', because that is what the government is 
doing, forcing Canadians and Quebecers to trust this document. 
What they have said since taking office 18 months ago is quite 
different from what they used to say in opposition.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to ask the hon. member a question, 
which he will surely be happy to answer. How can he explain, as 
seriously as possible, the Liberals' shift in policy? What is the 
most obvious explanation for this change of heart by, among 
others, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
who, when he sat on the opposition side, used to tear his shirt 
over this, when there is no trace of these elements in Bill C-43? 
How can the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
explain this extraordinary about-face, because the whole issue 
of government integrity is an extremely important and serious 
matter? How can the hon. member explain this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>This is a difficult question, Mr. Speaker, but I 
will try to answer it to the best of my ability.
<P>
	It should be pointed out first of all that the chief government 
whip is not easy to pin down. It is therefore difficult to explain 
his about-faces in any great detail. It seems to me, though, that 
the answer may lie halfway between human nature and what I 
would call corporate pressure.
<P>
	Perhaps you have already given some thought to the fact that 
Quebec is a step ahead in this respect. It certainly is no small 
thing that, in a democracy like Quebec, legislation and standards 
governing public administration were quickly established to 
ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, conflicts of interests 
are avoided.
<P>
	I keep saying that I am the son of a labourer. My father made a 
decent living but not a fortune. You do not have to come from a 
wealthy family to get into politics, as long as you have an idea to 
put across. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, for example, decided we 
would rather be funded through personal contributions.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	For my part, when I ran and was elected to represent the 
people of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, I ran on a $30,000 budget. 
This amount was made up of modest contributions by 
individuals who wanted me to become their member of 
Parliament. The difference between Bloc members and 
government members, who are under pressure from various 
sources, is that, when I rise in my place, I know that I do not have 
to account to a corporate constituency. I know that, whether I 
speak on drug patents, the recognition of same sex partners or 
the national AIDS strategy, I do so freely, without any 
constraints.
<P>
	But to be able to speak absolutely freely, our election funds 
have to be clean and the system must ensure that the ties between 
corporate constituents and elected representatives are clear. The 
government party, which is made up of honest people for the 
most part, exposes itself to criticism because it relies on 
corporate financial backers who have interests and attempt to 
influence government decisions. That is why it is so difficult to 
remain honest and keep one's hands clean in politics without 
clear funding arrangements.
<P>
	I think that party funding and lobbyists registration are issues 
that reflect our willingness as parliamentarians to maintain our 
independence of mind and action.
<P>
	Let us face it, with respect to the party financing policy and 
the lobbyists registration system, the Liberals are a traditional 
party, that is to say a party subject to pressure from the corporate 
constituency of this country. Again, it is a shame that the Liberal 
Party did not continue to act the way it did in opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve on his out-of-the-ordinary 
performance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11956"> 11956 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> I 
expected the Liberal members to rise in recognition of the hon. 
member's incredible talent, and particularly because of the 
appropriateness of his comments. Our colleague provided a very 
eloquent answer to the question asked by the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm as to why the Liberal Party, which makes 
up this government, is now proposing a bill which is not only 
meaningless, but which also contradicts the views expressed by 
the Liberals when they were in opposition.
<P>
	The best possible example is that of the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who, when in opposition, 
constantly denounced the Conservative government and fought 
tooth and nail to promote integrity. Now, he reminds us of St. 
Paul, who was struck and fell off his horse. Indeed, the member 
is now supporting a meaningless and toothless legislation, but 
one which will allow business to go on as usual. What took place 
in this House during the past week is very telling.
<P>
	Every day this week, during oral question period, the official 
opposition and the Reform Party gave examples of shameless 
patronage which are in contradiction with the good intentions of 
the legislation before us.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
to comment on the two timing displayed by the Liberals, given 
what they were saying when they sat in opposition and what they 
are now doing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member has one 
minute only to comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, you know I always respect my 
time limit. I wanted first to point out that the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead looks as tanned as the 
Minister of Heritage, so he too might have been to Los Angeles.
<P>
	Finally, this issue might say something about the Minister of 
Industry's importance in the cabinet. I think it also shows the 
real influence that minister has. If we were dealing with a 
minister with real power within the cabinet, surely the 
legislative results would have been different. But it is really not 
too late for the Liberals to pull themselves together, and let us 
hope that, in the coming hours and days, we will see one last 
instance of the confidence that can still drive this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I see my remarks will get a warm welcome on the 
other side. Earlier today, I listened to comments by members 
opposite. I listened intently like I always do. I really wonder if 
they are familiar with the bill before us or just with the person 
who prepared the notes they read, like good Bloc members who 
read the propaganda that is prepared either here, by their local 
branch, or by their jead office or even by somebody else.
<P>
	I also hear some heckling, not to use another word, on the part 
of a Reform Party member. He would like to know if I will 
address all aspects of the bill. I fully intend to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member of the Reform Party who is anxiously 
waiting for me to address particular parts of the bill will need to 
be reminded of the document of the Liberal Party known as 
``Creating Opportunity''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> As the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader and the excellent member for 
Kingston and the Islands has just said, it is called the red book. 
Yes, it is the red book.
<P>
	What was promised by the Liberal Party in the red book is 
what we are delivering to the people of Canada as we continue 
on our very successful program of delivering on our 
commitments to the people of Canada. Through the excellent 
leadership of the Minister of Industry we are delivering on that 
commitment in this third reading debate on Bill C-43.
<P>
	We promised as a party that we would restore integrity in 
government in a general sense. That is exactly what we have 
done with the leadership of the right hon. Prime Minister. We 
said that we would have stricter rules of conduct for lobbyists. I 
will get into those details in a minute. We also said that we 
would establish rules of conduct for members of Parliament and 
senators, and that item is on the Order Paper for debate on 
Monday. Immediately when we complete this facet of ethics in 
government we will deal with the next part, which is the code of 
conduct for MPs and senators.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I am anxiously waiting the support we will get toward 
bringing that resolution to a successful conclusion and to start 
our work in that regard. If members across the way do not adopt 
the motion to start that work, we will have to conclude they do 
not want rules of conduct and ethics to apply to them. We will 
see about that in a few days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> We will see that on Monday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> As the parliamentary secretary says because he 
is charge of such matters, we will see that on Monday.
<P>
	In the red book we committed ourselves as a party to deal with 
the issue of lobbyists. Let us remember how we got the rules that 
presently exist for lobbyists. Prior to 1985 there were no rules 
for lobbyists. On September 9, 1985 after a number of questions 
were asked in the House-and if I do say so myself I asked a 
good number of them-the then prime minister decided to 
announce a series of measures. Two years later-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11957"> 11957 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> The Conservatives?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It was a Conservative Prime Minister.
<P>
	Two years later when that same prime minister had not 
produced the rules, we prodded him and finally got a 
commitment from the government to establish a parliamentary 
committee. That was the Cooper committee.
<P>
	I sat on that committee. I will claim some responsibility for 
some of the recommendations in its report. It was chaired by the 
member for Peace River. We arrived at a unanimous report. The 
then New Democratic Party member for Nickel Belt, several 
Conservative MPs and I under the chairmanship of the member 
for Peace River produced a report.
<P>
	From that report the government produced a bill. That bill is 
the law in the country. It was referred to a parliamentary 
committee, the Cooper committee. We dealt with it, made some 
improvements to it and now it is the law of the land.
<P>
	One of the clauses that came from the committee was the 
sunset clause of sorts on which there would be a review. The 
review was to improve on the bill. Pursuant to that we did the 
study under the able chairmanship of the member for 
Fundy-Royal. We now have before us a bill to amend the 
present act. That is how it all came about.
<P>
	When five years of having the first law were completed or 
close to it the government, again at the request of the opposition, 
appointed a committee under the leadership of the member for 
Selkirk-Interlake, Felix Holtmann, who is in Ottawa; I saw 
him 10 or 15 minutes ago. He chaired the committee that 
produced a report I have before me today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Holtmann committee report was entitled ``A Blueprint 
for Transparency: Review of the Lobbyists Registration Act''. 
The Liberal Party used that report as the basis for its own red 
book.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> A member across the way says that it is not so, 
or he is questioning whether it is accurate. I will read to him the 
relevant sections of the red book at page 95:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In particular, a Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day-to-day 
application of the Code of Conduct for Public Officials. The Ethics Counsellor 
will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House 
of Commons and will report directly to Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Are members opposite listening?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Why bother consulting with them? They are 
not interested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> As a matter of fact the Prime Minister 
consulted with the two opposition parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> And now they are complaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Now they are complaining, as the hon. member 
so eloquently said. It continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Ethics Counsellor will be mandated to develop a corresponding code of 
conduct for lobbyists-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is enshrined in the bill before us today.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and to examine and recommend responses to the ethical and business 
practice issues that arise from time to time in government relations. The 
Ethics Counsellor will be able to offer guidance to both the lobbyists and their 
clients and, if necessary, so that they can judge in advance the acceptability of 
any proposed contract or activity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will give the Ethics Counsellor the power to 
investigate complaints and review specific dealings between the government 
and lobbyist to ensure that the Code of Conduct is honoured. The Ethics 
Counsellor will be available to the Prime Minister to investigate allegations of 
impropriety by Cabinet ministers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is all there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is all there. The part dealing with lobbyists is 
in the bill, if not more.
<P>
	The red book went on to state that we would adopt the 
recommendations of the Holtmann committee and that is what 
we are doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, let me quote from the Holtmann report on which was 
based the red book. Listen to what was said about the 
independence of the registrar. At the time, the title used was 
registrar instead of ethics counsellor. The title recommended by 
the Holtmann committee for this position was registrar.
<P>
	On page 19, the Holtmann report says, and my colleagues may 
want to listen carefully and even write this down: ``We listened 
with great interest to the arguments presented by these 
witnesses'', meaning the witnesses who wanted the registrar to 
be placed under the authority of the House of Commons, but 
``heard no evidence that the Registrar has been hindered in the 
execution of her duties. Nevertheless, we are anxious that both 
the excellent performance and the public reputation of the 
Registrar be maintained. We feel that this can best be 
accomplished by giving the Registrar an increased measure of 
independence and additional authority to report on matters 
pertaining to the Act. Apart from the obvious benefit of reducing 
the possibility of political interference, this would allow the 
Registrar to comment on deficiencies and problems with the 
operation of the Act. Therefore, the committee 
recommends-listen to this-that the Registrar be appointed by 
the Governor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11958"> 11958 </A></B>
<P>
in Council-in other words by the Prime Minister and the 
cabinet, and get  this-subject to the approval of a committee of 
Parliament''.
<P>
	There you go. It is already provided for in the Standing Orders 
of the House of Commons. As you can see, the complaints and 
the lamentations that we heard earlier today from the members 
opposite-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The moaning and groaning!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The moaning and groaning, it is nothing but a 
show.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is what it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Absolutely. It is nothing but a show. The 
members opposite got what they asked for and, indeed, what had 
been promised to Canadians. As usual, the Liberal government 
is determined to keep its promise to the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken: </B>As always!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> As always, as the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands so rightly said. So we have not diluted our 
commitment in any way as alleged by the opposition critic, the 
member for Berthier-Montcalm. He said earlier today that we 
have lenient rules. Did you hear that, Mr. Speaker? The member 
has certainly not heard the Minister of Industry, who said in this 
House today that we have the strictest rules of all the countries 
in the world.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> In the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, we will shortly be having a 
question and comments period, and I would invite the member 
for Berthier-Montcalm, in the preamble to the question he will 
no doubt ask, to tell us what other jurisdiction has stricter rules 
for lobbyists than are found in Bill C-43 before us. I invite him 
to list the countries for us. It will not take him long-there are 
none. I am familiar with the situation in the United States. There 
are absolutely none there. In the United States, only dealings 
between a lobbyist and a legislator are recorded. No record is 
kept for a member of the executive, or even for staff member or 
even for the highest government official in the country. Only in 
the case of a conversation or other communication with a 
legislator, not a member of the executive.
<P>
	In the United States, there is no record either of lobbyists 
costs, unlike what we will have here in certain controversial 
cases, as the minister indicated so well. In the United States, 
only the honoraria of foreign lobbyists are recorded when they 
lobby in the United States and only when foreign interests are 
concerned.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	I went to Washington with the committee, I saw what was 
being done there and I invite the members opposite to get their 
facts straight on this matter. I was, I humbly point out, the only 
parliamentarian to take part in the Cooper and Holtmann 
committes. The member opposite claims to have become an 
expert on the issue after spending some months on a 
parliamentary  committee-and the Bloc Quebecois even 
switched its critic mid-way through. I do not question the hon. 
member's competence.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, he is very competent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> But he must not lay claim to a monopoly on 
insight into this kind of thing, because I have been working on 
this matter for close to ten years now. I think I can safely claim 
to know at least as much as he does.
<P>
	I know that the opposition is quite upset about the issue. They 
see that in a few minutes we may vote in a new law which will 
strengthen the great confidence that the Canadian population 
already has in its government. The Liberals have been working 
like they always have on this issue, and that is what we intend to 
continue doing, that is what we promised and that is what we, as 
the government, will indeed do.
<P>
	A little earlier, I heard the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm talk about what he called the Liberal 
government's flexible conscience. Now, this is from people who 
got themselves elected under the separatist banner, calling 
themselves moderate separatists during the election campaign. 
They called themselves strong separatists in separatist ridings, 
and moderate separatists in those that were not. But, once they 
got elected and came to Parliament, they all threw out those 
principles and became militant separatists. Now, all of a sudden, 
the leader of their party decides to champion a form of federalist 
separatism. Look closely at what the members opposite have 
done. Separation with Canadian passports, Canadian currency 
and a federal Parliament. That is what some members opposite 
start calling separatism when they see that their agenda is going 
nowhere.
<P>
	So, we are now dealing with federalist separatists and 
separatist separatists across the way. But now, we must know 
whether the separatists-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me to invoke the rule of 
relevancy because we cannot see where the government whip's 
allegations are leading and what is the link with Bill C-43.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The rule of relevancy is 
very difficult to apply. It is extremely flexible. I listened 
carefully to all the speeches, on both sides of the House, and I 
believe that, to a large extent, the debate has been very relevant.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to 
conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm was quite right to talk about the flexibility 
of one's conscience; I suppose that he is quite angry at his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11959"> 11959 </A></B>
<P>
colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for claiming that to 
talk about such a topic, as his colleague did, was against the 
rules.
<P>
	I believe that he is going to get an earful from his colleague 
after questions and comments. I agree with the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm in this matter. I am sure that he was right to 
raise this issue. In fact, this is why I am answering. Since he was 
not called to order by the Speaker when he raised the issue, it 
means that he was abiding by the rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> This is too much!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No. Members across are not in a position to be 
sanctimonious. This is certainly not the right time for them to 
vow political chastity. Just think of what was happening recently 
between the local branch here and the head office in Quebec. 
One wonders which brand of separation will be preached. Is it 
the federalist one of the local branch manager in Ottawa, that is 
the Leader of the Opposition, or the separatist one in Quebec? 
Which one will prevail in the debate?
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	It now seems the member for Lac-Saint-Jean is slightly ahead 
of his provincial colleague. We will see, in the near as well as 
distant future. In any case, whichever brand of separation, it will 
still be separation. It is like ice cream. The flavour might be 
slightly different, it is still ice cream. In this case, however, the 
product has soured and the public will not buy it.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will repeat that we have here an excellent bill 
which was introduced by a minister who really did his 
homework and which was studied by an extremely competent 
parliamentary committee. That committee, through its majority 
members, delivered what we promised in the red book and went 
even further on some points.
<P>
	I support their work entirely. I am convinced that this is a 
good bill. As the Minister of Industry indicated, it is a 
legislation which has the strictest national requirements in the 
world. Yes I must repeat it. It is not my fault if such are the facts. 
Nonetheless, it is still the truth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I welcome questions from my colleagues across the way on 
this bill. I welcome in advance their support if they do want 
stricter rules for lobbyists. We will find out in very short order 
whether that is really what they want or if all they want to do is 
complain and not really do anything.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am really disappointed to see the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell laughing about such an 
important issue as Bill C-43, an Act to amend the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, confusing everything and saying almost 
nothing about the bill itself.
<P>
	The member talked about sovereignty, about all kinds of 
issues, about the leaders of the sovereignist forces in Quebec, 
about almost everything except for the real issue, the one 
concerning lobbyists. As for sovereignty, during the referendum 
period, in Quebec, the member will come and talk about the 
great policies of the stuffed beavers over there. He will come in 
Quebec and talk about that. However, today's debate is on Bill 
C-43.
<P>
	Bill C-43 is a most important bill, and I find it strange that the 
member has nothing to say about it. I will ask him a few 
questions but first, I want to make a comment. He 
underestimated the work done by the committee. He said that the 
members claimed they alone knew the truth because they had 
heard witnesses during six months. That is not true, Mr. Speaker. 
I am not alone in knowing the truth. I only report to the House 
what I have heard during the hearings of the committee.
<P>
	I report to the House what witnesses, taxpayers and voters 
said to the committee about what they would like to see in Bill 
C-43. I think that the member underestimates the work that has 
been done, and that is most regrettable.
<P>
	There are two very important points in this bill. There are 
many others, but what is important is not what is in the bill. 
There are, in particular, a couple of points concerning the ethics 
code and the appointment of the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	I will read two clauses to the member opposite who suggested 
that this bill is a model of openness and absolutely the best 
legislation of its type anywhere in the world, that they are the 
smartest, the most clever and the boldest in their proposal. Why, 
then, does the bill clearly state that the counsellor's 
investigations should remain secret, hidden behind the closed 
doors of the federal government? We are not allowed to know 
what is going on behind those closed doors. Why does the bill 
specify that the code of ethics is not a statutory instrument for 
the purposes of the statutory instruments act? Are they afraid 
that the public will initiate legal proceedings to have the code 
enforced?
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Are they afraid of civil suits? How do you explain section 10.5 
of the bill, which says that ``the Ethics Counsellor shall prepare 
a report of the investigation, including the findings, conclusions 
and reasons for the Ethics Counsellor's conclusions''? We insist 
on having a reasoned report. The ethics counsellor would never 
tell us how he came to these conclusions.
<P>
	It is the same with a judge's decision. It is by reading the 
decision that you know if the judge's findings are right or wrong. 
We will not have this information because the legislation is 
made especially for the friends of the government, those who 
contribute to the Liberal Party's election fund. They do not want 
us to know how the ethics counsellor came to his conclusions. 
They do not want us to know how the ethics counsellor really 
judges a minister, senior official or anyone else working  for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11960"> 11960 </A></B>
<P>
government machine. No, instead they introduce a bill that 
makes no sense.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that he should have been 
embarrassed to speak today about Bill C-43. I would have been, 
knowing that I had signed the Holtmann report, which 
recommended taking measures that are 10 times stronger and 
more comprehensive than those in the bill before us.
<P>
	He was a member of the Holtmann committee, he signed the 
report regarding the tier system for lobbyists and disclosure, and 
we are not even doing one-tenth of what the Holtmann report 
recommended. I would be embarrassed to flaunt that today. I 
would also be embarrassed to hold up a book, claiming that it is 
still red. Those small red books may all have come out of the 
same press, but not two are identical. At least in the version of 
the book they used during the election campaign they were 
committed to implementing the recommendations of the 
Holtmann report.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Promises, promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> It was an election promise. Today, their 
other small red book called ``Rebuilding Trust'' has nothing to 
do with that and would have been better named ``Breach of 
Trust''. It does not even go one tenth of the way, and that is 
disgraceful. I would be embarrassed if I were him.
<P>
	I would like him to explain to me why the contents of Bill 
C-43 do not jive with the Holtmann report. Let him explain, if 
he has the courage to and if he even knows, because he has 
hardly been to two or three meetings in the last six months. And 
today, he thinks he can teach me something. No, there is 
definitely something wrong with this picture.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not intend to 
apologize to the hon. member opposite for the fact that, since 
then, I became the government whip. During the period when 
discussions on the bill started and were finally concluded, I had 
the honour and the privilege-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> To abandon ship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not think that becoming the government 
whip of one's country means abdicating one's responsibilities, 
as the hon. member opposite inferred. If some day he manages to 
get this kind of job, perhaps he will understand. And if he does, I 
might remind him of what he said today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I hope not.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The opposition will be in bad shape.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It certainly will if it happens to be him.
<P>
	The Holtmann committee submitted a good report. For 
instance, all those who had to register, it is all there in the 
Holtmann report. Disclosure of information as well. Today's 
proposals on administration, implementation and enforcement 
of the legislation are even stricter than what was recommended 
in the Holtmann report.
<P>
	Look at what the report recommended, for instance, regarding 
the creation of a professional association and a code of ethics for 
lobbyists. It said lobbyists should immediately set up a 
professional association with a code of ethics. We go even 
further than that. The ethics counsellor himself will draw up a 
code of ethics on behalf of the lobbyists. We want it to be even 
stricter.
<P>
	The person in charge, the public official, will do this himself, 
and I am referring to the person who will have this 
quasi-judicial role to play. He will have that authority. In this 
bill we have gone even further than the Holtmann report, which 
was already a good report.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	We went farther than the current legislation. There were three 
stages. We started with the existing legislation, improved it with 
the Holtmann report, improved it in the red book, improved it 
further with the report entitled ``Rebuilding Trust'' and 
improved it again today with Bill C-43.
<P>
	We had the benefit of the wisdom of the members opposite, 
because we even adopted some of their recommendations with 
regard to their amendments, which we voted on a few days ago. 
We were proud to do so, because this is what we want, and I hope 
this is what the hon. members opposite want as well. We want 
the most practical bill, nevertheless, the best possible, by 
reconciling everything that needs reconciling so that what we 
put forward is more than just fancy theories. We have a good bill 
and we will have the best, when the members opposite decide to 
let their colleagues vote so we can get on with this matter, which 
is important for lobbyists, the government and the people of 
Canada, who elected this government on its agenda, on its red 
book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very 
brief. I will simply say that I appreciate the work the hon. 
member did with respect to lobbyists during the time he was in 
opposition. He was a good, hard working member and he said a 
lot of wise things. I wish that his government had followed some 
of his advice.
<P>
	I would like to refer to what I call the Liberals' red ink book of 
broken promises. At page 94 of the red book, under ``The Public 
Trust'', it says: ``Nine years of Conservative government have 
brought our political process into disrepute. A Liberal 
government will restore public trust and confidence in 
government.'' Wonderful. Those are nice words. ``We will 
regulate the activities of lobbyists by appointing an ethics 
counsellor''. They have done it. Great. It continues: ``We will 
reform the pension plan of members of Parliament''. For 
everybody who was here before 1988 it is the same old trough. 
``We will give more power to individual MPs by providing more 
free votes and more authority for parliamentary committees''. 
That is not happening. ``And we will establish strict guidelines 
for merit in government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11961"> 11961 </A></B>
<P>
appointments''. We have lists and lists of appointments on 
everything other than merit.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member to respond to this, 
because this is very serious. I believe that their commitment is 
honourable, but they are not following through. I would like the 
hon. member to explain it. He was involved in the reports in the 
past that made this recommendation. I am reading from page 95: 
``In particular, a Liberal government will appoint an 
independent ethics counsellor''. He referred to that in his 
speech. I would ask him to describe how the present 
appointment mechanism established in Bill C-43 via the Prime 
Minister and the submission of reports via the registrar general 
to the House reflects an independence, which is so necessary.
<P>
	It continues: ``The ethics counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation''. Great. But it says here explicitly: ``-will report 
directly to Parliament''. That is not happening. The hon. 
member needs to explain that.
<P>
	The Liberal government says that it will implement the 
unanimous June 1993 report; that is the Holtmann report. I 
cannot give the House the details, but if I had the time I would 
list two specifics in the Holtmann report that were not 
implemented. The removal of the tiers was an explicit Holtmann 
report recommendation. That is not in this bill. The 
anti-avoidance schemes were specific in the Holtmann report, 
but not in here.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond as to why the 
government is not doing those things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two points. First, I thank 
the hon. member for his questions. They were indeed very 
pertinent and I would like to respond to them. I know the hon. 
member has been very diligent in his work on this.
<P>
	I would like to suggest a comparison. The Minister of 
Industry also has reporting to him, albeit nominally, because he 
works independently, the director of investigation and research. 
That person investigates what we formerly called the combines 
investigation and so on. Does anyone ever say that the person 
who does that judicial function, because he reports nominally to 
the minister, who then tables his report in the House, is 
somehow tainted by the fact that he reports to the minister? I do 
not think anyone has ever said that.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I do not know why anyone would say that a report delivered by 
the ethics counsellor to the minister in his capacity as registrar 
general, which is then tabled by the minister in the House, is 
somehow tainted. The member across will surely know that is 
not the case.
<P>
	With regard to the tiers or the categories, I want to outline 
something for members across and indeed to all Canadians who 
might read <I>Hansard</I>. I cannot discuss watching TV; that would 
be inappropriate.
<P>
	The federations of agriculture and other organizations came 
to testify before us. They told us that the governments consult 
them, and because the governments consult them, the new and 
stricter requirements that we will be imposing on the contract 
type of lobbyist should not apply to them, that it is in fact unfair 
to them.
<P>
	If the member wants to say that we should give far more 
bureaucratic type of work to be done by the dairy commissions 
or the dairy councils, the federations of agriculture, the milk 
committees, and groups like that, let him say that, if he wants to 
impose those kinds of onerous requirements of the kind that we 
are placing on contract lobbyists.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He didn't even move those as amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No one even moved amendments to that effect.
<P>
	Because we are making the requirements so strict for others, 
that is why those things in there cannot be applied to groups like 
the federation of agriculture in my riding, or the milk 
committee.
<P>
	I will be meeting with the milk committee from 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell next week, Mr. Speaker, and you 
are invited to attend the meeting. All three milk committees are 
uniting at St-Isidore-de-Prescott in my riding. I will be meeting 
with their executive next week. That is a lobbying activity. They 
have asked to see me in order to lobby me on a very important 
issue.
<P>
	This is not a joke. The dairy producers in my riding, who feel 
these issues are very important to them and lobby their member, 
think this is pretty serious stuff. They do not want to have 
imposed on them the same kinds of requirements we would 
impose on a guy like Frank Moores. I do not even know if he is 
still working, but Mr. Moores, in the heyday of his Tory 
lobbying, would have had, under these rules, the same kind of 
requirement as l'Association des producteurs laitiers du comté 
de Russell.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I do not think I would put these groups on the same footing 
with regard to disclosure. If the members opposite think that is 
the right way, let them say so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hope and trust that I read 
the mood of the House correctly when I allowed the question and 
comment period to go a little bit longer than the period normally 
allows for. Following that, we have approximately five minutes 
left to this day. Do we in fact want to continue and allow the 
member for Skeena to take the floor, or are there other 
suggestions?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11962"> 11962 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. May I ask 
that you seek unanimous consent to simply continue the debate 
with the present member? I would appreciate that. I think it 
would be useful because of his experience and wisdom in this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House is the master 
of its own destiny. It is by unanimous consent, with the 
understanding that the day will end at 2.30 p.m.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm has the floor on a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understand correctly, the 
five minutes are in order to finish, only five minutes.
<P>
	As for the rest, regarding the wisdom of the hon. member, I 
cannot say I quite agree, but that is another matter. However, as 
regards unanimous consent, you have it for five minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I have understood 
everyone, we will still adjourn at the time agreed upon, that is, at 
2.30 p.m., but we will continue with a period of questions and 
comments for the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this.
<P>
	The member indicated that there were no amendments to 
remove the tiers. I want to inform him that in fact one of our 
amendments at report stage dealt with exactly that issue, and it 
was turned down. That has happened here.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	The member did not adequately explain how the 
independence of the ethics counsellor is achieved through the 
present system. When we compare it to the independence of the 
auditor general, there is quite a difference. Certainly in the 
perception of the people there is a large problem if the ethics 
counsellor is investigating an issue that deals with the registrar 
general. In that instance, the ethics counsellor would be doing an 
investigation and reporting to the very member he is 
investigating and then through him to the House. There is a 
perception of not having adequate independence. I want the hon. 
member's response to that. This is not adequate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> First, Mr. Speaker, let us establish one thing. 
The nature of dealing with lobbyists is not in itself judicial. One 
might argue it is quasi-judicial. We do not start off with the 
premise that someone who is being investigated has committed 
a crime. This is not at the same level. The member would 
understand that first premise. I am sure he does.
<P>
	We do not start off with the premise that anyone who is before 
the body in question has committed some sort of wrongdoing. In 
fact the ethnics counsellor will be producing the rules to govern 
these people, the code of conduct, providing advice to them. If a 
lobbyist is deciding whether or not a particular lobbying activity 
is ethical, he will be able to consult the ethics counsellor and so 
on. That is the first proposition.
<P>
	The second proposition is that the member has said that I have 
not convinced him why someone who reports nominally through 
a minister for a report to be tabled in the House would be 
independent. I have to turn it right around on its head and say he 
has not proven that he is not. He has far from made that proof.
<P>
	I gave the example of the director of investigation and 
research, who does work in regard to dealings in the corporate 
sector, and how if groups are guilty of collusion, price fixing, 
and so on, these people are investigated.
<P>
	There are administrative tribunals involving international 
trade that report through a minister to the House. None of the 
pension tribunals report directly to the Speaker of Parliament. 
Does the veterans pensions appeal board report directly to the 
Speaker? Of course not. It reports through the minister to the 
House. Does anyone say that all these people are tainted, 
incompetent, and that their judgment is biased? I do not think so. 
What about all the other administrative tribunals? Does anyone 
make that allegation?
<P>
	There is an interesting point. One minister has as his task to 
report the estimates of the CRTC in this House: the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. Because that minister passed a complaint 
on, without even a recommendation, referred a letter from a 
constituent, that was brought on the floor of the House as saying 
that this body is quite independent, even though it reports to the 
minister. If that is true, that a person reporting through the 
minister had previously, according to the same people asking the 
questions today, always been independent, how is it that this job 
of being the administrator of these rules will never be 
independent? How can that be? Obviously it is wrong. Their 
judgment is incorrect.
<P>
	I say that even though the person reports to a minister of the 
crown, the person is not a police officer or a judge of the 
Supreme Court. He administers rules of ethics. There are two 
facets to it: one involves lobbyists reporting through the 
minister to the House; the other one is reporting the conduct of 
ministers to the Prime Minister. The reason for that, of course, is 
we operate under the principle of responsible government.
<P>
	With the indulgence of my colleagues, may I end with this 
comment? What if we had a system pertaining to the conduct of 
ministers where the Prime Minister was not responsible?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11963"> 11963 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Prime Minister answered questions saying: ``Do not ask 
me. There is an independent officer investigating this'', what we 
would hear from the opposition was: ``Prime Minister, you are 
the boss. You appointed these people. You are the one who is 
supposed to administer discipline''. In other words, the 
opposition would turn it around. Its members would say quite 
correctly that we live under a system of responsible government 
and the buck has to stop with the person in charge.
<P>
	Those are the two functions that person will have to 
administer, one closer to a judicial role and the other something 
where the ultimate responsibility has to lie with the Prime 
Minister. Those are the two functions that the person will have 
according to my understanding of the job. That is the important 
thing for us to remember.
<P>
	I hope this legislation will be passed expeditiously and that 
we have better rules of conduct not for us in this bill-we will 
have those too, some other time-but a better code of conduct 
for lobbyists for the betterment of the whole country.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank everyone 
for their co-operation. It is most enjoyable to finish on a 
co-operative note at the end of the week.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.31 p.m.)
