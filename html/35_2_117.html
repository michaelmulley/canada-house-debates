government of their views on levels and priorities for the 
expenditure of tax revenues and to provide for parliamentary

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the people's tax 
form act. It is well known that the vast majority of Canadians 
oppose grants and handouts to business, special interest groups, 
bilingualism, multiculturalism, affirmative action, the CBC, the 
National Film Board, etc., but either the Liberals and the Tories do 
not listen or they just do not care.
<P>
	If the government receives millions of people's tax forms filed 
with tax returns every year it will be difficult if not impossible for 
government to ignore the collective will of the majority of 
taxpayers. Direct democracy and the power of populism can work 
and even though the people's tax form is voluntary, I am convinced 
that millions of Canadians would use the form to send a real 
message to government about which programs they support and 
which ones they do not.
<P>
	My bill also allows for the tabulation, analysis and review of the 
results by Parliament in time for the budget review process every 
fall. The people's tax form act would remove billions of dollars of 
unwanted, ineffective government programs and programs used 
purely for politically reasons.

two petitions today and the first comes from Hull, Quebec.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that our police

serve the emergency needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	They also state that in many cases the families of officers and 
firefighters who lose their lives in the line of duty are left without 
sufficient financial means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from December 9 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, 
the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account Act and related acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not intending to speak but since you called my 
riding I certainly have a few words to say.
<P>
	The question before the House is whether the Minister of 
Finance, who is probably one of the best finance ministers that 
Canada has ever seen, who has the best record of any finance 
minister Canada has ever seen-I had better be careful-with the 
exception of the gentleman who became the finance minister in the 
fall of 1977. The boss became finance minister at that point. There 
is one exception.
<P>
	What we have is the rational legislation of the great Minister of 
Finance and the irrational logic of all the opposition parties. It is 
what separates Liberals from Reform and Tory and Bloc members. 
Imagine discussing a bill in this Chamber and having the official 
opposition advocate that the GST should be changed so that it 
includes food and prescription drugs. Just imagine that.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Reformers stand in this Chamber and say: ``We do not like what 
the Liberals are doing. We would like to have the tax extended to 
include food and prescription drugs'', as the representative for the 
Reform Party stated in the House with respect to this bill.
<P>
	Imagine the transport critic for the second party in opposition, 
who is just like the Tories, advocating a tax on fuel to improve the 
roads. Imagine that. An increase in the excise tax is being 
recommended by the opposition parties.
<P>
	The finance minister has the best record in Canadian history, 
with the small exception of the minister of finance in the fall of 
1977; the boss. The finance minister is saying to the opposition 
parties: ``No, we cannot afford to tax people more on fuel and on 
gasoline, as the opposition parties are suggesting''.
<P>
	Not only that, they are also advocating helping the rich out a bit 
more. They suggested that our first priority should be to remove the 
taxes on jewellery. That was their priority yesterday in this 
Chamber.
<P>
	They want to do away with the Canada pension plan. The 
Reform Party is exactly like the Tory Party. At the Tory convention 
two months ago they said: ``Let us get rid of the Canada pension 
plan totally''.
<P>
	One other thing distinguishes the Liberals from the Tories and 
the Reformers. The Tories' policy meeting passed a resolution to 
experiment with medicare. That is exactly the same policy as the 
Reform Party of Canada. The policy statement of the Reform Party, 
its budget, which I always keep here in my desk, but I am not 
allowed to show it-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Read us something. Be accurate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Centre is saying: ``Be 
accurate. Read something from it''.
<P>
	Here are some of the recommendations of the Reform Party. On 
December 3 the hon. member for Calgary Centre said: ``Make it the 
broadest possible tax. Let us tax everything: groceries, prescription 
drugs''. Tax everything.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Keep going, George. Keep going.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker</B> Mr. Speaker, I can certainly do that. I will quote from 
the medicare section. The Reform Party says: ``The original 
medicare model is not only intolerably expensive, it is 
undesirable''.
<P>
	What do we have here? We have the opposition parties-and of 
course we cannot leave out the Bloc. The Bloc is on the record as 
supporting any tax forgiveness for wealthy people as long as they 
travel to the United States. It is on the record as being in favour of 
doing away with any double taxation on estate taxes. That only 
deals with people who make over $600,000 a year. That is the Bloc 
for you.
<P>
	Here we have the opposition parties saying no to the 
Government of Canada. They say they want more taxes on ordinary 
people. They want to do away with medicare. They want to do 
away with the Canada pension plan. They say they have a better 
way.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	What is their better way? The Tories and the Reform Party say 
they want to get there faster. Where? They want to eliminate the 
deficit faster. That is their policy. Where are we today under this 
Minister of Finance? Which country in the industrialized, 
democratic world has the best record for economic growth this year 
and next year according to the OECD and the IMF? It is Canada.
<P>
	The most recent figures are out. Which nation of the G-7 has this 
year the best record with the deficit and the GDP ratio? This new 
statement is from the IMF and the OECD made up of 28 nations, 
economists that hold their meetings in Paris and decide on those 
macro economic questions. Is it Germany, Britain, Japan, Italy, the 
United States?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is it Canada?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7281"> 7281 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> We now have the country with the best economic 
growth according to the OECD and the IMF of any of the 
industrialized democracies in the world. We now have, as well, 
Canada leading every other industrialized democracy in the world 
in the deficit to GDP ratio.
<P>
	The IMF made an interesting statement the other day. It said that 
the best record for interest rates was guess which country? Canada.
<P>
	These opposition parties that stand in this Chamber together with 
the Tories who try to hide, the Tories who have a policy to do away 
with medicare, do away with the Canada pension plan, to put taxes 
on groceries and prescription drugs, who want to put on additional 
taxes so they can build highways. They want to put toll gates on our 
roads to pay for them. Then they stand in the Chamber and say no 
to the great Liberal response to the problems in our economy. They 
stand and say no. We want to tax ordinary Canadians. We want to 
give tax breaks to the rich.
<P>
	However, we want to reduce the deficit more, while at the same 
time have a government that has the best record of any 
industrialized, democratic economy in the world. That is why 
Canadians are going to say no to these opposition parties and yes to 
the Liberal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak at second reading of 
the bill about the GST.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say to the hon. member for 
Gander-Grand Falls, who so eloquently described his affection 
for the Minister of Finance, that I previously found him to be more 
objective in his analyses than he was a few minutes ago.
<P>
	When we say the best Minister of Finance, I think we should 
qualify that statement. He just went with the flow. Even Mickey 
Mouse would be a better Minister of Finance than the one we have 
today, considering the economic climate. This is a Minister of 
Finance who maintains the tax loopholes for the rich.
<P>
	Is that what the best Minister of Finance is supposed to be like? 
The hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls usually comes down 
hard on giving preferential treatment to the wealthy. However, his 
government, for which he now seems to act as a yes-man, 
maintains the privileges of the wealthy. Is that what being the best 
Minister of Finance means? The best Minister of Finance after the 
one we had in 1977, who is now the Prime Minister?
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Remember that the Minister of Finance we had in September 
1977 ran up the first major federal deficit. Is that what the best 
Minister of Finance in 1977 was supposed to be doing? I am very 
disappointed in the hon.  member for Gander-Grand Falls. He is 
usually a better analyst.
<P>
	As for Canada's performance, I may remind him that the 
Canadian unemployment rate is around 10 per cent and that we will 
need more than 900,000 jobs in Canada to revert to the same labour 
market conditions we had before the recession. Is that Canada's 
best performance? We just received some statistics indicating an 
increase in the rate of child poverty. Is that Canada's best 
performance? We have one of the poorest records in the world in 
overcoming poverty, and all the while we maintain the privileges of 
the rich. It is awful to hear such things.
<P>
	Is the best Minister of Finance the one who signed the political 
agreement with three maritime provinces that will cost us $1 
billion? Is the best Minister of Finance the one who wasted $1 
billion on an agreement that will not resolve the GST? If that is the 
case, it is time we woke up and it is time for the yes men on the 
other side to wake up as well. The arrangement is less and less 
justifiable before the voters, in my opinion. The farce has gone on 
long enough.
<P>
	Canadians outside the maritimes are going to have to pay about 
$1 billion for an agreement that settles nothing and that scuttles a 
promise the Liberals made even before the last election campaign. 
They told everyone they would abolish the GST, the bloody GST. 
They lied to the people. It is a horrible thing to do. And the people 
believed them and voted for them.
<P>
	What do we end up with today? A monumental farce, an 
agreement worth $1 billion to harmonize the GST with the taxes of 
three maritime provinces. It really takes the cake when they present 
it as an extraordinary accomplishment by the best Minister of 
Finance, who is second only to the 1977 Minister of Finance, who 
is now the Prime Minister. It is quite a show.
<P>
	Canadians have not been fooled. They know very well they are 
going to have to pay for this agreement, which resolves nothing. It 
is nothing more than a local agreement with three maritime 
provinces. In Quebec, we will pay $250 million for this agreement. 
Worst of all in this story is the fact that Quebec harmonized its 
provincial sales tax with the GST at no cost whatsoever to the 
government. It did not cost a penny.
<P>
	We did it because our intentions were good, because we wanted 
to improve trade and because we wanted transactions to take place 
as smoothly as possible. We did not want small business to be stuck 
with two completely different systems operating in parallel. We did 
all that. We even administer on behalf of the federal government 
the infamous goods and services tax. And we did not get a penny in 
compensation for it, not a single penny.
<P>
	Now the government is presenting us with this agreement 
reached with the three Atlantic provinces. They are buying off the 
people in the maritimes for $961  million, that is nearly $1 billion. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7282"> 7282 </A></B>
<P>
It is a disgrace to present such a bill, and particularly to impose a 
gag order to limit debate on this bill.
<P>
	They do not like to hear the truth, to hear that they have been 
deceiving the public. Their commitment was not to hide the GST 
nor to sign an agreement with three Atlantic provinces, hoping that 
it would be used as a model nation-wide. That is not was they 
promised in the election campaign; they ran on the promise of 
scrapping the GST.
<P>
	We all witnessed the show the Deputy Prime Minister put on 
when she resigned and, half a million dollars later, made a 
triumphant comeback, having cleared her name. It is terrible to put 
on a show like that, and the people have had it. After spending 
$500,000 on this show, we are now spending nearly $1 billion on a 
historic agreement with the maritimes.
<P>
	The worst part is the incredible lack of transparency in all this. 
After this historic agreement-historic mainly for its cost of nearly 
$1 billion-was signed, the provinces, not only Quebec, but also 
Ontario and British Columbia, asked the Minister of Finance what 
formula was used to work out this huge amount.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance obstinately refused to make it public, 
knowing full well that this formula, if it exists-which is doubtful 
because this is a political agreement and political agreements do 
not require formulas-was not tailored to the specific situation of 
the three Atlantic provinces.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I am convinced that the federal mandarins who were present 
when the harmonization agreement was struck with Quebec, in 
1991, must have thought: ``We must be careful, because Quebec is 
the only province to have completed this harmonization process 
and it did not ask anything from the federal government''. Quebec 
is so nice that it did not ask anything from the federal government. 
Therefore, once Quebec decided to go along with harmonization, 
these mandarins must have devised the formula so as to completely 
exclude the Quebec situation. But let them make it public. If they 
have the courage of their convictions, if their formula is so good, 
then let them make it public, so that we can see how the finance 
minister managed to find $1 billion in his pockets and generously 
give that money to the maritime provinces. One billion dollars.
<P>
	Liberal members are boasting that books are exempt from the 
GST. This is great, and I want to congratulate Bloc Quebecois 
members, because they are the ones who, from the beginning, with 
the eight founding members of the Bloc Quebecois in this House, 
and out of all the members of all the parties in this House-and I 
see the hon. member for Longueuil-rose to ask that the GST not 
be imposed on books.
<P>
	In Quebec, there is no provincial sales tax on books. This tax was 
eliminated. The finance minister tells us: ``All the books that will 
be bought by educational institutions and organizations promoting 
literacy will be tax exempt''. We say great, but the government 
must do more. Culture should not be taxed. All books should be 
exempt from the GST, as called for by the eight founding members 
of the Bloc Quebecois. I see my colleague, the member for 
Rosemont, who is also in the House and who used to rise almost 
every other week, because we did not have many opportunities to 
speak back then, to demand that the GST be taken off books.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois were the only ones to meet with 
representatives of the literary community, all of them. The Liberals 
refused. The Conservatives refused; I understand. We were the only 
ones to do so.
<P>
	So I congratulate the minister for this small part of the bill, but I 
would like to see him go further, and heed the Bloc Quebecois's 
call to stop taxing culture and literacy.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, before giving the floor 
to anyone else, I must tell you that we voted on the hon. member's 
amendment yesterday and that debate is now on the main motion.
<P>
	As you know, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot 
addressed the motion at length yesterday, for 50 minutes I believe. 
This is the fault of the Chair, which should not have given the floor 
to the hon. member. I ask my colleagues not to speak twice on the 
same motion in future.
<P>
	I am certain that my colleague shares my opinion that we may 
not speak twice on the same motion. This is the Chair's fault, and I 
take responsibility for this error.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a small question. Yesterday, 
the debate was on the amendment I proposed. Today, it is on the bill 
as such at second reading. It should be possible to speak twice in 
two days, because the debate is a different one. I am asking for your 
opinion on this.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems that we are now debating the 
main motion. The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot spoke 
for almost one hour yesterday on the main motion. He proposed an 
amendment at the end of his speech. He perhaps thought he had 
spoken on the amendment yesterday, but the hon. member spoke 
twice on the same motion.
<P>
	I am sure he will not do this again in future. I am counting on my 
colleague not to speak twice in future. It is an error.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak once again to Bill C-70.
<P>
	First I must decry the fact that the government has moved time 
allocation, a form of closure, on this piece of legislation. I need to 
point out that since the fall session  began, the government has 
pushed through precisely nine bills and here we are ramming 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7283"> 7283 </A></B>
<P>
through important pieces of legislation in the last week. That is 
completely unacceptable.
<P>
	I have to speak to some of the accusations made by the member 
for Gander-Grand Falls. I would simply say that if he was not 
completely misleading the Canadian public, he certainly was 
quoting hon. members out of context and I must set the record 
straight.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member from Gander was saying that the Reform Party 
wanted to raise taxes. Let me make it very clear that our party will 
provide the average family of four in this country with a $2,000 tax 
break by the year 2000, $15 billion in tax relief for Canadians. That 
is part of our fresh start platform.
<P>
	The hon. member also spoke about the government's record of 
low interest rates. I have to address that. The reason we have low 
interest rates is that this country's economy has been so soft. That 
is why we have had low interest rates.
<P>
	Noticeably the member did not speak about unemployment. I 
would think someone from Newfoundland must address 
unemployment. In 1995 the G-7 said that Canada had the worst 
record when it came to unemployment in the G-7. Out of all seven 
nations Canada had the worst. Why would a member from 
Newfoundland not address something like unemployment? That is 
ridiculous. Obviously the government's record is so bad that the 
hon. member could not bear to raise the issue of unemployment.
<P>
	By the way, the Reform plan would take 1.2 million low income 
Canadians completely off the tax roles. I want to make that clear. 
Somehow the member for Gander-Grand Falls left people with 
the impression that we were going to tax low income Canadians 
more. We are going to take 1.2 million low income Canadians off 
the tax rolls. These are people whom the Liberals are currently 
taxing, including the member for Gander-Grand Falls who has 
voted in favour of every budget the government has brought in.
<P>
	The member for Gander-Grand Falls apparently is no friend of 
the unemployed. He is no friend of working Canadians who are 
being taxed to the hilt. I think the member for Gander-Grand Falls 
has a lot of explaining to do to his constituents.
<P>
	Specifically on Bill C-70, we need to remind people that this bill 
came about because of a broken promise, a very sorry beginning 
for this legislation. Going back to before the last election, members 
on that side of the House said: ``The GST is completely 
unacceptable. It is terrible. We will rip it out if we become 
government''.
<P>
	The member from Gander spoke of the finance minister. The 
finance minister when he was in opposition  said that the GST was 
terrible and that they did not want to have anything to do with it. 
The Prime Minister has been in this place on and off since 1963, 33 
years. You do not even get that much for murder in this country but 
he has been here that long. He sat here knowing very well that there 
was a possibility the Liberals could form the government and he 
said: ``We do not want to have anything to do with the GST''.
<P>
	What happened on October 18, 1993? The current Deputy Prime 
Minister said on national television in a CBC town hall meeting 
that if the GST was not gone, she would resign. She led everyone to 
believe that the Liberal government would get rid of the GST. We 
know that individual MPs campaigned on the promise to get rid of 
the GST.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do? Did they get rid of the GST? The 
record is very clear. The government did not get rid of the GST. 
Instead because it had no takers for its harmonization proposal, and 
it was desperate to come up with a reason or a justification for 
breaking its promise, it ran out to the Atlantic premiers with $1 
billion and said: ``Please come on board so we can say that we 
fulfilled our promise in some way, shape or form''.
<P>
	A billion dollars. And what was the result? Now a tax regime is 
being established in Atlantic Canada that is going to visit all kinds 
of sorrows on the people of Atlantic Canada. Beyond that, it creates 
all kinds of other problems. It is extremely divisive. When one area 
of the country is rewarded with a $1 billion compensation package 
but other areas are told that they are on their own, what happens? 
We get division.
<P>
	We get problems with national unity obviously. That is the 
government's whole approach to the issue of unity: divide and 
conquer, split people apart. The government has done it from day 
one and continues to do it. Lately it is talking about distinct society 
again. I cannot believe it, but it is part of its whole approach.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	What does this harmonized sales tax do specifically in Atlantic 
Canada? The government claims it will create jobs but the facts 
simply do not bear that out. We know already that stores are closing 
in Atlantic Canada because they cannot afford to implement all the 
necessary changes associated with bringing the harmonized sales 
tax to Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Greenberg stores is based in Quebec but has stores throughout 
Atlantic Canada. It is closing stores because it cannot bear the 
start-up cost of this new harmonized sales tax. Seventy-nine jobs 
are already disappearing in New Brunswick. It just escapes me that 
we are not hearing from New Brunswick MPs. They are not 
standing up and saying: ``We have to do something to protect these 
jobs''. Somehow the members from New Brunswick  are strangely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7284"> 7284 </A></B>
<P>
silent. Where are they? Why are they not standing up for their 
constituents?
<P>
	If something like that were happening in my riding or anywhere 
in Alberta where all those Reform MPs are, or in British Columbia 
or any Reform constituency I would like to think that those 
Reformers would stand up even to their own leader and 
government and say: ``This is unacceptable. We will not put up 
with this. We have received clear direction from our constituents 
and they do not want us to vote in favour of this legislation''. But 
the Liberals are like sheep. They are completely quiet. They have 
been cowed by the Prime Minister and the power of that office, 
which is ridiculous. It is absolutely counter to democracy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls spoke about 
democracy. He is a member who has spoken out in the past and has 
been relegated to the very end of the row, almost out the door. He 
can stand up and try to revive his flagging career all he wants 
knowing that the minister of fisheries may not be long for cabinet. 
However at some point he apparently wronged the Prime Minister 
in some way and now he has been relegated to being almost out the 
door and probably has no chance of getting anywhere which is 
unfortunate. That is how this government deals with people who do 
not toe the line.
<P>
	Let me speak about some things that will happen in Atlantic 
Canada as a result of Bill C-70. We have received letters from the 
Retail Council of Canada, as have hon. members across the way. It 
has warned about the tax in pricing aspect of Bill C-70, about how 
it will hurt many large retailers. It has talked about the millions of 
dollars it will cost. In a very up front manner it said that those costs 
will be passed on to the consumers in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Consumers will bear the cost of the deal that is being 
implemented in Atlantic Canada because the government was so 
desperate to come up with some kind of rationalization for not 
fulfilling its GST promise. Atlantic Canada has to pay for the 
government's broken promise. Atlantic Canadians have to pay 
literally out of their own pockets for this broken promise. But that 
is not all. Right now we are only talking about the large chains. 
What about the small businesses?
<P>
	Greenberg stores is not a large company and it is laying off 79 
people with another 71 possibly going. The other day I heard a 
story about a Halifax businessman who sells magazines. 
Approximately 8,500 journals come into his store on a weekly or 
monthly basis. Because of this legislation he will have to change 
the price on every one of those magazines. I do not care how hard a 
person works, that cannot possibly be done every week.
<P>
	Does the government care about all these common sense 
objections to this deal? Again the government members are 
strangely silent. Where are the members from Atlantic Canada? 
Where is the member for Halifax who sits in this place and so often 
speaks up? She is  strangely silent. Not a word. Why are they not 
standing up for their constituents? Why are they not standing up 
when they know it will cost jobs, when it means higher costs for 
consumers? I would think that is a basic responsibility of any 
member of Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	What about the defence minister? He represents a riding in 
which one of the Greenberg stores closed. Should he not be on his 
feet as a cabinet minister? Should he not be defending his own 
people?
<P>
	I cannot believe they are allowing this to be pushed through on 
closure without so much as saying this is wrong, we have to at least 
fix some of the details. They are silent.
<P>
	Other bodies have spoken of the problems this will cause in 
Atlantic Canada as well. The Real Estate Association of Canada 
talks about a $4,000 increase in the cost of a new house in Atlantic 
Canada. What is the government doing?
<P>
	There has been no initiative from the government coming 
forward and saying ``we are going to deal with that, we will fix it''. 
It is going to let the people of Atlantic Canada bear a $4,000 
increase in the cost of a new House simply because it had to rush 
through that deal to try to save the Deputy Prime Minister. That is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	If you make a mistake, as the government, if you break a 
promise, why do you not acknowledge that you have broken a 
promise, throw yourself at the mercy of the electorate and take 
your medicine? To try to somehow cover it up and then make 
people in Atlantic Canada, the most vulnerable economy in the 
country, pay for it is cruel. I do not know how else to put it.
<P>
	As we near the end of this debate, sadly the government has 
pushed through closure. I urge hon. members across the way to 
somehow screw up the courage to stand and defend their own 
constituents. Sixteen thousand people in New Brunswick alone 
have signed one petition in opposition to this legislation.
<P>
	If hon. members across the way will not listen to me and my 
colleagues in the Reform Party, perhaps they can somehow find it 
in their hearts to listen to their own constituents. That is the least 
the people of Atlantic Canada can expect from their MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today we are debating a bill that has come up very suddenly. It is a 
bill that, as of last week, was not even on the government agenda, 
the so-called GST harmonization bill, really the GST hiding bill 
that the government is trying to now push through as quickly as 
possible while people in the country are busy getting ready for 
Christmas and have their minds on other things. It is very typical of 
this government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7285"> 7285 </A></B>
<P>
	There are four main concerns that Reform has about this bill. 
One is that this new form of the GST will kill jobs. It is bad for 
business, it will kill jobs. This is in a part of the country that can 
least afford to have this kind of action taken against its economy.
<P>
	Second, this new form of GST that the Liberals are ramming 
through the House is bad for consumers because it will 
substantially raise the cost of many goods.
<P>
	We know our economy is driven 60 per cent by consumer 
spending. Now we will have even more difficulty, even more of a 
burden placed on the backs of consumers who are trying to provide 
the necessities for themselves and their families.
<P>
	Third, this new form of GST that the Liberals are pushing 
through in Atlantic Canada is bad for taxpayers because it means 
that taxes will be increased.
<P>
	The fourth thing is that this new form of GST being put forward 
by the Liberals is breaking a Liberal election promise, a strong, 
unequivocal, firm, clear commitment by this Liberal government 
to scrap, kill and abolish the GST.
<P>
	These broken promises continue to disconnect Canadians from 
the electoral process, increasing the level of cynicism and 
increasing the level of distrust and disrespect for elected people 
and for the institutions of government. This is a very worrisome 
and sad situation in this country.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	This bill was put forward and then closure was immediately 
voted through the House. The government is sneaking this bill 
through. Invoking closure yet again, as I said the last time I spoke 
on a closure bill, this seems to be a weekly if not almost daily 
occurrence by this government. It is disrespecting the democratic 
checks and balances of our system to simply push its agenda 
through with as little opposition and as little opportunity for 
examination as possible. This is not democracy as it was meant to 
be.
<P>
	I will not repeat some of the concerns that I raised in my last 
speech in this House on this issue except to say that Canadians who 
are watching the proceedings of the House on a daily or occasional 
basis need to take note of how this government is arrogantly and 
undemocratically flouting the conventions and the democratic 
checks and balances that have been put into place. I believe we are 
going to be paying a heavy price for this increasing erosion of the 
democratic process in our country.
<P>
	In 1990 a member of Parliament who is sitting on the 
government side and also sitting in cabinet said: ``The goods and 
services tax is a regressive tax. It has to be scrapped and we will 
scrap it''. The minister of defence now has a different tune to sing 
just five or six years later. He had the chance to keep strongly made 
promises, to act on the outrage that he and many of his colleagues  
expressed about the Conservative government GST and now he is 
totally backtracking and not to be heard from in this debate. The 
present minister of defence did not say: ``It must be harmonized 
and we will harmonize it''. No, he said: ``It has to be scrapped and 
we will scrap it''.
<P>
	On May 2, 1994 the Prime Minister said with regard to the GST: 
``We hate it and we will kill it''. Now he is saying ``we really like it 
and we will bring it back in a form that will gouge even more 
money out of taxpayers and citizens in the Atlantic provinces''.
<P>
	When the government fails to carry out these clear election 
promises, these clear representations to Canadians who place their 
faith, trust and confidence in this government and in government 
members, Canadians feel increased cynicism with their 
government and their country. This is something that is very 
disturbing and it is going to be a very difficult situation to deal with 
as time goes on.
<P>
	I would like to spend a few minutes talking about an aspect of 
this new replacement GST of the Liberals called a notional input 
tax credit. At present when a good or service is introduced into 
economy the GST is paid on those goods. When the goods go 
through the economy again in the form of used goods, the GST 
does not have to be paid on that good because it was already paid 
the first time it came into the economy. That was in the past.
<P>
	The Liberals have seen a golden opportunity to vacuum even 
more money out of the economy to fund its waste and its spending 
and its inefficient, bloated government. Now when a consumer 
buys a used product he will end up paying the GST yet again even 
though the GST has already been paid. In fact, that GST will be 
paid over and over every time there is a transaction involving those 
goods. This is something called tax cascading, which is kind of a 
nice term. Canadians would probably call it stacking the taxes, a 
tax on tax on tax. In fact, the taxpayer will have to pay tax twice, 
three times, four times and maybe more on the same goods.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	This is nothing more than another Liberal tax grab. It is also 
sneaky because the Liberals have not introduced this increased tax 
take. The honest way is to put the tax bill before the House and 
have it properly debated. It simply changed the definition of what 
the GST will apply to. The GST will be paid over and over.
<P>
	This will have a very negative effect on any business dealing 
with used goods. It will kill jobs, raise consumer prices and suck 
more tax dollars from the pockets of Canadians. There is very little 
profit in many of these businesses already.
<P>
	We know and the Liberals have acknowledged time and time 
again that taxes kill jobs. For example, the Liberals said that taxes 
on employment income, taxes such as UI premiums, make it more 
difficult for  businesses to operate at a profit, to expand their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7286"> 7286 </A></B>
<P>
economic activities and for the economy to grow and to create 
business and employment opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	Yet we see that taxes are something that the Liberals simply 
cannot do without. There have been over 35 tax increases in one 
way or another from this government in its years in office. Its total 
tax take has grown by $28 billion over its term in office; $28 billion 
that the government is taking out of the pockets of Canadians, out 
of the hands of business people, job creators and entrepreneurs and 
investors, workers and consumers, and putting it into the hands of 
politicians and bureaucrats. It is no wonder we continue to have an 
abysmally high rate of unemployment in the country. It is no 
wonder that Canadians have to work harder and harder and find less 
and less discretionary disposable income and find it more difficult 
to make ends meet.
<P>
	The standard of living of all Canadians is being lowered. The 
Liberal government is making a big show, a big production out of 
caring about the rate of poverty and the children in our country who 
are living in poverty. At the same time, it is pushing through 
measures such as this which contribute to the increasing poverty of 
members of our society, taking more taxes from the most 
vulnerable members of our society by this type of tax increase and 
doing it in a very hurried way to make sure that people do not see 
what is going on.
<P>
	There is a lot of misinformation, a lot of distortion by members 
opposite when they get up to speak, trying to cover up what is 
really happening. However, we need to get the message out to 
Canadians that this is not the way to attack child poverty in this 
country. It is not a way to give the poorest and most vulnerable 
members of our society a leg up. It is only a way to get more money 
into the pockets of the government.
<P>
	The harmonization is a red herring, a feeble attempt to convince 
taxpayers that the Liberals have kept their GST promise. Other 
provinces have been clever enough to see through this and have 
rejected this scheme. I urge the House to reject this scheme and to 
protect the people in the Atlantic provinces from this kind of tax 
grab on the backs of Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to tell Quebecers and Canadians that there are three 
good reasons why Bill C-70 ought not to be passed by the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The first, and perhaps the most serious, is that it sends a very 
ambiguous message to Canadians and Quebecers about what this 
government's word is worth. During the last campaign, they were 
saying that they were going to scrap the GST, that it would no 
longer exist, that they would make it disappear. Once in power, 
they began to  hum and haw and to mark time, but in the end they 
did not respect their contract with the voters.
<P>
	Running for office is like signing a contract with each voter, 
stating what one commits to doing, what one commits to 
defending, and, if elected, one will respect that contract. There is a 
very ambiguous, and very negative, message being sent to all those 
who might think of getting into politics: this government says one 
thing while campaigning to get elected, and does another once in 
power. It did the same thing with job creation and unemployment 
insurance. This is totally unacceptable, and very bad for 
democracy.
<P>
	In the next election campaign, when the Liberal candidates come 
knocking on the doors of Quebecers, voters will be entitled to ask 
whether what is set out in their platform is true, if their actions will 
match their words, if all their commitments are merely a smoke 
screen to win votes so they can do as they please as soon as the 
election is over. The Liberals will have a real problem relating to 
this question of a systematic lack of respect for the promises they 
have made on major issues.
<P>
	The second element, and this is particularly true for Quebecers, 
is the frustration that is felt when we see one billion dollars in 
compensation-no one on the other side of the House has 
questioned the accuracy of this figure-given to three Maritime 
provinces for harmonizing the GST.
<P>
	Harmonization is all very well, but I think we should realize that 
this is a repeat of an age-old practice of Canadian federalism, 
which is to try and cure the ills of one region in Canada at the 
expense of the other regions, in an attempt to buy political peace. 
After introducing employment insurance reform that penalizes the 
maritimes and eastern Quebec to a considerable degree, a form of 
compensation has been found, a kind of pacifier for the people of 
the maritimes. They are offered compensation for harmonizing the 
GST.
<P>
	However, Quebec, which proceeded with this harmonization 
several years ago, did not receive any compensation at all. Quebec 
did its job and made the system work. All public servants who 
administer the GST are with the Department of Revenue in Quebec 
City, and they remit the amounts to Ottawa. It all works without 
any compensation. Here again, we see the double standard we have 
seen so often in the history of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	This has some major economic impacts. We use this, for 
instance, in the new riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata-Les Basques, 
where the Témiscouata area borders on New Brunswick. This is 
one of many measures we are evaluating to find out how federal 
monies get to New Brunswick and how they get to Quebec, and 
whether these two parts of Canada are being treated equally. The 
study we are doing now focuses on all grants and assistance 
programs currently available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7287"> 7287 </A></B>
<P>
	We have here a clear example of a situation that may lead to 
unfair competition between two regions. One government will 
receive funding to harmonize the tax, while the other did not. 
There will necessarily be additional costs for the Quebec 
government. Products from New Brunswick will be more 
attractive because of the federal government's compensation, 
which was not given to the Government of Quebec. There is an 
injustice here that warrants our criticism.
<P>
	In its concern for tarting up the transformation of the GST, the 
federal government was prepared to pay any price for peace. The 
people of the maritimes won the jackpot. The people of Quebec, 
however, did not come begging, saw no need for compensation and 
harmonized the taxes at no cost to the government. Western Canada 
did not harmonize.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The situation has therefore created several Canadas. It does not 
work. It proves that, when the federal system is allowed to run on 
its own, this is the sort of monster we end up with. There will be 
two different types of taxation in two bordering provinces: in the 
maritimes, the taxation system is subsidized by the federal 
government; in Quebec, the federal government did not subsidize 
harmonization. Double standards are still unacceptable.
<P>
	I would like to take the few minutes I have left to point out that 
this bill represents what I would call a partial win for the Bloc 
Quebecois. Those members who represented the Bloc Quebecois 
before the 1993 election had systematically made representations 
to ensure that the GST would not apply to books.
<P>
	After all the representations that have been made, the bill before 
us today provides that books bought by groups involved in literacy 
programs, libraries and similar organizations will be tax free. 
Because of the major cultural impact books have on our society, the 
Bloc Quebecois feels that all books should be free of tax.
<P>
	I think we should keep up the fight because, as we can see, this 
would benefit not only Quebec but all of Canada. English Canadian 
culture certainly needs help in holding its own against American 
culture. Because markets are permeable and the fact that the same 
language is used in English Canada and in the U.S., books are 
among the main tools used to spread culture. This would have been 
an opportunity to give books published in Canada an edge, by not 
subjecting them to tax. Any way you look at it, the propagation of 
knowledge benefits society as a whole. But this is not reflected in 
the bill.
<P>
	I think the government could show its good will by making all 
books tax-free. I think all Quebecers and Canadians would gain 
from it. This is a measure that will probably be discussed in the 
next election campaign. At that time, we will have to make sure 
that each party will honour its commitments.
<P>
	This Liberal government will certainly have a major credibility 
problem during the election campaign, primarily because of issues 
such as the GST, employment insurance and the promise to create 
jobs. The current unemployment rate, which remains above 10 per 
cent, is the highest in a number of years. This figure includes 
people who are actually looking for work, but not those who have 
given up because they were unable to find jobs.
<P>
	There is a shameless waste of human resources in our society. 
Changing this situation must be our governments' top priority. We 
have no idea what kind of commitments this government will make 
the next time. What is more important though is whether or not it 
will fulfil these commitments.
<P>
	If the past is any indication of the future, it is not encouraging for 
Canadian voters, because each time they will have to decide 
whether or not to believe in a Liberal government commitment, 
they will remember that the Liberals did not do what they had 
pledged to do with the GST, and with employment insurance, as 
they simply implemented the reform prepared by the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	As for employment itself, again the commitments made were not 
fulfilled. The morning after the election, the Liberal government 
set out to tackle the deficit. This was fine, but in the process it 
overlooked another obligation, which is to ensure that our society's 
human potential is being used. In this sense, the bill before us is 
disappointing. It perpetuates an inequity in the Canadian federal 
system, which is the fact that different parts of the country are 
treated differently.
<P>
	In western Canada, the government is subsidizing an airline 
company that has trouble making profits because of a major 
management problem, while in Atlantic Canada it gives a 
compensation of $1 billion to harmonize the GST. In the middle, 
there is Quebec, which made real efforts to harmonize its tax, but 
which is not getting the benefits that other provinces are receiving.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	When will fairness prevail? I do not believe the solution to this 
problem lies in the current federal system. In any case, I am asking 
Quebec and Canadian voters to be very demanding, during the next 
election campaign, regarding the commitments that will be made 
by Liberal candidates.
<P>
	The evidence is before us: This government had pledged to 
eliminate the GST, but instead it comes up with cosmetic changes. 
The GST is still here and the commitment made during the election 
campaign was not fulfilled. This is why I feel the House should 
reject this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-70 is the harmonization of the sales tax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7288"> 7288 </A></B>
<P>
	I could not help but think about the word harmonize. It comes 
from the word harmony. Harmony means to create agreement, 
concord, to create an apt or aesthetic arrangement of parts. It is 
a progression of chords, to use a musical definition, to produce 
a pleasing effect. To harmonize then would be to make a form that 
is pleasing and to provide a consistent whole, to add notes to a 
melody to produce harmony and to bring into being or to create 
harmony.
<P>
	I thought to myself, I have heard a lot about this sales tax and it 
seems that none of those definitions really apply to this particular 
development. I looked up the antonym of harmonize. The antonym 
of harmonize is discord. Discord means to have disagreement, 
strife, to disagree or to quarrel, to be different or to be inconsistent.
<P>
	I thought to myself, which of those two words best describes the 
harmonized sales tax? Harmony, a consistent aesthetically pleasing 
whole where the parts agree with one another or discord, where 
there is disagreement, strife and division. I came to the conclusion 
that this tax has the wrong name. It should be called the discord tax 
or government by discord, not harmony. It is creating the opposite.
<P>
	Does it provide a beautiful, harmonious sound of working 
together in a melody of taxation? I do not think so. I am reminded 
of the member for Mississauga West. What did she say? She said 
that the people hate, they do not just dislike the GST, they hate it. 
Most people that I know like harmony and hate discord. It strikes 
me that is probably the situation.
<P>
	The other word that comes up and is a source with regard to 
harmony says it creates peace. There is all kinds of evidence that 
this has done anything but create peace. It looks like it does not 
even have the potential of creating accord.
<P>
	This is a tax of discord. It has created conflict among provinces. 
It has created conflicts between provinces and Ottawa. It has 
created conflicts among citizens. It has created conflicts between 
government and business. It has created conflicts between 
consumers and retailers. How many more conflicts do we want? 
And they call that harmonization. It is the exact opposite of 
harmonization.
<P>
	How is it possible that all these kinds of conflicts could occur? 
How does that happen? First of all it costs more. Can you imagine, 
Mr. Speaker, that three major retailers in Atlantic Canada have 
stated that their net annual deficit will total $27 million once 
harmonization is implemented? Are you aware that the Retail 
Council of Canada has said that by forcing stores to bury the new 
tax prices, the harmonization tax regime will cost retailers at least 
$100 million a year? That is the implementation of the tax. That is 
not revenue for the government.
<P>
	Why? Because there will be a duplication of information 
systems and the rewriting of software, the  repricing of prepriced 
goods, the duplication of advertising costs as it goes from the 
various catalogues and the various brochures that have gone out to 
the various consumers, the warehousing and distribution costs. 
That is no small cost.
<P>
	Then a study was done by Ernst &amp; Young. This very reputable 
national accounting firm said that a midsize national chain with 50 
stores in the Atlantic provinces would pay up to $3 million in 
one-time costs. Those 50 stores would pay $3 million in start-up 
costs. After that they would pay $1.1 million per year to comply 
with the regional tax in price sales system, which we know means 
that the total price includes the tax. The amount of tax paid is 
hidden in the price on an article when it is taken to the cashier.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Real Estate Association says that harmonization 
will increase the cost of a new house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland and by $3,374 in New Brunswick. All the nice 
young families will just love having to pay an extra $4,000, will 
they not? The answer is no they will not.
<P>
	Consumers will pay more for funeral services, for their 
children's clothing, for auto repairs, electricity, gasoline and home 
heating fuel to mention only a few of the things that will cost more.
<P>
	The more severe problem is that it does not abolish the GST.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston said it best. He said it 
quickly and concisely as he is able to do. He said: ``Scrapping and 
harmonization are not synonyms. Harmonization is a red herring''. 
How accurate he was and how clearly he described exactly what is 
going on.
<P>
	It also makes a lie out of statements such as when in 1990 the 
current Minister of Finance said: ``I would abolish the GST. The 
manufacturers sales tax is a bad tax and there is no excuse to repeat 
one bad thing by bringing in another one''. That was six years ago.
<P>
	In 1994, four years later, after the Liberal Party formed the 
Government of Canada, the Prime Minister said: ``We hate it and 
we will kill it''.
<P>
	In 1995, a year later, a Liberal backbencher, the hon. member for 
Mississauga West, said: ``I think the GST is going to become a hot 
point. I think if we do not do something about it our credibility is 
gone. People in my riding hate the GST. It is not one of those mild 
`we do not like it', they hate it. If the GST is merged with 
provincial sales taxes voters will not be satisfied unless the overall 
tax take is simultaneously reduced''.
<P>
	It is already clear that all of those statements have been proven to 
be false.
<P>
	I want to move to the next rather significant development which 
took place in August 1995. Going back to the Minister of Finance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7289"> 7289 </A></B>
<P>
who in 1990 said that it  was a bad tax, he said in August 1995: ``I 
think it is very clear that what small business wants and what 
consumers want is a harmonized tax''. Was he listening to the 
people?
<P>
	Is the minister listening to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia 
now? Is he listening to the people of Alberta? Is he listening to the 
people of Ontario? Is he listening to the people of British 
Columbia? If he were, there is no way he could make that statement 
and say that he is telling the truth. I do not know to whom he is 
talking. He is talking to somebody, but it is clearly somebody other 
than the people to whom I have just referred. It cannot be an honest 
statement. Either he has been listening to different people or he is 
deliberately misrepresenting what he heard the people to say.
<P>
	We need to go beyond that. This harmonized tax violates good 
government. It violates good management practices like the 
province of Alberta has put into place. In that province there is no 
provincial sales tax. Why? Because Alberta was able to balance its 
budget without a sales tax. That is a lesson not only this 
government should learn, but every provincial government should 
learn as well. The harmonization tax does not permit and reward 
good government and good practice.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	After all that, we also have to conclude that this tax is a bad deal. 
The Atlantic provinces were bribed with a $1 billion infusion of 
borrowed money which future taxpayers will have to pay for.
<P>
	Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia refuse to get involved. 
They are not even willing to talk about harmonization. The support 
is weak in Saskatchewan and in Prince Edward Island. That is 
harmonization? That is harmony? That is accord? That is creating 
peace? It is the exact opposite. It is divisive. It is conflicting. It is 
strife engendering. That is what it is. It is a bad deal.
<P>
	The Ontario Minister of Finance said that the blended sales tax 
using the GST base would cost Ontarians over $3 billion in extra 
taxes. He has put the kibosh on any harmonization talk and scheme 
in this province. That is the issue which is at stake here in this bill.
<P>
	It was done to give the government the appearance that somehow 
it has dealt with the GST and that somehow it would make people 
think the GST has been abolished. How ignorant, how stupid does 
the government think the people of Canada are? The people of 
Canada are anything but stupid and neither are they unable to 
understand what is going on in this issue. It is very significant.
<P>
	One more thing. How did the Liberals do it? They made it 
incomprehensible. I draw attention to Bill C-70, 335 pages of what 
the harmonization tax is about. It is not to say anything about the 
income tax act which is over 2,000 pages long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, in the 
little time I have allocated to me today I would like to talk about the 
so-called harmonization of the GST from two different points of 
view. I will talk about the deal itself and the fact that it is a bad 
deal, that it will hurt business and kill jobs in Atlantic Canada and 
across the country. Also, I will talk about the lack of integrity in 
government. The more important part of my presentation today 
will be to point out that this government has completely lacked 
integrity on this and a lot of other issues and Canadians should find 
this unacceptable.
<P>
	First, about the deal itself, it is clearly a bad deal for business. 
The premiers of the Atlantic provinces had to be bribed with a 
billion dollars just to accept this deal. Of course Prince Edward 
Island has not accepted it. The Liberal Government of Prince 
Edward Island was defeated recently partly because of the 
consideration of this deal. Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia 
have completely refused to talk about the issue, while 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island really have 
been less than positive about the deal.
<P>
	To accurately call this harmonization of sales taxes, it would 
have to apply right across the country. What we have is a deal only 
for three Atlantic Canadian provinces. That hardly makes for 
harmonization of the GST. Let us not call it harmonization. Let us 
talk about it for what it really is.
<P>
	The Ontario finance minister said that this deal will cost 
Ontarians over $3 billion. That is a lot of money. I am sure the 
people of Ontario who elected many of the Liberal MPs on their 
promise of abolishing the GST must be very upset about what has 
happened here. Not only has the promise to abolish, scrap, kill the 
GST been broken, but in an attempt to cover up this broken promise 
according to the finance minister of Ontario, it will cost the people 
of Ontario $3 billion just for the deal with the Atlantic provinces. 
The people of Ontario cannot possibly be very happy about this.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	This policy demonstrates what has already been demonstrated by 
this government many times before: the lack of a broad vision, the 
lack of well thought out comprehensive policy on issues. Too often 
we have had piecemeal legislation, which is the case again here. 
This legislation applies to only three provinces out of the ten. It is 
called harmonization but clearly it is not.
<P>
	What will this legislation do for businesses and jobs? This is the 
most important issue to consider in terms of this deal. It will be a 
big job killer. Several people who are involved and who will be 
affected by this deal have made that clear.
<P>
	The three major retailers in Atlantic Canada have stated that the 
annual retail deficit will total $27 million once harmonization is 
implemented. One private sector  retailer in Atlantic Canada was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7290"> 7290 </A></B>
<P>
contemplating opening two more stores in 1997 but has scrapped 
that plan because of this deal. That means jobs lost.
<P>
	Both privately owned and publicly traded stores are reluctant to 
explain the problems they face as a result of harmonization so as 
not to jeopardize customer confidence and the value of their stock. 
They must be careful in even talking about the effects of this deal.
<P>
	However, the Retail Council of Canada has said that in forcing 
stores to bury the new so-called harmonized tax, the harmonized 
tax regime will cost retailers $100 million a year. Not only is this 
so-called harmonization which affects only three Atlantic 
provinces going to cost the other Canadian provinces $1 billion 
over the next three years, but it will also cost Atlantic Canada 
retailers $100 million. That will mean job losses. Business people 
will have to work even more hours which will mean more time 
away from their families. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	An article in the December 4 <I>Globe and Mail</I> discussed the 
so-called harmonization and some of its impacts. It stated that the 
major increases will be on items such as home heating fuel and 
clothing which will be taxed at 15 per cent instead of the 7 per cent 
GST that is now applied. The tax will increase on essential items 
that nobody can avoid buying, such as heating fuel and clothing, 
and this will drive the prices up substantially.
<P>
	In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> article the Retail Council of Canada said 
that businesses will have to spend $28 million to get their pricing 
systems ready by April 7. ``This is a huge blow to Atlantic 
retailers'', said Peter Woolford, senior vice-president of the 
council. ``Retail profits average about 2 per cent of sales'', he said, 
and this is going to cut even further into those narrow margins.
<P>
	Mr. O'Brien, Atlantic director for the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, said that in the case of one magazine store in 
Halifax, the owner will have to change the prices on as many as 
8,500 journals a week. We are not talking about some 
megabusiness but about one small business owner who will have to 
change the prices on 8,500 journals a week. His comment is that he 
will have to work another seven hours a week when he is already 
working 70 hours a week. This is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	It is completely unacceptable to make changes that will make for 
more totally non-productive work for business owners and that will 
extend the hours of already overworked business owners, operators 
and workers in this country. We need less government interference. 
These people need more time to spend with their families. Clearly 
this bill will mean just the opposite in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Of course it has an impact across the country. A billion dollar 
increase in costs will mean more taxes for  Canadians in other 
provinces. That means more working hours and less time to spend 
with families. This will damage the already strained situation of 
families.
<P>
	I would like to close by talking about lack of integrity in 
government. I want to begin with some quotes from the Prime 
Minister and the finance minister in 1990, when they were getting 
into full gear for the election campaign.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said in the Toronto <I>Star</I> in 1990: ``The 
Liberals will scrap the goods and services tax if they win the next 
general election, leader Jean Chrétien says. `I am opposed to the 
GST, I have always been opposed to it and I will be opposed to it 
always'''.
<P>
	From the finance minister: ``I would abolish the GST'', April 4, 
1990.
<P>
	Then in 1992 as we got into the heat of the election campaign the 
Liberal leader was quoted in the Toronto <I>Star</I>, December 21, 1992: 
``With the federal election only months away Liberal leader Jean 
Chrétien faces two questions that are being posed with increasing 
urgency. Does he stand by his word to scrap the goods and services 
tax? The answer was given by the Prime Minister's 
communications director, Peter Donalo when he said that the leader 
is committed to doing away with the thing and to tell Canadians 
before the election where he would make up the money''. Of 
course, that has not happened. It is totally unacceptable that has not 
happened. A promise was made and clearly the promise has been 
broken.
<P>
	In closing I would like to quote a comment from the member for 
Kingston and the Islands at a meeting here in Ottawa. When the 
member for Kingston and the Islands was asked about the GST and 
the fact that a promise had been broken, his comments was: ``We 
changed our minds''. I do not think Canadians will view it with that 
levity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, before I get into any 
remarks that I would call GST specific, I would like to comment on 
something that is happening here today, which is the use of time 
allocation again by the Liberal government on this debate. That 
makes 26 times that this heavy handed throttling of Parliament has 
been practised by this government.
<P>
	It is a rather curious phenomenon that is taking place. It actually 
started in the Trudeau years. His was the first government in 
Canadian history that opposed free speech in Parliament. It was the 
first government that began to routinely use time allocation and 
closure. Prior to the election of Mr. Trudeau, these two means of 
throttling debate had been used only 23 times in the entire history 
since Confederation. I think it was first used by Sir Robert Borden 
during the first world war.
<P>
	Then Mr. Trudeau came along and what did we get? Forty-four 
uses of time allocation or closure in 15 years.  That is a bit of an 
escalation. Then in the Mulroney years they were used 63 times in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7291"> 7291 </A></B>
<P>
eight years and nine months, a new record, a new champion on the 
block.
<P>
	But what is happening under the current Liberal government? It 
has only been in office for a short time, three years and one month. 
Already it has used time allocation or closure 31 times. This is 
unprecedented. It is contemptible that any government would treat 
any parliament in this manner.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Today the Liberals are showing their contempt for Parliament in 
two ways. One is through time allocation. The other is contempt for 
their fellow members in that only one of them has even bothered to 
come in and listen to this debate. I refuse to blow air into an empty 
room. I request a quorum count.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Please ring the 
bells.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We have 
quorum. The hon. member may continue with debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I find it rather 
hypocritical of the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia to call quorum when several members on this 
side of the House have been sitting here attentively and nothing on 
the Reform side, including the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> And the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We are 
resuming debate. The hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, I suppose I should feel guilty 
for disturbing the free lunch of the Liberals. In case they follow the 
usual practice of getting a quorum and then quietly sneaking out 
like naughty children evading the headmaster, I am prepared to 
stand here and call quorum all afternoon if necessary.
<P>
	With regard to the question of closure, it is unthinkable that the 
government of a democratic country could use this heavy-handed 
blunt instrument to bludgeon Parliament with the regularity that 
this government has done. I do not know what the final outcome 
will be. Perhaps at some point in the not too distant future it will 
simply dissolve Parliament and say: ``We do not need it any more. 
Let us have permanent closure, permanent time allocation'' 
because that is the Liberal idea of the democratic process.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Remember, 31 times it has moved time allocation or closure in 
the short period of three years and one month. That is one-third 
more times than those blunt instruments were used in the entire 
pre-Trudeau era in this Parliament, back in the days when people 
actually  believed in democracy and when Parliament was still a 
place where people came together to debate the issues and arrived 
at conclusions.
<P>
	With respect to this marvellous HST that is being brought in by 
this bill in the Atlantic provinces, it is pretty easy to see why the 
government is so desperate to hide the GST. However, it is only 
going to be able to hide it in three provinces because nobody else is 
willing to get on board.
<P>
	I would like to quote a comment by the hon. member for 
Mississauga West with respect to the GST. She said: ``I keep 
hearing from the finance department that Canadians are getting 
used to the GST and now accept it. If anyone really believes that I 
do not think they are in touch with reality''. Bravo to the member 
for Mississauga West because she sure had that right.
<P>
	Then the hon. finance minister said: ``We have to do something 
about this GST because we made a mistake. We are sorry, but it was 
an honest mistake''. That is not good enough. Let us face it, despite 
their public pronouncements, the Liberals never had any intention 
of killing the GST. Instead they had this cockamamie plan to run 
around and hide it, meld it in with provincial sales taxes and then 
maybe nobody would notice. Long term planning, harmonization 
of the dreaded GST.
<P>
	The fact that it is going to cost citizens of the three 
non-harmonized provinces something in the order of $900 million 
in subsidies does not bother this government. What does it care, it 
is only money and this is a Liberal government. It is going to hurt 
small businesses in the three Atlantic provinces. What does the 
government care, it is not in business. It is made up of politicians 
and politicians do not care what happens behind that cash register. 
We are going to have it because the hammer has been brought 
down. Democratic debate has again been forbidden in this place 
which was designed for the democratic debating of the issues.
<P>
	I see the Speaker is signalling me, my time being up. I do thank 
all of those good Liberals who allowed their lunch to get very 
slightly cold. Members will notice that I did not fulfil my threat of 
continuously calling quorum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is good to hear that Saskatchewan is being 
heard from in the House of Commons this afternoon. I know 
Saskatchewan has some pretty strong views on taxation. We know 
a lot about paying taxes. Like many Canadians, we feel we pay 
more than our fair share of taxes. We are not very excited about Bill 
C-70, to harmonize or blend the sales taxes.
<P>
	We have talked about the Liberals a lot in the House of 
Commons. It sounds like a broken record but it is not. It is broken 
promises which are serious business. It is important for Canadians 
to know that Reformers are holding the Liberals accountable for 
their broken promises here in the House of Commons. I think this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7292"> 7292 </A></B>
<P>
has  been said a number of times but it needs to be repeated because 
these are important people who have made these statements.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The current finance minister on April 4, 1990 when he was 
sitting on this side in opposition said: ``I would abolish the GST''. 
That is pretty plain and simple. I can understand that. Canadians 
understood that and they elected a Liberal government because 
they had a pretty good hunch that the current finance minister 
would hold that position in a Liberal government.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister on September 27, 1990, just a few 
days after his finance minister had made that statement, said: ``I 
want the tax dead''. I know when something is dead. Coming from 
the farm I have seen dead animals. We bury them and they are no 
more. They are gone. They are forgotten and we do not deal with 
them any longer.
<P>
	The GST is not dead. It is alive and kicking. In fact, it is growing 
new hands. It is going to pick more pockets through a blended sales 
tax, a BST. That is a fitting name for the Liberals' approach to tax 
reform, call it BST. Again, coming from the farm I know what BS 
is and this is an accurate name for this sales tax.
<P>
	I want to tell the House about what is happening in 
Saskatchewan. We already have a 9 per cent sales tax, one of the 
higher sales taxes in Canada. There is only a province or two with a 
higher sales tax. We take the GST of 7 per cent and add it to our 
provincial sales tax and we have got 16 per cent or actually a little 
over 16 per cent sales tax on most of the goods we purchase. If it is 
services, because it is not a blended sales tax, we pay only the GST. 
As as farmer, if I go to my accountant or if I take a piece of 
machinery to a mechanic for repair or, as we all do if we have to get 
a haircut, we pay the GST but we do not pay the PST. It is on goods 
only.
<P>
	Liberals think that they are not getting enough revenue from 
taxes and they have to blend it so that the provinces and the federal 
government can extract more from us, particularly in the service 
industry which all of us rely on so much.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do? They thought the provinces would just 
jump at this chance of having a blended sales tax. They forgot one 
thing. Provincial governments also have to get elected. They were 
concerned and said ``how are we going to sell this BST, taxes going 
up on new items that currently are not being taxed or at least taxed 
at as high a level as it would be under a blended sales tax?'' There 
is a little problem with the provinces. They did not jump on board.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister could not keep her promise and had 
to resign, albeit a rather odd resignation, having done a poll first to 
see whether she could get re-elected before she resigned. I guess 
that is the way the Liberals think. Put honour at the bottom of  the 
list and check out expediency and pragmatic opportunity first.
<P>
	In any event, so be it. The Liberals were in trouble over the 
reform of the sales tax. Killing the GST was out of the question. 
They were trying to cloak that in some new scheme called blending 
or harmonizing the sales tax. They finally were able to sell it by 
offering three Atlantic provinces $1 billion. Whose dollars? A 
billion of our dollars, taxpayer dollars, to blend this new sales tax.
<P>
	The Liberal premiers of the Atlantic provinces went along with 
this buyout. Suddenly they found out that Atlantic Canadians were 
not so excited about it. They realized that the bottom line is they 
are going to pay higher taxes. One province did not go along with it 
because of course that province had to go to the electorate sooner 
than any other province, the province of Prince Edward Island. The 
Liberals found out that they were not very popular in Prince 
Edward Island as that government went down to defeat. I believe 
that the blended sales tax was a part of the reason the Liberals' ship 
sank in Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	We have an NDP government in Saskatchewan. Believe me, 
NDP governments know how to tax. They like to tax about as much 
as Liberals do. We have a 9 per cent sales tax in Saskatchewan. We 
are killing jobs and sending business to Alberta where there is no 
provincial sales tax. We have high taxes on our phone bills; we 
have high taxes on our power bills and the rates are going up; we 
have increased our gasoline tax, meanwhile our roads are in 
shambles; we have a high provincial income tax; provincial crown 
leases have increased; municipal reassessment is being done in 
Saskatchewan, which is increasing the cost to the taxpayers. Of 
course the taxpayer, no matter what level of government it is, is the 
same person.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The NDP got a sudden shock in Saskatchewan the other day 
when it lost a byelection in North Battleford, a seat it had held for 
most of the last 40 years. People in Saskatchewan were telling the 
NDP that they do not like the high taxes. They do not like the NDP 
nickeling and diming them to death. They are not prepared to pay 
more and more for less and less. Surprise, surprise. In 
Saskatchewan the NDP lost a safe seat. A new Liberal MLA was 
elected in the riding of North Battleford.
<P>
	The Liberals have also selected a new provincial leader. Of 
course they have had all kinds of problems. They have been 
shooting each other in the foot and stabbing one another in the 
back, as Liberals are prone to do once in a while. Out of the whole 
mess they had to choose a new leader. What did the new provincial 
Liberal leader in Saskatchewan pronounce almost at the beginning 
of his mandate? He said: ``I think we should harmonize the federal 
and provincial sales taxes''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7293"> 7293 </A></B>
<P>
	I was jumping for joy. That will ensure that Liberals will not 
be re-elected as members of Parliament for Saskatchewan. 
Saskatchewans simply do not want higher taxes on services. We 
are opposed to it. I believe the Liberal leader is already 
backtracking. In later press releases and interviews he has talked 
about reducing the provincial sales tax more than he has about 
blending or harmonizing the federal and provincial sales taxes. 
Politicians, when they make as big a blunder as the new Liberal 
leader made, are pretty quick to change their ways before they 
totally annihilate their political future.
<P>
	Harmonizing, he thought, would save Saskatchewan taxpayers 
money. Obviously Saskatchewan people do not think so. That is 
why he is changing his tune and talking about tax relief rather than 
a new tax.
<P>
	Where did he get the idea that tax relief might be sold to 
Canadians? He has probably looked at Reform's fresh start, for one 
thing. He has probably listened to the people, the common sense of 
the common people, who are saying ``we do not want more taxes, 
we do not want to see how imaginative you can be by introducing 
some kind of harmonized sales tax''.
<P>
	What Reform has offered Saskatchewan is not some new 
program, not a new tax scheme. It has offered tax relief. In the case 
of the province of Saskatchewan it would mean that $440 million 
would be left in taxpayer pockets. That is money they would not 
have to send to Ottawa.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan we send everything out of the province. We 
send our young people out of the province. We send our raw 
products out of the province. We send our opportunity and our 
future out of the province. We send our tax dollars out of the 
province. Only Reform has talked about leaving tax dollars in 
Saskatchewan, in the hands of the people of Saskatchewan, so that 
they can make the best decisions as to how that money will be 
spent. That idea is going over extremely well.
<P>
	We are looking at how we can keep things in Saskatchewan and 
how we can make that province grow. Reform has put forward a 
fresh start proposal which would leave $440 million in taxpayer 
pockets, rather than losing it through the BST, which was so aptly 
named by the Liberal Party.
<P>
	My time has just about expired, and so I will set the record 
straight. The NDP tax high, Liberals tax high, Reform spells tax 
relief. That is what Canadians want. That is what the people of 
Saskatchewan want. That is what the residents of 
Kindersley-Lloydminster want. That is why I am speaking on 
their behalf in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak on behalf of the residents in my area of the 
country on the GST issue. It was a very profound issue in the last 
election campaign.
<P>
	It is interesting and maybe not surprising that nary a Liberal will 
stand to try to explain, defend or otherwise obfuscate what they are 
doing about the blended GST, BST, HST or whatever they want to 
call it. Liberals today are hiding. They are laying low, hoping this 
will blow over. Of course it will blow over. It will blow over 
because the government forced closure again, for a record number 
of times. It is almost an admission of the incompetence of House 
management. They say ``we just cannot manage our affairs well 
enough to get this stuff through the House and what we have to do 
is force closure so there will not be any debate on these subjects''. 
We have seen that happen on routine bills, on very divisive bills 
and on very controversial bills. It does not seem to matter.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It seems to be that the routine now is bring in a bill. If they 
cannot manage their House time properly, they can cancel the 
debate. They do not let democracy interfere with the workings and 
machinations of the government. They just tell them how to vote in 
the backbench, cancel the debate and see if they can get away with 
it.
<P>
	So far if I could chastise for a moment the national media on this 
for letting them get away with this, it is beyond me. We stand up 
here and repeatedly say that this is not right, it is not fair, it is not 
due process. It is not a chance for Canadians to debate something as 
significant as the GST.
<P>
	Think back to when the GST was brought in. The bells rang for 
two weeks in this place. Things here were held up for two weeks. 
The Liberals were all in favour of that. Yet here today we are not 
allowed to debate for two days changes to the GST.
<P>
	It is a shame. It is a shame on the media, too, for not reporting it. 
It should be on the Liberals' case saying that democracy is not of 
interest to these people. It should be broadcasting that from coast to 
coast. It probably will not. I will leave it to the readers and the 
media watchers of the world to figure out why that is.
<P>
	I would like to talk today for just a couple of minutes about the 
politics of division that are being practised on that side of the 
House.
<P>
	My colleagues have gone through what is wrong with this tax per 
se, about the increased costs to the consumers, about how it is 
driving business out of Atlantic Canada, there very place where 
they are trying to draw business in, how it is a half baked scheme 
that does not have the support of the chambers of commerce and 
other business groups in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	That is already in <I>Hansard</I>. That is in the record but if I could 
talk a little today about why this bill is symbolic of the type of 
politics that seems to be acceptable to the Liberals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7294"> 7294 </A></B>
<P>
	What they have done here, of course, is pit one region of the 
country against the other. It is not a new idea for a Liberal. It is 
not new at all. They practice that pretty well constantly. ``Let us 
play Atlantic Canada against the rest of the country. Then we will 
go back to Atlantic Canada and try to buy its votes somehow. We 
will try to buy it off somehow and promise it something in the 
next election campaign. In the meantime, play one part of the 
country against the other''.
<P>
	We stand in the House and ask the Minister of Finance to explain 
himself when it is going to cost so many thousand jobs. He stands 
up and says ``the Reform Party hates Atlantic Canada''. The proof 
is in the pudding. This harmonized sales tax is going to hurt 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	In turn, the Liberals blame it somehow on the Reform Party. 
Who do they think brought in this tax, but the finance minister 
himself? Who thumbed their noses at the businesses in Atlantic 
Canada? The finance minister and the whole front bench.
<P>
	They do not mind, play one area against the rest. What about last 
year in my own province of British Columbia. British Columbia 
was trying to control its welfare costs. It brought in a residency 
requirement. The federal government said ``no way, if there is 
federal money involved, you have to have access for all Canadians 
through this federal program''. It fined British Columbia some $30 
some million for bringing in the residency requirement.
<P>
	It is interesting in Quebec now the fees for universities 
subsidized by the federal government are twice as high for 
non-Quebecers as they are for Quebecers. In other words, if 
someone from my province wants to go to la belle province and get 
their university education, their tuition fees are twice as high.
<P>
	Just to rub salt in their wounds, there are 50 countries of the 
world that can get cheaper rates at their universities than one can if 
from British Columbia. An argument on both sides of that equation 
can be made but the issue is why is it okay to punish British 
Columbia for having a made in B.C. policy. Maybe they should 
have. It is okay to punish there but do not say a word over here.
<P>
	When it comes to another province or another region, we will not 
say it. We will just let British Columbia take it in the ear.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	For that matter on the distinct society question itself, again 
symbolic of this government it says: ``We are going to push 
through the distinct society clause and it does not matter who 
protests. It does not matter whether British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario, the three largest provinces outside of Quebec are dead set 
against it, we are going to push it through''.
<P>
	The Liberals pushed the veto through the House of Commons, 
which makes it virtually impossible to ever change the 
Constitution. I do not know what kind of idea that was from the 
Prime Minister. It was made on a napkin at the parliamentary 
restaurant during lunch break, I guess.
<P>
	The minister brought in these proposals and said that they are 
going to be pushed through. The Quebec Liberal Party endorsed by 
the federal Liberal Party says: ``We have to have distinct society 
and we have to push it through''. What has that accomplished? The 
Bloc Quebecois, the Parti Quebecois and Mr. Bouchard all say it is 
nonsense anyway, that it is not going to solve anything, that it is not 
going to bring us together and that they are not going to believe in 
Canada more with this.
<P>
	They took it out west where I live and asked: ``Will you guys 
accept this in full?'' Eighty per cent of Canadians in my area of the 
country said: ``No way. We are not going to discuss this. We will 
discuss devolution of powers to all provinces, certainly. We will 
talk about a smaller role for the federal government, certainly. We 
will talk about areas of jurisdiction where there is overlap and we 
should get rid of that, certainly. But writing distinct society in our 
Constitution is just not going to happen''.
<P>
	The Liberals over there seem to think that by bringing in this 
controversial idea and by pushing it on the west and on Ontario it 
will somehow bring us all together, that somehow we are going to 
sing solidarity forever in 10 part harmony. It is not going to happen 
but the Liberals continue to do it.
<P>
	It is the same thing with the harmonized sales tax. The Liberals 
bring it in and what happens? Right away the premier of Alberta 
asked: ``What is going on? You gave a billion dollars to Atlantic 
Canada in order to harmonize the tax? What about Alberta which is 
paying the bills to harmonize this, in order to buy the favour from 
the Quebec premier?''
<P>
	The people in British Columbia rightly said: ``Wait a minute. 
You are saying a separate program for a separate region of the 
country with a separate pay off, a buy out and a Liberal handout is 
going to be paid for by people in our province in part?'' The people 
of Quebec would rightly say: ``Wait a minute. You have a sales tax 
over there and we have to pay the bills when right across the border 
is a province which is getting a pay out in order to blend its sales 
tax and enhance the reputation of the finance minister?''
<P>
	This government practices the politics of division. Time and 
again, whether it is distinct society, whether it is different rules for 
different regions of the country, whether it is the harmonized sales 
tax, whether it is the UI system, whether it is how to get a 
government grant, which region of the country one lives in plays a 
big part. Probably the icing on the cake is that those who are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7295"> 7295 </A></B>
<P>
heavily connected with the Liberal Party, either a  company, a 
government or their contacts, have a licence into the hallowed halls 
of power that sit in the throne room.
<P>
	I hope Canadians will take the government to task over the 
Christmas break and tell it that special deals for special regions are 
off and that they should not happen. The national media should be 
the first to report that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for the past three years I have been sitting here listening to 
debates. Of course, I have been sitting here all day listening to what 
has been going on. Madam Speaker, would it be out of order to 
make a simple request, that I stand here for 10 minutes and say 
nothing? Complete silence. Madam Speaker you are shaking your 
head. I wonder why.
<P>
	If I stand here and talk for 10 minutes it makes absolutely no 
difference because the government does not listen. In fact the 
government does not listen to me as an MP and it does not listen to 
the people of Canada. If we had total silence and did not debate 
anything, if the opposition was silent, the government would 
continue to do what it is doing, which is to run roughshod over the 
desires and wishes of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	The government has invoked closure on approximately 30 bills. 
Each time it does that, one question seems obvious: Why? Why is it 
invoking closure? I have observed a pattern over the past three 
years I have been in the House. Each time the government does not 
want Canadians to know what is going on, when it does not want a 
topic properly debated, it invokes closure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not 
think we have a quorum in the House. I call for a quorum count.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We shall 
proceed with a count of members present.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We have a 
quorum
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
sometimes wonder if when we have warm bodies in the House it 
makes any difference. I still do not think it helps anything. The 
government is not listening to what we have to say.
<P>
	We began today's debate with one of the members opposite 
making some blatantly false and misleading statements. It is 
interesting that the Liberals continue to propagate this not just 
within this House but outside this House as well. They continue to 
make completely false statements. The member also explained that 
this is the  best finance minister, except for the one we had in the 
mid-seventies who is the present Prime Minister.
<P>
	If the Liberals are going to set that person up as the best finance 
minister we have ever had, they are saying that the deficits begun 
by the Liberal government, the deficits that led to our tremendous 
present debt were good. They are saying that the past finance 
minister, the present Prime Minister, who started us on the road to 
overspending had the right idea. I cannot accept that. To set him up 
as the best finance minister we have ever had is totally false and 
misleading. That has to be the sorriest statement I have heard in 
this House to date.
<P>
	I made the point that approximately 30 bills have been rammed 
through the House. Full debate was not allowed on those which 
indicates this is a very undemocratic institution. The people of 
Canada must ask what is really going on here. Fundamental to this 
debate on taxes and on the GST is the question of why we need it. 
Why does the government need to continue raising all of this 
money?
<P>
	I discovered an interesting coincidence. This morning I 
introduced the people's tax form which is a voluntary tax form that 
all taxpayers could return with their income tax forms every April. 
On the forms they could indicate to the government the programs 
they support and the programs they oppose. It would be an 
indication to the government of what the people of Canada want.
<P>
	In light of the debate we are having today, would it not be 
interesting to include on that form a question which asks people 
what they would like done with the GST? Do they want it to be a 
hidden tax as this government is proposing? Do they want it hidden 
in the prices of products so when the government decides to 
increase the tax it will not be very visible and the government will 
not get all the negative publicity it hates? If the government were to 
ask the people of Canada, I wonder what their response would be.
<P>
	I believe that Reformers are speaking up on behalf of the people 
of Canada. The silence of the Liberals indicates that this 
government does not want to debate the topic.
<P>
	Each time the government raises taxes, we have already 
indicated in many previous speeches over the past three years that 
these taxes kill jobs. It is very simple. As long as people are paying 
more money in the form of taxes into the government coffers, they 
cannot spend that money on other things that create real jobs. They 
cannot buy goods and services which really creates a better 
lifestyle for all of us. Every time they send millions of dollars to 
Ottawa it is as if that money is put in a big black hole. It is not an 
effective way of producing jobs, I can guarantee that. In fact, taxes 
kill jobs. Studies have been done. They are out there.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7296"> 7296 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Taxes also hurt families. The GST really hurts our average 
family in Canada. How do taxes hurt families? Forty-six per cent of 
the average taxpayer's income now goes to government. It has 
come to the point where both parents feel they have to work in 
order to maintain a decent standard of living. One parent works for 
the government when we have a tax level that is so high. It hurts 
families because those parents would like to be spending more time 
at home with their children. Studies have found that the high tax 
level has really hurt families.
<P>
	The Liberals then turn around and appear to be compassionate. 
They are going to have a big program to target child poverty. Who 
has created the poverty? It has been these very people who now 
pretend that they are going to help people in some way. Reducing 
government programs so that we can reduce taxes should be our 
priority and fundamental to the entire discussion we are having 
here today.
<P>
	If we ask Canadians, as I have done, what their priorities are in 
spending and what things they would oppose, we would get some 
very interesting answers. If the government actually listened to 
Canadians, it could scrap the GST because it could reduce taxes 
which is what has to be done.
<P>
	I took a survey which has been tabled in the House along with 
the people's tax form bill that I introduced today. I believe the 
survey in my riding will not be substantially different from surveys 
taken across the country. What was the number one program, the 
sacred cow for the government, that people opposed? Official 
bilingualism. They felt that the government has been wasting 
money in this area for decades. The second thing Canadians 
opposed was funding for special interest groups. In my riding, the 
third thing they opposed was gun registration. Members may think 
that is just because I come from basically a rural riding, but I will 
tell a story.
<P>
	I spoke at the University of Toronto and half of the audience 
were young females. It was a good cross-section of the entire 
population. At the beginning of my speech I took a little survey. I 
asked them how many thought that gun registration was a good 
thing and a wise way to spend our money. The vast majority of 
them raised their hands and said they thought it was a good idea. I 
then asked if they minded if I explained it to them. I told them how 
it was going to take quite a bit of tax money to implement and in 
the end people would have a piece of paper lying beside their gun. 
To make a long story short, by the time I was done explaining to 
them what it was all about, I took another survey and the exact 
opposite happened. There was virtually no support for this.
<P>
	What happens is that if we properly inform Canadians as to what 
some of the programs are that this government is implementing, 
the support drops and they feel it is not a wise way to spend our tax
<P>
money. In fact, they would rather spend it on health care, family 
crisis centres and  those kinds of things, not the sacred things this 
government is implementing.
<P>
	I wish I could go on longer, but I will conclude. Let us look at the 
fundamental problem. The government is wasting money on so 
many things that are totally unnecessary and this could be scrapped 
if it did away with those things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to finally address Bill C-70.
<P>
	I find it ironic that the first thing the government does is it 
invokes time allocation again. When the Liberals sat here in 
opposition and the Conservative government did it, the Liberals 
cried about how it was anti-democratic, how it was restricting 
freedom of speech, and how it prevented people in all parts of the 
country from speaking out on an issue that is as important as this 
one.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	This bill is going to cost taxpayers in excess of $1 billion. The 
sum total of the bill's ramifications will be in excess of $1 billion. I 
will get to another amendment on getting rid of exemptions on the 
ways and means motion in a second.
<P>
	Why put this kind of pressure on members of Parliament by not 
allowing proper time to debate an issue? Why push this through the 
House of Commons real fast? Is it because the government has 
used an incentive of $961 million to get these Atlantic provinces to 
buy into a program that is going to cost Atlantic consumers more in 
the long run? Is it to make three provincial premiers look good 
today, while in the long run they are going to lose their jobs? I 
predict what just happened in P.E.I. will happen to the rest of them.
<P>
	People across the country have one thing in common: if it affects 
their pocketbooks they get upset. When they find out in Atlantic 
Canada that this harmonization is strictly helping business, that this 
tax inclusive pricing will tend to lead to higher prices in the long 
run without them knowing it, there is going to be a huge rebellion 
in those provinces in the next election.
<P>
	How can the government justify invoking closure on a bill like 
this? It goes back to the March 6 budget of this year and here we are 
today in December. Does the government not know how to plan an 
agenda? Does the government not know how to present something 
in the House of Commons so members can totally debate it?
<P>
	We have been here for three years and I have counted 26 time 
allocations and three closure motions. For those people who do not 
understand the three closure motions, closure allows time to talk 
out the issue until 11 o'clock that day. That gives more time for 
members of Parliament to discuss it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7297"> 7297 </A></B>
<P>
	What does the government do? Twenty-six times it has used the 
hammer of time allocation, not closure. This means the debate ends 
at the end of Government Orders  which is usually around 5.30 p.m. 
This debate will be over at 5.30 p.m. tonight and it denies us an 
extra five and a half hours to debate the issue.
<P>
	Where are the Liberal members from western Canada? Do they 
agree that we should give $1 billion of taxpayers' money outside 
those provinces? They are too chicken to say anything. I challenge 
them to stand in the House and say something. I challenge the 
members from B.C. to speak for 10 minutes in support of the 
finance minister on this issue. I challenge all of Atlantic Canada 
Liberal members to get up and support this and say how wonderful 
it is. I expect them to do that and justify it.
<P>
	Twenty-three per cent of the bills that we have been debating in 
this House have used either time allocation or closure. Let us look 
at the statistics a little further. One hundred and twenty-three bills 
have been passed in the three years to date and half, or close to half, 
of those bills have been supported by the opposition. That reduces 
it to 62 bills. That means whenever the opposition, either the Bloc 
or the Reform, puts a little pressure on the government by trying to 
show how a bill can be better, or tries to improve it through 
amendments or whatever, the government has invoked time 
allocation and closure 29 times. That then increases the percentage 
to almost half.
<P>
	This government does not appreciate debate. This government 
does not welcome debate. Its members are hypocrites when they 
say they listen to the public. They are duplicitous when they tell the 
Canadians public that members of Parliament are given lots of time 
to speak. We are not. Our ability to speak out on this issue has been 
severely restrained and it is time for us to tell the Canadian public 
what is happening.
<P>
	A payment of $961 million was made to three provinces in 
October of this year. It was charged off to last year's budget, to last 
year's income statement, to last year's deficit ending March 1996. 
This finance minister is setting a bad precedent. That is not just my 
opinion, that is the opinion of the Auditor General of Canada. That 
is in the public accounts.
<P>
	Yes, the auditor general signed off on the financial statement. He 
did not have any reservations about them because he felt the 
bottom line of $28 billion is a true number but not because it 
includes the $961 million. He would not have included that. It is 
because there were other circumstances. I got this from the 
testimony of members of Treasury Board and the auditor general in 
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. It is because there 
were other areas of revenue, small amounts and bigger amounts, 
that add up almost to the same amount. Because he saw those 
offsetting amounts he did not have a reservation. If those other 
amounts had not been understated by the government he would 
have had a reservation in this last year's presentation.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Shifty books.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes. Cooking the books is what it is.
<P>
	It is a fine line but a lot of people have compromised on it. If we 
had proper time to debate this, and if the member opposite would 
sit and listen for a while instead of just jabbering off and trying to 
interfere with my speech, he might learn and understand that this is 
a bad precedent. It is bad for Canada.
<P>
	Politicians cannot be allowed to cook the books. The finance 
minister needs to stick to generally accepted accounting principles, 
stick to government precedents and not change the rules as he goes 
along just to make himself and his government look good on their 
promise to achieve 3 per cent of GDP and to get this out of the way 
so he does not have to show it in this year's statement.
<P>
	That is why we are upset about time allocation. It restricts the 
time that members have to say what they want to say. We have to 
waste half our speech to get this message across to the Canadian 
public that our democratic rights are being infringed on when we 
are being denied the opportunity to speak.
<P>
	Another thing that really upsets me when it comes to finances is 
yesterday, in answer to a member from the Bloc Quebecois, the 
finance minister bragged that he has not raised taxes in three years, 
that personal income taxes have not increased in three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Is that true, hon. member across the way?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> There is another member who does not understand the 
facts of what the Prime Minister has done. There are two ways 
taxes are raised. One way is to raise the rate. The other way is to 
reduce the exemptions or the deductions or to tinker with the tax 
base on which one has to pay that rate of tax. He has not raised the 
rate, but he has surely and often in a number of ways tinkered with 
the deductions.
<P>
	Let me give an example. From now on if ever the Prime Minister 
or the finance minister says that he has not raised personal income 
taxes-and I dare him right now to say it after I have put this into 
the record-his nose will grow like Pinocchio every time he says it.
<P>
	The current rule in the Income Tax Act for labour sponsored 
venture capital corporations is that you are allowed up to 20 per 
cent of the net cost not to exceed $5,000. In layman's terms that is 
what the rule says basically. Now the government is reducing that 
for this year. There is a transition from 1996 to 1997. It has 
amended section 127.4 to provide that an individual's tax credit is 
limited to a uniform 15 per cent of the net cost. That means it has 
been reduced to $3,500. It means that those people who were 
putting money away, working for companies that sponsored these 
RRSP type investments now have to pay tax on another $1,500 that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7298"> 7298 </A></B>
<P>
prior to this  they did not have to pay tax on. That is a personal tax 
increase.
<P>
	The finance minister has increased personal taxes to the degree 
of disposable income for families on a personal basis going down 
by $3,000. I just hope that this finance minister has the courtesy to 
admit this and never again say in this House that he has not raised 
personal income taxes. That is as close to the Pinocchio syndrome 
that we have in this House. I would use another word, but I respect 
the Chair and I know that I cannot use language like that.
<P>
	My final comment is that there is a member from Newfoundland 
who was talking about what I said about harmonization. We are 
against this nickel and dime, two bit effort to harmonize. If a 
package was presented to us that harmonized with all provinces we 
might consider supporting it. We would have to see it first. We have 
not seen it yet.
<P>
	Second, if the government is going to harmonize and we do want 
to have the lowest rate, we have to look at the possibility of taxing 
everything that we can. This is what the member from 
Newfoundland will not put in his speech. To help the poorest and 
the neediest of the needy you have an increased rebate program to 
make sure that those people do not suffer. This would really tax the 
rich and that is what the Liberals like to do-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we have had a lot of the truth spoken here by the 
Reform Party members in the last couple of hours, as usual.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I heard a most astonishing thing in the House. A day or two ago 
the Minister of Finance said in the House, on national television 
and in front of all members, that the Liberal government had not 
raised personal income taxes one cent since it formed the 
government in 1993. A lot of words went through my mind when 
he made that statement. The closest description to a term I cannot 
use in the House would probably be something like stable waste. It 
was such an outrageous statement. The Reform member has just 
pointed out in clear terms that the Pinocchio syndrome is present in 
so far as the Minister of Finance is concerned and other Liberals 
who harmonize with him on that theme.
<P>
	There are two things I want to talk about today. One is the 
recurring scenario of the Liberal government limiting debate on 
this most crucial subject.
<P>
	We all understand that the GST is probably the most hated tax, 
the most railed against tax, the most despised tax in all of our 
taxation system. That was clear from the minute it was brought it. I 
wish I could say that it was the Liberals who brought it in. That 
would make my day.  However, I cannot do that because we know 
that it was the Conservatives who brought it in, under Brian 
Mulroney, who incidentally still has his protege sitting in the 
House, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who now leads the 
Conservative Party.
<P>
	We have all heard the hon. member for Sherbrooke say that some 
day Canadians will realize what a great Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney was. We hope he keeps on saying that because we will 
keep reminding Canadians that it was the Mulroney Conservatives, 
and the hon. member for Sherbrooke was part of that government, 
that rammed the GST down the throats of Canadians without a 
question of whether it was fair or honest or whether the way it was 
done contained a hint of integrity.
<P>
	In spite of all the things that Canadians hated about the GST and 
the Mulroney reign of terror in Parliament, the one thing that they 
hated the most was the way the Tories used to shut down debate on 
crucial issues. They used to limit the time that MPs would be 
permitted, on behalf of their constituents, to put forward their 
constituents' views.
<P>
	We watched in absolute astonishment as the leader of the Tory 
Party did that. He did it time and time again, with the full support 
of the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who was part of the cabinet 
and who now leads the Tory Party. He continues to say that the 
former Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney, was a great leader. We will 
remind Canadians of that.
<P>
	The amazing thing is that the Liberals, when they were in 
opposition, used to speak in utter outrage at the way the Tory 
government limited debate. Time and time again Liberals rose, 
individually and in unison. They railed against the government for 
this trampling of democracy. They were so self-righteous. They 
called the Tory government the worst dictator that this country has 
ever seen. They would rail against it.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I want to make a statement that the number of times the Liberal 
government has brought in closure on debate since it moved from 
one side of the House to the other would make Brian Mulroney 
look like a saint when it comes to putting closure on debate in the 
House.
<P>
	I think it is such a perfect example of hypocrisy when the 
Liberals spent day after day slamming the Mulroney government 
and now they are doing it themselves, only twice as bad. It is 
almost an embarrassment to sit in the House and watch democracy 
be trampled on. I said before that the ghosts of the great 
parliamentarians who once sat in this House and represented the 
great Liberal Party of years past and who knew about democracy 
must be hanging their heads in shame when they see these Liberal 
members trample on the sacred ground they laid here. And let us 
make it clear that there was a time when that party understood the 
fundamentals of democracy. They fought for that state of 
democracy only to see this  Prime Minister throw it aside like 
yesterday's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7299"> 7299 </A></B>
<P>
garbage. It is almost an embarrassment to sit in the same House 
with a party that does that sort of nonsense.
<P>
	I think we will move on now to the harmonization plan and talk 
about some of the comments from the provinces about this great 
Liberal harmonization plan.
<P>
	The province of Ontario said that if the plan were implemented 
in Ontario it would cost Ontario consumers from $2 billion to $3 
billion more a year in purchases. The Canadian people have seen a 
decrease in their disposable income over the last 25 years like they 
could never have imagined or dreamed would happen. They have 
seen personal income taxes raised by the government in the last 
three years. They have seen our national debt go to about $600 
billion. They have seen our health care and our social safety net 
gutted, having the heart ripped out of it by the $50 billion we are 
paying to service the debt. And now the Liberal government has the 
audacity to present the harmonization plan which is even going to 
make what disposable income is has left appear to be even less. In 
fact, it will be less because a tax is a tax is a tax, no matter where it 
is put or where it comes from; it can only come from one place, the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	I share my colleague's thoughts about this harmonization plan. I 
share the thoughts of the great Parliamentarians who have gone to 
the great House of Commons in the sky and who look down and see 
the way these Liberals are trampling on democracy.
<P>
	All I can say is again, as with many bills in the House, it is truly a 
sad day for democracy, a sad day for the Canadian taxpayers. We 
will stay here and fight for the Canadian people. We will fight for 
their freedom and their tax freedom.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, as we have 
heard, this is a sad day for all of us in Parliament. We have had 
approximately 30 other sad days like this when the government has 
used closure to shut down debate in the House of Commons. Not 
only do we not believe in democracy in the House but we also, as 
we have seen time and time again, have no vision for the country in 
this House either.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	This is a despicable act that the government continues to put on 
Canadians; the lack of vision. I am afraid for our children and our 
grandchildren.
<P>
	Having travelled extensively this year, seeing the vibrant, 
booming economies of the Asia-Pacific, seeing the booming 
economy of Germany, looking at so many countries that have long 
term plans, standing in Potsdam plaza and seeing $7.5 million 
being spent to rebuild Berlin is a vision. This country has none of 
that.
<P>
	We have a Prime Minister who is tired, a Prime Minister who has 
nothing to offer the country, who will  come up with a plan because 
he has a dream to bring himself to some kind of glory and maybe 
get named by the United Nations or something.
<P>
	It is a disgrace what this government is doing and how it is 
mishandling the governing of this country. It is hard to believe that 
as we close each session, all of a sudden we get to a great rush to 
get legislation through.
<P>
	The only legislation that we are going to discuss tomorrow will 
be a prebudget debate, which is promised in the red book. Everyone 
is excited to get right to it because, again, it is just Liberal 
propaganda.
<P>
	Yet there is an issue like the GST in this harmonized tax which 
affects every Canadian, men, women, children, seniors. Everybody 
in this country is affected by this and the government uses closure 
on it to shut down debate.
<P>
	What kind of leadership is that? What kind of vision, what kind 
of plan does this government have for this country? When the other 
side of the House was over here, it called the PCs everything it 
could think of in all those many times that they used closure.
<P>
	It certainly is different how things change when those members 
cross the floor. Let us all of us stand here and say ``that cannot 
happen to us, we cannot let it''. Canadian people have lost respect 
for this place and it is because of those kinds of actions by 
governments like this one.
<P>
	We need to reform this place. We need to change this place 
dramatically. This place is not working. This place is not respected 
by the people of Canada. The people here are yesterday's people 
led by yesterday's man.
<P>
	We are going nowhere into the future. We are going to be out 
competed by the countries that I have mentioned, by southeast 
Asia, by the European Community. They will knock us off in terms 
of our position and our quality of life if we do not learn how to 
compete, if we do not have a vision that goes longer than six 
months at a time in this country.
<P>
	A good example is how many Liberals are not here to listen to 
this kind of statement. Where are they if this place works? Where 
are they?
<P>
	Enough of incompetence, lack of planning, lack of vision, lack 
of guidance for this country. The Canadian people know that 
already and will get that message. I am confident in the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	We have problems like $600 billion in debt. We have problems 
like $50 billion in interest payments. We spend $14 billion in 
education. We spend $16 billion on health care, $20 billion on 
pensions and $50 billion on interest payments. This country has 
problems.
<P>
	We have to turn it around for our children and our grandchildren. 
We must do that. We must have that vision. What about this GST? 
We heard lots of comments about it. In my riding we had rallies of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7300"> 7300 </A></B>
<P>
6,000 people and  more who said that the GST was a bad tax, a tax 
that would not work.
<P>
	We had an association that put out thousands of bumper stickers. 
Every car in my riding had a bumper sticker on it saying what its 
owner thought of the GST. The group is called Canadians AGAST. 
It had rallies. One of the biggest was over 6,000 people who told 
the politicians what they thought of the GST. Of course, the 
Liberals were on that bandwagon as well.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Think of the comments that were made by the now finance 
minister, the now Prime Minister and the now Deputy Prime 
Minister. ``We are going to get rid of this terrible tax. We promise 
we will''. Why have the Canadian people lost their belief in this 
place? It is obvious why they have lost it. It is because in here 
members say one thing when they are on this side and another thing 
when they are on the other side.
<P>
	Even though interest rates are where they are today, people are 
not investing in businesses or in their communities. People are 
going to the underground economy. They are taking their money 
out of this country.
<P>
	Let us think about this. One hundred and fifty-three students who 
have graduated after a five year course are saying they have a job 
and are thankful to have a job. However, 90 per cent of these 
students have a job outside of this country. Those faces, which I can 
see in front of me, have said they cannot stay in Canada. There 
were 700 graduate students hired in Sweden in the last couple of 
years. Those are people who are potential taxpayers and the future 
of our country. Why are they leaving in droves? It is because they 
would have to work at McDonald's if they stayed here.
<P>
	There is no future for this country without a vision. We know we 
have a country today that has the potential to be the very best and 
stay the very best into the 21st century. However, it is promises that 
are not kept and the changing of one's position all the time that 
have caused us all concern.
<P>
	People in the Liberal Party are no different than the Kindys and 
Kilgours of the last Parliament. We can now throw in the Mills and 
the Nunziatas. If Liberal members disagree with their party they 
are out on their heels.
<P>
	There are so many people in business who are disgusted with this 
tax. There are also many people in Atlantic Canada who are 
disgusted with this harmonization. In my riding, we have many 
people in the service industry who are fed up with the 
administration and the nature of this whole tax called the GST.
<P>
	We must keep our promise and not harmonize but eliminate the 
GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Okanagan-Shuswap is probably the best place in Canada 
and maybe even in the whole world. It is a great place to live.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have the same problem as most people in 
Canada have. We are here today to speak to Bill C-70. In case 
people out there do not understand exactly what this bill entails, 
here it is. It is totally unbelievable. It contains 335 pages on how to 
harmonize a tax. I would hate to figure out the cost of each page. 
Believe me, Madam Speaker, you probably will not make that 
much in your lifetime nor in mine nor in a number of other 
lifetimes in this House.
<P>
	This government has spent hundreds of hours and days trying to 
figure out how to broaden the tax base in this country.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at what they mean by broadening the tax base. 
I want the people who are listening and every member in this 
House to understand that whenever a politician talks about tax that 
means they are going to raise the level of tax. That is what it means, 
no matter what they say.
<P>
	The Liberals spent days, weeks, months trying to figure out a 
way to soft sell this to the people. They spent millions of dollars to 
figure out one word that the public might just accept: harmonize. 
All they had to do was look it up in the dictionary but I suppose that 
would have been too simple.
<P>
	So now we are looking at this harmonization of taxation. We try 
to debate this issue but the government has decided that we do not 
need any more debate in this House. It does not want any debate in 
this House. The government would not like the people outside this 
House or off the Hill, those people who have a life outside of these 
walls, to even know what goes on in this House and therefore will 
invoke closure.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You mean we cannot debate it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> The government says ``No, we will put a time 
allocation on you people. We will see that you only debate it for a 
certain length of time, and that's it. You will be curtailed to a 
certain length of time''. This is in Canada, in the House of 
Commons. I do not know what is going on here. I know a lot of 
people did not spill their blood and die for this type of set-up. And I 
call it a set-up because that is exactly what it is.
<P>
	The other day I mentioned a parasite, a bug we have out west. It 
is called a tick. It latches on to human beings and sucks the 
lifeblood out of them. Likewise there is politickitis, a two legged 
insect that is found in government. Ninety per cent of all 
politickitis sit on the frontbenches; 10 per cent sit on the 
backbenches. I will not deny that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7301"> 7301 </A></B>
<P>
	A politick is a politician in power who latches on to the taxpayer 
and sucks the living blood out of them just as this government 
has been doing since it got in here. And there has been no change.
<P>
	I well remember the 1993 election campaign. I remember how 
we were going to be rid of this GST. Since the Liberals have come 
to power there is a new name for it. It is called ``get stuffed, 
taxpayer''. That is exactly what it is and that is exactly what the 
Liberals are telling the average taxpayer. ``Get stuffed, we're not 
interested in it''. And they get away with it.
<P>
	But it will stop. The taxpayers will make sure it stops. Sooner or 
later taxpayers are going to throw this bunch out. It is only a matter 
of time. They are tired of politicians knocking on their doors every 
four years. They are tired of politicians getting down on their knees 
and begging the electorate to put them back in power. They 
promise they will not do it again.
<P>
	I have a question for you, Madam Speaker. Name for me one 
policy, one tax that a government put in which defeated that 
government and that an incoming government got rid of? There is 
none. The new government just expands upon it. It raises more 
money.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	As I sat and thought about how the government is broadening the 
tax base, I came to one conclusion. The main reason it has done this 
has to be, beyond a doubt, that it needs money for its pension plan. 
It has to be. The MP pension plan has to be in serious trouble. It is 
the million dollar pension plan which members opposite will take. 
That is what it is going to do with the money. That is what 
harmonization is all about. It has absolutely nothing to do with the 
word harmonize.
<P>
	In most places that is called legalized theft. That is exactly what 
it is. Liberals said it was not personal tax. Every tax in this country 
is a personal tax. When I buy something, whether it be a shirt, 
shoes, fuel for my car or for my house, the tax on those items is a 
personal tax. When they say it is not a personal tax they are 
snowing the public. It goes on and on. They get away with it 
because they implement time allocation and closure. Is that a 
democratic society? No. We have long past the point of being a 
democratic society.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I would probably characterize us, along with 
many members of the House-and I am sure many members 
opposite would agree with me-as having probably the greatest 
dictatorship in the free world. It sits right here in this Parliament. I 
cannot believe it. I cannot believe that we have allowed it to go as 
far as it has. What is happening in this country is absolutely 
ridiculous. It is being fostered by many members opposite. When 
those members disagree, they are kicked out of the caucus. ``Do not 
come back into our caucus. I will not sign your papers''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They think it is funny.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes, they think it is funny over there. They think 
this is the way to do business. They tell their members that if they 
disagree with them they should keep their mouths shut. ``Get out of 
here. We will disband your organizations and you will never be 
allowed to come in here again''. Is that democracy? I think not.
<P>
	I have a feeling that underneath the propaganda machines that sit 
over there some of them could make what happened many years 
ago look very tame.
<P>
	It has to make us wonder exactly how far some hon. members 
will go in order to get elected. It does not take me long to picture 
these people ringing the doorbells come the next election. They 
will say ``We got rid of the GST, we harmonized it. It is still there. 
It is still sucking your paycheque, but we harmonized it''.
<P>
	When they go back to the people and say ``trust me'', I want 
everyone to understand that for sure their fingers will be crossed. 
They have not done anything above board yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, before I start I 
would like to congratulate my colleague for his most excellent 
speech. We can always tell when a Reformer is speaking from the 
cacophony of bleating babble which comes from the other side.
<P>
	We are talking today about another Liberal broken promise. 
There is a whole bunch of them. We have referred to them over and 
over again in our interventions on this bill and other bills.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	First of all, we are talking about the promise to scrap, abolish 
and get rid of the GST. We are also talking about the Liberal 
promise to introduce democracy into this House. The people on the 
other side of this House yelled, screamed and ridiculed the Tory 
government for doing exactly what they are doing today.
<P>
	I would like to respond to some of the comments made by the 
hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls. I have respect for this 
member and I am aware that on many occasions he has had the 
courage to stand up and challenge his own government, to 
challenge his own leader when there was an issue that was going to 
affect his constituents. He knew and realized that the government 
was wrong and he challenged it. I congratulate him for that. If more 
backbenchers in the Liberal government did that then possibly we 
would get better government. Unfortunately most do not have that 
courage.
<P>
	During the intervention of the member for Gander-Grand Falls 
he was trying to paint this wonderful rosy picture of how great a job 
this government has been doing for the last three years. He referred 
to statistics with regard to the deficit and other industrialized 
nations. For the life of me I cannot understand why this member, 
who has been very  lukewarm to his own government for the last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7302"> 7302 </A></B>
<P>
three years, is all of a sudden on side with it. I imagine he has his 
own reasons for that.
<P>
	In a valiant but vain attempt he painted his government in the 
best light that he possibly could. He said the government's record is 
good. We know what the government's record is on the GST. We 
know what the government's record is on invoking closure. Let us 
talk about a couple of other issues, issues that are not only near and 
dear to me but near and dear to many people in my constituency.
<P>
	Let us talk about the broken promise of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement for a few minutes. When this government 
campaigned in 1993 it said it would abrogate the North American 
Free Trade Agreement unless it worked for Canadians. It had some 
concerns about the agreement and it wanted to make sure it could 
go back and renegotiate it and make sure it worked for Canadians.
<P>
	Let us examine the government's record on the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. What is the single most important trade 
issue between Canada and the United States? What is the single 
biggest net export to the United States that means the most jobs in 
Canada? It is Canadian softwood lumber. Canadian softwood 
lumber is the single biggest net export to the United States.
<P>
	What has this government done in renegotiating NAFTA and 
standing up for Canada's interest in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement? When Mickey Kantor talked to the Prime Minister or 
his office or the minister of trade and said he wanted to do a deal 
that is going to limit Canadian imports into the United States, the 
minister said ``how high do you want us to jump and when can we 
come back down again?'' The government rolled right over on it.
<P>
	This is an issue that affects four provinces significantly and 
every province either directly or indirectly. There are hundreds of 
thousands of jobs hanging in the balance. This government and this 
Prime Minister who promised Canadians they were going to make 
the North American Free Trade Agreement work for us have turned 
their backs on these people and allowed American trade officials, 
Mickey Kantor in particular, to dictate to us how we are going to 
run our softwood lumber industry.
<P>
	I want to talk for a minute on who benefits from this. Most of the 
timbered land in Canada is owned by the crown and is granted as 
tree farm licences. Various sawmills and pulp mills get rights to 
harvest in these areas but the land is owned by the crown.
<P>
	In the United States it is different. Most of the timbered land in 
the United States is owned by private individuals and corporations. 
Incidentally, most of the timbered land in the United States is 
owned by a handful of wealthy corporations that have the money 
and the power to go to Washington, D.C. and lobby for their  
interests. They are the ones who are benefiting. They are the ones 
whose asset value has increased as a result of this quota system. 
They are the ones who are able to demand more money for their 
timber in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	And who is losing? The first big losers are the consumers in the 
United States who on average pay $3,000 more now than before the 
quota for the construction of a new home. The American 
consumers have been held up by their own lobby groups and by the 
wealthy timber owners in the United States. And the other big 
losers are the Canadian producers and the people who are 
employed in those industries. They are the ones who are paying for 
this.
<P>
	I cannot understand for the life of me where the leadership is 
from the government benches, the Prime Minister and his trade 
minister. They allow the North American Free Trade Agreement to 
be abrogated by the Americans so that it works in favour of the 
Americans at every step and turn when it becomes an issue that is 
important to them. But when it is an issue which is vitally 
important to Canada, there is no leadership whatsoever. They roll 
over and play dead. This is another example of a Liberal broken 
promise.
<P>
	The Prime Minister takes these trade junkets all over the world 
and spends millions of Canadian taxpayer dollars doing it. He goes 
to South America, Europe and Asia, all the while telling people he 
is there to promote Canadian business and industry. He hands over 
millions of dollars in subsidies, grants and no interest loans to well 
heeled companies like Bombardier. However when it comes to an 
issue that is vital to British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and 
Quebec, what does the Prime Minister do? He just rolls over.
<P>
	A lot of potential jobs will be lost as a result of this. Sawmills in 
my riding, in Terrace, Smithers, Hazelton and Prince Rupert are on 
the verge of closing. They have announced closures and are cutting 
back or laying off people just before Christmas because of the lack 
of leadership from this government.
<P>
	It reminds me of another Liberal promise. Does anyone here 
recall the promise about jobs, jobs, jobs? Well the jobs, jobs, jobs 
in my riding are going gone, gone, gone because this Prime 
Minister and his trade minister cannot represent the interests of 
Canadians when it comes to trade with the United States. That is 
the track record of the government.
<P>
	I cannot believe it. I am ashamed as a Canadian. I am absolutely 
appalled and ashamed that the government is so weak-kneed and so 
willing to accept what Mickey Kantor and the trade department of 
the United States demands of us rather than standing up for our 
interests.
<P>
	While we are talking about Liberal broken promises, the promise 
to scrap, abolish and kill the GST, the  promise to introduce more 
democracy into Parliament and do away with votes on closure so 
that we would have the ability to debate these issues at length, there 
are other broken promises as well which are costing Canadians jobs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7303"> 7303 </A></B>
<P>
right now. Broken promises are costing my constituents their 
livelihood.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable. The government should 
demonstrate leadership. The Prime Minister should demand a 
meeting with the President of the United States and put this issue at 
the top of the agenda and work for the interests of Canada for a 
change instead of going on golfing holidays with his friend Mr. 
Clinton while Mickey Kantor beats up on our trade officials.
<P>
	I am appalled and ashamed of being a Canadian today when I 
look at how easily American interests have rolled over us and 
forced us to do their will.
<P>
	In closing, when the government brags about keeping its 
promises, when the government brags about how well Canada is 
doing economically, it is totally ignoring the unemployment rate in 
this country. It is totally ignoring the people who are concerned 
about losing their jobs, and there are a lot more of them now as a 
result of the softwood lumber issue. It is totally ignoring the cost to 
the people of Atlantic Canada for paying the harmonization cost of 
the GST. It is totally ignoring the fact that the rest of Canada is 
going to foot the bill for this billion dollar bribe.
<P>
	The government is totally ignoring many of the most serious and 
important promises it made during the last election campaign. We 
will be reminding Canadians in the very near future of all these 
Liberal broken promises.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I must say at the outset that it is going to be a really tough 
act to follow. My hon. colleagues from Okanagan-Shuswap and 
from Skeena who immediately preceded me have done an 
absolutely superb job of representing their constituents and the 
views of Canadians on this very important topic.
<P>
	I might hasten to add that there is a real problem in this House of 
Commons when we see the Liberal government bringing forward 
time allocation 26 times in this Parliament. This is the 26th time we 
have gone through this to date, where this government has limited 
debate, shut down debate, shut down the democratic process to ram 
through a piece of legislation.
<P>
	And the Liberals have the audacity to go before the Canadian 
people and talk about democracy. And they will have the audacity 
in the next election to try to tell Canadians that they have lived up 
to their red book promise of restoring integrity, restoring 
credibility in Parliament and in the political process in this country. 
The Canadian people will reject that as the nonsense it has become.
<P>
	When that party, the Liberal Party of Canada, was on this side of 
the House, its members ranted and railed. They criticized the Tories 
every chance they got for bringing in time allocation or closure. 
Yet, 26 times the government has used time allocation and four
<P>
times it has brought in closure for a total of 30 times it has shut 
down debate in this place in just a little over three years. Actually it 
is in under three years because the 35th Parliament did not start 
sitting until January 1994. It has shut down debate 30 times on 123 
bills.
<P>
	I am sure that at some point in time someone is going to do the 
arithmetic and figure out that on a percentage basis, this Liberal 
government in the 35th Parliament of Canada has used time 
allocation and closure more often than the Mulroney Tories. That is 
despicable. It is a disgusting record for a government that said it 
was going to restore integrity in the system.
<P>
	On to the GST-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Finally.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> I can hear all the 
heckling going on over there. They are amazed because they cannot 
face the truth of what has transpired in this Parliament. They 
cannot face the truth. That is the problem that exists over there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Tell us the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Okay, the GST. The 
hon. member says he wants to know the truth. I am here today to 
tell the truth, to tell the people in TV land exactly what the truth is.
<P>
	What did the Liberals say during the 1993 election and in the 
time leading up to it? I will tell you what they said. Did they say 
they would harmonize the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Yes, read the red book.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Page 22.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> No, of course not. Did 
they say they would hide the GST? No. Did they say that they 
would blend the GST? Of course not. That is not what they said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Read it into the record.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resume your 
debate, hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker, for attempting to restore the decorum in the House. It was 
getting a little loud on the other side.
<P>
	I am sorry that the government did not decide to use the term 
blended sales tax. I am quite sure of the reason it decided to go with 
the harmonized sales tax instead of the blended sales tax. I am kind 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7304"> 7304 </A></B>
<P>
of sorry about that because they would have had the BST. 
Canadians would have really appreciated having the letters BS 
attached to  tax, the BST, especially in regard to the promises made 
by this government during the 1993 election. That describes 
exactly their promise to get rid of the GST. They should have called 
it the BST.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Now that we know what the Liberals did not say, what did they 
really say on the hustings, on the doorsteps and in the 
all-candidates forums during the 1993 election campaign? We 
know what they said. They said they were going to kill the GST. 
They said they were going to abolish the GST. They even said that 
they were going to get rid of the GST totally. That does not sound 
much like harmonizing to me.
<P>
	It is ironic that the Liberals are no different from the Tories. That 
is why we hear Canadians from coast to coast to coast saying 
Liberal, Tory, same old story. It does not matter which party they 
vote for. Once they get into power they do exactly the same thing. 
There is no difference.
<P>
	Do we want to see exactly how much difference there is? Let us 
refer to the notes from a speech by the hon. member for 
York-South Weston.
<P>
	I am pleased to see you in the chair, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps we 
will see some decorum restored to this Chamber. I am pleased to 
see you there.
<P>
	The member's speech was entitled ``Honesty, Ethics and 
Accountability: Does it Exist in Canada's Political System''. This 
is what the member, who used to be a Liberal, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So the problem with today's political system is not the people we have in place, 
but rather the problem with our system in Canada is the system itself. The system is 
what is fueling public cynicism and distrust.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My removal from the Liberal caucus in April is the perfect example of the 
reward/punish system I have referred to. I was removed for voting against the federal 
budget because it failed to fulfil the Liberal Party's election promise to replace the 
GST. Prior to the vote, I wrote to the Prime Minister to advise him that I would be 
voting against the budget. I reminded him that while we were in opposition our 
efforts to eliminate the GST was one of the most significant battles we fought during 
the Mulroney administration. While in opposition, the Liberal Party vigorously 
opposed the GST in the House of Commons. Liberal senators undertook an 
unprecedented effort to kill the legislation and we forcefully campaigned against it in 
the last election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is trite to say that every government has a moral obligation to keep its major 
election promises. In my view, the last federal budget represented the final retreat 
from the promise to replace the GST. I think that the government's announcement 
that it intends to harmonize the tax has verified this. Voting against the budget was 
the only way that I could reconcile what I had said and done in the past in the House 
of Commons and what I had said to my constituents on their doorsteps with the fact 
that the government-</BLOCKQUOTE>

with the holiday season fast upon us, I want to remind Canadians 
who contemplate getting behind the wheel of a car after they have 
been drinking of one sobering statistic.
<P>
	Each year on average in Canada, drunk drivers kill two and half 
times more people than do murderers. In 1994 alone this meant that 
1,400 Canadians lost their lives because someone decided to have 
one more for the road.
<P>
	I want to remind Canadians that the Liberal justice minister has 
done nothing to address this obscenely offensive situation. The 
government has had ample opportunity to redress the problem. 
Most recently this opportunity has come in the form of a private 
member's bill presented by my colleague, the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley. The bill would have mandated a 
minimum sentence of incarceration for those who kill as a result of 
driving while impaired.

wondering if the justice minister has a different message.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a number of 
sawmills in Quebec are unhappy with the softwood lumber quotas 
they were assigned in late October under the agreement negotiated 
with the United States in the spring of 1996.
<P>
	They are questioning the way in which the quotas were arrived at 
by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. How 
is it that, according to the <I>Financial Post</I>, BC sawmills were given 
quotas representing between 75 and 85 per cent of their 1995 
production, while Quebec's were between 60 and 65 per cent?
<P>
	While many sawmills were going to reduce their production by 
10 to 15 per cent, many are now thinking about shutting their doors. 
The whole quota assignment process must be reviewed. Otherwise, 
there will be more loss of employment in Quebec. Or better yet, I 
suggest that there be a review of this agreement, which has left 
people unhappy on both sides of the border, both in the United 
States and in Canada.

recession and they welcome good economic news. That is why the 
proposed Bell Canada rate increases will be an unfair burden for 
small business leaders in my community and in ridings across 
Ontario and Quebec.

	If the proposal is accepted, telephone rates in my riding for

economic growth and the HST.
<P>
	The majority of individuals at the forum expressed the view that 
the country's social services cannot stand another round of cuts, 
that the government has hit expenditures as much as it can. They 
proposed we look at high end tax reform as there is a sense that 
large corporations and Canadians in the higher income brackets are 
not paying their fair share.

economy focused on whose role it is to create jobs and how to do it. 
Forum members suggested government does have a role to play in

determination to ensure that the horrors of the second world war

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the Minister of the Environment tabled the long 
awaited changes to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. As 
usual, what the government says about protecting the environment 
is very different from what it does.
<P>
	CEPA used to be the supreme environmental law in this country, 
in that it could override other acts and other departments. The new 
act will now only apply if the substance of concern is not covered 
by any other act, and the minister can only intervene if a province 
fails to do so. This effectively downgrades CEPA from being the 
most important pillar and centrepiece of environmental law into a 
law of last resort when nothing else applies. This legislation will 
take us backwards, not forwards. It effectively forces Environment 
Canada out of the environmental protection business and allows the 
harmonization agreement with the provinces to take precedence 
over CEPA.

strengthened and revamped, not weakened in the manner proposed 
by the Minister of the Environment.

<P>
	We welcome the recent federal investment in fuel cell research

agricultural research. Farmers, food processors, marketers and the 
academic community are all working in partnership with 
Agriculture Canada for the national good.
<P>
	Through Agriculture Canada research labs, important work is 
being conducted to ensure the safety of the national food supply, to 
develop new crops, to investigate environmentally friendly and 
economical herbicides and pesticides to improve crop production 
and to identify new markets for Canadian produce and agri-food 
products.
<P>
	Leading the way in the area of research and development, 
especially in biotechnology, the research labs have developed 
better methods for growing and storing Saskatchewan produce. 
Innovation Place, through its harnessing of government, academic 
and private sector resources, is an excellent model for the effective 
partnerships that ensure the successes we have seen in research and 
development.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
celebrate the 48th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. I would like to draw your attention to the 
determination and courage shown by several women's groups who 
established the permanent Arab tribunal on violence against 
women this week in Rabat, Morocco.
<P>
	Recent events in Afghanistan are a clear indication of the need 
for such a tribunal. In fact, the first ones to suffer as a result of the 
political situation in Kabul are women. They have been excluded 
from public life and fired from their jobs and are compelled to 
abide by medieval customs.
<P>
	The rights of women have been ignored in Afghanistan for many 
years. The restrictions imposed by the Taliban, such as closing 
girls' schools, prohibiting women from leaving their homes to go 
to work and the rule obliging women to cover themselves from 
head to foot are dramatic examples of violence and crimes against 
women in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	I wish the permanent Arab tribunal on violence against women 
all the courage and energy it needs to proceed with its difficult task.

<P>
	An individual from my riding was not allowed to ask a question

	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
today's highly competitive global economy, the need for 
co-operation between government, universities and the private 
sector in the area of research and development has never been 
greater.
<P>
	One of the best examples of the importance of such research is 
the RH Laboratory at the University of Manitoba which specializes 
in blood plasma refractionation. The RH Laboratory is a world 
class facility which has contributed much to the successful 
treatment of children with blood disorders. Not only have they 
produced cures for very serious diseases, but they also produce 
high quality permanent jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Their success shows what can be done through co-operation 
between the federal government, universities and industry.
<P>
	The University of Manitoba exemplifies this type of 
co-operation, from mobilizing world markets with the research 
done on the canola breeding program to the centre for disease 
control, the centre of excellence in new composite materials, 
research on medical devices and the list goes on.

gathered the collective wisdom from western Canadians who know 
how to discover, develop and apply the science and technology 
created in our government labs.
<P>
	We learned first that Canadians can be proud of the excellent 
work being done in our research laboratories; second, that we have 
the potential to be world leaders in many fields; and, third, that new 
partnerships are the key to unlocking this potential.
<P>
	These new partnerships must include all those who are key to the 
successful transfer of technology. Each partnership must value the 
contribution of the others. Each partnership must accept that the 
main goal is to be  successfully commercialized as science and 
technology in our lab.
<P>
	New ways of getting research out of the lab, on to the factory 
floor and into the home will mean new jobs and new opportunities 
for Canadians. New technologies will allow rural communities to 
share in the latest research. New linkages between researchers and 
businesses across the country will increase the potential to compete 
in world markets.
<P>
	I know our Prime Minister values the advice we have received 
and will act on it in the best interest of all Canadians.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDEFENCE">NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, in his remarks, the Minister of National 
Defence tried to minimize his department's responsibilities in the 
seizure of over 20,000 pieces of child pornography at the National 
Defence Research Establishment, a high security centre, with the 
explanation that it is not possible to monitor every computer in the 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	Understandably, but how can the minister make light of such 
events, when in fact the individual using the research centre's 
network was not only obtaining material, a very serious matter of 
itself, but was feeding a network, a very large international child 
pornography distribution network?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I agree totally 
with the Leader of the Opposition that we cannot make light of this 
situation. It is absolutely deplorable. It is disgusting. The 
individual involved was arrested.
<P>
	What I was trying to explain in response to journalists' questions 
is that this phenomenon is occurring everywhere. The Internet, 
which should be a source of development and change, in the best 
sense of the word, has now become something that affects not only 
national defence, but also many people known to members of this 
House and children at home, because it provides access to totally 
repugnant information, photos and acts. There is absolutely no 
doubt about this.
<P>
	I am hoping that everyone understands we recognize this is 
unacceptable, and that the person involved, if found guilty, should 
be punished to the full extent of the law. This morning, I met with 
departmental officials not only to inform them, but also to ask them 
to take all possible measures, to investigate and to find out how this 
sort of access may be controlled.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7309"> 7309 </A></B>
<P>
	The whole question of pornography on the Internet will be not 
only a burden but a major challenge for everyone in all sectors: 
in government, in the private sector and even at home. I hope that 
together we will find ways to remedy the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the minister's explanations, and I will ask 
him the following supplementary.
<P>
	How does the minister explain to the people who pay the salaries 
of the department's employees the fact that, in a top security centre 
of the Canadian army, an employee in an important position, a high 
level strategic position, can spend the bulk of his time over weeks, 
if not months, creating pornographic material without any 
questions being asked? Can the minister explain that?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I obviously do 
not know exactly how much time the person in question spent 
preparing his material and how and in what context he obtained it. 
Technology now enables us to do things we would never have 
dreamed of being able to do before.
<P>
	I would say to my hon. colleague, that, under the circumstances, 
when we come across someone-because the man accused is quite 
sophisticated and well educated-someone who is sick and wants 
to obtain child pornography, we must obviously be much more 
careful in the way we deal with these problems. It is complex, not 
only here but everywhere.
<P>
	All I can say by way of explanation is that the sort of people 
interested in this kind of activity do not share their interest with 
their neighbours or their colleagues at work. I am sure my hon. 
colleague would be just as disgusted to find out as I would. No one 
knows how he managed to use the system. We will find out. An 
internal audit has been requested.
<P>
	Once again, I deplore the situation. It is unacceptable. However, 
it is first and foremost the availability of this sort of material on the 
Internet that presents the greatest challenge to all of us. Would 
anyone with a way to control it please let me know. I will give out 
my telephone number at the end of question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is very modest. Everyone knows he may be 
reached at national defence.
<P>
	More seriously, though, and this is in fact extremely serious, I 
would like to ask the minister whether, when it was possible for this 
employee, unbeknownst to everyone, his superiors and his 
colleagues, to carry on these activities for weeks if not months, 
using a Canadian army computer in a top security centre, the 
minister can be certain, with all the challenges of informatics, that 
the  same thing is not happening with military secrets, for example, 
or information of strategic importance?
<P>
	How can the minister assure the public that he has the means to 
control this if he is unable to control something like child 
pornography?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent 
question and one that crossed my mind when I was informed of 
events.
<P>
	I am assured that, with the way communications work, the link 
with the service providing access to the Internet is totally separate 
from what happens on the system used to transmit information of a 
secret or sensitive nature.
<P>
	I asked the same question. I was assured that it was a completely 
separate activity. The man in question was taking information off 
the Internet, he was trading, if my information is correct. For 
matters of security, however, the system is totally separate.
<P>
	I recognize the importance of the question raised by the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition. I have checked, and the only assurance I 
can provide is that, right now, my informants are confident this sort 
of activity could not happen.
<P>
	I am satisfied that this is the end of the story, but I assure you 
that we will be watching the situation closely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	We have learned that an individual who is supposed to be 
working on top secret projects in a maximum security location, 
right inside an army research establishment, is able, apparently 
without difficulty and unbeknownst to anyone, to spend weeks and 
months using army computers to supply an international child 
pornography network. This lack of control is impossible to 
understand.
<P>
	Given the appalling weaknesses in the army's security system, 
how can the minister assure us, with any credibility, that there are 
not other similar activities, or even espionage activities, going on 
within his department or within the armed forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as far as 
espionage goes, it is obviously very difficult. We know that this is 
an environment in which there are many secrets. We do not know if 
anyone knows what goes on in an espionage environment.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	When my hon. colleague asks me whether this could be going on 
elsewhere, I am going to be very frank, because you are talking 
about the integrity or the credibility of the minister and of the 
department. With over 80,000 people working in the department, I 
would be very reluctant to give you any assurances that there were 
not among them the sorts of people who visit, here  in Ottawa, and 
throughout the country, as you are all aware, sites that sell very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7310"> 7310 </A></B>
<P>
explicit videos or advertise their availability. The Internet 
continues to provide this kind of information, not just to people 
working in the Department of National Defence, but to people in all 
sectors of society.
<P>
	This is not a phenomenon associated exclusively with the 
Department of National Defence. It is a phenomenon that must be 
addressed. As I told the hon. Leader of the Opposition, we do not 
have all the answers as to how to control access, or to be certain 
that no one will abuse this kind of system.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I would remind you to always 
address your comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
because it goes on elsewhere does not make it acceptable in this 
case.
<P>
	Despite the military police, despite the additional measures that 
must be part of normal routine in a military research establishment, 
it was not until the OPP got involved that this scandal finally came 
to light.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, in his department, the same 
department that held a monumental search a few months ago-they 
looked in all the files, all the computer files, all the filing cabinets, 
and they even turned the waste paper baskets upside down, in order 
to find the missing documents-nobody saw anything then, and 
that it was not until the OPP investigation that this situation came 
to light?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously the 
hon. member was wondering how these things could have gone on 
for a period of time. Clearly, no one knows, because if the hon. 
member or myself had seen this kind of material, we would have 
taken action.
<P>
	As for the research establishment in question, it would have been 
surprising to find any information related to the Somalia inquiry 
there. But I want to assure my hon. colleague that this will not end 
here. The issue goes much further, and we will be using the means 
at our disposal to try to avoid a recurrence of this kind of situation.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DISTINCTSOCIETY">DISTINCT SOCIETY</A></H3>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister told me in question period that 
distinct society was something to which he subscribed all along. 
How soon he forgets: the Prime Minister certainly did not believe 
in distinct society strongly enough to support the Meech Lake 
accord when he was running for the Liberal leadership in 1990. 
Even John Turner was recently surprised at the Prime  Minister's 
conversion to the idea of distinct society in the Constitution.
<P>
	My question is very simple. Why the flip-flop? Why is he 
supporting distinct society and special status for Quebec now when 
he would not and could not support it in 1990?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the text and the premise 
of the hon. member's question are simply false.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate that but I was quoting from yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	We were both here in 1990. She was busy busy with the 
leadership campaign and knows exactly what the Prime Minister 
was saying on the campaign trail in 1990.
<P>
	That was flip-flop number one. Let us look at flip-flop number 
two. It is also from <I>Hansard</I>; I am not dreaming it up.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister said that he had ruled out a 
nationwide referendum on distinct society. This flies in the face of 
the Prime Minister's promise to give Canadians a say in the future 
of their country. It also flies in the face of his commitment back in 
1992, which I am sure the Deputy Prime Minister will remember, 
to put any major constitutional change to a referendum.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister keep the promises he made in 1992 and 
in the recent throne speech to hold a national referendum on any 
attempt to entrench distinct society in the Constitution?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the premise of the 
hon. member's question is false.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
something far more serious at stake here than someone standing up 
and just saying that the premise of the question is false.
<P>
	I was quoting yesterday's edition of <I>Hansard</I> and quoting 
something the Prime Minister of the country said in 1992 before he 
was Prime Minister.
<P>
	It is easy to toss this off, but when the Prime Minister is going 
directly against things which he said earlier, that he is about to 
entrench distinct society with the support of only seven provinces 
and 50 per cent of the population, surely the Deputy Prime Minister 
remembers what the Prime Minister did only a year ago, which was 
to entrench the veto for the five regions in the country.
<P>
	Since B.C., Alberta and Ontario all have serious reservations 
about entrenching distinct society and special status in our 
Constitution, I would like to ask this one more time. How do the 
government, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister 
expect to  entrench distinct society in the Constitution? How in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7311"> 7311 </A></B>
<P>
world will it ever pass the five region veto which this government 
brought forward last year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we hear the 
poisonous rhetoric emanating from the Reform Party it is no 
wonder it is in the position it is in the current polls.
<P>
	The hon. member, instead of lecturing the Prime Minister on his 
commitment to recognize the distinctiveness of Quebec, a 
recognition that he has characterized throughout his career, would 
be better off if she talked to some of her own colleagues.
<P>
	I have a quote of the kind of poisonous rhetoric that is emanating 
from the member for Simcoe Centre who, in a recent unity forum, 
said: ``French Canadian prime ministers have led this country 
down the road to ruin. The mood is that they are not doing their 
job''.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member what the member for 
Simcoe Centre heard from one of his constituents: ``If you dump on 
French Canadians you are going to send this country down the road 
to separation''.
<P>
	You are sending this country down the road to separation. That is 
the kind of vicious rhetoric which pits Canada against Quebec and 
we will not stand for it.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr.

making consistent comments in this House, but there is a limit. For 
example, when she was appointed heritage minister, she pledged to 
save Radio Canada International.
<P>
	Will the heritage minister explain to the House why, barely one

<P>
	I am pleased to see that the hon. member, who wants to destroy 
Canada, is nevertheless supportive of the CBC. Now, this shows a 
lack of consistency in the Bloc Quebecois' policy. These people 
want to destroy the country, but they also want the CBC to keep 
broadcasting abroad.
<P>
	Regardless of that inconsistency on the part of the Bloc, it goes 
without saying that the government hopes to  find the means to

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last Friday, the decision to shut down Radio Canada International 
was announced. But the minister had promised, she had given her 
word, that Radio Canada International would remain open as long 
as she was the minister. The Minister of Canadian Heritage 
recently had to resign for not keeping her word over the GST.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Canadian Heritage tell us why she is still 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage today, after once again failing to 
keep her word and save Radio Canada International?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the door is still open as 
far as Radio Canada International is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the minister renege on her promise to  save Radio Canada 
International when we all know what the solution is? Everyone 
knows it and it has been clearly shown that, in making budget 
choices, she herself has decided to waste $43 million: $20 million 
on the propaganda agency operating under the name of Canada 
Information Office and $23 million on the flag project, when all 
she would need to save Radio Canada International is $16 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that the 
decision not to fund half of Radio Canada International was made 
by the board of directors of the CBC. I hope that the hon. member 
is not suggesting that we force the CBC to spend money outside of 
its mandate.
<P>
	That having been said, there is no doubt that I have worked and 
continue to work with my colleagues in government. We have been 
unsuccessful in finding alternate funding to cover the money lost 
because of the CBC's budgetary problems, but we have not shut the 
door on anything and, if at all possible, we would like to work 
together, in co-operation, to find a solution like we did last year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
exchange on Radio Canada International gives us an idea of just 
how far out of touch and out of control this minister is. She has 
absolutely no idea what is going on within her own department.
<P>
	Radio Canada International's closing was announced in 
December last year and we had 125 people working for Radio 
Canada International who did not have any idea what their future 
was going to be. And now it has been announced again in 
December this year. What in the world is going on? Why does she 
not have some kind of idea of where the funding will come from for 
functions within her very own department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member actually 
took the time to examine the estimates of the government he would 
know that RCI actually falls under the Department of Foreign 
Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have in 
my hand a news release from the minister dated March 21, 1996: 
``The enormous outpouring of support for RCI, both within Canada 
and around the world, has persuaded us that it is a vital voice for 
Canada which we must maintain. ``While we have managed to put 
together a financial package for the coming fiscal year, all the 
parties with an interest in RCI must now work together to develop a 
long term funding solution''.
<P>
	She was responsible, according to this news release of March 21, 
1996, yet she has done absolutely nothing, has put the jobs of 125 
people at risk and has closed down the voice of Canada 
internationally.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7313"> 7313 </A></B>
<P>
	Why does she not get her act together? Why did she not have 
some funding in place so that we would not be going through this 
fire drill with nobody in charge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I am 
encouraged by the hon. member's support for Radio Canada 
because unfortunately when we as a government announced the 
rescue package last March this very member spoke out against it. 
This is the same member who recently passed a minority 
committee report in which he said: ``A national federally funded 
television broadcaster is not essential''. This is the position that he 
took before the standing committee on heritage.
<P>
	Perhaps if he could bring the same clarity of thought to the 
House of Commons as he did to the committee, then with the 
support of the Reform Party, the support of Bloc and the support of 
Canadians we could keep this very vital voice alive.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the heritage minister.
<P>
	In letters she sent to cultural organizations confirming grants, 
the heritage minister asked them to display and promote the 
Canadian flag, and to encourage pride in Canadian citizenship. 
Federal government grants to cultural organizations therefore now 
depend on these organizations taking part in Heritage Canada's 
propaganda campaign.
<P>
	Is the heritage minister aware that in these and all her other 
dealings she comes across not as the minister of heritage but as the 
minister of propaganda?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am proud of my country 
and I am proud of my flag.
<P>
	I find it completely consistent with my cultural responsibilities, 
just as Quebec's Minister of Culture wants taxpayers to know 
where provincial grants come from. We made the same request. 
Our request is exactly the same as that made by Louise Beaudoin, 
Quebec's Minister of Culture.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am only too pleased to inform the House officially that it 
does not happen like that in Quebec. All grants are made by the 
Conseil des arts et de la culture, and nothing comes from the 
minister herself.
<P>
	What the heritage minister would really like is to go down in 
history as the minister who put all those flags out there.
<P>
	Does the heritage minister realize that, by making the promotion 
of culture, unity and the Canadian flag a prerequisite for obtaining 
grants from her department, she is trying to harness culture to 
political partisanship?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, as usual, 
the Bloc Quebecois does not have all the facts. We never required 
that the flag be flown. We encouraged it, just as Mme Beaudoin 
did.
<P>
	When festivals are financially supported by Canadian taxpayers, 
it is only natural that the Government of Canada should be 
recognized. For my part, as long as I live in a country called 
Canada, I will never be ashamed to fly my flag.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has agreed to import a small quantity of 
plutonium fuel for testing purposes at the research centre in Chalk 
River, Ontario. This naturally concerns many Canadians.
<P>
	Could the minister say what concrete assurances she can provide 
this House that this action is not compromising the safety of 
Canadians and that appropriate monitoring procedures will be put 
in place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to reassure the hon. member and all Canadians 
in relation to the announcement made yesterday by my counterpart, 
U.S. secretary of energy Hazel O'Leary.
<P>
	First, I want to remind colleagues that Canada has a lengthy 
history in terms of advocating the destruction of nuclear weapons. 
Colleagues will remember that in April the Prime Minister 
attended the safety and security summit in Moscow where he said 
that Canada had agreed in principle to look at the prospect of 
burning weapons grade plutonium in CANDU reactors.
<P>
	Yesterday my counterpart, the U.S. secretary of energy, 
announced the conclusion of phase one of an American study to 
determine safe and secure methods for disposal of weapons grade 
plutonium. The CANDU reactor is one of the three options that 
appears on that list. In fact, what now becomes necessary is to do a 
fuel test in relation to the utility on the CANDU.
<P>
	What I want to do today is reassure all members of this House 
that the fuel test is going to be conducted under the most stringent 
safety and security measures put in place, regulated and monitored 
by the Atomic Energy Control Board.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, today the Somalia inquiry has requested that the privy 
council extend its mandate. The inquiry has yet to complete its 
study on the deployment and the post-deployment phase of the 
Somalia mission.
<P>
	Will the defence minister assure Canadians that his government 
is not going to shut down the inquiry before it finishes all of its 
work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the commission 
of inquiry on Somalia has requested the privy council consider an 
extension of its mandate. Obviously the government will consider 
that request.
<P>
	I want to repeat to my hon. friend that I hope all members of this 
House will express their views on whether or not the inquiry should 
continue on, if they would like it to go for a year, two years, three 
years or four years, or if they think there might be some value in 
trying to learn the lessons of what happened in Somalia so that we 
can avoid a repetition of the intolerable incidents that took place 
there.
<P>
	I guess it is all a question of whether it happens in our lifetime or 
not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is very fine that the Minister of National Defence 
would blame the members of this House for the delay in the 
Somalia inquiry. We have to remember that it was the Department 
of National Defence that caused the delays in the work of the 
inquiry by failing to supply documents that the inquiry had 
requested in a timely fashion.
<P>
	Canadians want to know about the post-deployment phase of the 
mission and what went wrong at national defence headquarters and 
the Liberal government cover-up.
<P>
	Why will the minister and his government not prove to 
Canadians that they care more about the truth than public relations? 
Give the inquiry the time it needs to do its work.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always 
hesitate to comment on public relations because it is not a skill that 
I have acquired.
<P>
	As the government considers this matter I think it will be very 
important to understand what the position of everyone is with 
respect to this.
<P>
	It has been suggested that the government wants to continue the 
inquiry in order to avoid having to deal with it over the next year or 
two when an election would have  to be called constitutionally. We 
cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	If the hon. member through his party wishes to indicate that we 
should give unlimited time to the Somalia inquiry and the 
commissioners to do their work, however long that may take, 
however much it may cost and whatever the results may be, I would 
certainly ask the government to take that into account. Somehow it 
does not seem to be consistent with the Reform Party's usual 
practical and pragmatic and efficient way of approaching things.

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Again yesterday, we questioned the Minister of Industry about 
what is going on at the Space Agency. Once again, he attempted to 
minimize the allegations against the president of the agency, by 
reducing them to a mere matter of destroying handwritten notes, 
but it is far more than that. Obviously, the president of the agency 
also has a problem with his expense account.
<P>
	At the time he appointed Mr. Evans to the position of president 
of the Canadian Space Agency, was the minister aware that he had 
made an expense account claim which was dubious, to say the 
least, and which Roland Doré, the former president of the Space 
Agency, had refused?

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the

Speaker, it is very unfortunate that this member seems to be 
manipulated by information being spun out by a former employee 
of the space agency whose position was terminated in a 
reorganization, who is in the process of suing the agency and who 
thinks that the official opposition can be a medium for trying to 
prosecute his lawsuit.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is not replying to the question in any way whatsoever.

	We will therefore ask him how he can explain that the president 
of the Space Agency attempted to get reimbursed for a travel and 
meal claim for a trip to St-Hubert on June 3, 1994, when he 
travelled as this minister's seatmate on the plane and the meal was 
provided free of charge?

Mr. Speaker, just to illustrate how silly this is becoming, yes in 
fact, Mr. Evans did fly to St. Hubert on that occasion with me. No, 
there was no lunch provided. Second, Mr. Evans did not return on 
the aircraft. Third, evidently Mr. Evans did drive back to Ottawa. 
Apparently an expense claim was made. It was not paid and 
therefore was not improperly paid.
<P>
	This is getting pretty silly. I would suggest to the hon. member 
that she let the courts decide whether this friend of hers has a valid 
complaint or not. The courts can make that decision. She does not 
need to come into this place in order to try to disparage the

Speaker, I have a letter dated December 14, 1995 from the 
Canadian Wheat Board to a western farmer stating that it has no 
commercial market for hulless waxy barley.
<P>
	Could the agriculture minister explain why Alberta and 
Saskatchewan wheat pools are allowed to grow and market hulless 
waxy barley into the U.S. outside the Canadian Wheat Board 
pooling system yet a farmer like Andy McMechan is thrown in jail 
for doing the same thing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obviously very clear that under 
the regulations of the Canadian Wheat Board Act and other 
pertinent pieces of legislation there is an export procedure provided 
under the law and under the regulations for the exportation of all 
wheat and barley. All of those who comply with those rules and 
regulations may export.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Andy McMechan was ordered to refund $55,000 to the 
CWB pool account, the premiums he gained for selling his grain 
into the U.S. Yet wheat board officials have directed Saskatchewan 
farmers to flour mills in Saskatoon who have paid millions of 
dollars in premiums outside the pool account for unlicensed wheat.
<P>
	Would the minister of agriculture please explain where in the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act it allows for some farmers to gain 
premiums outside the pool and others are thrown in jail?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Recently in a statement to the Senate committee on banking, the 
minister committed to increasing the co-operation between 
regional development agencies, the Business Development Bank of 
Canada and other branches of its department, including science and 
research.
<P>
	What has the minister done to increase co-operation within 
Industry Canada to promote effective regional economic 
development and to support science and research in western 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the

Speaker, the matter of the co-ordination of the regional 
development agencies with Industry Canada and the various 
agencies that are part of the industry portfolio both in respect of 
science and technology as well as small business and the 
information highway has been a matter of the utmost importance to 
me.
<P>
	In western Canada we have seen the delivery of a variety of 
services related to each of those areas through the 91 western 
economic diversification offices that are available in western 
Canada in part through the Community Futures Development 
Corporation. We have seen contributions through western 
economic diversification to research and development projects

telecommunications and through Paprican and Ballard 
Technologies, both based in Vancouver, from Technology 
Partnerships Canada.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday a government study showed the huge cost of 
unemployment of up to $91 billion. The IMF has pointed to the 
high rate of unemployment in Canada as a cause for concern. Even 
the private sector seems to have lost faith in being able to create the 
jobs Canada needs. Indeed it is cutting jobs.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Finance has no vision for dealing with 
unemployment, will he pull together the stakeholders in this 
economy so we can build a vision for the future to deal with 
unemployment? Or, does he not care about all the unemployed 
people in the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we as a government did not adopt the scorched earth policy of 
either the Reform Party or the Conservative Party in our approach 
to the deficit. We simply wanted to deal with the question of 
growth in the economy and the consequent employment that would 
flow therefrom.
<P>
	As a result we have put enormous amounts of money into 
technology partnerships, as stated by my colleague the Minister of 
Industry. As my colleague the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has said, we have put enormous sums of money into 
youth employment. The Prime Minister's Team Canada approach 
has paid tremendous dividends to the country.
<P>
	The hon. member may have learned something from that report, 
but because of the devastating effects of unemployment the 
government has taken the decisive action it has taken. As a result 
we will continue to do so.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about having stakeholder meetings. We 
have done that with the business community. We have done that 
with the Canadian Labour Congress. We have done that with 
virtually every stakeholder. We will continue to meet with 
Canadians to create employment in Canada.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-70, 
an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing and 
Reduction Account Act and related acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will use 
my time in this debate to talk about two specific aspects of the bill. 
One is the use of time allocation, and I will speak specifically about 
the blended sales tax.
<P>
	It is important that we have the facts on the record. As of 
December 10, 1996 the government has placed before the House of 
Commons a total of 162 bills. Time allocation has been used on 20 
of these bills or 12.3 per cent of government legislation that has 
been presented.
<P>
	On four of the bills, however, either the Bloc Quebecois or the 
Reform Party gave procedural assistance for the implementation of 
time allocation, which in fact means that less than 10 per cent of 
the bills introduced by the government since the last election have 
been subjected to time allocation unilaterally applied by the 
government.
<P>
	Perhaps more relevant are the statistics on time allocation 
concerning the actual number of times that time allocation motions 
have been moved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Are you proud of this or what?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Actually, yes, I am.
<P>
	Since time allocation motions may be moved only at one or two 
stages of a bill, no bill may pass the House without opposition 
co-operation unless the government has applied time allocation 
two or three times to that one bill.
<P>
	A quick calculation of these facts shows that government bills in 
the House of Commons have been considered at 429 separate 
stages at which time allocation could have been applied. On only 
27 of these occasions has time allocation been applied, which is 
only 6.3 per cent of the time. On five of these occasions, however, 
at least one opposition party gave procedural assistance to the 
implementation of time allocation, leaving only 22 occasions on 
which the government unilaterally implemented time allocation. 
That is only 5.1 per cent of all possible occasions.
<P>
	Another important issue about time allocation is that Canadian 
citizens expect us to get on with the business of governing. They 
request that we move forward. We hear all the time about how slow 
government is and how much it needs to move forward. I would 
suggest, as those of us who came from the world of business know, 
that the time the discussion is called to an end we can agree to 
disagree, vote and move forward. I have absolutely no problem 
with our record.
<P>
	With regard to the blended sales tax I understand in this 
morning's debate there were some particularly outrageous 
comments on the concept of the blended sales tax.
<P>
	It seems the Bloc Quebecois has spent its time for debate on this 
important issue telling Atlantic Canadians that their elected 
officials, the bureaucrats and the people  of Atlantic Canada 
themselves do not know what they want and that the BQ knows 
what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7317"> 7317 </A></B>
<P>
Atlantic Canadians want. It is a pretty curious situation. They are 
trying to deny the Atlantic provinces the blended sales tax when 
they have had that system since the GST was implemented.
<P>
	The second component of their time was used to talk about the 
adjustment assistance package when that is not even being 
considered today. In fact it has already been dealt with in a previous 
bill.
<P>
	What do members of the House of Commons do? They are 
supposed to be debating the issue at hand. They are supposed to be 
getting on with the business of the day. They are supposed to be 
implementing legislation that Canadians want. Instead the 
opposition parties are getting into a silly game of trying to oppose 
the business we are trying to accomplish, to debate other issues that 
are not on the table and, in the case of the BQ, to use the time to tell 
people who actually elected them to make the decision for them 
that they are wrong and the BQ knows better.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	I suggest they run federal candidates in all the provinces in the 
next election and we will see where the chips will fall.
<P>
	I am particularly disturbed that my province does not have the 
opportunity to have a blended sales tax, even though we hear from 
Canadians and business people all the time about the complicated 
procedure of two sales taxes on two different bases, with two 
different collection times.
<P>
	In the last provincial election our premier advanced to the 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association the reasons we in Ontario 
need a blended sales tax. I will quote the premier of the province:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want something that works. And I'll tell you this: that if we had one VAT 
(value-added tax), one base, one bureaucracy to collect it, the manufacturers and the 
businesses in Ontario would save over a billion dollars by being able to deduct those 
costs that you cannot deduct today on the sales tax.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mike Harris went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has been one of the areas of major competitive disadvantage that Ontario 
manufacturers have had and Ontario businesses have had and I say, stop the rhetoric, 
stop the politics, stop the finger-pointing. Get on with harmonization and 
simplification of the GST-or whatever the new initials are-and the PST.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Harris underestimated the savings to provincial businesses 
and manufacturers by some $6 billion. The savings to the provinces 
and their businesses would be $7.8 billion with a blended tax 
system. So I say to Mr. Harris to stop the rhetoric, stop the finger 
pointing. Let us get on and make a better system for those 
provinces and businesses.
<P>
	Why are we giving a competitive advantage to the provinces of 
New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia  and Quebec? Why 
do our business people have to struggle with complicated 
paperwork many times during the 12 months of the year on two 
different bases. Why can they not deduct what they should be able 
to deduct for their input costs?
<P>
	Now is the time for action. Now is the time to end this debate and 
to move on to a vote on this issue. Let us go to the electorate with 
our platforms in place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the debate on Bill C-70 since 
question period and before. It occurs to me it has been a very 
interesting day in the House of Commons. We are faced with what I 
considered to be a double Liberal whammy. First, for the 
umpteenth time we are faced with time allocation or closure 
invoked by the government.
<P>
	The second whammy is the HST, the BST, the GST or whatever. 
I will speak for a second about the speech of the member for 
Burlington. She had some interesting statistics I would like to 
discuss.
<P>
	She spoke about using time allocation or closure for 12.3 per 
cent of the times that it could have been used. I would hardly be 
proud of that record. It amazes me. If the bar is set low enough it is 
easy to jump over it.
<P>
	To talk about the debt and the deficit, the Liberal government is 
now claiming what a wonderful job it has done with the economy 
and the finances of the country. The deficit is still well over $20 
billion a year. They are proud of using closure 12 per cent of the 
time. It blows my mind. It amazes me that anybody from any party, 
including my own, would ever have the gall to stand up and be 
proud of records like that. It just shocks me.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk for just a second about the idea of closure. After we 
were elected in 1993, we came to Ottawa and heard all the media 
stories. The Prime Minister and members of the government would 
stand up and say: ``We are going to be different. This is going to be 
a new Parliament. The 35th Parliament is going to be something of 
which we, as parliamentarians, can be proud''.
<P>
	I am afraid that I have been seriously disappointed in that aspect. 
Yes, the first couple of months of January 1994 started with some 
level of decorum that probably has not been seen in this House for 
many years. It deteriorated rapidly.
<P>
	We are seeing again on a regular basis things like closure being 
used in the most undemocratic fashion anyone could ever imagine. 
We live in Canada. I am proud to be a Canadian. I am proud to live 
in our democracy. By the same token, I am deeply ashamed to be 
part of a system at times uses the most undemocratic tactics. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7318"> 7318 </A></B>
<P>
would expect to see those kinds of tactics in  many other countries 
but those are countries that I would prefer not to live in.
<P>
	To stand up in the House today and talk about using closure12 per cent of the time is something that I find unbelievable. The 
member for Burlington said: ``Let's have an election. Let's find out 
what the people want''. That is good. Let us have an election. I am 
prepared to do that. When Canadians see and understand what kind 
of undemocratic government we have at this point in time, they 
will say: ``Thank you very much. We will try somebody else''. I am 
looking forward to that day with great interest.
<P>
	The member for Burlington seemed disappointed and was 
complaining that perhaps the opposition parties, including our 
party, wanted to stall the debate further. Some of these bills have 
great importance. She implied in her speech that it is fine to speak 
in debate as long as we agree with the government.
<P>
	I think back to three bills in particular, Bill C-68, Bill C-33 and 
this bill, where the government used closure to ram the bills 
through as fast as it possibly could. Why did it do that?
<P>
	It is because Canadians are not in favour of these types of bills. I 
believe that the opposition has a duty to convey in the House the 
thoughts of the people of Canada. That is why we did it. We do not 
do it to stand up here and waste time. We are very busy people. We 
do not need to listen to ourselves speak.
<P>
	They are important bills. Bill C-68, Bill C-33 and now Bill C-70 
have tremendous impact on the future of this country. It is our right 
and our duty to speak. That is why I was elected and why 
everybody else in this House was elected, to truly debate those very 
critical issues.
<P>
	Just recently we supported the government on the Tobacco Act. 
We wanted to see it go through as quickly as possible. We felt that 
Canadians were in favour of it. We agreed with the government. We 
said: ``Let's do this. Let's get it through''. We did. It is done.
<P>
	I do not think it is fair for any government member to stand up 
and criticize us for asking for more open, honest, democratic 
debate. I know I do not have much time left but for the minutes that 
I have left, I want to talk about the GST or the HST or the BST. I do 
not care what it is called. They are all one and the same.
<P>
	The member for Kindersley-Lloydminster talked a few 
minutes ago, before question period, about the BST. He is from 
Saskatchewan where we all know what BS stands for. I am from 
Saskatchewan as well. I also know what HS could stand for. It is all 
one and the same, it is still a tax. I have horses on my farm and 
therefore I do know what HS could stand for.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	A tax is a tax is a tax. One cannot get around it and it cannot be 
hidden. People are not stupid and they realize  exactly what is 
going on. To call it the HST or the BST or the GST or the ABC, it is 
still a tax. Canadians are tired of taxes. We are taxed to death.
<P>
	In question period we talked of jobs and what the high 
unemployment rate costs in dollars. It is difficult to put an number 
on it but we do know that high taxation causes unemployment. That 
is just a plain and simple fact of life and there is no getting around 
it.
<P>
	I have two friends in my riding, Elwood Nelson and Keith 
Talbot, who are both auctioneers. Recently I was talking to them 
about the problems the GST causes in their business. It causes 
tremendous trouble. These two gentlemen generally hold farm 
sales where they sell pieces of equipment, tools and so on. There 
would be hundreds and hundreds of items at any one auction sale 
on a farm.
<P>
	Their difficulty is determining for what each individual item has 
been used and whether it is a personal item or a business use item. 
There are hundreds of items at one auction sale and these 
auctioneers hold sometimes 60, 80 or 100 auction sales a year. It is 
impossible to determine whether that piece of equipment or that 
tool has been used as a personal item or for business purposes. 
There is a difference in how they collect the GST and submit it.
<P>
	They do not have a clue and they have been led down the garden 
path by Revenue Canada on the GST for six years. The rules 
change every six months. Somebody comes in with a new idea and 
they change it all over again. The same thing is going to happen 
when the tax is harmonized. They are going to have to go back and 
start all over again just has they have done so many times in the 
past.
<P>
	I think of people who run stores. Recently I asked a woman: 
``What do you think of the GST?'' She said: ``I hate it, Allan, but at 
least it is in. It is in my computers, in my cash register and it is 
done. I don't like it but I have to live with it''. What is going to 
happen when the HST comes in, or the BST, or whatever it is 
called? They are going to have to change again.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you know who they are going to remember? 
They will not think about Brian Mulroney. They are going to think 
about the Liberal government. They are going to think about this 
finance minister and they are going to say: ``That's the guy that did 
it to me this time. First it was Mulroney, now it is the finance 
minister''. The same thing, it makes no difference.
<P>
	My colleague for Prince George-Peace River gave a very fine 
speech in the House just before question period and he said: 
``Liberal, Tory, same old story''. They are going to remember the 
people who made them change and cost them a tremendous amount 
of money once again.
<P>
	I cannot believe this is going on. If I were a Liberal member of 
Parliament who is seeking re-election I would be embarrassed to go 
out back on the campaign trail to  be asked: ``What about that GST 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7319"> 7319 </A></B>
<P>
thing''? and have to say: ``Oh, we are sorry, we made a mistake''. I 
am ready. Let us try it.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
really quite an occasion to be able to stand up and speak one more 
time on the GST. In fact, if we could go over a little of the history 
of it, Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will remember all too well back to 
1990-91. Many of the people who are in the Chamber today cannot 
remember the experience but you and I certainly do, sir. You will 
remember the vitriolic attacks that came from this side of the 
House. I could point out the seat that you sat in when you criticized 
the GST. It was really something. Of course, we were in agreement. 
This member looks so young he was hardly born at that time, but in 
fact he was around somewhere, but not in the Chamber. I remember 
all too well the attacks that came from the Liberal opposition about 
the GST and how terrible it was.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Of course when the Liberals came into power-you remember 
this, Mr. Speaker, because you campaigned in 1993 just as I 
did-and it was going to be gone. I am sure the people in the 
Niagara Falls area as well as the people in northern Alberta 
thought: ``Oh, finally, if the Liberals come into power, then we are 
going to see an end to this dreaded GST''.
<P>
	For heaven's sake, what do you think happened next? Page 22 of 
the red book became absolutely famous. I would quote from it now, 
Mr. Speaker, but you know I do not have my copy any longer, but I 
certainly know what page 22 said. It said that the federal 
government was going to do away with the GST. What do we have? 
It is a kind of symphony really. It is a harmonization. The GST is 
still here. It is alive and well. Now it is going to be the HST, the 
BST or whatever it is. It is not a good thing.
<P>
	It is easy for members to put on a brave face now that the 
Liberals are in government and say: ``What we are doing is the very 
best thing for you''. We hear time and time again about people who 
have retail businesses. In my area we have a lot of farmers. The 
horror stories that they are phoning my office with are hard to 
believe.
<P>
	Here is a good one, or a bad one, depending on which way one 
wants to look at it. A farmer phoned my office not too long ago and 
said that because farm equipment is exempt he is allowed to 
receive a GST rebate or exemption on it. It was okay if he bought a 
half-ton truck. He would be able to get the GST back.
<P>
	However, one farmer bought an extended cab half-ton truck. A 
regular truck with no extended cab was fine but he bought an 
extended cab truck because he kept his saddles and bailer twine and 
so on in the back seat. Do you know what happened? The GST 
department said: ``No, no. This becomes a luxury vehicle and so 
you have to pay GST on it''.
<P>
	Then I would get another call from somebody else who would 
say: ``I have a suburban, an entirely closed in vehicle, and I can 
claim exemption on that''.
<P>
	It just shows what a disastrous nightmare this whole thing has 
been. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you have had the odd call in your 
office as well. I do not think our regions of Canada are that much 
apart on these issues that you have not had a call or two in your own 
constituency office saying: ``What in heaven's name is going on 
here''.
<P>
	I would like to go back to when the GST initially came in. It was 
going to be revenue neutral. I am sure if I jog your memory,Mr. Speaker, you will remember it was Bill C-21, the deficit and 
debt reduction account, that was passed in the 34th Parliament. All 
excess revenue was to go to pay down the deficit and then the debt. 
Guess what. That did not happen.
<P>
	I put several dollars into that because I believe that if we are 
going to put our money where our mouth is then we had better 
contribute to that. As you know, Mr. Speaker, I have put my 10 per 
cent pay deduction into the deficit and debt reduction account for 
some time.
<P>
	The question is far bigger than that. Is this tax a good tax or not. 
The answer across the country has to be no. Some points of it were 
good in terms of making it visible. Canadians are not the type of 
people who are going to remember something for five years 
generally. We complain about something for 20 minutes and then 
we get out our cheque book, write a cheque and say: ``That is the 
government for you'' and we carry on.
<P>
	Yet five years later there is a vehemence, a vitriolic spirit across 
the country about the GST and now the heat is being raised one 
more level with the BST in Atlantic Canada. If you look at the 
specifics of that, the Atlantic premiers were bribed into signing this 
$1 billion deal. It was borrowed taxpayers' money. They were 
Liberal governments. They were tempted, if you will. They were 
bamboozled. It was hogwash. The point is it was $1 billion of 
borrowed money.
<P>
	It is as if the government said: ``We are doing a great thing here. 
We are going to pay off our Visa but we are using our Mastercard to 
do it''. That simply cannot happen. The federal government took 
this $1 billion of borrowed money to their political friends in 
Atlantic Canada, the Liberals, and said: ``Come on guys. We have 
to live up to page 22 here. We have to have harmony here in the 
symphony, so please help us out any way you can''. It cost a billion 
dollars of taxpayers' money borrowed on MasterCard. There is 
something dreadfully wrong with that because we cannot live 
beyond our means. I suppose the Canadian taxpayers, those from 
Atlantic Canada who have signed on to this deal and those of us 
who live in other parts of the country can literally say thanks a 
billion.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7320"> 7320 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Where is this cash coming from? The money does not just 
bubble up from under the surface. These are real cheques which are 
being sent to the government at income tax time from real people 
working in real jobs. A billion dollars to kick this thing into motion 
and people on the other side of the House say it is a really great 
deal. They say: ``We are are from the government and we are here 
to help you''. No wonder people get nervous when they see people 
from the government here.
<P>
	Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia are not even willing to 
discuss the federal proposal. Support for it is weak in Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island. When the government 
talks about full harmonization and how well everything is going to 
blend together and that it will be happy times for us in Canada as 
we move toward the next century, it simply is not true.
<P>
	People from my constituency, not just farmers but business 
people also, continually phone my office saying: ``Deb, you just 
cannot imagine how much manpower it takes to fill all of this out''. 
Sadly enough, one more level of it is being added at the Atlantic 
Canada level. The rest of Canada is saying absolutely not.
<P>
	It makes me think of my colleague next door in Edmonton 
Northwest who said that in Alberta it would be really great to blend 
or harmonize the sales tax. Mr. Speaker, I am not good at math and 
you know that. You have known that for years. However, if we have 
zero provincial sales tax in Alberta then what can we harmonize the 
GST with in order to make it 15 per cent? Any person in their right 
mind would say: ``Wait a minute, I am not sure we can blend this 
because there is nothing to blend it with''. We had enough of a hard 
time in Alberta going to any tax system. We have been blessed out 
there and we appreciate it is because of our natural resources.
<P>
	When I hear the Minister of Natural Resources say that in 
Alberta it would be a really good thing to blend it, she has to give 
her head a shake. If she thinks she is going to go door knocking in 
the next election saying: ``Harmony, ebony and ivory, let us live 
together in harmony'', it simply is not going to happen. They are 
going to laugh her right off the block.
<P>
	As my friend said earlier, I suspect that whether it was the Tories 
who brought in the GST or the Liberals who have pushed up the 
heat one notch on it to the BST, people really do not know the 
difference. All they know is they have been stuck with this tax and 
every time they buy two newspapers, let us say the Edmonton 
<I>Journal</I> and the Edmonton <I>Sun</I>, which equals a dollar, they also 
have to find a nickel and two pennies some place in their pocket to 
pay for them. I know that because every week when I go to the 
airport I run into the store to buy two newspapers. I cannot just flip 
a loonie out. I have to find the pennies and a nickel. It is a pain. Not 
a day goes by that a consumer does not say that they hate this tax.
<P>
	What is amazing about this tax is that Canadians are still angry 
about it this many years later. Whether it is the Conservative 
government that brought in the GST or whether it is the Liberal 
government that brought in the BST, which it is in the process of 
doing by ramming it through with time allocation, when Canadians 
go to the polls next time they are not really going to remember the 
difference. As far as it goes, with the old line federal parties, they 
say that whether it is the Liberals or the Conservatives, it means 
higher taxes, bigger government and more money in debt. Whether 
it is the Conservatives or Liberals, they are the two sides of the 
same loonie.
<P>
	One has to ask how Atlantic Canadians are feeling about this. Let 
us look at a couple of examples. Let us remember of course that all 
these people are represented in name by Liberal members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce predicts that the harmonized 
sales tax will push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent as well as 
force municipalities to raise property taxes. Does this make any 
sense? I would not think so. The Halifax Chamber of Commerce 
should be able to go to its MP's office and say: ``Okay girl, you go 
on up to Ottawa and tell them just exactly how we feel about it''. I 
am not sure she has been able to do that.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Real Estate Association says that harmonization 
will increase the costs of a new house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland and by $3,374 in New Brunswick. Nobody has that 
kind of cash to pay out.
<P>
	The GST was wrong. The GST was bad. The BST is wrong. The 
BST is bad. I know that Canadians are still going to be angry about 
this in the next election campaign. They will say: ``Wait a minute. 
Liberal, Tory: one gave us one, one gave us the other. They are the 
same thing. They are the two sides of the same loonie''. The 
Liberals may meet the same fate that the Conservatives did in 
1993.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
just to reiterate, we are talking about Bill C-70, an act to amend the 
Excise Tax Act and other acts so as to accommodate the GST and 
make it into the BST or blend it or harmonize it or otherwise.
<P>
	My question to the House and the people of Canada is: What is 
the impact of the GST? Is this a good thing or is it dividing us?
<P>
	It has been a very unsettling thing from its inception. The way 
the government is carrying on at the moment, trying to get different 
regions to buy into it, is once again pitting Canadians against 
Canadians. It is characteristic of the government to do just that. It 
will confer special privileges on some groups of people and say: 
``If you are in this group, then you have these privileges. If you are 
not, then you do not have them''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7321"> 7321 </A></B>
<P>
	What we need in Canada is equality. We need equality between 
all Canadians and we need equality between all of the provinces. 
My suggestion is that the GST and any of its offshoots are tearing 
the country apart and that is not good.
<P>
	The other aspect which I would like to address concerns 
integrity. I will keep using the word integrity to show in what way 
the GST is reflective of integrity in government. Let us start with 
the GST as an election promise.
<P>
	Canadians are probably tired of hearing all of this, but this has 
caused us to say: Why did the Liberals as a party make a bunch of 
promises and put them in the red book? Was it to get themselves 
elected or was it to better govern the country? The answer is 
obvious. It was a book of promises cobbled together to win an 
election. Never mind the results. As long as they could promise 
enough and get the message out, people would vote for them and 
then they could do whatever they wanted.
<P>
	We have used the GST as an example of a Liberal broken 
promise time after time in the House. Perhaps it is the prime 
example, but it certainly is not the only one. We did a study of the 
red book promises. We calculated that 30-odd per cent of the 
promises in the red book have been kept by the Liberal 
government. The government's estimate is that 70-odd per cent of 
the promises have been kept. Canadians can make up their own 
minds by looking at the red book, if they want to take the trouble to 
find out who is speaking the truth.
<P>
	In any event the GST is typical of an integrity issue. Before the 
government was elected it said: ``We must form the government. It 
does not matter what we say, we have to get the votes''.
<P>
	The red book is also typical of the difference between the 
Liberals and their way of doing things and Reform and its ways. 
The Liberals in cobbling together the red book, started from the 
top. It is a backroom document, with input of course from other 
areas. They said: ``What is it that we need to really convince the 
public?''
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, Reformers get together and say: ``Here are the 
principles and policies. We need to make positive changes in the 
country''. Those policies and principles come from the bottom up. 
They are grassroots stimulated and they are ordinary people who 
say: ``These are the changes that we need''. Our fresh start 
document is a reflection of that, from the ground up rather than 
from the top down.
<P>
	I am using the GST as an example, but let us look at integrity as 
reflected by the current government. There was talk about an ethics 
counsellor. Again it was a red book promise that there would be an 
ethics counsellor. Not only would the Liberals deal with the GST 
but they would do all these other things.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor has turned out to be a will-o'-the-wisp. 
What are the terms of reference for the ethics counsellor? Some of 
them have been published, but when it comes down to the 
nitty-gritty, they are concealed. It is a matter between the Prime 
Minister and that counsellor and not open for the rest of us to see. 
That is not integrity.
<P>
	Look at party discipline across the way. The member for York 
South-Weston is a prime example. Here is a man who stood on his 
honour and said: ``I as a member of the Liberal Party took part in 
the decision to eliminate the GST. We have reneged on that 
decision. As a matter of honour, I will opt out''. He is being 
severely punished and will continue to be for being an honourable 
man. That is not a good example of integrity on the part of the 
Liberals or the Liberal government, however one would choose to 
put it.
<P>
	What else is this negative GST tearing apart? What else is it 
doing to the country? We hear examples from across Canada about 
the negative effects of it.
<P>
	One of my constituents felt strongly enough about the GST that 
he said he believed the government was doing something illegal 
with this tax so he refused to pay it. He ran a shop called the 
Sandwich Tree in Nanaimo. He was prosecuted by Revenue Canada 
for not collecting the GST, but he held his ground. So far he has 
won two court decisions on this but of course he is not finished 
with it. Through Revenue Canada the government is saying: ``Get 
him''. Whether the government has good legal background to say 
this, I do not know. But the evidence I see is that this man is not just 
being prosecuted, rather I think he is being persecuted. His wife's 
salary has been garnisheed as has his own. He is not a free many 
any more, I can assure the House of that, whether or not he has won 
the first two rounds of this case.
<P>
	Integrity. There are examples of integrity or its opposite in this 
House every single day, whether it is talking about the GST or 
about other subjects. I hear the Minister of Finance every day 
saying things that are patently not correct about the Reform Party. 
He puts our policies in a way which is totally twisted, and this is 
wrong. If that is an example of integrity as with the GST, I am not 
with it.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage today in exactly the same 
way did the same thing when talking with one of our members, 
supposedly answering a question on what our policy is with regard 
to the CBC. She deliberately chose to say things that are not 
Reform policy. She absolutely, deliberately said: ``No, this is what 
you guys are advocating'', and it was patently wrong.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The GST is not doing good things for the country. It is not doing 
anything for individuals, for groups or for regions. It is certainly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7322"> 7322 </A></B>
<P>
not doing anything for our  economy except driving it underground. 
That makes the situation even worse. We do not need the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard a lot of debate on the issue. Some 
tremendous speeches have been made today. They have been 
entertaining and nice to listen to.
<P>
	I was reminded of a farmer who got shafted on a horse he did not 
really want. He went to an auction sale. He needed a good work 
horse. The auctioneer asked his helper to bring out one of the 
horses. The helper led it around. It pranced. It was a big, heavy set 
horse. He felt this was exactly what he needed. He got it at a pretty 
fair price and went home very happy. He took it off his buggy to 
take into the barn and found out that it was stone blind. It could not 
see the barn door.
<P>
	What does someone do with a blind horse? It is not a very good 
work horse unless it is led back and forth down the field. He said: 
``What am I going to do? I got shafted. I have to get rid of this 
horse. I have to get some money out of it''.
<P>
	This is what this tax reminds me of. He advertised it. He said: ``I 
am going to advertise this huge, heavy set horse as a real good, 
powerful beast. I will advertise it at a bargain. I will get my money 
back somehow''.
<P>
	Another farmer read about it in the papers. He came over and 
said: ``Could I have a look at the horse you have for sale? It sounds 
like a fairly good bargain''. He went into the barn and led the horse 
out. He pranced it around in his yard. He showed the other farmer 
how big it was, how capable it was and how flexible it was.
<P>
	The other farmer said: ``It looks like a good horse to me''. He 
said: ``It is a good horse''. He spoke with a bit of an accent. He 
said: ``It is a good horse but it don't look so good''. It is not really 
what you see''. He said: ``I don't care about looks. It is a big horse. 
I am going to buy it. I think it will do the job for me''.
<P>
	He took it home and when he went to put it in the barn he found 
out it was blind. He got shafted. He went back to the first farmer 
and he was mad. He said: ``Look here, you sold me a horse that was 
a real heavy horse, a good work horse that could pull a big load and 
it is blind''. He said: ``I tried to tell you it don't look so good''.
<P>
	That is what I hear with this GST today. He told them that it was 
blind, that it just did not look so good. That is probably what we 
heard from the Liberals when they were in opposition: ``This GST 
is terrible. We will have nothing to do with that animal''.
<P>
	What did those terrible Tories do? They brought in eight other 
people to fill the other place a little more to get it passed. When the 
Liberals ran for government they said: ``These terrible Tories don't 
look so good. They have this terrible tax. They are ripping off 
farmers. They are ripping off taxpayers and consumers. If we get 
elected  we will kill that tax. We will bury it. We will tramp on it. 
We will hang it''.
<P>
	I do not know all that they said. I heard a lot of different 
comments that they would get rid of it just like the farmer did with 
his horse.
<P>
	Today some lofty Liberals are saying it is a pretty good tax. They 
ask why we are complaining. It is a good horse. To whom will they 
sell it next? Could they sell it another time? I do not think they 
could sell it to farmers. It does not look so good to them.
<P>
	The other day we talked about a businessman who was dealing 
with the GST issue. An inspector from the GST department came 
out to do his audit. He said: ``I see you have a truck sitting in the 
yard. You have not claimed all the GST on it. What is the reason?'' 
He said: ``The truck is taxable. The hoist is not taxable. The box is 
taxable. I have a terrible problem figuring it out''. He said: ``What 
do you mean the hoist is not taxable?'' ``It is a separate entity and it 
is not taxable. It is for a different use''. He said: ``I don't believe 
you''.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	The inspector wanted to find out if it was true. He phoned his 
superior but the superior was not in the office. He had gone away 
on a three-day educational trip or something. The inspector sat in 
this businessman's office for three days. Finally the superior 
phoned back and tried to give him a ruling. He said: ``I don't know. 
You will have to ask somebody else''. For three days he waited. 
Imagine how much GST it took to pay his wages.
<P>
	These are the problems. Not everything is taxable. Some things 
are taxable. Some of the horses are blind. Some can see.
<P>
	How will we sell this sucker in the next election? We will have to 
dress it up some. The horse that does not look so good will not sell 
again. Let us dress it up and say that we will harmonize it. Maybe 
we can give it a little better colour. It might just look a little better 
in the dark even if the horse cannot see. This is the way taxpayers 
and voters get shafted during elections.
<P>
	We must start being honest and accountable. We must show the 
integrity we promised during the election campaign. I guarantee 
the House that when we sit on that side there will not be any GST. 
At the least it would be called something else. It will not be a GST. 
That tax has hurt business and jobs. Why would we keep the 
sucker? That is why I am saying it will not be there.
<P>
	I am sure they will all vote for me now. They did in the last 
election. They put 177 Liberals over on that side when previously 
there were a few Liberals here and 212 Conservatives on that side. 
Somehow we have to sell the stuff.
<P>
	I hope consumers, farmers and electors get what politicians 
promised them. When the previous government had 10 per cent 
unemployment nobody  thought it was acceptable. We still have
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7323"> 7323 </A></B>
<P>
10 per cent unemployment and we have $100 billion more in debt. 
Something has to change or the country will not survive.
<P>
	Promises do not get us anywhere. If all the promises made in this 
House had been kept I am sure there would not be $600 billion of 
debt.
<P>
	Who will look after those promises in the future? Will it be our 
children or our grandchildren? Let us show some integrity. Let us 
call a blind horse a blind horse if it is one. Let us call a Holstein 
cow a milk cow and not a beef cow. That way we will probably get 
something done in the House.
<P>
	It concerns me when I hear a dozen good speeches that will 
probably have very little effect outside the House. The country is a 
lot bigger than the inside of the House. Approximately 30 million 
Canadians depend on the House to set down regulations and taxes 
so Canada can survive and operate efficiently. They expect us 
somehow to take care of the $600 billion that have been put on the 
shoulders of future generations. If we do not start addressing that 
issue I am afraid politicians will not be rated second from the 
bottom as they were in the last CTV integrity poll. They will be 
rated at the bottom, right below lawyers and other legal people.
<P>
	We must ensure that politicians begin to climb in the ratings of 
integrity and honesty. We must try to get politicians back up to the 
top where former prime ministers, former oppositions and former 
members of the House once were. We must realize the country was 
built on broken promises. The promises that were kept built the 
country. If we do not return to the old system where taxpayers or 
the electorate hold us accountable for the promises made, I do not 
think the country will survive.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I reiterate. Let us not sell a blind horse to the electorate in the 
next election. Let us give them one that really pulls the country out 
of the mess it is in. Then we will have accomplished something.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Lisgar-Marquette on 
his very colourful, heartfelt and passionate speech. I certainly do 
not think I have his experience to be able to provide that kind of 
wonderful analogy on the serious topic we are speaking about 
today.
<P>
	The government is very happy in trundling out many statistics. It 
is very happy in saying what a good job it has done economically. It 
is very happy in saying it has kept over 80 per cent of its red book 
promises. That is simply not true.
<P>
	Before the last election one of the primary planks in the platform 
the government ran on was that it would scrap the GST. The GST 
was to go. If the GST was not scrapped some of its members said 
the would resign. The  GST has not been scrapped. It is firmly 
entrenched into our tax structure.
<P>
	This is very important for a number of reasons. First, it is 
disingenuous. Second, it shows the government has not kept its 
promises. Third and most important, it crushes the economy, 
affecting the livelihood of every Canadian.
<P>
	Instead of trying to scrap this hated tax, instead of trying to 
remove a tax that impedes the ability of companies to get on their 
feet, to hire people and become more aggressive competitively, the 
government is trying to harmonize this tax, bury it. This will not 
help people. Rather it will cost the taxpayer, the consumer and the 
producer hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
<P>
	Producers and consumers in the maritimes have been saying that 
harmonizing the GST will cost millions of dollars. It will not only 
compromise those who are rich. By harmonizing the tax people in 
the lower socioeconomic groups are impeded and compromised. It 
impedes and compromises people on fixed incomes. Those are the 
people who get it in the neck much more so than anyone else. 
Harmonizing the tax in the way the government suggests will 
compromise and impede the poorest individuals living in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	Furthermore the tax is being sponsored by British Columbia and 
Alberta. They have paid over $1 billion. Those are the facts. It does 
not bring the country together if one segment of society has to 
offset another segment of society in this manner.
<P>
	Certainly the maritimes need money but they need effective 
investment, infrastructure and skills training to maximize the 
possibilities and potential which exist on the east coast.
<P>
	For all it wishes to do the government fails in bringing out its 
statistics to mention that it has increased taxes over 22 times. It 
stands there and spouts off about how well we are doing 
economically. It fails to mention the unemployment rate in Canada 
is over 10 per cent. In fact the underemployment rate, along with 
our unemployment rate, approaches 20 per cent.
<P>
	Sooke in the western part of my riding has over a 20 per cent 
unemployment rate. This is an area of immense diversity and 
immense potential. Yet it has a 20 per cent unemployment rate. 
When I go to the people who work in my riding, the producers, the 
consumers and the people who hire, the primary obstacle to getting 
back on their feet is the high taxes they labour under.
<P>
	There are some possibilities and solutions which I will present 
today to the House. The first thing we have to do is get the deficit 
down to zero. We have proposed through the fresh start platform a 
plan to get our deficit down to zero by 1999. After that we propose 
to eliminate the GST.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7324"> 7324 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	We also propose to lower the tax burden on individuals. That 
basically comes down to the fact that our philosophy is very 
different from that of liberalism. The Liberal philosophy is that the 
government will take care of society. We agree that society has to 
be taken care of. We agree that those who are disadvantaged in our 
society must be provided for if they cannot help themselves. 
However, it is not the government's position to always do that.
<P>
	We also feel that people who can take care of themselves have 
the responsibility to do just that. It is the role of the government to 
provide people opportunities and skills training in order to 
maximize their potential.
<P>
	We have often been accused of being a slash and burn party 
because of our fiscal conservatism. I would argue that if we profess 
to have a social conscience, we cannot have a social conscience 
unless we are fiscally conservative. If we are fiscally irresponsible 
we compromise social programs and the very people we wish to 
help. We compromise those who are poorest in our society and the 
social programs which have defined Canada as a caring society.
<P>
	Our program of fiscal conservatism would provide people the 
tools to take care of themselves. It would strengthen our social 
programs. It would provide health care to individuals.
<P>
	Our deficit reduction platform will put more money into the 
hands of Canadian taxpayers. For example, everyone will have an 
increase in their basic personal exemption. It will go from $6,456 
to $7,900. That will provide tax relief to every taxpayer in the 
country.
<P>
	We would also increase the spousal allowance from $5,308 to 
$7,900.
<P>
	We would cut unemployment insurance premiums by 28 per cent 
and eliminate the 5 per cent surtax on high income earners.
<P>
	These measures are important. They would provide money to 
consumers. They would enable taxpayers to better care for 
themselves and their families. That is a significant departure from 
the Liberal view, which is that the government can better take care 
of the people than the people can do themselves.
<P>
	There are other possibilities for solutions which are available to 
us that would stimulate the economy and decrease the tax burden, 
which would create jobs for unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has recently made some 
excellent presentations. It said that the government should tighten 
up the eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance to 
improve labour market flexibility.
<P>
	The government has been increasing payroll taxes since it came 
to power in order to increase government  revenues. We do not 
think that is fair. By increasing payroll taxes the government is 
directly taxing producers and employers. When it increases payroll 
taxes it impedes the ability of employers to hire more people. We 
do not thing that is fair. The government should admit that it is 
increasing the tax burden on producers and employers. It should 
lower the payroll taxes. That would provide an incentive for 
employers to hire more people, invest in their companies and create 
infrastructure development. That would provide employment 
opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	At the end of the day, the single most important concern which 
affects Canadians from coast to coast is job security.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	In closing, I implore the government to look at what the Reform 
Party is putting out in its fresh start platform, look at the solutions 
we have for decreasing the taxes, revamping the economy, getting 
our deficit down to zero and saving our social programs.
<P>
	Together we can work to make Canada a stronger place. I again 
implore the government to do just that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the first time I have been in the House since your 
appointment. I would like to congratulate you. I wonder if I may 
say that there but for the grace of God go I.
<P>
	I feel I must speak in today's debate on this legislation to 
harmonize and streamline the GST because this government does 
not support the people of Canada. This government does not keep 
its promises to the people of Canada. This government is cheating 
the people of Canada by making promises not once but over and 
over again and then breaking those promises.
<P>
	Election promises made by the Prime Minister, the Deputy 
Prime Minister, the finance minister and scores of Liberal cabinet 
and caucus members to eliminate, not harmonize, the GST have not 
been kept. For example, the Deputy Prime Minister on October 19, 
1993, as we are all familiar with, said: ``Food is not subject to GST 
because it is a necessity. So are books. They are needed for young 
minds to grow''.
<P>
	The past Liberal whip, who is now the Minister of International 
Co-operation, said: ``GST on reading material is bad policy and 
undemocratic. It creates more unemployment''. Both these 
members were speaking against the GST.
<P>
	The defence minister, who was the finance critic in 1990, said: 
``The Liberal Party would scrap the GST''. He pledged in a 
nationally televised debate with finance minister Michael Wilson: 
``The goods and services tax is a regressive tax. It has to be 
scrapped. We will scrap it''. That was in 1990.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7325"> 7325 </A></B>
<P>
	The solicitor general said: ``Not only do the Liberals oppose 
the GST now, but opposition will continue even if the bill is 
passed. We are not interested in tinkering with the GST. We don't 
want it at all''.
<P>
	The industry minister said: ``Our credibility will be in shreds if 
we do not come up with a thoughtful alternative to tax reform that 
stands up to scrutiny''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said: ``The Liberals will scrap the goods and 
services tax if they win the next general election. I am opposed to 
the GST. I have always been opposed to it. I will be opposed to it 
always''. This was in 1990.
<P>
	Those were the statements made and we know where we are 
now. None of them has been kept.
<P>
	Atlantic premiers in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland were bribed into signing the bill with $1 billion of 
borrowed taxpayer money. The finance minister is crowing like a 
rooster saying ``aren't I great, look what I have accomplished''. Is 
this not a bribe? Is this not a one time payment?
<P>
	Sales tax will go up for the money lost when the $1 billion runs 
out because the $1 billion is paid over three or four years. Atlantic 
Canadians are going to have to make up for it when the money is 
gone. The GST may remain the same at 7 per cent but there is 
nothing to prevent the province from hiking up the sales tax to 
make up for the lost revenues. I believe at that time it is going to be 
need that determines the amount.
<P>
	Instead of trying to help the hard hit Atlantic provinces whose 
demise of the cod fishery and low economy have made it difficult 
enough for them, the premiers of these three provinces have fallen 
into bed with the senior Liberal government and are hitting their 
people with a 15 per cent GST. We all know that HST is just 
another name for GST. The new tax is even worse because now 
Atlantic Canadians will be paying tax on everything, books, auto 
repairs, funeral services, haircuts, electricity, gasoline and home 
heating fuel-literally everything. The finance minister has tried to 
claim victory and a pat on the back for this?
<P>
	Let us take a look at literacy. On October 23, 1996 the finance 
minister gave a news conference in which he stated that the 
Commons would implement a 100 per cent GST rebate on all books 
purchased by public libraries, schools, universities, et cetera. In the 
first case, those students, those people, members of our society 
who are furthering their education, not always school children, are 
going to need textbooks that they cannot get at libraries. They are 
going to have to buy textbooks they cannot get at libraries. This is 
literacy and this is a definite detriment to them.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I noticed that on the notice of ways and means sheet under the 
explanation of this new program it says under  ``the printed book'' 
what is not included. In (f) it says ``a book designed primarily for 
writing on''. I imagine a scribbler might fall into that category and 
students need scribblers in day schools. (g) says ``a colouring book 
or a book designed primarily for drawing on''. What about art 
books?
<P>
	On page 4 of the explanatory notes it says ``also excluded are 
books designed primarily for writing on or drawing on or affixing 
thereon items, etc., clippings and pictures''. Students use these all 
the time in their everyday work.
<P>
	In reality we are not helping these particular students as far as 
literacy is concerned. We are hitting them in the school room as 
well.
<P>
	What about books in the home, what about home libraries? How 
many people like to keep books in their homes that they can read? 
They do not want to always have to go to the library and return 
them every week. There are a lot of good books people like to keep 
just because they enjoy reading. There again these people are going 
to be penalized.
<P>
	I have often said in this House that literacy begins at birth. That 
means we all should have in our home a good stock of books that 
are going to help us increase our education and help our children to 
develop a love of reading.
<P>
	Workshops, scribblers, mothers going back to school to continue 
in their education, what if they need a science text that they have to 
buy for $100? There is $15 extra on that. What if they are going 
into medicine or anybody going to continue their schooling? This 
HST or GST is not helping literacy. It is making it difficult for 
Canadians to improve their literacy.
<P>
	What about businesses and the retail stores? The change over is 
going to cost a fortune for them to adjust to. We are hitting small 
business right where it hurts. This is another major tax grab.
<P>
	The three major retailers in Atlantic Canada have stated that 
their net annual retail deficit will total $27 million once the 
harmonization is implemented. The Retail Council of Canada has 
said that by forcing stores to bury the new tax in prices the 
harmonized tax regime will cost retailers at least $100 million a 
year more.
<P>
	Most Canadians, I believe, do not want to see the tax buried. A 
lot of people would prefer to know what they are going to pay in tax 
before they go to the cash register. Tax included pricing that hits 
retailers hits them in these four areas: duplication of information 
systems and rewriting of software, repricing of prepriced goods, 
books, greeting cards and so on, duplication of advertising costs, 
flyers, catalogues, and warehousing and distribution costs. It is 
really going to hit our small business retail stores.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7326"> 7326 </A></B>
<P>
	What about consumers? For Atlantic Canadians it is going to 
hit them with a double whammy. They will pay more for funeral 
services, children's clothing, books, auto repairs, all the things I 
previously said. The Investment Property Owners Association is 
concerned about renters. There are going to be higher operating 
costs for the landlords, so who is going to feel those higher 
operating costs? The renter. It will be passed on to them. Because 
renters usually have less income than homeowners the tax increase 
is really going to hurt those who can least afford it.
<P>
	How does the rest of Canada feel? How do Canadian consumers 
feel all across this country? They are footing the bill. I do not 
imagine they are too happy about it.
<P>
	On integrity this government, I feel, ranks very low on integrity. 
Recently I had an opportunity to write an article in my home 
newspaper. I wrote about integrity. I wrote about the end justifying 
the means. As a matter of fact, I spoke first about our provincial 
government. The reason is I had to explain to some of my 
constituents that we have to look more closely at integrity. ``Our 
provincial government seems to believe the end justifies the 
means'', I wrote, ``but I say if the means involves deliberate lies 
about the budget to mislead the people during an election 
campaign, if it involves misappropriation of money from charity 
bingos, if it involves mismanagement of a huge crown corporation 
like B.C. Hydro, and ministers not reporting their departments' 
true financial condition just prior to an election, then the end 
cannot justify the means. British Columbians should be shouting 
for recall. If we do nothing about the lack of integrity in our 
provincial government, then we deserve the results''.
<P>
	What about integrity on the federal level? ``On the federal level 
the Prime Minister's office recently sent a memo to Liberal Party 
officers across this country instructing party officials and media 
representatives to lie about the Reform Party. Here is another case 
of the end justifying the means but the media seem to have decided 
they will just ignore this one. Given this evidence of astonishing 
dishonesty in the Prime Minister's office, what if the federal 
Liberals' balanced budget projections are no more honest than the 
provincial NDP's?''
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Maybe the 
member inadvertently used an unparliamentary word when 
referring to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's office. I 
would ask that she withdraw that word.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Chair was listening to 
the words that the hon. member used. She may have used an 
unparliamentary word in relation to the Prime Minister's office. Of 
course, it is unparliamentary when used in relation to members of 
Parliament. She was prudent not to have done that. Accordingly I 
am not sure there is a point of order here,  although certainly the 
words are getting borderline. The hon. member's point is made. 
The hon. member may resume her remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, for the sake of the member 
opposite, I will say mislead instead. The newspapers were very 
clear and they have already stated it.
<P>
	Given this evidence, we do have an enormous burden of federal 
debt, now $600 billion, which the government has decided to stop 
mentioning. The Liberals' deficit reduction plans are based on 
continued strong economic growth but where will that growth 
come from? Retail sales remain down. Bankruptcies are up 23 per 
cent. Consumers are not spending. Financial experts warn of the 
danger of overextended credit cards. We are not looking at a good 
picture in the future.
<P>
	Integrity. The HST is not what Canadians were promised by the 
Liberals in the last election when they went door to door looking 
for votes. We should have them honour their words. I would like to 
point out on integrity that when the heritage minister gave up her 
seat to seek re-election in the byelection she once again mentioned 
in her propaganda material in her campaign that she gave up her 
pension which we know was temporary, again misleading the 
people.
<P>
	I would like to wrap up. Unfortunately, we did not get the 
postponement and I am sorry that that did not occur. I sincerely 
hope and implore this government to rethink the GST and HST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate 
that we have to rise in the House today to address this bill. It is a 
bill that in reality should not have come before this House. It is an 
issue we should not have had to talk to. The Prime Minister, the 
Deputy Prime Minister, the finance minister and scores of cabinet 
and caucus members all made election pledges to eliminate, not to 
harmonize the GST. The issue that should be before us is the 
elimination and not the harmonization of this tax.
<P>
	As members know full well, the heritage minister was forced to 
resign and seek re-election at a cost of over $500,000 to Canadian 
taxpayers because she was unable to fulfil a commitment that was 
made during the election campaign. The finance minister publicly 
begged for forgiveness. ``We have made a mistake'', he said for his 
complicity in misleading Canadians on this Liberal GST policy.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston was banished from the 
Liberal caucus by the Prime Minister for insisting that the 
government keep its word on the GST. The member for 
Broadview-Greenwood went into a self-imposed exile in a rare 
show of solidarity with the member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	What is the issue here? The issue is a matter of keeping one's 
word. Let us think of it in personal terms.  If any member in this 
House or any person in my circle of acquaintances made a specific 
commitment to me that they intended to do something and then 
reneged on that deal, somehow tried to back away from it by saying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7327"> 7327 </A></B>
<P>
that they did not really mean what they said, my toleration for that 
individual would be surely tested.
<P>
	It goes without saying that individuals who continually make 
promises they cannot keep really are not held in high regard by the 
people who have to deal with them. If they are in business, in short 
order they will be out of business. If it is a matter of friendship, 
friends are gone and friends are lost.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The question which comes to mind is, if this is the way we 
respond on a personal level to people who do not keep their word, 
what should be the reaction of Canadians to a government, 
members of which made a commitment in the heat of an election 
campaign and then are unable to maintain the commitment? The 
patience of the voters with the government would be sorely tested 
because of its inability to keep its word.
<P>
	We have in this harmonization a situation where the Atlantic 
provinces were bribed into signing the deal with a billion dollars of 
borrowed taxpayers' money. All Canadians are aware that these 
kinds of expenditures are only possible because of the ability of the 
government to borrow money. It is not because there is a pocketful 
of money which could be doled out to try to get people on side. The 
fact is that the government is short well over $100 billion in its 
term of office and to finance this little escapade it will have to 
borrow even more.
<P>
	There are three provinces, Alberta, Ontario and British 
Columbia that are not even willing to discuss the federal proposal. 
Support for the harmonization proposal is weak in Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and P.E.I. It just goes to show that this is going to be 
piecemeal legislation.
<P>
	It will be restricted to one area of the country where in some 
respects the governments were unable to turn down the federal 
government because they just did not have the fiscal strength to do 
so. On the other hand, it is a part of the country which will suffer 
the most because it entered into this agreement. In essence, if we 
are going to help the governments in the maritime provinces, in 
Newfoundland, we should be looking at trying to determine ways 
to reduce the tax rate to make that area of the country more 
attractive to industry rather than simply showing them how to hide 
taxes which they certainly do not need.
<P>
	Another issue is the impact this bill will have on business. As has 
been stated in the House today, and which I think is worth 
repeating, three major retailers in Atlantic Canada have stated that 
their net annual retail deficit will total $27 million once 
harmonization is implemented. Now $27 million may not be much 
money to the heritage minister because she certainly knows how  to 
throw around the tens of millions of dollars to back up policies 
which have little real effect, but for business it is a big wad of 
money.
<P>
	One private retailer in the Atlantic region was contemplating 
opening two stores in 1997 and now has decided against it. That is 
the danger of this high taxation. That is the danger which is posed 
to the economy in the rest of the country if we allow the 
government to lead us into a harmonization program that will only 
result in higher taxes and which will hide a tax that Canadians are 
so against.
<P>
	A study by the accounting firm of Ernst and Young estimated 
that a midsized national chain with 50 stores in the Atlantic 
provinces would pay up to $3 million in one-time costs and up to 
$1.1 million a year to comply with a regional tax in price sales 
system. That is a lot of money: $1.1 million for 50 stores. It is a 
huge overload on any one store in that chain. It is only reasonable 
to assume, given taxation levels of that magnitude, that the chain 
will be closing stores.

<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce predicts that the harmonized 
sales tax will push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent and will 
force municipalities to raise property taxes. An increase of 5.5 per 
cent in housing costs is an unquestionably bad move. Canadians are 
hard pressed to pay housing costs. Any increase will be felt by the 
people who can least afford it: the low income earners and first 
time home buyers.
<P>
	In essence this tax is making it even more difficult for our 
children to start the process of putting their own roofs over their 
heads. We are making it difficult for them to get out of the rental 
market. There will also be a great impact on the rental market. It is 
anticipated that rental costs will increase due to the imposition of 
this tax.
<P>
	Consumers will pay through the nose. They will pay more for 
funeral services, children's clothing, books, auto repairs, 
electricity, gasoline, home heating fuel and haircuts among other 
things.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the Investment Property Owners Association 
tabled a report in the Nova Scotia legislature. It says that renters 
can expect to shoulder some of the higher operating costs that will 
hit landlords with the harmonized GST. Because renters have less 
income than homeowners, the tax increases due to the blended GST 
will hurt those who can least afford it.
<P>
	The federal government's proposal will hurt low income 
Canadians the most. Therefore I move:

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Chair has received 
the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Delta. Before 
putting it to the House, it would be appropriate to consult. I will 
consider the matter and get back to the House in a few minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to oppose the government's 
use of closure in its attempt to ram through the House the hated 
GST harmonization scheme. This debate-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am not 
questioning your ruling but I would like some clarification on it. 
The motion was very straightforward. In our opinion it was in 
order. Could the Speaker enlighten me as to why he wanted to 
consult on this motion so I will have that for future reference?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I can give the hon. 
member the benefit of the doubt. I assume he thought the motion 
was in order since he seconded it. I am sure that is his view. The 
Chair simply wants an opportunity to review the motion in relation 
to the authorities on the subject to ensure that it is in order. If that 
assurance is one that I can give the House I will then put the motion 
to the House. I hope to have it very shortly and I will be back to the 
House as soon as I possibly can in respect of the motion. Resuming 
debate.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, your chance to review the Reform Party 
amendment is most appropriate and in order, as is the concept of 
having an open and true debate in the House of Commons on the 
GST. Canadians are sick and tired of the attempt by the Liberal 
government to shut down open and honest debate. It is very 
unfortunate.
<P>
	The debate gives me an opportunity to remind the constituents of 
the Liberals sitting in the House of what was said on the campaign 
trail about the GST.
<P>
	We are going to play a little game called recall for a few 
moments. First let us recall the words of the Prime Minister when 
he was a candidate for the Liberal Party. He said: ``We hate it and 
we will kill it''. He did not say: ``We hate it and we will harmonize 
it''.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance was campaigning as a Liberal 
candidate he said: ``I would abolish the GST''. Pay careful 
attention to the word ``abolish''. According to my reference 
material it means get rid of, to lose sight of, to bury. That does not 
sound anything like ``I would harmonize the GST''.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence said when he was a candidate: 
``The GST is a regressive tax. It has to be scrapped and by golly, if 
we are elected to government we will do just that. We will scrap 
it''.
<P>
	All across the country as the campaign went on Liberal candidate 
after Liberal candidate knocked on doors, spoke at public meetings 
and said in unison: ``We will kill the GST. The Liberal Party will 
kill the GST if we become government after the next election''. 
Everyone heard it. We heard it on talk radio shows, we heard it on 
platforms at all-candidates meetings, we heard it at the doorstep, 
we heard it from coast to coast.
<P>
	It is sort of fun to go back in time and reminisce about what 
happened in the 1993 election but there is a very serious part to all 
of this. The bottom line is that the Liberal candidates prior to the 
1993 election deliberately misled the Canadian people about what 
they were going to do with the GST. They deliberately misled the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	In venue after venue in the 1993 election, Liberal candidates 
across the country told the Canadian voters that they would scrap, 
that they would kill, that would abolish the GST. Those are the 
facts we are presented with today. Taxpayers are going to 
remember because we are going to keep reminding them that they 
are going to pay for this Liberal promise. This is yet another 
Liberal broken promise to the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	The taxpayers are going to pay for this harmonization scam of 
the Liberals. It will hurt every Canadian taxpayer because to get the 
Atlantic premiers, the ones who agreed to the harmonization, the 
Liberals will have to give the Atlantic provinces a cash payment to 
induce them to come on board this scheme. This payment to the 
Atlantic provinces, the ones that have joined on, that have been 
duped into it by the Liberal Party, is going to amount to about $1 
billion a year just to satisfy the whims of this government to make 
it look not quite so bad.
<P>
	They can once again try to fool the Canadian people, but they 
will not get away with it. Canadians in certain regions of the 
country and reasonable people do not think they should be asked to 
subsidize a tax cut for the maritime provinces that came in on this 
plan because of the Liberal harmonization scam. The Liberals are 
using $1 billion of taxpayers' money to sell the GST to Atlantic 
Canada so that they can keep an election promise. That simply is 
not going to sell to the rest of the country.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	This Liberal bribe of the Liberal Atlantic premiers is truly 
despicable. Canadians will not be hoodwinked by Liberal trickery 
and sleight of hand. Atlantic Canadians will also suffer because 
while they may pay a lower tax rate in this harmonized taxation 
scam, they will pay taxes on a greater range of goods and services.
<P>
	I was told as a youngster that there is no such thing as a free 
lunch. No one gets something for nothing, particularly when a 
Liberal government is running the country. If people think they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7329"> 7329 </A></B>
<P>
actually getting  something from the government, they should keep 
their hands on their wallets in their back pockets. The government 
will not give what it has first not taken away.
<P>
	It has become abundantly clear that the government was very 
opportunistic in discussing the GST and suggesting to Canadians 
that when it came into power somehow the GST would magically 
and mysteriously disappear. Just to remind hon. members across 
the way exactly what their record is on this, let me refer to some 
quotes that came from government members over the last several 
years with respect to the GST. I want to remind them how far they 
have gone astray from their original promise.
<P>
	Let us go back to the government members when they were in 
opposition in the wake of the GST coming into this place under the 
Conservative government. I begin by quoting some members who 
now hold prominent positions in the cabinet of the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	First let me quote the current House leader back in the days 
following the GST coming into place under the Conservative 
government. He said: ``Not only do the Liberals oppose the GST 
now, that opposition will continue even when the bill is passed. We 
are not interested in tinkering with the GST. We do not want it at 
all''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the current finance minister said: ``I would abolish 
the GST''. The Prime Minister said: ``I want the tax dead''. One of 
the quotes that came from the Toronto <I>Star</I> back then was: ``The 
Liberals will scrap the goods and services tax if they win the next 
general election. The leader of the party said that he was opposed to 
the GST. `I have always been opposed to it and I will be opposed to 
it always'''.
<P>
	We saw the climax of the quotes that came from all the various 
members in October 1993 of the eve of the election when the 
current Deputy Prime Minister on national television-that image 
will be frozen in my mind forever, and I am sure in the memories of 
many in this House as well-when she said: ``If the GST is not 
abolished under the Liberal government I will resign''.
<P>
	The hypocrisy of the Liberal government is astounding. 
Members say one thing and they do another thing. If it is not the 
GST, it is the CF-18 contracts. I could go on for hours and hours 
about the flip-flops of this Liberal government in the past three 
years. There are so many flip-flops it is hard to keep track of them 
all.
<P>
	What about the flip-flop on limiting debate and using closure? In 
opposition, the Liberals railed against closure. Democracy, it 
appears now, is irrelevant to our Liberal colleagues across the way. 
All they care about is lining their pockets and rewarding their 
friends like Bombardier. When it comes to politics they ram things 
through the House, forget about the people of Canada, forget about 
democratic principles and forget about  returning integrity to this 
place. It is a shame that they do this.
<P>
	They all care about pretending to keep promises. They do not 
care that their public relations campaign comes at the expense of 
taxpayers outside Atlantic Canada and at the expense of democracy 
and free speech in this place where free speech is held so dearly.
<P>
	Canadians should know that this bill should be opposed. 
Limiting debate should be opposed. This Liberal government 
should be opposed and will be opposed by the people in the next 
general federal election.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I should inform the House 
that the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Delta is, in 
the view of the Chair, in order.
<P>
	The House will now resume debate on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With all 
due respect, we would assert that it is not a reasoned amendment 
opposing the principle of the bill, but rather that it raises 
extraneous issues that go to the motive behind the bill and that it is 
not a properly receivable amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, just to assist the 
Chair, that sounded to me like a challenge of the Chair's ruling. The 
Chair has ruled that the amendment is in order. It would seem to me 
that the appropriate time for the member for St. Paul's to have 
raised that objection would have been at the time the amendment 
was moved by the hon. member for Delta. However, that was not 
done and you have ruled. We would appreciate resuming debate on 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member for 
Calgary West is correct. If the parliamentary secretary had an 
objection to the amendment he should have raised it at the time the 
amendment was moved. No objection was raised at that time. The 
Chair has made a ruling. The amendment, in the view of the Chair, 
is in order. Therefore, we will be resuming debate on the 
amendment at this point in time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I might apologize to you, there 
was never any intent whatsoever to question your ruling. I was on 
my feet as you stood to make your ruling. I was not recognized. I 
stayed on my feet and I stated my position for the record.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I want to assure the 
parliamentary secretary that the Chair did not think there was any 
challenge to the ruling. I thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for 
that explanation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to state that the official opposition will support the 
amendment presented by the Reform Party.  It does not happen 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7330"> 7330 </A></B>
<P>
often, but since this amendment is in line with our thinking, we 
shall be very pleased to support it.
<P>
	The amendment asks the House to decline to give second reading 
to the bill, since the principle of the bill does not seek to abolish the 
GST, and the Reform Party members are right. We have been 
discussing this bill for a number of days, and we pointed out that 
when the Liberals were in the opposition and also when they were 
on the campaign trail, their platform included a promise to abolish 
what they referred to as the bloody GST.
<P>
	Three years after the Liberals came to power, we hear that the 
Minister of Finance has just signed an agreement with the maritime 
provinces to harmonize the GST and provincial sales taxes and 
that, in a generous gesture, the Minister of Finance will take nearly 
$1 billion out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers outside the 
maritimes to compensate the maritime provinces for caving in and 
accepting this political agreement with the Minister of Finance, 
just to give Canadians the impression the federal government was 
doing something about the GST and that there have been 
improvements.
<P>
	They would have us forget that the Liberals led a heroic struggle 
against the previous government to abolish the goods and services 
tax. We on this side of the House are getting used to a situation 
where the government rises every day to renege on its promises. 
Other promises were broken by the government as well.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	For instance, the government spent part of its election campaign 
shouting: ``Jobs, jobs, jobs. We are going to create jobs''. That 
promise was broken. It will take another 900,000 jobs to get back to 
the labour market conditions that existed before the last recession. 
When they said jobs, jobs, jobs, it was just window dressing. They 
never made any formal commitment to the public to create the jobs 
that are so badly needed by Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	The unemployment rate is at 10 per cent, and they shout: ``Jobs, 
jobs, jobs''. Some campaign promise. A promise that was trashed. 
A promise to restore a healthy labour market was not kept.
<P>
	During the election campaign, they also said that poverty must 
be eliminated, and so forth. Since they came to power, the situation 
has gotten worse. The latest statistics on child poverty are 
outrageous. Child poverty is worse in Canada than in any other 
industrialized country. One more commitment that bit the dust.
<P>
	The same goes for the GST. In this case, no problem, they are 
going to harmonize it. They are going to hide it in the price, in the 
maritimes. It will cost taxpayers outside the maritimes $1 billion. 
The government acts as if it had always promised an agreement 
with the maritimes, plus political compensation, compensation it  
will take out of our pockets to put a good face on the way this 
government is handling the GST.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister put on a show of her own not long 
ago. She resigned on a matter of principle, because she had 
promised the public that if her government did not abolish the GST, 
she would resign. So she resigned. Her show cost taxpayers a half a 
million dollars, so she could be reelected in the same riding.
<P>
	When you have principles, when you have certain beliefs, and 
you stake these during an election campaign and even before, when 
you are in the opposition, and when you come to power, you do the 
exact opposite, you resign outright. You do not run again in the 
same riding, for the same party and come back to the same position 
three months later. That is cynical and arrogant in the extreme.
<P>
	However, the Deputy Prime Minister has broken more promises. 
Radio Canada International is about to disappear. The decision has 
been made. During the election campaign and quite recently, she 
promised to maintain Radio Canada International. She even put her 
seat on the line with her commitment to the survival of Radio 
Canada International. Today, it is as though it never happened. The 
government lacks credibility, and the Deputy Prime Minister lacks 
twice as much credibility. It is time this government cynicism 
stopped.
<P>
	That is why we support this motion for the bill not to proceed to 
second reading, because it does not contain any clause on 
abolishing the GST. That is what the government had promised. 
When we say promises, we do not mean idle promises, but 
promises that have been written down, recorded on video, like the 
events involving National Defence.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the present Prime Minister 
was saying: ``We will scrap the GST''. The Prime Minister also 
said on May 2: ``We hate this tax and we are going to get rid of it''. 
What good is the Prime Minister's word? The Deputy Prime 
Minister's? What is this government's word worth?
<P>
	Perhaps it is high time for the public to wake up, for them to 
realize that this government is thumbing its nose at them, that this 
government has no respect for the people, that this government is 
elected only to serve rich Canadian taxpayers, the very rich who 
transfer family trusts worth $2 billion out of the country tax-free. It 
is time for people to realize that, with this agreement on the GST, 
they are thumbing their noses at all Canadians.
<P>
	It is not, moreover, only in Quebec that people are voicing 
opposition to this agreement. Everywhere else, in Ontario, the 
Prairie provinces, British Columbia, people feel that this 
agreement is absurd. Moreover, the Minister of Finance has been 
asked many times to produce the formula used to calculate his 
billion dollar figure, with no response. The minister refuses to 
make this formula public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7331"> 7331 </A></B>
<P>
	Questions arise about the government's honesty and its ability 
to really carry out the commitments it made during the election 
campaign. I am not talking about shows where they over inflate 
promises kept, as the Prime Minister did at the last Liberal Party 
congress, but actual accomplishments. The GST was one of this 
government's main promises, and look what they did with it.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Jobs were one of the government's main promises, and the 
government has fallen some one million jobs short.
<P>
	The government can boast about the interest rates being very 
low. Do you know why the interest rates dropped, basically? The 
first reason is the American economy; the second, the Canadian 
economy and the third, the fact that people are not working. When 
they no longer have a job, they no longer spend and there is no 
more inflationary pressure. At this point, there is no need for the 
Bank of Canada to strike at non existent inflation by increasing the 
interest rate. These are the basic reasons for the lower interest rates, 
and not good management by this government. This government 
manages nothing.
<P>
	This government has managed nothing since taking office. It 
allowed itself to be swept along by the wave. Things went well, 
they drifted along and forgot the commitments they had made with 
respect to jobs and the fight against poverty. The Prime Minister 
and Minister of Finance's gang preferred to make a show of it and 
look after the interests of rich taxpayers. This is the reality of this 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder to myself what Canadians 
might think watching this debate on television. It is quite a 
spectacle sometimes, especially when members of the opposition 
stray from discussing and debating the issues before us and launch 
into a litany of complaints, frustrations and concerns which have 
nothing to do with those matters.
<P>
	I will speak to the issue before us and point out what viewers, 
Canadians observing this spectacle from the opposition, will easily 
conclude. It is incredible. From members of the Reform Party we 
have incredible paternalism. Who would expect otherwise? Let me 
put in a nutshell what they have been saying for hours and hours: 
``We know better than Atlantic Canada. Don't do this to yourselves 
because we know better''.
<P>
	One colleague suggested today that perhaps the best response 
would be for the Reform Party to run candidates in Atlantic Canada 
and teach the people there what they do not seem to understand 
themselves. The people of Atlantic Canada have elected 
governments that know what they are doing and have decided it is 
in the interest-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must have struck a chord. The 
people of Atlantic Canada clearly know what is in their interest and 
are prepared to rise or fall as governments on that. Unfortunately 
the Reform Party does not represent that area of the country but 
thinks it knows best, knows better and knows what would help 
them. Reformers are prepared to stand here for two days to tell 
Atlantic Canada just what is good for it. That is some indication of 
the incredible arrogance and paternalism of the Reform Party with 
respect to other regions of the country.
<P>
	With regard to the Bloc let us point out something else that is 
quite incredible about the spectacle of its interventions in the 
debate. Let us understand this clearly. Bloc members want to deny 
harmonization to Atlantic Canada, but they forgot to say in a single 
speech over two days that the Quebec sales tax is harmonized with 
the GST. They tell Atlantic Canada not to do it, that it is 
outrageous. By the way, they go on to say: ``You are buying them 
off. You are doing this adjustment assistance''.
<P>
	I did not hear in one speech any rejection of the adjustment 
assistance for farmers when agricultural subsidies were removed. I 
did not hear a word from Reformers on the Crow rate subsidy of $1 
billion plus. No one stood and said at that time: ``Don't give this to 
us''. They said: ``Don't help us with an adjustment to this structural 
change. No, don't do that''. They were silent, struck dumb.
<P>
	When it comes to assistance to Atlantic Canada there is not a 
word from the Reform Party about the Crow rate subsidy of $1 
billion plus. However it is no to Atlantic Canada, no adjustment 
assistance for them. From the Bloc there is no adjustment 
assistance for structural change but on agricultural subsidies the 
cheque can be written. It is really quite incredible and I do not think 
anybody will be fooled.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite stands and says: ``We are still waiting 
for the formula''. Nonsense. The formula has been well known. It 
is compensation for a loss of revenue greater than 5 per cent of the 
sales tax base. He knows it. Hon. members know it. Anybody who 
has been unfortunate enough to watch the debate for two days 
knows it because we have said it several times. Quebec does not 
qualify. Nor would other provinces qualify that have not yet joined 
but will in due course.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	The Atlantic provinces qualify. They are losing that revenue. 
What did Quebec do when it harmonized? It wanted to keep it 
secret but did not want the Atlantic provinces to have it. It ran two 
systems side by side and had an increase in revenue. There was not 
a decrease when Quebec harmonized. It did not qualify then and it 
does not qualify now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7332"> 7332 </A></B>
<P>
	I go back to the history of the last couple of years. I participated 
in the finance committee when it travelled across the country 
asking Canadians about the GST. Members opposite can invent 
what took place but I was there and so were some of their 
colleagues.
<P>
	Canadians told us there was an incredible anomaly with two 
sales taxes in most provinces, some 10 sales taxes in total. 
Whatever else we do, they told us to harmonize. The following 
sounds like a quote from the Reform Party, but there is only one 
taxpayer so there should be only one tax administration, one tax. 
Canadians asked for simplification over and over again.
<P>
	To listen to the parties opposite one would think they were not 
sitting at the table with us. They asked for tax inclusive pricing. 
They wanted the option of knowing what the tax was. That is why it 
is provided on the receipt as it is in most of the world. Canadians 
told us they wanted no more sticker shock, no more counter shock.
<P>
	In closing, I will make another point about the incredible 
spectacle we heard from the Bloc. I wonder if the reason its 
members have not reminded Canadian people about harmonization 
in Quebec is that it is a competitive advantage vis-à-vis Atlantic 
Canada. They know that. They do not want Atlantic businesses and 
consumers to have the advantage available to Quebec businesses 
and consumers.
<P>
	This change will result in input tax credits in Atlantic Canada, 
tremendous savings passed on to consumers, cheaper prices and no 
net increase in tax revenue. It is good for Atlantic Canada. That is 
why their governments want to do it, no matter what the Reform or 
the Bloc may have to say about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to follow the previous rant from the member for St. Paul's. It 
is the first we heard from the Liberals today on the issue and gives 
me an opportunity to address some of his comments.
<P>
	It was interesting when he said this move was in the interest of 
Atlantic Canada. Yet few members on the government side from 
Atlantic Canada are willing to speak to the issue. Very few 
members are willing to speak to the issue of GST harmonization. 
Almost none from Atlantic Canada. One spoke earlier today, the 
hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls. We can check the blues, 
but I do not think he mentioned GST anywhere in his speech. He 
obviously was not too thrilled about the initiative.
<P>
	The government makes the point that it must be governing for 
the benefit of the people of Atlantic Canada because the Liberal 
government in Atlantic Canada likes this initiative. The role of the 
Parliament of Canada, I would remind the parliamentary secretary, 
is to govern for the benefit of the people of Canada; not just the 
people of Atlantic Canada but all Canadians.
<P>
	Interestingly enough we did not hear mention of the people of 
Atlantic Canada. Where are the petitions to Parliament demanding 
this harmonized GST? Where are the letters of endorsement from 
the business community and from consumers groups? We are not 
getting them in our offices. We are getting precisely the opposite.
<P>
	The federal government should have a broader view of what is in 
the interest of the people of any region of the country than just what 
the party of the government thinks in a particular region.
<P>
	We get the same line every time the Reform, the Bloc or any 
other party criticizes a Liberal government initiative directed at a 
specific region. Its members always say they are the guardians of 
the region. They ask where we were when they were giving 
something to our region or to somebody else. The great tragedy of 
the country is governments that do not govern for the entire 
country. Historically governments, particularly Liberal 
governments, have used policies to divide, conquer and pit one 
against another so they can act as the defender of one region at any 
point in history, depending on where they need to pick up some 
votes.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	It is a terrible way of approaching government, but that is the 
history. I am addressing second reading of Bill C-70 on GST 
harmonization which, as has been pointed out by many speakers, is 
being implemented with time allocation.
<P>
	It is important to point out that this bill was read for the first time 
in this House only on December 2, just over a week ago. This is 
only the third day we have had any debate at all on this piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burlington, a Liberal member, had a 
tremendous argument. This one we need to get bronzed over here. 
It was that they would not need to move time allocation if the 
opposition would just support their bills. That would make it much 
easier.
<P>
	There is a pattern here. We saw this pattern not just in this fall 
sitting but in previous sittings in the last three years. That has been 
that we have had a very slow legislative agenda for several months.
<P>
	Just as the House is about to rise for a break, important 
legislation appears which must be passed immediately. In this 
sitting, the fall sitting, we passed only nine pieces of legislation, 
including some supply bills and housekeeping measures that were 
of fairly minor significance.
<P>
	Last week three pieces of legislation were introduced which 
most analysts of Parliament would argue are the three most 
important bills introduced in the fall sitting, the harmonization of 
the GST, amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board, and the 
tobacco legislation. These are three of the most important bills.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7333"> 7333 </A></B>
<P>
	Now they must all be passed according to some rushed 
schedule. I should add, just a couple of weeks before that, changes 
to the rules for the next election campaign. That is probably the 
fourth most important. It came in only three weeks before the end 
of the session.
<P>
	Why does the government do it this way? I have tried to figure 
that out. Why are we rushing, for instance, an important debate on a 
GST package in order to have a prebudget debate, which the 
government will have no intention of listening to whatsoever? It is 
not on a substantive piece of legislation. Why are we doing this?
<P>
	Some of it may be disorganization. Some of it may be unclear 
priorities. I fear the longer I am here the reason it does some of this 
is it really ultimately wants to rush committee stage of these bills.
<P>
	Committee stage is where the public and affected interests get to 
express their views on the bill to indicate where amendments 
should be made and where parliamentarians and other expert 
witnesses are able to go over the clause by clause of a bill to 
suggest technical amendments.
<P>
	That is the stage the government wants to rush. It has been 
increasingly rushing it, even on important legislation. The 
consequences of that have been very obvious in this Parliament to 
observers. Often we are passing legislation that is not well thought 
out, that is poorly drafted technically and that ends up being 
amended or delayed in the Senate.
<P>
	I suspect we will see that happen again, if not on this bill at least 
on one of these three bills we are now rushing.
<P>
	We have today the Liberal Party bringing in a bill to support and 
enhance the position of the GST across the country. I will not dwell 
too much on that. It is tremendously humourous to see the Liberal 
Party now being the one enacting the new version of the GST.
<P>
	Perhaps even funnier than that was the appearance of the leader 
of the Progressive Conservative Party to vote against the GST. Of 
course, just his mere appearance in the House of Commons is 
funny enough, seeing how infrequently it seems to occur.
<P>
	Let us go back to the original GST. The original GST was 
discussed in a white paper presented by the previous government in 
1987 and implemented in the 1990-91 period. It is important for me 
to acknowledge, as I want to address a serious issue here, that many 
conservative people in the country, many business people, very 
conservatively oriented people, were very supportive of the thrust 
of the GST, at least initially. Some still are.
<P>
	Why was this? It is important to understand why some supported 
it and why they do not today and why it is an error to support this 
tax.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	They supported it because of the deficiencies of the existing 
manufacturer's sales tax. They supported it because it was a value 
added tax implemented in a multi-level way that ideally would not 
distort prices. On top of that it was a consumption based tax which 
therefore would not have strong incentives against investment.
<P>
	However, these were very short term reasons for anybody to 
support this tax. They were very short term reasons because the real 
issue this country has been facing for the last 10 years and will face 
for the next few at least is the deficit and whether we will end the 
enormous deficits of this federal government by increasing taxes or 
whether we will end them by cutting spending; in other words, 
whether we will ultimately balance the budget in this country by 
having very big government or by having much smaller 
government. Of course, big government got us into this economic 
situation in the first place and we favour a solution that will bring 
us back to smaller government.
<P>
	If we take a big picture look at the GST, the big problem with it 
is not the specifics of its construction. It is in the end a powerful 
revenue generator, one that works best if hidden. It makes it easy to 
raise rates, easy to broaden the base, and it brings the federal 
government into an area that is traditionally provincial authority. It 
leads to tax collusion rather than the phrase harmonization or rather 
than competition between governments.
<P>
	That is what we see happening with this GST harmonization 
today. We see a deal that buys off the Liberal Party in the Atlantic 
provinces, that uses the term harmonization for essentially 
arranging a collusion scheme between governments to make it 
easier for them in the future to raise taxes. They can do it with a 
majority vote. But it makes it virtually impossible for them to ever 
lower the rates of taxation. It takes another step toward hiding and 
burying taxes in prices and it broadens the base of existing 
provincial sales taxes on Atlantic consumers.
<P>
	The real agenda of the Liberal Party is to make sure the fiscal 
actions it takes, both on the spending and taxation sides, ultimately 
secure big government and high taxes in this country. I believe that 
in the end this is what has caused the slow economic growth in the 
past generation. This will ensure the country continues to slip.
<P>
	We need another way. This harmonization of the GST, this tax 
collusion between provincial and federal Liberal governments, is 
not the way to reverse the economic decline of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to add 
to the debate today because of the implications for Canadians, the 
people from coast to coast we represent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7334"> 7334 </A></B>
<P>
	I reject the statement of the member opposite who said that we 
have not heard what the people of Atlantic Canada have said. We 
have indeed. We have heard of those business that are shutting 
down and laying off staff because they cannot compete under the 
rules being imposed on them by this new legislation.
<P>
	I have something to say about the GST in a broad sense. We 
greatly underestimate the impact it has on our economy. There is a 
simple rule that if you want people to do something you make it 
easy for them. If you want people to stop doing something, then 
you make it more difficult. The taxation of cigarettes is an 
example. When taxes were reduced, consumption went up. When 
taxes were increased, consumption and the purchase of cigarettes 
went down. That is true in every sector.
<P>
	I will use the example of my father. He is a senior citizen now, 
well on in years. He is one of those pioneers who helped to build 
this country out in the west. My dad purchased a new car every four 
to six years. That became a regular pattern for him. But in 1990 
when they brought in the GST and he was ready for a new car he 
did not buy a new one. So his old car turned four years old and then 
five and then six.
<P>
	One day I asked him if was going to buy a new car because he 
usually did. He said: ``No. Between the provincial sales tax and the 
new federal sales tax, the GST, I am not going to buy a car because 
that is one tax which I can avoid paying just by making the choice 
not to purchase a new vehicle''. As a result, my dad to this day is 
still driving his 1985 Oldsmobile. He says it will be his last car 
because he will not pay tax on a new one. We could multiply that 
situation over and over again. The people in the car business in 
Ontario have lost many important sales. If we multiplied it by the 
number of people who have responded in that manner, we would 
probably be surprised by the huge economic impact the GST has 
had right across the country.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I have the duty to represent my 
constituents and also to represent what is good for the country. It 
seems that in this Parliament the opposition parties are better able 
to do that than the governing party. I bring to the attention of the 
House evidence to support that statement.
<P>
	I believe that the opposition has a very important role to play, so 
I went back to when the Liberals were in opposition. I read 
<I>Hansard</I> from that time. I went to the PubNet system and said let us 
see what the Liberals said about the GST when they were in 
opposition. I have quotes from several Liberal members who were 
in opposition who I think correctly represented Canadian thinking.
<P>
	First I would like to cite quotes from the hon. member for 
Burin-St. George's. He is an eloquent speaker. He frequently 
speaks on these subjects. This is what he said  on March 12, 1993. 
He was deriding the government's jamming through the GST at 
that time. This was on the debate when it was simplifying it. The 
Conservative government brought in 350 pages of simplification 
for the GST procedures and that is what the House was debating on 
this occasion. He said: ``The government used every rule in the 
book and every perversion of most of the rules to get the GST-and 
that is what I am talking about in case my friends on the other side 
have forgotten so soon, the goods and services tax. It is called many 
other names by those 85 per cent of Canadians who vehemently and 
strongly oppose that tax measure''. I believe that member when on 
this side of the House was correct. As far as we know, about 85 per 
cent of Canadians were opposed to the tax.
<P>
	It is a violation of our trust if we bring into this place legislation 
and we jam it through, as this government is now doing, against the 
will of the people. How can we expect to have respect as 
parliamentarians if we go against the will of the people and impose 
on them what we know best, as opposed to what they are 
demanding from their government? How can we expect respect for 
our laws if the people of the country lose their willingness to be so 
governed?
<P>
	Let me go back to the member for Burin-St. George's. He said: 
``I am talking of the bankruptcy of ideas and about the pain that has 
been inflicted on individuals, families and corporations out there, 
on people trying to do business, trying to run their homes and 
trying to maintain and manage their family budgets. I am talking 
about that kind of bankruptcy, that kind of pain''. He was 
accurately expressing the huge pain of excessive taxation on our 
citizens.
<P>
	I quote again: ``Go out there and ask almost any Canadian how 
fair the GST has been for him or for her. Ask a person who is in 
university and who must buy some books how fair the goods and 
services tax is. Then remember that the goods and services tax was 
going to lower prices''. Here we are in 1996 hearing exactly the 
same thing. Those same members, now on that side of the House, 
with the ability because of their numbers to do something about it, 
are refusing. When they were on this side of the House they 
represented the people. They said we should not tax books. What 
are they doing now? They are increasing the tax on books, 
effectively, for university students.
<P>
	I quote again: ``We have to understand the double talk of this 
government on many matters. When it says it is going to do 
something, then that is code for saying that it is really going to do 
the opposite. But for the record it has said it will do something 
else''. That is a quotation from a Liberal member talking about the 
Conservatives and we know where they went.
<P>
	Unfortunately my time is up. In conclusion, let me say this one 
sentence. I am here to do everything that I can to  fulfil the Reform 
plan to reduce the GST in stages to zero until it is gone as we bring 
government spending under control and stop that excessive 
taxation demand on the taxpayers.

	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training

<P>
	As a member of Parliament who has fought long and hard for the 
rights of Louis Riel and the Metis people, I feel that I and other 
members who have also struggled long and hard over many 
decades to right this wrong, have been put in a very untenable 
position. I feel my rights as a member of Parliament have been 
marginalized because this bill is rooted in everything that Louis 
Riel did not stand for.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. It is clear that this 
is not time for debate on the bill. The time has elapsed. This is a 
deferred division.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. A point of order 
was raised so that some members would have a chance to leave and 
others to save face, because what was raised had already been 
pointed out by the person who was trying to get out of voting for 
the bill. She is as much out of order as I am.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The question before the 
House is on a deferred recorded division. Neither point is relevant 
to the division before the House, but rather is tending to debate 
which was completed in accordance with the rules.

Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEACEKEEPING">PEACEKEEPING</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 23 consideration of the 
motion; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is somewhat ironic that 
after we have spent most of this day responding once more to time 
allocation we now have an opportunity with motion M-31 to 
discuss at least partial restoration of the prerogatives, dignity and 
relevance of Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to open my address by quoting some remarks made 
by the current Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs in the House on October 23. I quote from <I>Hansard</I>: ``When 
a peacekeeping mission is being launched, reviewed or renewed, 
debate is encouraged and the House is asked to support the 
initiative''. There is no requirement in that statement that the 
House give its consent but only that it be encouraged to support the 
government's moves.
<P>
	In the same address the parliamentary secretary went on to say: 
``The government agrees that a debate on our commitment should 
be held either in this House or before the Parliament of Canada, but 
it is quite another story to ask that there be a vote before Canada 
can make any commitment''. Is that not nice? ``It is quite another 
story to ask that there be a vote before Canada can make a 
commitment''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7339"> 7339 </A></B>
<P>
	It has not always been that way. There was a time when 
Parliament had some relevance, when Parliament had real power.
<P>
	As usual I notice that most of the Liberal members are 
conspicuous in their absence from the House. Those sweethearts 
may have nothing but contempt for this institution but, by God, 
they should have a little respect for their fellow members. They 
should show that respect by at least hearing our views and going 
through the motions of having a real debate.
<P>
	There was a time when cabinets, no matter how powerful, 
respected this place. I quote <I>Hansard</I> for June 30, 1950, when the 
Right Hon. Louis St. Laurent said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the situation in Korea or elsewhere, after prorogation, should deteriorate and 
action by Canada beyond that which I have indicated should be considered, 
parliament will immediately be summoned to give the new situation consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	``Parliament will be immediately summoned''. How Liberal 
attitudes have changed in this post-Pearsonian era. Parliament is 
now regarded as little more than a nuisance, but never a serious 
threat to governmental activity.
<P>
	In September 1950 Parliament was indeed recalled to debate 
sending ground troops to Korea. The debate began on September 4. 
The mobilization order was issued on September 9. Some might 
call this undue delay, but remember that the UN resolution calling 
for joint action had been passed on June 27. The government had 
waited for two months before it decided to bring the matter to a 
head, discuss it in the House and set the subsequent events in 
motion.
<P>
	When the Suez crisis developed in November 1956 the House 
was already in session, but Canadian participation was nevertheless 
determined by order in council. That was only six years after the 
Korean involvement.
<P>
	In theory, and it is a great theory, Parliament had 10 days in 
which to determine whether to fund the action. However, in 
practice, as we all know, it was an exercise in rubber stamping. 
Here in Canada, with no separation of executive and legislative 
powers, Parliament cannot, without a vote of non-confidence, 
restrain the government by denying funding for its adventures.
<P>
	In contrast, the U.S. Congress 25 years ago was able to stop 
military operations in Laos and Cambodia by tying the purse 
strings of the government.
<P>
	In this century, for those of you who have not followed the 
political life of our giant neighbour to the south, the U.S. president, 
prior to the Laos and Cambodia situation, had gradually usurped 
the power of Congress to declare war. However, Congress is 
nevertheless the ultimate authority because of its power to 
withhold funds.
<P>
	Of course, the flip side to that is, contrary to our domestic 
situation, the power of the president as commander in chief confers 
what has been described by some as a vast reservoir of powers in 
time of emergency, with the authority to do just about anything 
anywhere that can be done with an army or navy. It is the type of 
power which has been usurped by cabinet in this country.
<P>
	It has become possible to deploy troops in situations where, 
although combat is not technically involved, there is danger of 
provoking conflict or where the deployment of troops could be 
regarded by others as a hostile act. Under the Canadian system 
governments are not supposed to possess such draconian powers, 
but cabinet abuses in the post-Pearson era have conferred them as a 
matter of custom, a custom which must be reversed if we want to 
reaffirm democracy in this country.
<P>
	In M-31 it is stated that not only should Parliament be vested 
with the power to send our troops abroad, but that it should be 
subject to a free vote of the members. It should not be a partisan 
issue. Members of Parliament, before they put their constituents or 
the sons and daughters of their constituents into life-threatening 
situations, should be able to look into their own souls and they 
should be able to consult with their constituents to make a decision 
which bears the imprint, if you will, of the will of the country. We 
should not be rushing about, sending troops hither and yon without 
the absolute support of the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It is possible, although I would say by no means certain, that if 
we had had a reasoned debate and a free vote in the House on the 
Rwanda adventure that particular fiasco might have been avoided.
<P>
	I see the Speaker is giving me the finger. I will terminate my 
remarks at this point.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I was only indicating to 
the hon. member that he had one minute left. If he wishes to 
continue for another minute the time is his. I was not in any sense 
being disrespectful to the hon. member whose views are very 
important to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to join in the debate on this 
motion put forward by the member opposite.
<P>
	On the surface the bill differs a little from what the government 
has already put into practice. In fact the government has made a 
point of encouraging public debate and more open consultation in 
all major foreign and defence policies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7340"> 7340 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> When did we vote on any of them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Peacekeeping debates held in the House have 
been numerous, a practice to which the government remains 
committed. It is my belief, however, that while this motion is 
similar in spirit and steps have already taken by the government to 
increase consultations, it has the potential to deprive Canada of its 
ability to respond effectively to crisis situations. This motion 
would transform a well functioning system into a more 
cumbersome process.
<P>
	The value of Canada's involvement in promoting international 
peace and security cannot be overstated. As the government has 
emphasized in the House on numerous occasions, Canada has a 
long and proud tradition of helping global communities defend 
peace, freedom and democracy. It remains committed to creating, 
in association with its friends and allies, a stable international 
environment. We realize that our security and prosperity depend on 
a safer, more secure global order.
<P>
	As a responsible member of the international community and as 
a major trading nation, Canada understands the need to contain and 
prevent conflict. We also want to help reduce the human suffering 
in situations where outside assistance can make a difference.
<P>
	Canada has consistently seen peacekeeping as an extremely 
useful tool in international efforts to manage and resolve conflict. 
We have excelled at peacekeeping. Our experience and skills are 
unmatched. We have a long tradition of peacekeeping and expertise 
based on professionalism, training and courage of our personnel.
<P>
	We have a wealth of experience in preparing, deploying, 
sustaining and repatriating peacekeeping forces of various 
strengths and, more recently, have been in a vanguard of new 
concepts. Our corporate memory and reputation in peacekeeping 
thus makes us a natural choice for a wide variety of missions.
<P>
	For Canada to remain on the leading edge of peacekeeping 
operations, it must recognize and be prepared to adjust to new 
global realities. Events in today's world unfold with startling 
speed. We have seen numerous examples in recent years of 
tensions, left simmering for years, suddenly boiling over with 
terrible ferocity.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the government rejects the motion before 
us. At a time when an efficient response would be critical, this 
motion would complicate unnecessarily the government's capacity 
to react to the UN's request for assistance in peace operations and 
to respond to changes in the peacekeeping mandate. That certainly 
is the consensus of many former Canadian UN commanders. They 
have identified the length of time it takes for the international 
community to respond to a crisis as a major problem.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Major-General Romeo Dallaire has been an eloquent and 
passionate advocate of the need for efficient response to 
emergencies. And who should know better than a man who saw the 
horrible carnage that took place in Rwanda and Burundi? He 
witnessed it firsthand.
<P>
	The motion before this House would add another step, one which 
is redundant to the decision making process. Should we support a 
motion which in practice could erode Canada's capacity to become 
involved and provide help when and where it is needed? If a 
situation is deemed an emergency, it should be treated like one.
<P>
	Improving the ability of Canada and the UN to react promptly 
and effectively to a wide range of humanitarian crises has been a 
priority of this government. For example, the Canadian Disaster 
Assistance Response Team, or DART, was established this year as 
part of the response to the kind of conditions found two years ago 
in the Rwanda crisis. In Rwanda a terrible price was paid because 
of the slow and ineffective response. Many, many lives were lost.
<P>
	For some time Canada has played a leading role in efforts to 
design a specialized military unit to respond to humanitarian 
emergencies. We have now put our plans into action. The DART 
team will be able to respond to a crisis in Canada or almost 
anywhere in the world within 48 hours of a government decision to 
send assistance. It has the capacity to assist and complement the 
work of humanitarian organizations in critical situations, 
conducting emergency humanitarian assistance operations for up to 
40 days.
<P>
	For example, DART might work with non-governmental 
organizations such as CARE in responding to a major cholera 
epidemic. They will be able to provide medical resources and treat 
up to 500 patients a day. They will be able to help provide electrical 
power and clean water for up to 10,000 people a day. They will be 
able to build temporary shelters as needed. This capability will also 
buy time for Canada to assess the situation and determine long term 
assistance strategies.
<P>
	Canadian peacekeepers are trained to respond effectively in 
times of crisis. They have leadership to assess situations and 
implement plans to assist others. These are the assets so valued in 
times of crises, assets we cannot allow to be unnecessarily 
compromised by the added step this motion would introduce in the 
decision making process.
<P>
	The proposal from the member opposite may well introduce 
rigidity where flexibility currently exists, and impede decision 
making rather than assist it. Rigidity, inaction and cumbersome 
decision making are exactly the problems Canada is trying to 
alleviate at the international level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7341"> 7341 </A></B>
<P>
	Members from both sides of this House have acknowledged that 
the UN must improve its ability to  respond rapidly and effectively. 
The UN needs to do so to identify and prevent impeding crises 
from escalating. In the aftermath of the cold war there is no reason 
the UN cannot ultimately perform this role.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the UN does not currently have the capability, 
politically, militarily, administratively or logistically, to react 
rapidly to conflicts or humanitarian crises where security is at risk. 
The current ad hoc method of obtaining and assembling units from 
member states while at the same time trying to set up operational 
headquarters makes true rapid response impossible to achieve.
<P>
	New approaches are being implemented. This was the impetus 
behind the Canadian study of the UN's rapid reaction capability in 
peace support operations. Canada has emphasized the need to 
create within the UN a capability to respond with humanitarian, 
diplomatic, military and logistical aid in a more efficient manner 
and a much improved crisis management apparatus.
<P>
	Sovereign states must adapt to this new world in order to permit 
the UN to do the job they do not want to do individually, or cannot 
do for various geopolitical reasons. Change is required if we were 
to manage properly future humanitarian crises. In an emergency 
situation where many lives are at risk, surely the members of the 
House would not want to complicate Canada's response 
mechanism by placing an unnecessary procedure in the way. At a 
time when flexibility of response is critical to meeting demands of 
rapid change, eastern Zaire being the current example, the motion 
before us would complicate our process, which has been proven to 
be effective, and would potentially place the lives of many in 
unnecessary jeopardy.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	The government has demonstrated its commitment to 
consultation. We have listened to the views of parliamentarians and 
the Canadian public in formulating peacekeeping policy. We will 
continue to do so in the future. But not every decision can be 
reached by committee. The government has established the 
political guidelines and reciprocal trust must prevail in their 
implementation. There is a time when action backed by discretion 
and experience is crucial to success. To abandon flexibility is to be 
imprudent.
<P>
	We have listened to those who gave us the mandate to govern, 
the citizens of this country. They have made it clear through their 
support the existence of a consensus among Canadians on the 
approach we have taken in peacekeeping. Now it is up to us to 
make the difficult decisions that will enable us to accomplish the 
mission, but to do so the government must have the ability and 
flexibility to choose from among different options.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I rise in the House today to speak to the  motion of the 
hon. member for Red Deer and the amendment of the hon. member 
for Témiscamingue, I would like to start by saying that the first few 
times I took part in debates of an international nature in this House, 
I realized this could have a tremendous impact, both on the people 
and the countries where interventions take place and in our own 
ridings, where we have members of the military who are called 
upon to take part in these operations.
<P>
	After being involved in the debates we have had on Bosnia, 
Haiti, Rwanda, and perhaps tomorrow in another debate which may 
arise unexpectedly, I think the motion before the House is a very 
interesting one and is also very balanced, which is very important 
in the area of international relations, especially when we consider 
the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Témiscamingue.
<P>
	If the motion were adopted, as amended, it would say as follows: 
``That all projects of military commitments abroad involving 
Canadian troops must, as soon as possible, be the subject of a vote 
in the House''. As soon as possible, and that is in response to the 
arguments of the government, which contends this would paralyze 
the government's activities. No, the Bloc Quebecois amendment is 
intended to ensure that the government retains enough flexibility 
but at the same time will respect the advice it is given in the House. 
It would do so as soon as possible, always, of course, depending on 
the emergencies that arise.
<P>
	I will resume my reading of the motion: ``-must, as soon as 
possible, be the subject of a vote in the House in order to 
recommend their approval or rejection to the government''. The 
government's responsibility remains intact. There are always 
aspects of international relations, diplomatic and security aspects 
that may be considered and of which each member of this House is 
not necessarily fully aware.
<P>
	However, I think it would be useful for the government, as part 
of a review of Canada's international policy, to make a rule of what 
has been its practice for a number of years, which is to consult the 
House regularly when it has decisions to make regarding the 
presence of Canadian troops abroad.
<P>
	It is important because, as I said earlier, one of the first speeches 
I made in this House was one I made in a debate on Bosnia. There 
are young men and women of 20, 25 or 30 in my riding who took 
part in these operations. I met some of these people last week and 
they described their experience, the results and how things worked 
over there.
<P>
	With the advice of people who were in the field and also what I 
would call the sense of balance, the sense of responsibility we find 
in this House when we deal with international issues and when we 
do not get the same kind of partisan debate we might have on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7342"> 7342 </A></B>
<P>
domestic issues, I think it is important for the government to be  
able to consider these roles and the advice that may be 
forthcoming.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	All this is especially important since in future, Canada will 
undoubtedly be asked to take on an expanded role in these 
operations. We can expect all kinds of unusual situations on this 
planet. Every time, this will require a detailed and balanced 
analysis. We will have to look at the pros and cons of our 
involvement. The latest crisis in Rwanda and the Zaire question are 
a case in point.
<P>
	During a debate in this House on the question, we realized that 
both the government and the opposition parties had a very balanced 
approach. They all wanted to ensure that nothing ill-advised was 
done on the international scene which would be harmful to the 
populations concerned. This obliged the government to take all 
recommendations into consideration.
<P>
	I recall that, among the things that were said, it was stated that 
care must be taken to avoid sticking obstinately to military 
intervention if this proved to no longer be the right solution. This 
was said in the House. Suggestions were made, enriching the 
debate and enabling the government to take a stand.
<P>
	The motion presented to us is important in that connection. It 
restores to Parliament a responsibility which is rightly ours. I know 
that we are in a British parliamentary system, in which the 
government assumes total responsibility; it is different from the 
American or the French system.
<P>
	When international security is concerned-international military 
interventions in which human lives are at stake-it is important to 
give members of Parliament the chance of putting forward their 
points of view and, whenever possible, a vote ought to be taken 
when the situation is not urgent and does not require action to be 
taken within hours.
<P>
	We have seen the case of Rwanda. We had the time to discuss the 
situation, to adjust our positions. By taking into consideration the 
opinions expressed during the debate, the government avoided 
taking actions that would have been badly perceived, as well as 
ineffective on the international scene.
<P>
	They could have come back and asked the opinion of the House, 
in light of the new information available. The government would 
have been well advised to base its positions on the results of House 
votes. In the case of a major international situation for example, the 
unanimous support of the House would strengthen the 
government's intervention. The government would also be in a 
better position internationally.
<P>
	At home, it can always be argued that decisions are made 
democratically. They are made in consideration of elected 
officials' opinions. If we passed the motion before  us, we would 
show our belief in letting elected officials have a say not only in 
principle but also in reality.
<P>
	Our opinion must be taken into consideration, because 
increasingly a precise way of consulting elected officials in such 
situations must be defined. The trend will be increasingly to create 
an international emergency force that would act in difficult 
situations or situations involving military or humanitarian 
interventions, matters of practical logistics and of principle.
<P>
	The government benefits from considered opinions on all these 
things and from the opinions of the members of the House of 
Commons, which represents all parties in Canada. This is equally 
valid in the case of interventions in francophone and anglophone 
countries, whatever the make-up of the Canadian force and the type 
of intervention involved.
<P>
	Recently, on the question of Zaire and Rwanda, we wondered 
about an American presence and the type of aid they could provide. 
Would a vote in the House not have given the Government of 
Canada a stronger position from which to defend its viewpoint? 
Would that not have been worthwhile? We would all have benefited 
from such a position.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I would like to come back to the impact that I think is the most 
important, the human impact. In the course of our duties as MPs, 
we are often called upon to vote or take a stand on economic, social 
or cultural issues. When we talk about the presence of foreign 
soldiers, we are talking about human issues, about families that 
will be left worrying, separated from one of their own. Therefore, 
we must be sure that, when these situations arise, we have truly 
weighed all sides of the issue, because we cannot really afford to be 
wrong. We must identify the position most likely to resolve the 
situation and to allow Canada to fulfil its international role. The 
support the House of Commons can provide in these cases is, in my 
view, an important factor.
<P>
	I am not in complete agreement with the arguments we heard 
earlier from a government member, who said that this would take 
away the government's room to manoeuvre, that we could not 
always change course rapidly enough. I think that the opposition 
parties, in these situations, have learned to weigh all the facts 
carefully before adopting a position.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the member for Témiscamingue 
meets all these criteria, and it would be a sign of maturity on the 
part of this Parliament and of the government majority to approve 
it, so that all proposed military commitments abroad involving 
Canadian troops can be the subject of a vote in the House of 
Commons with a view to their approval or rejection. Democracy 
and Canadian diplomacy abroad would stand to gain.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Motion No. 31 put 
forward by my colleague from Red Deer. The motion asks that our 
peacekeeping commitments, which involve 100 or more personnel, 
be put to the House of Commons in a manner that would allow a 
free vote.
<P>
	This motion has a lot of credibility because, if there is one single 
issue that I have had a lot of calls from my constituency about, it 
has been the sending of our troops to different parts of the world to 
be involved in peacekeeping activities. The opportunity to have 
free votes on this issue is certainly justified as a result of the input I 
personally have had from the people of Prince George-Bulkley 
Valley.
<P>
	Also, on page 92 of the Liberal red ink book, the Liberal Party 
promised more free votes in the House. However, these Liberals 
have not allowed very many free votes.
<P>
	We do have debates on certain peacekeeping missions. When it 
comes to peacekeeping and the lives of our Canadian soldiers, it is 
absolutely essential that Parliament as a whole is able to have 
meaningful debate and provide input in these matters. But the fact 
is that cabinet and only cabinet has the ultimate authority to 
designate soldiers to peacekeeping activities.
<P>
	That is an awesome power for the cabinet to have. Regardless of 
what our constituents may have to say about it, regardless of what 
the Canadian people may feel about it, the small group in cabinet 
can make the unilateral decision to send our soldiers abroad. And 
that has been done. It has been done over and over again. There is 
no requirement to hold a debate on these matters. It is only required 
that Parliament be reconvened within a 10-day period following the 
decision to commit troops in the first place. That is sort of the 
reverse.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	I would think the proper way to handle these matters would be to 
have a debate and after the debate cabinet would make a decision 
based on that input. It can make a decision with the confidence that 
the concerns and the voices of the Canadian people have been heard 
in the House. But that is not the case.
<P>
	It is interesting that in the fall of 1994 a special joint committee 
released a defence policy paper. Lo and behold, the paper had the 
support of all the parties in the House. Liberals know very well that 
one of the recommendations stated ``nor should the government 
commit our forces to service abroad without a full parliamentary 
debate and accounting for that decision''.
<P>
	As we have seen on the GST issue, the Liberal government can 
take a promise to scrap the GST many  different ways. I would 
imagine the way it has taken this is that there will be a full 
parliamentary debate in the accounting for that decision but it will 
come after cabinet has already made the decision to commit troops. 
I stated earlier that is the reverse of the way one would assume 
things should operate in this House. Mr. Speaker, I am sure you 
would agree with me on that point. We have had token debates on 
peacekeeping and cabinet does what it wants anyway.
<P>
	If we want to have a full accounting of our peacekeeping 
decisions as recommended by this policy paper which all the 
parties agreed on, then MPs must have the opportunity to debate 
these matters in the House of Commons.
<P>
	This motion in no way attempts to limit our international 
obligations; it does not do that. It in no way attempts to somehow 
remove Canada from its very distinguished role as a peacekeeper.
<P>
	We have much to be proud of when it comes to peacekeeping. 
We have done a good job. Since 1947 over 100,000 Canadians have 
served abroad in over 30 peacekeeping and related operations. We 
are the only country that can legitimately claim to have participated 
in almost every peacekeeping mission organized under the UN.
<P>
	When countries are in need of someone to enforce ceasefire 
agreements or provide humanitarian aid, they come knocking at 
our door. We should be proud of that record. The international 
community is very aware of Canada's professionalism and its 
commitment to neutrality and evenhandedness.
<P>
	In helping other countries we are also helping ourselves. A safer 
and more secure international environment is key to our very own 
security and prosperity.
<P>
	While our record on peacekeeping speaks for itself and while we 
are anxious to assist other countries in dire need of our soldiers' 
services, these Liberals have not given the military the support it 
needs and deserves and the lives of Canadian soldiers overseas 
have been put in danger because of that.
<P>
	The Liberals have committed our troops to war zones with 
antiquated equipment. Stories came out of Bosnia of Canadian 
peacekeepers trading helmets and flak jackets with their 
replacements at the airport because there was not enough gear to go 
around. That is an incredible thing to comprehend.
<P>
	Furthermore, the armoured personnel carriers they were using 
provided our troops with inadequate protection against bullets and 
land mines. That is frightening. These are Canadian soldiers. It was 
only last summer that the Liberals announced that the armoured 
personnel carriers would be upgraded. That is some consolation but 
we did have those dangerous situations prior to that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7344"> 7344 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Outdated equipment at the department of defence should come 
as no surprise since it has faced continual cutbacks under the 
Liberal government. As a matter of fact the 1996 Liberal budget 
predicts that expenditures at national defence will be cut by 20 per 
cent in 1998-99.
<P>
	That leads us to this scenario. While the government is 
committing our troops to more and more missions, they are being 
sent off with poorer and poorer equipment. That is not a mission a 
Canadian soldier really wants to go on. This is why I say that the 
policies of the Liberal government are putting the lives of our 
peacekeepers at risk, sending them into areas of peacekeeping and 
providing humanitarian aid without being properly equipped or 
properly prepared.
<P>
	We can see that in the most recent issue as we have been talking 
about sending our peacekeepers to Zaire. There was no real plan. 
As far as I know, there is still no plan but the government has been 
intent to send our troops over there.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs himself has stated that we need 
to have the views of members of Parliament. The views of 
members of Parliament are what this motion asks for, nothing more 
than that. It is not designed to impede our peacekeeping activities. 
It simply asks that members of Parliament be given a chance to 
have meaningful debate in the House to put the views of their 
constituents forward in this House before a cabinet decision is 
made to send our troops abroad.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to support this most worthwhile 
motion put forward by the hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
am pleased to participate in the debate on Motion No. 31 put 
forward by the hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
	In late October in the first part of our debate on this motion we 
heard criticism of our record of consultation on Canadian 
participation in peacekeeping operations, especially in former 
Yugoslavia and Haiti. I would like to remind hon. members 
opposite that since January 1994 our participation in peacekeeping 
operations has been debated in this House eight times. They should 
have been here between 1988 and 1993 and compare that record to 
this one.
<P>
	On most of these occasions, particular attention was drawn to 
our role in former Yugoslavia and Haiti. Furthermore, numerous 
other consultations took place in discussions with the standing 
committee on foreign affairs, of which the hon. member is a 
member, which also has a voting mechanism.
<P>
	I cannot overemphasize that at every opportunity this 
government has endeavoured to facilitate the debate on Canada's 
peacekeeping commitments. The apparent objective of Motion No. 
31 to generate such debate has already been accomplished by this 
government.
<P>
	This motion contains no innovative proposals to strengthen the 
Canadian policy making process with respect to peacekeeping. The 
only effect it would have would be to hamper Canada's ability to 
act by making the existing process more cumbersome, which could 
only compromise the respect and admiration the country has 
merited through its peacekeeping actions for more than 40 years.
<P>
	In light of Canadians' ability to express their concerns regarding 
any peacekeeping operation, their willingness to do so and the 
frequency with which the House is debating this matter, the motion 
under consideration is really unnecessary. It can only sap Canada's 
ability to act swiftly in accordance with its international 
peacekeeping commitments.
<P>
	We are the first to implore the international community to react 
swiftly in times of crisis, as stressed in the report on the United 
Nations' rapid response capacity which I am pleased to note 
resulted from a Canadian initiative.
<P>
	The international community must react efficiently. Having 
pressured the international community for action on this issue, 
Canada has a responsibility to play a leading role and must not run 
up against redundant mechanisms. Even when confronted with 
humanitarian emergencies such as in eastern Zaire, we were 
prepared to consult the House, as is only right. Nevertheless the 
opposition leaders chose to trust us and not to recall members to the 
House unnecessarily.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at peacekeeping and peace building in the 
aftermath of the cold war. In the post-cold war era the whole 
context of peacekeeping has changed. Increasingly, instead of the 
classic cross-border conflict between states, we are dealing with 
internal conflicts which threaten to spill over into regional conflicts 
and to fall into unending cycles of violence. We have seen this 
pattern most clearly in the former Yugoslavia and in the great lakes 
region of Africa.
<P>
	These changes have sparked debate in Canada and 
internationally about how best to respond to these needs, a debate 
that informs the quest for reform within the United Nations. In this 
context, and as I mentioned earlier, Canada tabled a study on ways 
to enhance the UN's rapid deployment capabilities. Work is under 
way within the United Nations to implement many of the 
recommendations made in this study. That is one aspect of the 
debate, making us better peacekeepers, able to react more 
efficaciously, with a more flexible, integrated response. This is the 
premise on which we have built our international reputation as 
some of the best peacekeepers in the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7345"> 7345 </A></B>
<P>
	The other aspect is recognizing the need for a broader approach, 
not just keeping the peace now, but building peace to last. This 
broader approach has been termed peace building. Peace building 
is rooted in the recognition that human rights and basic freedoms, 
the rule of law, good governance, sustainable development and 
social equity are just as important to world peace as arms control 
and disarmament. In other words, if we want to restore and 
maintain peace in countries plagued by conflict, we must 
guarantee human security as well as military security.
<P>
	While peacekeeping seeks to guarantee security on a military 
basis, the goal of peace building is to put in place a lasting 
infrastructure for human security. Once a peacekeeping operation 
is under way, peace building seizes on a brief opportunity, a crucial 
moment to help a country turn to the road of lasting peace and 
stability.
<P>
	It works to bring about the minimum conditions that will enable 
a country to take control of its destiny after which social, political 
and economic development become possible. Peacekeeping and 
peace building clearly have to play closely linked roles, 
complementary roles, to put an end to the conflict.
<P>
	In planning international missions to Haiti, Bosnia, and now 
Zaire, we are becoming increasingly aware that multi-disciplinary 
actions are needed that address more than one aspect of a problem. 
Armed forces cannot only enforce a ceasefire but can also establish 
a framework in which civilians, including NGOs, can act. Civilian 
operations include both a humanitarian assistance component and 
peace building activities.
<P>
	It is absolutely essential to link and co-ordinate these two 
aspects: assistance and peacekeeping in the short term and peace 
building in the long run. This need has been recognized in the 
United Nations Security Council resolution on the forming of a 
multilateral force in response to the situation in Zaire. The 
resolution explicitly called for a second follow-up phase in the 
force's mandate. Planning for that phase began immediately which 
has never happened before.
<P>
	This is an example of new approaches to conflict resolution. 
Other methods may be needed in other situations but what is 
important is to react in a flexible and innovative way. In accepting 
his Nobel prize, Lester B. Pearson stated: ``The best defence of 
peace is not power but the removal of the cause of war, and 
international agreements which will put peace on a stronger 
foundation than the terror of destruction''.
<P>
	Implicit in this statement are several basic Canadian values. In 
line with the third pillar of our foreign policy we see peacekeeping 
as a means to project these values. First and foremost is the 
commitment to peace itself and to the non-violent resolution of 
disputes, values which resonate throughout our society.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	Crucial to achieving peace is the pursuit of a process of dialogue 
and consultation, leading to mutual agreements. Our federal system 
could not work without a firm commitment to the consultative 
process. Broad international support fortifies such agreements by 
providing recognition and legitimacy.
<P>
	Strengthening the foundations of peace, as I have just described, 
fosters the establishment of an international order based on rules to 
which Canadians are strongly attached. In short, peacekeeping goes 
hand in hand with our vision of Canada, our vision of a progressive 
country that is open to the world and committed internationally. In 
addition, it strengthens Canadians' fundamental belief in the 
effectiveness of civil society, good governance and respect for 
human rights and the rule of law.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about Canadian expertise in 
peacekeeping. Nourished by these values and by four decades of 
on-the-ground experience, Canada has developed extensive 
expertise in peacekeeping. The notion of civil-military 
co-operation to enhance the effectiveness of peacekeeping is the 
cornerstone of the new peacekeeping partnership. This partnership 
was put into action by the Lester B. Pearson Canadian International 
Peacekeeping Trading Centre. It is also at the core of the DART, the 
Disaster Assistance Relief Team, a concept developed by DND to 
intervene efficiently in the case of a humanitarian disaster and to 
co-ordinate in theatre efforts with humanitarian agencies.
<P>
	A national consensus for our peacekeeping policy and operations 
is also very important. Canadians have a remarkable degree of 
support for peacekeeping which is a great satisfaction to all of us. 
Polls indicate that 80 per cent of our fellow citizens take great pride 
in our country's peacekeeping role. Many of our fellow citizens see 
it as our most important contribution to the international 
community. Our national consensus on this issue transcends 
partisan differences and is supported by all segments of society. 
The Canadian media as well echo and strengthen that consensus.
<P>
	I see, Mr. Speaker, you are giving me a signal that my time is up. 
I thank the hon. member for Red Deer for bringing forward this 
motion so that we can talk about peacekeeping and peace building. 
I hope in the future the hon. member would bring more 
constructive and creative ideas to the whole idea of conflict 
resolutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to speak today on Motion M-13 put forward by 
the hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
	As official opposition critic on foreign affairs and vice-chair of 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, I am in fact entitled to draw attention to the appropriateness 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7346"> 7346 </A></B>
<P>
of this motion, which would make the process of sending our 
troops overseas much more open and democratic.
<P>
	Let me start off, however, by reminding you that the Bloc 
Quebecois has proposed a very important amendment, because we 
felt that Motion M-31, while very pertinent, was still flawed. Thus, 
with the amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, the motion 
would read as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, all proposed peacekeeping or peace 
enforcement commitments involving Canadian troops must, as soon as possible, be 
the subject of a vote in the House in order to recommend their approval or rejection 
to the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment would be totally acceptable to the present 
government, since it would have the advantage of adding to the 
transparency of the decision making process associated with 
sending our soldiers abroad, without tying the hands of the 
government when prompt action is required.
<P>
	You will see that the Bloc Quebecois is being very consistent 
with its previous positions, because we had already, in the 
dissenting opinion we tabled in November 1994 in conjunction 
with the report by the Special Joint Committee reviewing Canada's 
Foreign Policy, recommended that the House of Commons be more 
involved in decisions involving foreign affairs.
<P>
	I will quote, if I may, an excerpt from page 4 of the Bloc 
Quebecois dissenting opinion: ``We consider that Canada should 
submit any decision to participate in peacekeeping missions to a 
vote in the House of Commons, as rapidly as possible, when time 
allows''.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	Now that the irritants in the motion tabled in this House by the 
Reform Party have been removed, we sincerely believe that it 
would be illogical for this government to vote against it, especially 
since the Minister of Foreign Affairs is constantly reiterating his 
desire to consult MPs and the general public to a larger extent.
<P>
	I do not have to remind my hon. colleagues in this House that the 
principal role of a member of Parliament is to represent his or her 
fellow citizens. The government ought, therefore, to do everything 
it can to involve MPs in decisions as important as sending our 
soldiers overseas. The lives of Quebecers and Canadians are at 
stake, whom Canada takes the risk of sending into parts of the 
world where instability or danger, or both, are constantly present.
<P>
	Of course, our military personnel possess all of the qualities 
required to carry out such missions successfully. Moreover, they 
have our total support and affection, given the excellent reputation 
they have built for themselves in their many peacekeeping 
assignments. 
<P>
	We believe, however, that not just the soldiers, but the people of 
Quebec and Canada are entitled, at the very least, to be informed of 
the dangerous situations our troops might have to contend with. 
What is surprising today is that the Liberal government might well 
vote against this Reform Party motion as amended by the Bloc 
Quebecois, although the Liberals themselves promised in their 
famous red book that they would increase the involvement of 
Parliament and the public in debates on major foreign policy 
issues.
<P>
	I shall, if I may, quote a particularly significant excerpt from the 
red book which would be a mere pamphlet if it only included the 
promises that were kept. It says, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will also expand the rights of Parliament to debate major 
Canadian foreign policy initiatives, such as the deployment of peacekeeping forces, 
and the rights of Canadians to regular and serious consultations on foreign policy 
issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The conclusion is that it makes no sense at all to debate this 
motion today, since it is clear that if the Liberal Party had kept this 
promise, the case would already be closed. Of course some of our 
Liberal colleagues are going to argue that the government would 
not be as functional or that it has to be able to act quickly.
<P>
	During the debate in April 1995 on Bill C-295, whose purpose 
was to promote parliamentary control of peacekeeping operations, 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence 
and Veterans Affairs implied that he would not go along with the 
idea of being subjected to a set of rules that would restrict the speed 
with which the government could react.
<P>
	Motion M-31 as amended would allow the government to act 
quickly. Adding the phrase ``as soon as possible'' means that the 
government could act immediately in a crisis and would not have to 
wait for Parliament to reconvene before making a decision.
<P>
	If, for instance, a crisis arose somewhere in the world, our troops 
could be dispatched immediately to the theatres of operations and 
subsequently, parliamentarians would be able to have a debate on 
this decision.
<P>
	The Americans have already thought about this and came up 
with a solution in 1973 in the form of the War Power Resolution. 
The three main points may be summarized as follows: after sending 
troops abroad, the president has 48 hours to inform Congress in 
writing of what he intends to do; the use of force by troops must 
cease within 60 days, unless Congress authorizes an extension. 
However, the president may request a further 30 days to ensure a 
safe withdrawal of the troops. Congress could demand the 
withdrawal of the troops within 60 to 90 days by passing a 
resolution to that effect, a resolution that would be passed 
simultaneous by both chambers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7347"> 7347 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear that we are nowhere near this kind of control. Motion 
M-31 as amended by the Bloc Quebecois merely proposes to have 
an open debate on sending our troops abroad.
<P>
	This motion would give members a chance to make their 
suggestions and opinions known in this House. The last time troops 
were sent abroad, it was clear that the members of this House had 
not been consulted but merely informed.
<P>
	It is too bad government does not pay more attention to the 
advice of parliamentarians, despite its claims of openness and 
transparency.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Take for instance the case of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs. The minister does not seem to realize that the members of 
this committee examine a certain number of issues thoroughly. We 
hear witnesses from all walks of life with often exceptional 
knowledge of often very complex subjects.
<P>
	The minister keeps saying that the work done by the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade is very 
important. He says that he intends to keep committee members 
informed of the government's decisions, and to take into 
consideration the positions formulated by this committee.
<P>
	Is there not something ironic about the fact that these eloquent, 
gratuitous and inconsequential statements come from the same 
government which waited until the members of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade were held 
up abroad as members of a parliamentary delegation to sneak 
through the House the bill to implement the Canada-Israel free 
trade agreement, despite the reservations expressed by members of 
this committee during clause by clause consideration of the bill and 
after hearing witnesses?
<P>
	When the government decided to lead what was supposed to be a 
multinational force that would go and help refugees in the African 
great lakes region, it did not even bother to consult or even inform 
members of the committee or at least the chairman of its decision.
<P>
	The government has already promised that members sitting in 
this House will have a say in the deployment of peacekeepers. That 
is exactly the purpose of motion M-31.
<P>
	I see you are signalling that my time is up, but you allowed the 
member of the Liberal Party a few seconds more, so I shall, if I 
may, use the time I have left to say that this is exactly the purpose 
of Motion M-31 as amended by the Bloc Quebecois. It does not 
deny the government the authority to act quickly when the situation 
so requires and it would have a major impact in that it would open a 
window on that rather closed decision making centre which is the 
Department of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998 and the importance of this 
declaration in the promotion of human rights both domestically and throughout the 
world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to lead off an extremely unusual 
debate in the House of Commons. It is the kind of discussion that 
we need to have more frequently not only in Parliament but among 
ourselves as Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This debate is on human rights in the world and at home. Two 
years from today, the world will celebrate the 50th anniversary of 
the adoption of the United Nations Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. For the first time in the history of man, a 
declaration was adopted in which all peoples of the world agreed 
that, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for Mount Royal and chair 
of the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities for having requested this debate and the 
former hon. member and Secretary of State for External Affairs, 
Walter McLean, for his hard work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For all of us who have known her in the House of Commons, it is 
no surprise that it is the hon. member for Mount Royal who is the 
prime advocate for this discussion, where we examine our 
conscience as parliamentarians and our hearts as human beings. It 
is no surprise because the phrases ``advocacy of human rights'' and 
``Sheila Finestone'' go hand in hand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to recognize the contribution of the United 
Nations Association in Canada, which encourages Canadians to 
focus on education, public awareness, the participation of young 
people and community involvement in human rights on this 
historic occasion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7348"> 7348 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The United Nations was created so that the world had a place to 
come together. Right now, in the search for a new secretary general, 
countries are thinking more about their veto than reflecting on the 
fact that the United Nations is the only world vehicle we have for 
advancing true world harmony.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Yes it is possible for countries to stymie one another at the 
United Nations but to do so for reasons of national vanity is very 
wrong. At the UN we come together, we put aside our individual 
interests so we may act in harmony and collective honour.
<P>
	As President John Kennedy said in his state of the union address 
to the United States Congress in 1962: ``Our instrument and our 
hope is the United Nations, and I see little merit in the impatience 
of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument 
because they dislike our imperfect world''. John F. Kennedy's 
statements are as true today as they were when he spoke them in 
1962.
<P>
	Yes the United Nations needs to be reformed. But member 
countries also need to reform their attitude toward the United 
Nations and they should start doing something about paying their 
back dues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people of Canada consider Boutros Boutros-Ghali highly 
talented, extraordinarily committed, most dignified and a great 
friend of Canada. We hope whoever succeeds him will have the 
wisdom to continue his sensible and considered actions.
<P>
	Two years from today, celebrations will be held around the world 
to mark the anniversary of this declaration. Three years from the 
end of the month, we will be celebrating the advent of the new 
millennium.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is my profound hope that as we prepare for these occasions, 
Canadians take to heart the awesome meaning of these words: 
``Now, therefore, the General Assembly proclaims this universal 
declaration as a common standard of achievement for all peoples 
and all nations to the end that every individual and every organ of 
society-shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect 
for these rights and freedoms''.
<P>
	What the world agreed to 48 years ago was not just a statement 
from governments. It was a statement for each and everyone of us 
in our daily lives, in our communities and in our own homes.
<P>
	The declaration committed us to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion. It committed all of us to equal pay for equal work, a 
radical concept those many years ago. It committed us to respect 
for privacy, to peaceful assembly, to opposition of inhuman 
punishment, to protection against discrimination, to freedom of 
movement, to just and favourable conditions of work, to food, to 
clothing, to housing and medical care and to basic education for 
everyone in the world.
<P>
	Have we achieved these goals completely here in Canada? No 
we have not. Have we achieved these goals completely in our 
personal lives? I know the answer for me is no and I suspect the 
same is true for most other Canadians.
<P>
	We have all from time to time advanced our own interests at the 
unfair expense of someone else. We have harboured views of 
people based simply on their language, or their religion, or their 
social or economic status, or their race, or their sexual orientation, 
or where they lived in the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We tend to promote our own rights. Too often we make 
disparaging remarks about others rather than try to find a way to 
work together to do things well.
<P>
	The upcoming celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the 
declaration will give us an opportunity to underscore the fact that 
Canada and its people have always been at the forefront of those 
defending human rights. Canada and its people, especially, know, 
however, that they can always do better.
<P>
	The United Nations declaration was drafted by a Canadian 
professor, John Humphrey, who died last year. Professor 
Humphrey, who was from Quebec, carried the torch for Canada's 
campaign in favour of human rights worldwide. His words, in their 
wisdom, convinced the world. At the time we acknowledged that: 
``Yes, we make mistakes, and yes, we can do better and we believe 
we must do better''.
<P>
	This desire to do better and more underlies Canada's 
commitment to peacekeeping. It also underlies our commitment 
with respect to multilateralism and our faith in the United Nations.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	Despite the many infractions against human rights, it is 
important to remember that the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights has helped to change things for the better.
<P>
	Democracy has spread in Latin America, the Berlin wall has 
come down, apartheid is no more, the threat of nuclear war has 
faded. These were all just dreams not so very long ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yet at the time this declaration was drafted, most scoffed at the 
dream of an end to totalitarianism or the opening of the iron 
curtain. These were the visions of a freer world that the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights dared us to dream.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7349"> 7349 </A></B>
<P>
	And as hope has come to so many in the life of this declaration, 
our world continues to rest on other dilemmas and reflect on other 
problems: the problems in northern Island, the stalemate in the 
Middle East, the millions of frightened refugees in Rwanda and 
Zaire, the manifest in ethnic hatred in Bosnia, the terrorism in 
Paris, Tokyo, New York and London. We need to be inspired by 
human rights, to renew our hope and translate it into action. In 
the life of this declaration time and again people have endured 
great suffering and have achieved great progress.
<P>
	As we approach the millennium it is sobering to realize that at 
the beginning of the current millennium there was no Magna Carta, 
there was no democracy. People were either masters or slaves. 
Communities were built up or thrown away on the basis of race or 
ethnic heritage. Human beings were treated as gods or garbage 
depending upon where they were born, what they believed in or 
what they held sacred.
<P>
	It is even more sobering to realize that as we approach the dawn 
of a new millennium, race, religious and ethnic divisions are still 
tearing people apart across the globe. For all of our political 
advances as human beings, for all of our economic and social 
accomplishments, for all of the marvels of industrialization, people 
are still bombing one another because of how somebody looks, how 
they sound or what they think.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is the dark side of human nature. This is why the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights is so important. It makes it possible 
to bring out the positive side of human nature.
<P>
	We are grateful for the chance to be able to debate widely 
diverging points of view in the House, and we do so day in and out. 
We also know that, as citizens, we have the power to bring about 
change by marking an X on a piece of paper.
<P>
	But the credit is not due solely to us in the House. Many 
generations of Canadians have preceded us.
<P>
	We are the envy of the whole world because, for decades, 
Canadians have acted responsibly and fairly towards each other 
and, in particular, towards the rest of the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The United Nations was born out of a war where a star or a 
triangle sewn on a lapel meant death. The United Nations was born 
out of a war in which millions of teenagers became dismembered to 
save the world from a madman who would not respect basic human 
rights.
<P>
	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights consists only of a 
short preamble and 30 articles. It is the length of a political 
pamphlet but it is the critical affirmation of decency which flows 
from the work of the world coming together to stop another world 
war.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That this document was written by a Canadian, and that 
Canadians like Mr. Pearson took the initiative to have this 
declaration adopted, are surely reasons to be proud. We should also 
take much credit for the enforcement of the principles set out in 
this declaration.
<P>
	Certain steps in achieving respect for human rights will take 
much longer than others, or will lead to controversy. Certain steps 
will require that people set aside old grievances and old settlings of 
account.
<P>
	And Canada's contribution to all these steps will force us to 
remember the mutual respect we owe one another as citizens of this 
country.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	It will also encourage us to continue in our role of leader in 
financial, human and political issues abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is far too easy to point to instances in which all of us as a 
country, and each of us as individuals, have failed to live up to that 
dream of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is far too 
easy to give up trying to solve very complex and difficult problems. 
But no great human challenge, no great human dream was every 
easy, and no human glory was ever achieved without determination 
and hard work.
<P>
	In two years it will be the 50th anniversary of the declaration 
which speaks to justice, freedom and peace. Three years from now 
we will be entering a new millennium. Where do we go from here? 
How do we get there? No one knows for sure, but one thing is 
certain. If we follow the principles laid out 48 years ago in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights we can be certain that 
tomorrow will be a better time than what we inherited.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, with your leave, I would like to 
ask for the House's consent to split my time with my colleague, the 
member for Mercier, giving us both 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the hon. 
member have the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as the official opposition's human rights critic, it is 
obviously a very great pleasure for me to take part in this debate to 
mark the fact that 1998 will be the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to note, as the 
Deputy Prime Minister has done, that this declaration was written 
by a Canadian, John Humphrey, a citizen of Quebec, and by 
Eleanor Roosevelt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7350"> 7350 </A></B>
<P>
	Although respect for fundamental rights is now guaranteed the 
people of Quebec and of Canada through their respective charters, 
this is not the case in certain countries, where governments are 
still trampling citizens' individual freedoms and fundamental 
rights.
<P>
	We, as parliamentarians, have an opportunity today to restore the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights to its rightful place in the 
forefront of national and international debate. The 50th anniversary 
must mark the renewal of the declaration and not just the 
commemoration of a date.
<P>
	My colleagues will have a chance to go into more depth on the 
historic evolution, present situation and probable future of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and its enforcement 
throughout the world. But I will begin, if I may, by recalling briefly 
the birth of this declaration, certainly one of the major historic 
events in humanity's evolution.
<P>
	On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly 
unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
This marked the turning of an important page in the history of 
mankind.
<P>
	Indeed, the horrors of the second world war greatly contributed 
to raising world awareness and truly expanding the concept of 
human rights. As early as June 1945, the United Nations Charter 
and the statutes of the International Court of Justice were ratified in 
San Francisco. The following year, the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Commission on the Status of Women were created.
<P>
	Finally, after adopting the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the UN passed the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights which we are celebrating today.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	Since then, there has been continuous progress in terms of 
respect for basic individual rights almost everywhere in the world. 
I say ``almost'' because, unfortunately, in certain areas of the 
globe, there is still a great deal of progress to be made.
<P>
	Right from the start, in order to better ensure respect for basic 
human rights, and to promote their implementation, the UN 
decided to set international standards, protect human rights and 
provide technical support where needed. In order to attain these 
objectives, however, the United Nations Organization had to draw 
up clear rules relating to human rights, hence the necessity of 
adopting this Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>
	This universal declaration may be the keystone of United 
Nations declarations on human rights, but it is not the only one. In 
fact, the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development, and the 
1992 Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance strengthened the United Nations' moral 
interventions.
<P>
	It is, moreover, important to keep in mind that all of these 
declarations are not legally binding, and that the UN, lacking a real 
United Nations military force, performs more of an international 
ombudsman role.
<P>
	Fortunately, on the other hand, the international conventions and 
covenants have force of law in the states ratifying them. The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
both drafted in 1966, are highly binding on signatories.
<P>
	International conventions, on the other hand, focus on more 
specific attacks against human dignity such as the 1969 convention 
on racial discrimination, the 1981 convention on discrimination 
against women, the 1987 convention on cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment, and finally the 1990 UN convention on the 
rights of the child.
<P>
	All these measures have achieved concrete results such as stays 
of execution, the release and medical care of prisoners, and 
sometimes even a complete overhaul of legal systems emphasizing 
the importance of human rights.
<P>
	For instance, Bulgaria, Malawi and Mongolia recently received 
assistance in drafting a new constitution and new legislation, both 
conforming to the conventions on human rights.
<P>
	Even more recently, in 1993, the UN General Assembly adopted 
a resolution creating the position of High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, whose duties consist in preventing and managing 
crises, sometimes by providing technical assistance to states in 
transition and co-ordinating interventions aimed at promoting 
fundamental rights.
<P>
	As we can see, we have come a long way over the years in our 
respect for human rights, and we should proudly emphasize events 
like the one that brought us here today. The future celebrations 
around the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights should be more than just that. This great event should not be 
just another occasion for organizing huge banquets, cocktail 
parties, receptions and shows for the benefit of venerable 
dignitaries the world over.
<P>
	We are all familiar with the propensity of our leaders to slap each 
other on the back as a sign of satisfaction and to congratulate each 
other while singing the praises of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. It will be available in pocket format, as a poster 
either laminated or beautifully framed in acrylic, and it will be seen 
at its best. People will shout that they love it, they venerate it, and 
they will very pompously wish it a very happy 50th birthday.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7351"> 7351 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	But for thousands of victims of torture and summary 
imprisonment by unscrupulous governments, this anniversary will 
not be a joyous occasion. In fact, for all these people, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights remains nothing more than a hope 
based on the action of countries, which, like Canada, protect 
fundamental rights and might have some influence on the leaders 
of those countries that still refuse to do so.
<P>
	Often, this declaration is universal in name only. There was 
nothing universal about it when the Government of China decided 
to crush the student movement for freedom in Tiananmen Square 
barely a few years ago.
<P>
	There is nothing universal about it for the victims of oppression 
in East Timor or for the children exploited in India or for the 
political prisoners in Indonesia or for the demonstrators in 
Belgrade and other major Serbian cities.
<P>
	Canada has an important role to play in this area. We must 
develop a policy of international trade that includes respect for 
human rights. We can no longer simply close our eyes to these 
atrocities in the name of profit. We must make it known to the 
entire international community that Canada will make no human 
rights compromises out of a need to trade with these countries. Is it 
not both deplorable and embarrassing when the Prime Minister of 
Canada signs lucrative trade agreements with countries heavily 
criticized by Amnesty International without any mention 
whatsoever of human rights?
<P>
	I might point out that barely a few years ago, when the whole 
world knew that the communist regime in Romania was 
systematically ignoring the fundamental rights of its citizens, 
Canada welcomed its dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, with open arms 
and great pomp. Madam Speaker, I will conclude, if I may have one 
minute. I would not like this situation repeated.
<P>
	In conclusion, we must continue to promote basic freedoms 
wherever necessary. We will stop the day the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights is truly what it is supposed to be: universal. The 
whole world will have achieved its goal: peaceful co-existence of 
peoples and respect for human dignity. Are we dreaming?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder if you could enlighten us about whether there is a question 
period following the interventions, please.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead have unanimous 
consent to share a limited 20 minutes of his usually unlimited time 
with his colleague from Mercier? There are no questions on this 20 
minutes. After the next member's speech we will enter into 
questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with a feeling of honour, pride and great responsibility that I rise to 
speak on this extremely important issue. Of course, we are 
celebrating the 48th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.
<P>
	I need hardly remind anyone that the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights came about because of the 
atrocities committed during World War II, and that, coupled with 
the social movement that had existed prior to that time, these 
terrible wars forced, and indeed helped nations to adopt 
unanimously in 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	Having armed itself with the means, the UN was able to begin 
protecting human rights, and it continues to offer assistance and 
experience to states that want to advance the cause of human rights 
and freedoms.
<P>
	In addition to being a specific instrument of the UN, this 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights was also a rallying point 
for all people, all groups in different countries suffering injustices 
of all sorts, to help them continue their struggle and call for justice, 
sometimes when they did not have a voice.
<P>
	Through its efforts, the UN obtained concrete results, as my 
colleague pointed out. Releases, stays of execution, improvement 
in prisoners' living conditions, and input into the domestic 
legislation of certain countries are examples of what the 
international community can achieve by bringing pressure to bear. 
We can only rejoice. It is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	However, I would like to say that the situation is not so rosy that 
we can afford to sit on our laurels. As we know, not only are human 
rights violations still taking place openly and publicly throughout 
the world, but we must sadly point out that, depending on the 
location, and sometimes the nature, of the conflict, the 
international community does not always react in the same manner.
<P>
	It must be acknowledged, in fact, that the international 
community did not react to the invasion of Kuwait in the same way 
it reacted more recently to the situations in Burundi, Zaire, Bosnia, 
Tibet and Indonesia. One may wonder what made such a difference 
that, in one case, an extraordinary military force could be drawn 
up, while in others not even a minimal force could be assembled, 
and millions of innocent victims were left to not only live through 
the war, but to suffer-as civilians, which is what they generally 
are nowadays-the horrific aftermath of war.
<P>
	We are living in a world where we are assailed daily with images 
so horrific that they ought to convince us to do everything in our 
power to defend human rights. Yet, as we know, we continue to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7352"> 7352 </A></B>
<P>
view those images and to carry on living our calm and tranquil 
lives, while sometimes taking a voyeuristic interest in the suffering 
that is going on elsewhere. One might say that the duty to intervene 
varies in intensity, depending on the place involved.
<P>
	The great powers are not interested, either, in insisting with 
equal vigour, regardless of the location, that human rights be 
respected. It cannot be denied that economic and financial interests 
play an extremely important role.
<P>
	Recently and most tragically, western Europe was unable, or 
claimed it was unable, to help resolve the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
<P>
	One might say that, if the will of the international community is 
truly there, it is high time it gave itself a reliable means of ensuring 
the protection of civilians during conflicts, as well as a permanent 
means of intervening, no longer just to maintain peace, but to 
restore it.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	We know that many countries are discussing this question. We 
know that Canada, pushed by the official opposition, has made 
concrete proposals and has struggled to advance the idea, which is 
supported by the former Secretary General of the United Nations, 
of having a permanent force in a position to step in when it deems 
necessary.
<P>
	More consistency is needed in the actions of the international 
community, and efforts must be made to do away with this justice 
which is really not justice, this double standard, which considers 
some dreadful situations more dreadful than others, and which 
mobilizes the international community over some cases and not 
others.
<P>
	I can only vigorously underscore that, in the effort to find 
support for all those who suffer and specific ways Canada and other 
countries so wishing may help these people and groups in countries 
where human rights are not respected, there must be no trade 
relations independently of international involvement in the respect 
of human rights.
<P>
	In this regard, Team Canada provided a very poor example and 
confirmed the Prime Minister's oft repeated statement that trade 
relations for Canada would now be dictated by ``business as 
usual'', and this is what characterizes relations with countries 
known worldwide not to respect human rights. Team Canada 
brought no honour to Canada in this regard.
<P>
	The official opposition will continue to urge the government to 
bear in mind that it cannot continue to have close, warm and 
lucrative trade relations with countries that do not respect human 
rights, while continuing to boast about being responsible and being 
a  leader in the respect of human rights. I feel obliged to state this 
fact here, this evening, and my colleagues will confirm it in the 
coming minutes.
<P>
	On the eve of the 50th anniversary, we must see the horror of the 
international situation in order to decide to take the next step in 
organizing solid support for the respect of human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, I simply want to point out to you 
and to this House that the members of the government will now 
share their time. Therefore, instead of 20-minute speeches, we will 
have 10-minute speeches followed by 5 minutes of questions and 
comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am splitting my time with the member for Red Deer.
<P>
	I am pleased tonight to be able to speak to the commemoration 
of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both to reflect 
on its helpfulness in providing guidelines for national institutions 
and specific human rights issues as well as to call on the Canadian 
government to account for the steady erosion of these principles in 
public policy today.
<P>
	Forty-eight years ago the world, having endured two world wars, 
one which threatened the global with the spectre of fascism, called 
on its leaders to commit to a fundamental standard of responsibility 
toward both their own citizens and to people around the world.
<P>
<B>(1940 )</B>
<P>
	Forty-eight years ago the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights was born to form the basis of many national human rights 
acts. In 1976 it was coupled with the international covenant of 
economic, social and cultural rights, the international covenant on 
civil and political rights and the optional protocol to the latter 
covenant, to become the international bill of human rights.
<P>
	The declaration has much to commend it. It has been used to 
protect many vulnerable Canadians. It has been used not only to 
direct public policy but also to remind individual Canadians in 
their own private relationships about their responsibility to respect 
others. It has been used to frame policy which has made Canada a 
safe haven for those who have fled from oppression and almost 
certain death in their own country.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as each day passes it becomes more and more 
evident that Canada has lost its commitment to the essence of the 
human rights debate, the recognition of the inherent dignity and of 
the equal and unalienable rights of all members of the human 
family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. 
With the loss of the vision it has also lost its commitment to our 
fundamental institutions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7353"> 7353 </A></B>
<P>
	In my brief time tonight I want to reflect on three issues, the 
lack of protection for existing basic human rights, the evolution 
of the broader interpretation of rights, with their infringement on 
existing rights and basic institutions, and the denial of the full 
equality of Canadians.
<P>
	First I want to talk about the erosion of our protections. There 
have been many UN conferences in the past few years on a wide 
range of issues, from population to habitat, from women to the 
environment. It has become clear that special interests dictate the 
agenda, not those representing the main concerns of many 
countries.
<P>
	The UN process is not democratic, in violation of the universal 
declaration's affirmation of the importance of democracy. 
Certainly in Canada there is no accountability to Parliament to 
ensure that delegates accurately reflect the views of our country.
<P>
	My own experience at the Beijing conference on women showed 
me how developed countries, including and especially Canada, 
trampled the human rights of delegates from other countries as well 
as those of Canadians. When they are advancing narrow special 
interests, the commitment made to the most basic of human rights 
like the freedom of opinion, conscience and religion found in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights do not matter.
<P>
	I read into the record last week a statement from the official 
Canadian facilitating committee report. It specifically advised 
Canadians to criticize the opinions of Muslims, Catholics, pro-life 
groups and REAL Women. This kind of intolerance, which is 
condemned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, appears 
to have become standard policy among Canadian delegations to 
UN conferences over the past few years.
<P>
	Even more disturbing is the way countries like Canada use the 
UN to lever legislative change in Canada as well as in the domestic 
policies of developing countries, contrary to the democratic 
process. An example of the influence of the UN policy is in the 
guise of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which seeks 
to broaden children's rights at the expense of family and parental 
autonomy.
<P>
	The most significant institution recognized in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the broader international 
bill of human rights is the family as the natural and fundamental 
group unit of society. Yet astonishingly this is one of the sections 
which is most ignored by the federal government today.
<P>
	The international covenant on economic, social and cultural 
rights in article 10 states that the widest possible protection and 
assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural 
and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its 
establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education 
of dependant children.
<P>
	The international covenant on civil and political rights, in article 
23, says that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of 
society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.
<P>
	The framers of these documents recognized that the family was 
the key social institution for effectively realizing all other rights 
that are mentioned.
<P>
	The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is being used to 
eliminate parental freedom and responsibility in child discipline 
through its demand that Canada repeal section 43 of the Criminal 
Code. Despite the strong majority view in Canada that the 
discipline of children should be the prerogative of parents, the UN 
has demanded that Canada repeal the protection for parents who 
choose to use responsible corporal punishment.
<P>
<B>(1945 )</B>
<P>
	The fact that such a demand comes not through democratic 
process but by way of an international body does not seem to 
matter. The fact that it attacks the autonomy of parents and, 
therefore, the UN's human rights commitment to the family seems 
to be irrelevant. The fact that such a decision has ramifications for 
the freedoms of religion, opinion and conscience which are 
protected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not 
appear to matter.
<P>
	Canada's leading anti-corporal punishment group, the Repeal 43 
Committee said that: ``Freedom of religious belief does not include 
the freedom to engage in practices that threaten health and safety,'' 
yet there is no evidence to defend its link between responsible 
corporal punishment and health and safety.
<P>
	Reform supports the original understanding of human rights as 
they apply to children, that is protection rights which obligate us to 
make the health and well-being of children a priority by combating 
abuse and seeking their best interests in situations such as family 
break-up.
<P>
	But in the same Beijing document I cited earlier we can read the 
following: ``Human rights activists applauded a Canadian 
breakthrough that recognizes children's evolving rights to make 
their own decisions even though the issue pits a child's right to 
learn about issues against the right of parents to prevent access to 
subjects in which they do not believe''.
<P>
	The new notion that legitimate protection rights should be 
expanded to include what could be termed choice rights for 
children denies the autonomy and importance of parenting and the 
family. Despite the problems associated with giving children the 
freedom to make choices they are not ready to make, and despite 
the opposition of most Canadian parents toward this idea, Canada 
has been advancing this ideology domestically and on the 
international stage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7354"> 7354 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, another violation of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights is the system of special rights that has contaminated 
almost very sphere of public policy in this nation.
<P>
	The Reform Party has told Canadians clearly in our fresh start 
election platform that we support the repeal of section 15(2) of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which provides for the 
establishment of discriminatory treatment of Canadians based on 
sex, race, ethnic origin, family status and other irrelevant 
characteristics. Untold destructive policies have been introduced in 
Canada and justified by this mentality: employment equity, official 
bilingualism, official multiculturalism, the ongoing paternalism 
toward out native population and divisive immigration policies.
<P>
	It is astounding that in 48 years, almost half a century, the 
Canadian government has lost its commitment to true equality and 
the dignity of every human being.
<P>
	In conclusion, those who constructed the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights had noble intentions. They worked hard and 
produced a commendable document. Unfortunately, while 
bureaucrats and governments have been busy redefining and 
massaging the message to their own ends, here in Canada and 
elsewhere real human rights abuses still exist.
<P>
	There are many around the world who face death each day as 
they take a stand for the most basic of human rights. The spirit and 
letter of the universal declaration supports their cause and calls on 
the world to respond. There is much to be done at home and abroad 
to honour our 1948 commitment. Let us never lose sight of its 
original intent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in listening to the debate, the 
member forgot to even remember a recent happening in the world 
when the world thanked Canada as a people for asserting our 
collective conscience once more.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister, through his leadership moved the United 
Nations to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Zaire. We 
should continue to remember that, for the essence of human rights 
is about the integrity of any one person which if violated destroys 
the essence of our humanity and the soul of any nation. When the 
Prime Minister took that action, we should not lose sight of that 
very caring and creative leadership. It is fitting to be able to 
comment on this on such a special day of debate devoted to human 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	An ancient Chinese proverb said: ``A journey of 1,000 miles 
must begin with a single step''. The first step in the journey to 
make human rights the acid test of any civilization was taken when 
the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948. Nearly 50 
years ago, on  December 10, the conscience of mankind said never 
again: never again to the disregard and contempt for human rights 
which resulted in the Buchenwalds of that time; never again to all 
the death camps and the dictators who marched people into slavery; 
never again to all those barbarous acts which provoked and killed 
an entire wartime generation.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister took that step, the member from the 
Reform Party should have taken pride in that step. The men and 
women of that time took the first step in Paris knowing full well 
that the journey ahead of them was long and full of danger. In 
taking that first step, the assembly of citizens of the world, men and 
women, turned a corner in the course of world history. Henceforth 
there shall be a world in which human beings will have freedom of 
speech, freedom of belief, freedom from want and freedom from 
fear.
<P>
	Today, in 1996, when we look back to the idealism of those early 
defenders of human rights we see that the record is very mixed 
indeed. I would like to call hon. member's attention to the 
international tribunals which have been frustrated in their attempts 
to prosecute those same dictators who, at a different time, had 
marched Bosnians, Haitians, Somalians and Rwandans into times 
of barbarisms unmatched in human history.
<P>
	We must remember the leadership taken by the Prime Minister. 
On this day we look at all the violence of unrestrained ethnic and 
racial conflict across the planet. We look at the unconscionable 
social and economic inequities which in our time are growing. 
However, let me say that the fundamental rights of humanity are 
not just civil and political rights but critical to these rights are our 
civilian societies in the mature western democracies.
<P>
	I agree with the member that human rights have as much to do 
with the right to medical care as it does to the right to vote. Human 
rights have as much to do with having a roof over one's head as it 
does with privacy. Human rights have as much to do with children 
in poverty as it does with the brave and courageous individuals 
around the world who fight for freedom in countries where 
intimidation, fear and oppression are daily realities.
<P>
	In commenting on this debate, we must look at the question of 
human rights in this perspective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to take the second half of my fellow member's time and to 
again remember December 10, 1948, the conference on human 
rights and the statement made at that time.
<P>
	Human rights is something that hopefully every single one of us 
as Canadians feel strongly about and are concerned about. I am 
sure we could talk about it in many different ways. What I intend to 
do tonight is concentrate primarily on the international aspects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7355"> 7355 </A></B>
<P>
	Each and every day my office receives a great many letters from 
across the country appealing to the government to do more about 
human rights. I suggest that many Canadians who have written 
those letters feel that the current government has done a poor job 
in many areas of human rights.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	In much of the current debate a false dichotomy has developed. 
On one hand, many human rights activists argue that Canada 
should completely cut off countries with abusive governments. 
They argue that we should not trade with them, that we should 
publicly condemn them and that we should isolate them. On the 
other hand, the government has taken the approach of cosying up to 
at least 99 per cent of the dictators, of being their best buddy and of 
saving its outrage and contempt for the other 1 per cent to make it 
look like it actually cares. Neither of these approaches achieves the 
goal that most Canadians want.
<P>
	From speaking to Canadians I believe they want government 
policy to accomplish several things. First they want Canada to help 
people who live under abusive regimes in the most constructive 
way possible. In order to help people, Canada must have a presence 
in the affected country. Canada has a lot of experience in building 
legal and democratic institutions in the developing world. This is 
an important feature of Canada's current foreign aid program.
<P>
	That is why Reform supports this process which includes things 
such as monitoring elections to make sure they are free and fair; 
providing legal expertise to reform the court systems; and 
providing training for police so they will serve and protect rather 
than intimidate and bully their populations. It is our hope that 
through this type of policy we can help the people in the developing 
world to establish democratic and legal institutions that ordinary 
people trust.
<P>
	Reform also supports working with non-governmental 
organizations and the private sector to build civil societies in 
developing countries. With this policy Canada will be able to help 
people in the developing world to help themselves to a better 
future. As social and business groups emerge as legitimate political 
forces in developing countries, they will be able to assert 
themselves and work against corrupt and abusive governments.
<P>
	Reform also sees international trade as a source of hope for 
people in developing countries. Certainly there is an intense debate 
surrounding this point but I believe supporting human rights 
through various programs and reforms will mean little if the people 
we are trying to help continue to live in absolute poverty and 
destitution.
<P>
	International trade creates jobs and incomes for millions and 
millions of people who would otherwise have nothing. This is not 
to say that wages are always at an acceptable level. It is not to say 
that the workplace  conditions are what we would expect here in 
Canada. But if we ask the question, would the people living in 
abusive countries be better off or worse off if Canada and other 
developed countries refused to trade with them, I believe the 
answer is clear.
<P>
	In the political debate in Canada, Reform has consistently argued 
that the best kind of welfare program is a job. If this is true in 
Canada where we have a whole social safety net which includes 
free health care, employment insurance, old age security, welfare 
and a host of other programs for our citizens, then it is doubly true 
in countries where no such programs exist.
<P>
	For all of the reasons I have mentioned: providing jobs, assisting 
in democratic institutions and building and reforming corrupt legal 
systems, Canada should not choose the path of isolation. Even 
though cutting countries off would be a strong symbolic statement, 
I do not think it is the best way to help those people who 
desperately need our assistance.
<P>
<B>(2000 )</B>
<P>
	Nonetheless, neither should the Canadian Prime Minister be best 
buddies with foreign leaders who reject democracy and frequently 
run corrupt and abusive regimes. This sends out all the wrong 
messages. I believe this is where the current government and our 
Prime Minister have failed.
<P>
	It must be clear to Canadians that our government is not 
condoning the kind of massive repression and abuse that frequently 
takes place around the world. Unfortunately it is not clear. In fact 
many Canadians have written me to complain bitterly about the 
behaviour of the Prime Minister. They believe he has callously 
ignored human rights abuses in his foreign travels and this has left 
them outraged.
<P>
	This reminds me of a highly ironic point. Just over a month ago 
the Prime Minister attacked me and the leader of the Reform Party 
for having met with the U.S. speaker of the house of 
representatives, Newt Gingrich. He was shocked and outraged. It 
seems the Prime Minister believes that Reform should not meet 
with the democratically elected leaders of our closest ally, the U.S., 
but it is a demonstration of true Liberal Party leadership when the 
Prime Minister befriends dictators all the time.
<P>
	In fact I would not even be surprised if we find the Prime 
Minister golfing with Saddam Hussein over the Christmas break. 
How many people commented about the Prime Minister dancing 
with the Prime Minister of China and some of his past history? Or 
how about embracing Mr. Castro and some of the abuses there? I 
have been in some of the jails in Cuba and have looked at them and 
have seen the human rights abuses in that country.
<P>
	My point is that while Reform does not advocate isolation, we do 
reject the government's shameless  pandering to foreign dictators. 
We reject it and so does the Canadian public. It is for this reason 
that at the last Reform Party assembly in Vancouver our 
membership voted overwhelmingly, over 90 per cent, to oppose 
federal government foreign aid to governments which suppress 
basic human rights. That is the commitment our party has made 
and we will follow through on it when we form the next 
government. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7356"> 7356 </A></B>
<P>
Reform will end the Liberal government's practice of giving 
handouts to abusive regimes.
<P>
	In the future Canada must provide an example to the world. We 
should use our foreign aid program to constructively promote 
democratic and legal reforms. We should encourage expanded 
trade to generate jobs in developing countries, but we should make 
it perfectly clear that the systematic abuse of human rights is 
unacceptable. We should voice our concerns and cut off aid to those 
who reject freedom and ignore human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
ask the hon. member a question but before doing so I thank him for 
an interesting address.
<P>
	Has he considered the relationship between human rights under 
the universal declaration and under national constitutional law.
<P>
	He will know of course that in the actual drafting of the UN 
document Canadians played a very large role, but still it is a 
different document from the charters we have been used to in the 
common law world. It is designed for legislators. Ours is designed, 
the American bill is designed and western bills are generally 
designed for judges and judge made law. Still our own charter of 
rights and freedoms borrowed from the universal declaration in its 
drafting.
<P>
	Has he considered the correlation between the universal 
declaration and its enforcement and a national charter such as ours 
and its enforcement? Is it the obligation, in his view, of national 
legislators to bring national law in line with the universal 
declaration?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I cannot give a legal 
answer to that question.
<P>
	My honoured colleague obviously is an expert in international 
law and constitutional law. I respect him for that.
<P>
	I would say that when it comes to human rights it comes more to 
the point of common sense, not the sorts of things where we could 
get hung up in a court of law, in international courts, where we 
could debate it for years on end.
<P>
<B>(2005 )</B>
<P>
	It reminds me of the couple of monks in a monastery back in the 
17th century who debated for 100 years whether or not angels have 
wings. The debate went on for 100 years and at the end of the time, 
they came to a conclusion. Their conclusion was that some angels 
do and some angels do not. That is what happens when we get too 
hung up in the legal ramifications.
<P>
	I would say in answer to the hon. member's question that the role 
of Canada is to show leadership. Through our Constitution, which I 
believe does give equality to all within the law, that is what we 
should try to achieve on an international basis. The closer we come 
to achieving that, the better this world is going to be for the human 
beings living in it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am honoured to be able to 
participate in this very special debate to raise awareness of the 
upcoming 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.
<P>
	My portfolio as Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and the 
Status of Women deals specifically with human rights, the rights of 
women and minority groups to have an equal place in the 
economic, social and political life of this country.
<P>
	The difficulties facing many Canadians, women and men, are 
rooted in inequality, in gender and in ethnic socialization and 
outmoded customs, attitudes and practices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The activities related to the two components of my mandate, the 
status of women and multiculturalism, are closely linked and are 
also complementary. The purpose of both components is to ensure 
that all Canadians avail themselves of their right to equality and 
realize that human rights are sacred.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Government of Canada is deeply committed to the 
realization of women's rights as human rights. Human rights relate 
to every aspect of people's lives, be they male or female. Human 
rights speak to the ability of people to live, to work, to play, to 
worship, to be safe from societal harm and to contribute fully to the 
social, economic and political life of their nation.
<P>
	Respecting human rights means promoting choices, 
opportunities, equality and fairness. Women cannot assert 
themselves effectively nor can their human rights be respected 
when their economic base and their social status are not as secure 
as those of men or when the integrity of the person is still subjected 
to rape and to violence.
<P>
	Our blueprint for action to the year 2000 is the 1995 federal plan 
for gender equality, a comprehensive plan of federal government 
initiatives to advance women's equality. As well, Canadians, 
whether they be disabled, aboriginal or gay and lesbian, who face 
the barriers to social and economic equality because of racism and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7357"> 7357 </A></B>
<P>
discrimination miss out on opportunities to contribute to  society, a 
society in which we all have a share in building or destroying. The 
choice is ours. When we do not respect others because of their 
differences or respect their rights to make basic choices, we create 
a society that is bound for destruction.
<P>
	To work for the full implementation of human rights is to strive 
for a democratic ideal. This in itself should be incentive enough for 
Canadians to promote the full realization of human rights. But if it 
is not, there is a second and more pragmatic argument to persuade 
Canadians to demand the full observance of human rights in our 
country. We must improve the lives of women, aboriginal peoples 
and Canadians of all ethnocultural origins and as we do so, the 
social and economic life of the nation will benefit as a whole. As 
we respect each other's equal rights, we create a social structure 
based on respect, on accommodation and therefore on finding 
peaceful resolutions to conflict.
<P>
	These are not the worst of times, but neither are they the very 
best of times. We still live in a society here in Canada where there 
are those in this country and in this Parliament who would deny 
jobs to persons because of their race or their sexual orientation, 
who say that in order to foster equity we must treat everyone the 
same. On a very practical level Canada cannot afford to have or to 
deny even a few of its citizens an opportunity to contribute as fully 
as possible to the economic, political, cultural and social life of the 
nation.
<P>
<B>(2010)</B>
<P>
	We only have to look at nations of the world where there is 
ethnic cleansing, intolerance and denial of equal opportunity to see 
that people will not for long stand to be oppressed. They will rise in 
anger and with violence to assert their right to the basic human 
freedoms to achieve their individual potential.
<P>
	Canada must ensure that human rights are given more than just 
lip service here in our territory because the world looks to us for 
leadership on the international stage, to show by example, to assist 
in encouraging and building democratic processes. By isolating 
those who do not conform to our ideals, we lose the very important 
opportunity to teach and to inform.
<P>
	As a signatory to a number of instruments that have been 
developed to protect and promote human rights, Canada has an 
obligation to assist when and where we are able in carrying out an 
international mandate, but also to ensure that we practice here at 
home what we preach.
<P>
	Behind all of our human rights activities at home and abroad is 
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
adopted in 1948. In the aftermath of the horrors of the second world 
war, Canada worked for change to create a world where fascism 
and totalitarianism could not survive, a world where peace could 
become a reality, a world where individuals were free to live 
productive and fulfilling lives according to their own ability.
<P>
	We have been working hard in the field of human rights, both 
domestically and internationally, and there is firm evidence of our 
progress. In Canada we have the charter of rights and freedoms 
which guarantees all Canadians equal protection and equal benefit 
of the law. Women's equality rights were enshrined in the charter in 
1985. We have a Canadian Human Rights Commission where all 
can seek justice and ensure equality.
<P>
	We have the court challenges program which allows access to 
disadvantaged groups and individuals so that they can put forward 
selected cases of national significance on language and equality 
rights. We have the world's first multiculturalism act and we are 
working to build a multifaceted strategy to address violence against 
women and children. Treasury Board recently agreed that a number 
of federal government spousal benefits should apply to same sex 
couples.
<P>
	In October I was very pleased to honour our government's red 
book commitment to launch the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation. This foundation will facilitate the development, 
sharing and application of knowledge and expertise to contribute to 
the elimination of racism and all forms of racial discrimination in 
Canada.
<P>
	We are world leaders in advancing women's rights globally, 
particularly with respect to violence against women and children. 
At the 1995 United Nations world conference on women in Beijing, 
women's human rights formed the cornerstone of Canada's 
position. In Stockholm, Canada pledged to do all in its power to 
end the commercial sexual exploitation of children and implement 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
	Through the Canadian International Development Agency, 
CIDA, Canada has long supported international women's rights 
organizations and developed gender sensitive programs to assist 
women in achieving their economic potential in developing 
countries. We have also supported organizations such as the 
Asia-Pacific Forum on Women and Women in Law and 
Development in Africa. We are the first country to create gender 
discrimination as a criteria for refugee status.
<P>
	We are moving forward, but the job is not yet done. If we can 
envision our ideal, then we can believe in its reality, a reality that 
seeks to foster equality by treating people differently and by using 
different strategies to do so. With a strong enough belief and hard 
work to back it up, we can realistically hope to achieve our ideal 
which is to keep that belief strong and our incentives fresh.
<P>
	We need occasions to remind us of the worth of what we do. 
Such an occasion is the 50th anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. I urge everyone in this House to use 
this day and this time to recognize  the importance of serving each 
other and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7358"> 7358 </A></B>
<P>
permitting each other to live with equal opportunity in this very 
great country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we are approaching the 50th year of the magna carta of 
human kind. When the United Nations General Assembly adopted 
this magna carta, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on 
December 10, 1948, United Nation member states committed 
themselves to recognize the inherent dignity of the equal and 
inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the 
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	I want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, for agreeing to launch on this day this 
important debate. I would encourage all people to think about these 
matters over the coming year and plan some activity to celebrate 
next year's 50th anniversary.
<P>
	I also wish to express appreciation to the Hon. Walter McLean, a 
colleague of this House for many years, a secretary of state 
himself, who has been very instrumental in raising all these issues 
and talking about the importance of planning ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This declaration was a powerful idea that inspired us. It 
recognized that we all have rights as human beings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is not because we inhabit a particular country, are the 
product of a particular class, of a particular group or the product of 
a particular ethnic background; it is because we exist as human 
beings.
<P>
	This declaration was drafted by a really fine Canadian. I am glad 
that my colleague in the Bloc noted this in his remarks. I know that 
the family of John Humphrey and John Humphrey himself would 
have been very proud of this day. Unfortunately, he passed away 
last year. He lived in the Mount Royal riding and he and Eleanor 
Roosevelt were the key drafters of this declaration of human rights. 
Although most of his fellow citizens might not even recognize this 
great Canadian's name, his achievement has an ongoing impact on 
the functioning of our governments and, as a result, on the way that 
each and every one of us conducts our lives.
<P>
	The universal declaration revolutionized international law by 
enshrining the principle that the international community has an 
abiding and important interest in the fundamental rights of all 
human beings. It established the framework for the international 
recognition of the rights of human kind.
<P>
	In the 50 years that followed the United Nations put into place 
covenants, principles and monitoring activities which all 
demonstrate a fundamental international  agreement to recognize 
different aspects of the indivisible, inalienable and fundamental 
rights of individuals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the ensuing 50 years, and I feel I must repeat this, the 
United Nations adopted conventions, principles and control 
mechanisms which all reflect this strong desire on the part of the 
international community to recognize all aspects of the indivisible, 
inalienable and fundamental rights of the individual.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The principles, the goals and the fine phrases have been put on 
paper and agreed to. Now what?
<P>
	To no one's surprise, when we look at how the international 
human rights system actually functions, we confront a paradox. 
Many of the ringing statements of principle in the universal 
declaration and various covenants are honoured more in the breach 
than in observance.
<P>
	The United Nations human rights system is a patchwork. The 
monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are imperfect. Too often 
the politicians, the bureaucrats and diplomats natter on and on 
about what is wrong and how to improve things, but it is often too 
little and too late. It is a very slow process.
<P>
	I heard the secretary of state a few moments ago allude to the 
fact that in Beijing we had to reaffirm the fact that women's rights 
are human rights, inalienable, et cetera. It was quite a critique on 
the state of the world, although let us not despair.
<P>
	What about the people? We have all read about the Holocaust, 
which is now called the Shoa. We know about racism, fascism and 
intolerance. What have we learned? Have we learned very much?
<P>
	All we have to do is turn on our television to see the horrors of 
Cambodia, ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and mass 
killings in Rwanda. It is no wonder that when we did our television 
study children find that the most terrifying thing on TV is the daily 
news. The world is still struggling with ethnic, cultural and 
religious differences. How to accept and live as equals peacefully 
and respectfully is still the challenge to meet.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	Other people at risk, with disadvantages to overcome are the 
disabled. They are still among the poorest and rank at the bottom or 
the end of the queue to receive services and remain the most 
marginalized and vulnerable group in this world.
<P>
	Then we must complete the circle, for there is hope, a light 
shining to mark the way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7359"> 7359 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, we are still guided in our actions by hope, because 
without the Universal Declaration and the other UN conventions, 
we would have no landmarks, so to speak.
<P>
	The peoples and nations of the world and their governments 
would be disoriented, without purpose, without standards, without 
ways to measure their progress or to know what they did right or 
what they did wrong.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	So this brings us to that ultimate recognition. I would say that 
domestically we have moved ahead, that the UN's involvement in 
human rights has become part of the evolving process, a kind of 
perpetual motion machine. In the half century since the adoption of 
the universal declaration internationally accepted values have 
shifted and goals as well as programs have moved forward, in large 
part pushed by the very existence of these United Nations 
declarations of human rights principles.
<P>
	Domestically, Canada confronts the same paradox. The 
principles of fundamental human rights for Canadians are well 
entrenched here. We have cause to be proud of section 15 of our 
charter of rights and freedoms. We have cause for pride in other 
aspects of our charter; the recognition of human rights in the basic 
constitutional fabric of this country.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act assures protection against 
discrimination in areas within federal jurisdiction. The language of 
human rights and of inclusiveness is spoken everywhere 
throughout Canada, in all our provinces and no more or no less, 
might I say, than in my own province of Quebec, which passed the 
first human rights act in Canada in 1977.
<P>
	Like the United Nations, Canada has ways of monitoring 
compliance with human rights standards. The supreme court, of 
course, is one and the most important, but there is as well the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission. The standing committee 
that I have the privilege to chair is another. We may be different 
singers but we sing the same tune.
<P>
	Progress has been made, no doubt about it. But why does this 
paradox, the difference between principle and practice, continue to 
confront us so starkly even here in our own country? I would say 
that the perpetual motion machine I spoke about earlier comes into 
the picture in Canada too, just like at the international level.
<P>
	The acknowledgement of human rights in Canadian laws and 
institutions has fostered an environment where awareness of rights 
has promoted awareness of practices. The awareness of practice 
has promoted awareness of flaws, and awareness of flaws has 
promoted demands for change. And while changes have been 
made, more needs  need to be address. The goal remains the same 
but the distance between the players and the goal posts has widened 
and so we have to become even more vigilant.
<P>
	In the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Disabled Persons we have become very aware that we need to keep 
the gap from widening even more. As we develop and apply new 
technologies we must keep in mind that all of us, knowingly or 
unwittingly, attach social values and responsibilities to 
technological developments.
<P>
	Take the debate over new technologies right now and their 
implications for privacy, which is a human right. We have been 
looking at new physical and biological surveillance techniques and 
personal identification practices, including new ways of testing an 
individual's genetic make-up. We have become aware of the 
tension between progress and rights and why it is so crucial to 
protect privacy in the face of new technology.
<P>
<B>(2025 )</B>
<P>
	Supreme Court Justice LaForest said in a 1990 decision: ``The 
limits of our personal privacy define in large part the measure and 
the limits of our freedom. Not to be compelled to share our 
confidences with others is the very hallmark of a free society. That 
is where we hope human rights is headed''.
<P>
	We know there is no ultimate answer in finding the balance 
between an individual's right to privacy and society's broader 
requirements. Defining human rights is a constant process of 
evolution, just as our Canadian federation is constantly evolving, 
particularly when balancing rights against social policy.
<P>
	In order to build equality into the fabric of our society we have to 
take a positive approach that goes beyond using the courts to deal 
with abuses. Recognition of fundamental human rights is essential 
for individuals to develop a sense of belonging, a sense of equality 
and a sense of the rights and obligations of citizenship.
<P>
	A true economic and social democracy, like the one I believe 
Canada must keep striving for, has to build equality and justice into 
every aspect of every human relationship. We must never lose sight 
of that goal. We must intensify and strengthen our message. That is 
the reason we must emphasize the importance of marking the 50th 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 
December 10, 1998; plan now, act later.
<P>
	As the drafters of the charter did almost 50 years ago, we must 
use the concepts of human rights to point the way to ongoing 
respect for each other as human beings. We can move toward our 
vision of equality but we can do this only together for the full 
enjoyment of our lives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We can do it together to more fully experience justice, peace and 
freedom.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
share my time with the hon. member for Louis-Hébert.
<P>
	I appreciate this opportunity today to draw your attention to 
World Human Rights Day. The world has undergone profound 
changes since the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, whose 48th anniversary we celebrate on this 10th of 
December.
<P>
	During those past 50 years, considerable progress has been 
made. In recent years, humanity put an end to a number of 
dictatorships, including the hated apartheid regime in South Africa, 
which gave new hope to the entire African continent.
<P>
	In 1989, we saw the Berlin wall, that symbol of the cold war, 
collapse, and we also saw major changes taking place in the 
countries of eastern Europe. The rivalry between the two great 
blocks has ended.
<P>
	The issue of human rights was officially mentioned at the 
beginning of this century in the Pact of the League of Nations 
which, among other things, led to the creation of the ILO and the 
United Nations Organization. The UN preparatory commission, 
which met in 1945 immediately after the closing session of the San 
Francisco conference, recommended creating a commission to 
promote human rights as defined in section 68 of the Charter.
<P>
	Finally, the draft declaration was submitted, through the 
Economic and Social Council, to the General Assembly meeting in 
Paris. The declaration was adopted on December 10, 1948. In two 
years we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of this declaration, 
which constitutes ``a common standard of achievement for all 
peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every 
organ of society shall strive by teaching and education to promote 
respect for these rights and freedoms''.
<P>
	The declaration provides that ``recognition of the inherent 
dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the 
human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
world'' and ``disregard and contempt for human rights have 
resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of 
mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall 
enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and 
want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common 
people''.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	The horrors of World War II played a large part in making the 
whole world aware of the direct link between the respect of human 
rights and peace. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the 
cornerstone of the UN human rights conventions. It was followed 
by the Declaration on the Right to Development in 1986, the 
Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in 1992, and several others. These declarations and 
conventions are not legally binding, except on ratifying states. 
However, many countries have incorporated certain provisions into 
their legislation.
<P>
	The principle of the declaration which states that ``All human 
beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'' has served as a 
model for the laws and institutions that today protect Canada, 
Quebec and many other countries.
<P>
	Human rights, peace and development are the three pillars of the 
UN.
<P>
	Since it was first formed, the UN has adopted over 50 
instruments concerning human rights: the right to life, the right to 
freedom, the right to freedom of expression, religion and 
association, the right to protection from discrimination, the right to 
adequate food and housing, and the right to an adequate standard of 
living.
<P>
	We are told that international promotion of human rights is an 
integral part of Canada's foreign policy. However, the present 
government is closing its eyes to repeated violations of human 
rights in certain countries, especially when it is a question of 
developing trade ties with those countries. This is true in the case 
of China and Indonesia.
<P>
	The cold war is now a thing of the past. It has been replaced, 
however, by other types of threats to peace and security: interethnic 
hatreds; breakdown of social and government infrastructures; an 
increase in the frequency and intensity of internal armed conflicts, 
with all the massive migrations that result. Twenty-five million 
refugees have been forced through persecution to move or leave 
their country of origin. As you know, the situation today in Zaire 
and neighbouring countries is tragic.
<P>
	Despite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and all the 
other covenants and protocols on human rights, there have been 
genocides in Bosnia, Rwanda and Burundi. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
several cruel dictatorships sprang up in Latin America. Flagrant 
violations of human rights in Chili-assassinations, tortures and 
disappearances-forced me and my family to leave my country of 
origin and come to Quebec. Even today, according to Amnesty 
International, a number of Latin American countries continue to 
violate certain fundamental rights.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of 
Guatemala and the National Revolutionary Union of Guatemala on 
the peace accords and definitive ceasefire that were signed not long 
ago. Peace has been restored after 35 years of fighting between the 
armed forces and the guerrillas. I hope that Canada will play an 
active role in supervising these accords and help to promote and 
defend human rights, including those of the Indian peoples in this 
country for whom I have great respect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7361"> 7361 </A></B>
<P>
	We have a duty to condemn human rights violations throughout 
the world. But this is not enough. We must establish a permanent 
international criminal court. This decision is urgently needed, 
considering the intolerable situations experienced by various 
peoples, and I am thinking of Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and 
other countries where war criminals remain unpunished.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Ligue des droits et libertés du Québec 
on starting a campaign to establish this kind of permanent tribunal, 
and I would ask the government to give its vigorous support to this 
initiative. I have always been active in promoting human rights, 
especially in the ``Ligue'' where I was a member of the board for a 
number of years.
<P>
	The international community must acquire the necessary tools to 
implement existing standards effectively and wisely throughout the 
world. It must also have the tools to punish the perpetrators of 
crimes against humanity. It is necessary to reinforce international 
control, investigation and monitoring mechanisms, especially in 
cases of forced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture. We 
must narrow the gap between the solemn principles set forth in the 
Charter and the suffering endured by peoples throughout the world.
<P>
	Furthermore, we cannot dissociate the protection of human 
rights from the process of democratization. Poverty is a major 
obstacle to the genuine implementation of the principles 
underlying democracy. It is on behalf of this ideal that third world 
countries have started a long and difficult struggle to obtain 
recognition of the right to development and to find a solution to 
their debt problems.
<P>
	In concluding, I would urge the Canadian government to make 
this issue an absolute priority and to intensify and reinforce the 
promotion and defence of rights and freedoms here and throughout 
the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member for his speech, which is as well 
informed and well researched as usual.
<P>
	He pointed out the lack of an international criminal court with a 
general jurisdiction. We have only <I>ad hoc </I>courts, special courts 
such as the tribunal on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and 
Somalia.
<P>
	But does he consider that creation of a criminal court with 
overall jurisdiction would be enough to guarantee application of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? Is it not possible to 
also consider creating a United Nations court mandated to 
implement human rights?
<P>
	The European charter has its own special court, the European 
court of human rights. The great German and French charters both 
have their special, constitutional courts. In Germany and France, 
when a constitutional matter is involved, there is the special 
jurisdiction of the council of state and even the appeal court, the 
court of cassation. May I ask these questions of my colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
high praise. I acknowledge that he is a great jurist, and he is asking 
me a question that has no easy answer.
<P>
	I believe that, like the Civil Liberties Union in Quebec, the 
International Federation of Human Rights in Paris has always 
called for the creation of a permanent international criminal 
tribunal. I believe this is necessary, particularly to judge those who 
have committed crimes against humanity.
<P>
	It is true that there is a human rights tribunal in Europe, but it has 
no jurisdiction over war criminals who have committed crimes 
against humanity.
<P>
	I support his suggestion, if that is what he is suggesting, that the 
UN create its own tribunal, particularly when infractions of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights are involved. The UN is a 
formidable body, an extraordinary organization, but it does not 
have the capacity to apply its fine principles.
<P>
	What we need is a body that is capable of monitoring and 
controlling application of the charter, and of judging those 
responsible for offences under that declaration and other 
international conventions on human rights.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
am pleased to rise on this important day, on which the international 
community celebrates the 48th anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>
	It was no doubt at the time an important event. It was the end of 
the second world war and of all the atrocities it engendered. At the 
time, the 48 members of the League of Nations felt there should be 
a charter that would serve, as my colleague from Mount Royal said, 
as a sort of measure to assess progress or the lack of it.
<P>
	However, certain questions arise. Was it a real desire to mark a 
new stage in the respect of human rights or was it rather vague 
declarations that might be described in popular language as wishful 
thinking? The answer no doubt lies somewhere in between the two. 
There was wishful thinking, because not a whole lot of progress has 
been made.
<P>
	I refer, as proof, to the latest report of Amnesty International, 
which appeared in June of this year and which mentioned, and I 
will take the liberty of reading a few paragraphs: ``Torture, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7362"> 7362 </A></B>
<P>
arbitrary detention, rape, mass executions, disappearances and 
human rights  violations occurred in 146 countries in 1995''. The 
report obviously criticizes the inaction of the international 
community.
<P>
	We learned that there were human rights violations in 146 
countries. The report goes on to say that 4,500 prisoners were 
tortured to death, 140,000 people disappeared and 2,900 people 
were executed. We might well ask then whether any progress has 
been made and whether the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
achieved the importance it might have.
<P>
	We could talk about the complicity of the international 
community, because, in the end, countries are always trying to 
defend certain interests. There are outrageous paradoxes that we 
will never understand. How is it, for example, that the five 
permanent members of the Security Council alone manufacture 80 
per cent of the world's armaments? And yet there they are on the 
Security Council. Do the words still have any meaning?
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Bourassa, referred earlier to the 
sad history of genocides. He gave some examples. One is, of 
course, the elimination of six million Jews. Another is the cruel 
treatment of Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge. Another is the 
endless war in the Sudan, now in its tenth year, that is no longer 
even mentioned in the press, where the government is 
systematically fighting people in the south, who practice a different 
religion. There is the former Yugoslavia, of course, where Muslims 
have undoubtedly been persecuted by Croats and Serbs in equal 
measure. There is Rwanda, where close to a million people have 
died in ethnic wars.
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	The worst thing in the case of Rwanda is that the International 
Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development led a 
mission there in 1992.
<P>
	They described what they said were all the conditions needed for 
genocide to happen. The report was submitted to the Secretary 
General of the United Nations, nothing was done, and the 
inevitable happened. The genocide took place, and now we find 
ourselves in an extremely difficult situation in this region.
<P>
	One of the major problems is the whole question of impunity. 
Rwanda, Haiti, and the former Yugoslavia are examples. Crimes 
against humanity are committed and the international community 
is unable to bring the guilty parties to trial and sentence them.
<P>
	Remember what happened in Haiti after the military coup. 
General Cédras was finally persuaded to leave. He was showered 
with money to help him make up his mind. It was tragic to hear 
President Aristide, on his return, talking as though reconciliation 
were possible, when the rule of impunity was in place. In my view, 
reconciliation-and this is undoubtedly true in Rwanda as well-is 
not possible unless a minimum of justice has been done.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Bourassa, spoke of the need for 
tribunals. That is elementary. Ad hoc tribunals with minimal 
powers are established and, eventually, as it just happened in the 
former Yugoslavia, they try some individuals very low in the 
hierarchy, but the real culprits always manage to elude pursuit.
<P>
	What can ordinary citizens do? There are a number of things that 
can be done. I referred earlier to Amnesty International. Any man 
or woman in this country may choose to work with Amnesty 
International to help free prisoners of conscience.
<P>
	This morning, at the foreign affairs committee, we heard from a 
NGO known as PEN Canada. There is also a PEN Québec and PEN 
International. This organization is dedicated to having journalists 
and authors released from prison. It handles the cases of 900 
individuals jailed for their ideas. This is another NGO the public 
can support financially or through volunteer work.
<P>
	Here, we have the international centre for human rights, which is 
government subsidized. This is one of the good things this 
government has done in terms of human rights. The centre is 
already operating in a dozen countries, helping non-governmental 
organizations involved in human rights and other organizations in 
the civil society get established to ensure that they gradually 
develop the capacity to face arbitrary or military powers in these 
countries.
<P>
	What is missing is any real political will. It is true in many 
countries, and in Canada as well, unfortunately. In its last foreign 
policy statement, Canada put trade relations before human rights. 
Such an action certainly does not do much in terms of promoting 
human rights around the world.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with pride and humility that I take part in the debate 
on this motion.
<P>
	I am proud to be a citizen of a country known throughout the 
world for its enviable record on human rights.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	I am proud also that Canada has given its solid support, during 
the last 48 years, to the United Nations Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. I am proud, moreover, to belong to this 
government, which continues, to this day, to make our country a 
leader in the promotion of peace and security throughout the world.
<P>
	The promotion of human rights is an objective that is 
unanimously supported by Canadians, regardless of their political 
beliefs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Despite our best efforts, however, people all around the world 
still suffer violations of their basic human  rights. Discrimination 
and abuse still exist. There are human rights abuses in all societies, 
ours included. Continued efforts are needed to achieve progress. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7363"> 7363 </A></B>
<P>
We, both citizens and leaders, are collectively responsible for 
dealing with the problems at home and abroad.
<P>
	My colleagues have spoken very eloquently on this subject 
tonight. I think of the speech by the hon. member for Mount Royal. 
As minister responsible for our international development 
programs, I would like to acquaint the House with the activities of 
the Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, for which 
I am responsible, to promote human rights, democracy and good 
governance activities which have begun to bear rich fruit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	CIDA's mandate was clearly stated in the government's foreign 
policy document entitled ``Canada in the World'', tabled in the 
House in February 1995. And, regardless of what may have been 
said a little earlier, one of the six priorities for our official 
development assistance program is, and I quote: ``Human rights, 
democracy, good governance: to increase respect for human rights, 
including children's rights; to promote democracy and better 
governance; and to strengthen both civil society and the security of 
the individual''.
<P>
	According to the official CIDA policy statement: ``Human rights 
are derived from the inherent dignity of the human person, and they 
are of basic importance for the well-being of individuals and the 
existence of freedom, justice and peace in the world''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Translated into CIDA programming, taking a human rights 
approach to development does not simply mean lecturing recipient 
countries about democracy and human rights. It means making 
difficult choices among the competing demand for aid and setting 
priorities for how we use our limited resources. As minister 
responsible for the Canadian International Development Agency, I 
know what it is to be pressured by various individuals for various 
good initiatives, most of them quite worthwhile but not all of which 
can be supported.
<P>
	CIDA has done its job with a good deal of success. We have been 
able to put in place projects and programs that are helping to 
enhance the will and capacity of developing countries to respect the 
rights of children, women and men and to govern in an effective 
and democratic manner.
<P>
	During the two year period 1993-94 and 1994-95, CIDA spent 
some $46.5 million on 384 projects around the world directly 
related to human rights and democratization. These are the most 
recent detailed figures available. The rate of approval of such 
projects is accelerating and they cover a wide variety of initiatives. 
Let me enumerate a few.
<P>
	Thirty-seven per cent of the money that was contributed was 
done in efforts that strengthened the democratic process, including 
elections and building democratic awareness. A further 25 per cent 
supported initiatives to build a rule of law, including strengthening 
the judiciary, training for police and prison officials and greater 
access to the law. I had the opportunity to open a tribunal recently 
in Haiti along with my colleague from Louis-Hébert across the 
way.
<P>
	Finally, 20 per cent of the funds provided are for projects to 
strengthen civil society, including building human rights awareness 
of disadvantaged groups and the advocacy role of civil society 
organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	CIDA's mechanisms are flexible and they adjust to existing 
needs. In fact, statistics do not reflect the nature of the work done. 
Let me give you some concrete examples.
<P>
	As I said earlier, when I spoke about Haiti, CIDA's contribution 
in that country allowed RCMP officers, members of Montreal's 
urban community police force, and members of other Canadian 
police forces to teach Haitian police officers how to conduct 
investigations in a democratic society.
<P>
	In Guatemala, our support to the office of the ombudsman for 
human rights helped the ombudsman uncover and confront those 
responsible for human rights violations in that country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Legal assistance, counselling and training were provided for 
Somali women who were victims of sexual violence in the refugee 
camps at the Kenya-Somali border. Funds were also used to 
improve the security of these same camps.
<P>
	These projects focused on women because, unfortunately, 
women remain, to a large degree, the chief victims of human rights 
abuses.
<P>
	In East Africa, judges and magistrates from several countries 
have received training to increase their awareness of issues relating 
to human rights, democracy and good governance. In Malawi the 
Canada fund paid $50,000 to help the United Nations organize a 
constitutional conference and prepare a bill of rights and employ a 
human rights adviser for their police force.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And the list goes on. As I said before, there are some 384 
projects on the go. Together, they provide a lot of information on 
democracy and human rights. This kind of information is 
accessible to every Canadian, through schools, the media, and the 
elections that have taken place at the municipal, provincial and 
federal levels for over a century.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7364"> 7364 </A></B>
<P>
	While we are getting together today to highlight the significance 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we must also 
recognize that human rights and good government go hand in hand 
with lasting social and economic development.
<P>
	To conclude, I will refer to the policy statement of the Canadian 
International Development Agency, for which I am responsible. It 
says that respect for human rights, democratization, and good 
government are essential to the security of children, men and 
women alike, and the development of society.
<P>
	These three issues are an integral part of CIDA's mandate, and I 
would venture, the goal of every Canadian involved with 
promoting sustainable development to reduce poverty and make 
the world a safer, fairer and more prosperous place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is CIDA's goal, this is the government's goal and I would 
suggest it is the goal of human beings everywhere who long for a 
healthy, secure global society.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my hon. colleague has the privilege of heading an incredibly 
effective agency, CIDA. I have been witness to much of its work. I 
congratulate him on its undertaking.
<P>
	I would suggest to my hon. colleague that there is a lot of 
questions from some Canadians who are not as well informed about 
the importance of interlinking countries, both developing and 
underdeveloped countries, with democracies like Canada.
<P>
	They ask when we are in difficulty here, why are we spending 
money elsewhere. What do we plan to accomplish by helping 
women through micro credit or the World Bank, or building 
bridges or teaching farming and agriculture, marketing and good 
production, civics and civism and democracy? What does that have 
to do with us when we are poor, hungry and when we need to be 
looked after? Dollars here first. Charity begins at home.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. minister would care to comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, this is an excellent question, one 
that should be raised at every opportunity to give all Canadians the 
opportunity reflect on this important issue.
<P>
<B>(2100 )</B>
<P>
	First, if one were to look at humanitarian aid and programs of 
development only on selfish grounds, which would not be the focal 
criteria in any case, one would have to come up with the following 
equation nonetheless. Almost 70 per cent of all the aid that we 
provide comes right back to Canada in the form of purchases of 
goods and services and so on from Canadians. I am not saying that 
it would be the sole criteria to use. As a matter of fact I said it was 
not. One should at least bear that in  mind when one is making the 
equation. I thank my colleague for bringing that up.
<P>
	Second, it is important for us to know the reputation that this 
country has right around the world. Whether it is in Haiti where my 
colleague for Louis-Hébert and I were the other day, or when I had 
the opportunity to be in China, our reputation as a nation is far 
greater than our absolute numbers. I was told in China by more 
than one political leader that what they know the most about 
Canada is Dr. Bethune and the Canadian International 
Development Agency. It is absolutely amazing that a country of 1.2 
billion people would know of a development agency of Canada, a 
country of 30 million, as something that they would all have in 
mind.
<P>
	It is linked very much to their way of doing things. When they 
undertake purchases, when they find goods, services and so on, 
Canada is there. It is no coincidence that we are the most trade 
dependent nation in the western world. It is largely due I suspect to 
the fact that we have internationally the great reputation that we 
enjoy.
<P>
	Finally, we are in government and as such we have a collective 
responsibility. I know some will disagree with that proposition and 
perhaps I will get one or two letters tomorrow for saying this, but I 
feel that it is our responsibility to help out fellow human beings. 
Those of us who know or study or even remember the two wars of 
this century and how sad they were, will know that when there is a 
war, it involves a lot more. Not only does it involve the nations that 
are at war directly but it can involve virtually everyone.
<P>
	The war in Rwanda, that tiny African nation the size of 
Vancouver Island, has consumed billions of dollars over recent 
years. That in itself should tell us that having peace, again if that 
were the only criteria, is much cheaper than not having peace. Our 
role in contributing to peace, good governance and the respect of 
human rights even if we were to use economic criteria alone makes 
sense. There is the human criteria to invoke and that is the most 
important one of all. I thank my colleague for raising this issue.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am honoured to rise in this place of free and open debate 
to speak in support of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998.
<P>
	I intend to speak today about the reasons why we must 
commemorate this important occasion. As Canadians we must lead 
the world in celebrating and reaffirming the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights for four basic reasons, and I will give the House 
the four reasons.
<P>
	First, Canada was instrumental in the declaration's existence. 
Second, our Canadian society has been profoundly shaped by the 
declaration's articles. Third, we must applaud the victories that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7365"> 7365 </A></B>
<P>
have made in human rights internationally. Fourth, we must 
acknowledge that our work is not complete.
<P>
	Canada and Canadians have been a force in establishing this 
important document. After the second world war our country 
shared the belief with our allies that we needed international 
institutions like the UN to prevent future wars from happening. It 
was the determination of Canadians like Louis St. Laurent and 
Lester Pearson that pushed for an institution which respected the 
sovereignty of states but also valued the rule of international law.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	After the allies liberated the concentration camps at the end of 
the war, people around the world were shocked and dismayed by 
the inhumanity of the holocaust and the tyranny of the axis powers. 
This prompted Canada to join with other nations to establish the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>
	It was a Canadian who authored the original draft. The member 
for Mount Royal spoke about Dr. John Humphrey, a New 
Brunswick born Quebec lawyer, former dean of law at McGill 
University in Montreal, one of Canada's finest jurists, a key figure 
in setting out the scope and content of this great human rights 
convention. We have a great deal to be be proud of and we should 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration because 
of this.
<P>
	Canada has had an important place and has played an important 
role in developing this international convention. However, 
Canadian society has also reaped the fruits of this great document. 
Our society, the envy of the world, has nurtured the seeds of the 
virtues of respect, tolerance, freedom and democracy.
<P>
	This declaration has been a guiding force for these virtues right 
here at home, for example, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1947, 
the Canadian Human Rights Act of 1977, the Canadian 
Employment Equity Act of 1986, the Canadian Multiculturalism 
Act of 1988 and last and most important, the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms adopted in 1982.
<P>
	All of these important roots of Canadian human rights law were 
inspired by the articles in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. We must celebrate our Canadian accomplishments as part 
of our international ones. That is why we must mark this important 
day.
<P>
	As we approach the 50th anniversary, let us applaud our 
successes over the last few years. We have witnessed the 
transformation of South Africa from apartheid to a multiracial 
democracy. I witnessed this firsthand. I was fortunate to be chosen 
as the Canadian representative to observe South Africa's first 
multiracial elections in 1994.
<P>
	We have also witnessed the progress to democracy in many parts 
of Latin America. My past riding president and provincial Liberal 
candidate Bruce Davis also went as  a Canadian representative to 
monitor elections in Nicaragua a few years ago.
<P>
	We have seen progress in Haiti, Russia and parts of eastern 
Europe. The spread of freedom, justice and democracy throughout 
the world is owed to this great document. This document has also 
been a rallying point for many international conferences on global 
issues.
<P>
	Last year I was fortunate to attend the international conference 
on women in Beijing, China. It was there that the nations of the 
world met to affirm the principle of equality in article 2(1) of the 
universal declaration. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, 
without distinction of any kind, such as race, sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To put it simply, women's equality rights are human rights and 
countries of the world must reflect that. The declaration has been 
instrumental in our successes around the world but there is still 
work to be done. With regimes like Nigeria's, where oppression 
and corruption prevail, with gross violations of human rights in 
countries like Burma, Indonesia and Iraq, with conflicts fed not by 
ideology but by perverse commerce in places like Liberia, 
Afghanistan and Somalia, we must celebrate the UDHR and 
demand that these nations respect and honour the universal 
declaration.
<P>
<B>(2110 )</B>
<P>
	With atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, we realize 
that our work as a peace loving nation is not done. With the growth 
of hate messages on the Internet, we realize that our work as a 
tolerant, respectful, multicultural society is not done. With terrorist 
groups from Ireland to the United States to Israel spreading 
violence and fear in order to achieve political power, we realize 
that our work to preserve freedom and democracy and to respect 
the opinions of our opponents is not done.
<P>
	We must celebrate and promote human rights by aiding the work 
of the international criminal tribunals, promote the strengthening 
of international labour standards, help establish an international 
criminal court and fight for the international initiatives for the 
welfare of children.
<P>
	Until we do that, our work to establish free, democratic and civil 
societies around the world will not be done. We can begin this work 
by reaffirming our commitment to the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and by celebrating its 50th anniversary.
<P>
	In closing, I can sum up my address by turning to the words of 
my esteemed colleague and friend from Winnipeg South Centre, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He remarked in a speech earlier 
this year: ``If we turn away from the desolation and dismay of 
human suffering, if we fail to stop hatred from flowing through the  
channels of our new electronic networks, if we do not care about 
the present or future of vulnerable children, if we do not counter the 
capricious and arbitrary actions of authoritarian governments with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7366"> 7366 </A></B>
<P>
no legitimacy beyond weaponry and terror, then we will face harsh 
consequences down the road. In the larger landscape of human 
society, what began as hateful rhetoric may turn into open 
terrorism, regional warfare or genocide''.
<P>
	If we are serious about human rights around the world and here 
at home, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights with all the glory it deserves. Every 
member of the House will join with me in affirming all 30 articles 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights today and especially 
in 1998.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege and an honour to speak today on this 
extremely important issue of international human rights.
<P>
	In the post-cold war era we all came to believe that there would 
be a newer and brighter future for everybody. We thought that the 
cold past and the cold times of two terrible wars were over and we 
would see a time when the future would look brighter, when human 
rights would be respected and we would all live in a safer and more 
peaceful time.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the post-cold war era has demonstrated that 
anything but that has occurred. We have seen an explosion of 
regional conflicts, primarily internecine conflicts, affecting nation 
states. Many of these states were boiling over and when the cold 
war ended, the shackles which prevented these conflicts from 
blowing up were removed. We saw a time of violence, destruction, 
raping and pillaging in nations which were relatively peaceful.
<P>
	We need not look any further than the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia to see a graphic and tragic example of what has 
happened in our midst. Potentially those situations could have been 
prevented. I will say more about that a little later on.
<P>
	Prior to the cold war ending, the nations of the world got 
together and developed a number of declarations on human rights, 
beginning with the Hague and going on to the Geneva convention. 
They sound very good and mean well. If we were to adhere to those 
conventions we would not see much of the terrible suffering that 
people, primarily innocent civilians, have endured over the last 
several decades. Unfortunately, with these declarations have come 
an absence of enforcement.
<P>
<B>(2115 )</B>
<P>
	Enforcement is essential if we are going to have a rules based 
human rights network that is going to work. Without the 
enforcement, some countries will not adhere to these basic human 
rights.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that what we have seen over the last 20 years is a 
change in who the victims are. The victims are no longer the 
combatants who have UZI submachine guns, who have AK-47s. 
Ninety per cent of the victims we see in today's internecine 
conflicts are innocent civilians who have no part whatsoever in the 
trials and tribulations they have been subjected to. That is why 
when we are developing a rules based human rights network and an 
enforcement policy for the future, we have to remember that we are 
trying to protect those individuals who are most vulnerable in our 
society and are the least able to take care of themselves.
<P>
	One can see that many of the situations in so many of the terrible 
civil wars that have taken place have occurred under the guise and 
under the leadership of individuals who are draconian rulers. In no 
way, shape or form do they represent the best interests of the 
majority of their people.
<P>
	Zaire and the former Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan 
Karadzic, General Mladic, Sese Seko Mobutu and others have 
demonstrated that they do not represent the wishes of the majority 
of their people. They are prepared to subject their people to terrible 
atrocities for their own gains and the gains of their own political 
elite.
<P>
	That is why when we develop rules for the future, we now have 
to start being a little firmer in what we are putting forth and 
recognize that the leaderships we are integrating with and so-called 
negotiating with may not represent the best wishes of their people.
<P>
	First we have to develop a warning system, one that will identify 
the precursors to conflict. After that, we have to develop a rules 
based response system to the precursors to conflict. I say the 
precursors to conflict because foreign policy throughout the world 
has focused not on conflict prevention but on conflict management.
<P>
	We talk about peacekeeping and peacemaking as part of conflict 
prevention. It is not. Conflict prevention means preventing the 
conflict. When peacekeepers and peacemakers have to be put into a 
situation, the conflict has already occurred and it is too late. The 
seeds of ethnic discontent and hatred have already been laid and 
therefore the seeds for future conflicts are laid. This is not 
necessary. It is possible to prevent these and future conflicts if we 
change our mindset on foreign policy from conflict management to 
conflict prevention. How do we do that?
<P>
	The first thing again is to identify the precursors to conflict, of 
which there are many, and precede the conflict by many years. 
Examples are inappropriate arming, the subjugation of democratic 
and basic rights of a group of people, terror campaigns against a 
group of people, the withdrawal of the economic abilities of certain 
groups of people to function, the breakdown of judicial structures 
and the rule of law falls apart. These are all examples of the 
precursors to conflict that take  place before a conflagration occurs. 
Let us set up monitors so we can identify that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7367"> 7367 </A></B>
<P>
	The second is we need a response and the response has to be 
multinational. The problems that are affecting these nations will 
not be solved if only one country is going to respond to them. The 
international community has to respond to them and that is why we 
need a multinational response system.
<P>
	These responses can involve a carrot and stick approach. If they 
are going to engage in these behaviours, we can prevent them from 
doing that or suggest that they do not by offering a carrot. The 
carrots could be such things as approved loans and preferred trade 
status. By doing this we could convince the nation states that it is 
not in their best interests to engage in a conflagration, but it is 
certainly in their best economic and social interests to engage in 
peace building between disparate groups.
<P>
<B>(2120)</B>
<P>
	There is the stick approach. We could remove or withdraw loans. 
We could recall loans which were made by the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other nations. We could 
cordon off areas. We could withdraw funding. We could discourage 
nations from engaging in activities with surrounding nations. We 
could impose sports bans. We could freeze the assets of the 
draconian rulers.
<P>
	It is exceedingly important to hit those individuals who 
transgress international rights and to hit them in their own pockets. 
Too often what happens is that these groups or individuals who are 
engaging in draconian measures are doing so with complete 
impunity. We have to hit them, because hitting the country at large 
sometimes does not work.
<P>
	Some of the sticks that I proposed may not be appropriate in 
certain circumstances, but sometimes they will be. We have to be 
careful and balance it out to ensure that those who are least 
advantaged in a society will not be hurt.
<P>
	Another activity which has been used before but not often 
enough is to engage in positive propaganda. Oftentimes when the 
breakdown of structures occurs before a war, we find that one 
group is engaging in negative propaganda against another. That 
was done very effectively in the former Yugoslavia. We also saw it 
in Somalia.
<P>
	The international community, especially the United Nations, 
could transmit positive propaganda and peace building messages to 
the groups. They must also engage in efforts to bring the disparate 
groups together in an effort to try to build bridges of understanding.
<P>
	What often happens in a conflict is that one group demonizes the 
other. It breaks the communication between groups, which enables 
one group to develop negative myths about the other. It also instils 
fear within the borders of the other group. This must be broken 
down. The only way to break this down is to foster levels of 
communication between the groups. The best way to do that is to 
do it on the ground with civilians. Civilians can be easily 
manipulated by the powers that be.
<P>
	Fostering a sense of democracy and the support of judicial 
structures is also extremely important, as my Liberal colleague 
mentioned in her speech. It is exceedingly important to do that. 
Without a strong judicial structure, without the influence of 
democratic principles and the support of democratic structures 
within a country, there is the breakdown of infrastructure which 
lends itself to conflict.
<P>
	This is an area in which Canada can take a leadership role. To do 
this will require the revamping of the International Monetary Fund, 
the World Bank and the United Nations. As the United Nations is 
looking for a new secretary general, Canada can influence that 
secretary general with respect to the role which he or she might 
take.
<P>
	Right now we have a window of opportunity. The problems that 
are going to face nations will require a multinational response. To 
do that will require a revamping of those three structures. It will 
also require a level of co-operation among the members of the 
international community which we have not seen, but just because 
we have not seen it does not mean it is not possible. If we do not do 
it, all nations will pay a very heavy price.
<P>
	No country in the world is looking very clearly at the problems 
which will affect us in the 21st century. There will be 
environmental problems, population explosions, conflicts and 
many other problems. All of those problems are not being looked at 
in a multinational fashion. We get together to study them a lot, but 
studies do not necessarily produce action. Oftentimes one study 
will lead to another rather than leading to a course of action.
<P>
	We have an unusual situation in our country. We are one of the 
few countries in the world which has an international reputation 
and ability to engage in the revamping of those international 
structures which is so greatly needed.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	Power in the future is going to come from three areas: traditional 
military power; traditional economic power; and a non-traditional 
form of power which will go to those countries which can act as a 
mediator to organize international consensus. This is where I 
believe Canada can take leadership. We, along with a handful of 
other countries such as Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, 
Australia and New Zealand to name a few can band together as a 
group and collectively utilize our diplomatic corps, our foreign 
affairs consultants and experts to bring forth this consensus within 
the international fora.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7368"> 7368 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, we are doing it not only for ourselves but for the 
international community. There are some powerful and perhaps 
self-centred ways in which we can justify this involvement. I will 
not argue the humanitarian grounds because they are self-evident 
as we speak. However, I am going to argue in a very self-centred 
fashion.
<P>
	If conflicts are allowed to occur, we then see a migration of 
population to our shores. We see greater demands on our official 
development assistance. We see greater demands on our defence 
department assistance. We see greater demands on our domestic 
expenditures on social programs. I am sure, Madam Speaker, you 
would agree that people like to live in their own countries and in 
their own cultures if they have a choice. Why not facilitate that and 
enable these people to live in peaceful surroundings? By getting 
involved in doing this, we are doing it primarily for international 
peace and security but also for some very conclusive domestic 
reasons.
<P>
	There are many things that we should do in terms of trade, aid 
and human rights. We have to convince the private sector, and I 
think we have abrogated our responsibilities in large part on this, 
that it is in its best interests to ensure that there is going to be peace 
and a civil society in the areas where it wishes to engage in trade. 
Engaging in trade and speaking out for human rights are not 
mutually exclusive; in fact they go hand in hand.
<P>
	I propose that our government ask that our private sector demand 
of its companies when they go abroad that they adhere to the same 
basic rules and regulations of labour that are engaged in in our 
country, that they engage in the same basic rules and regulations of 
human rights that are engaged in in our own country, that we 
support companies that are going to help to promote democratic 
structures and human rights in those countries abroad. These things 
would be useful and again would make Canada look very good.
<P>
	We had a great opportunity recently with the Canada-Israeli free 
trade agreement to do just that. We had an opportunity, and I think 
we missed it in a big way, of ensuring that the Canada-Israeli free 
trade agreement was going to be equitable for the Israeli people as 
well as the Palestinian people. Economic emancipation for the 
Palestinian people and economic interactions between the Israeli 
and Palestinian people are going to promote peace. That is the way 
in which it is going to be done. It is not going to happen on 
diplomatic initiatives only. It is not going to happen by standing 
back with an armed or walled mentality. It is going to happen when 
Israeli and Palestinian, Jew and Arab get together and engage with 
each other, understand each other's hopes, fears and aspirations and 
understand that very clearly their hopes, fears and aspirations are 
very similar.
<P>
	I hope the government will continue to pursue this, and ensure 
that the agreement is going to be mutually beneficial to both 
peoples. I hope it speaks out on the transgressions that are 
occurring there as well as in many other parts of the world.
<P>
	We can take a much stronger role. The Prime Minister and the 
ministers of trade and foreign affairs are going to go to southeast 
Asia again. East Timor has an egregious record of human rights 
abuses. It is important for us to engage in trade opportunities with 
the area, and also engage in speaking out against human rights 
abuses there.
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	In closing, I would summarize by saying that the government has 
a great opportunity to work with members of the House to ensure 
that Canada takes a leadership role in support of human rights of 
people around the world whose rights have been transgressed, 
people who cannot speak for themselves for various reasons.
<P>
	Our role in the 21st century is to be that third party which brings 
nations of the world together to work co-operatively to address the 
problems that affect us all. That is the only way we will collectively 
survive in a better and more peaceful world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate this evening 
on the 48th anniversary of the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>
	Today, December 10, we are all observing international human 
rights day. On this day it is important to remember why this 
declaration was born. The declaration came about because of the 
devastation and horrible slaughter resulting from the continual 
violation of human rights around the world.
<P>
	The men and women who drafted the declaration had themselves 
witnessed the extermination of entire peoples as a result of twisted 
racist ideologies and were resolved to put an end to such atrocities. 
Their long term vision to establish universal principles recognized 
that human rights and peace were intertwined.
<P>
	Unfortunately, man does not always learn from his mistakes, as 
we still see around the world violations of human rights in the form 
of torture, disappearances, arbitrary arrests, executions, killing of 
defenceless demonstrators and detention because of one's beliefs. 
When these attacks occur far away from us they are still attacks 
against each and every one of us. For every time there is a violation 
of human rights, there is a violation against humanity and the 
human spirit.
<P>
	However, we must not be discouraged by this, for the declaration 
has paved the way for the progress in the struggle of human rights. 
While the declaration set out the principles for the protection of 
human rights, the United Nations has developed specific bodies 
and procedures to deal with human rights issues. The International 
War Crime Tribunals in the Hague for the  former Yugoslavia and 
for Rwanda represent a critical element to the progress made in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7369"> 7369 </A></B>
<P>
area of human rights. These tribunals have shown that individuals 
responsible for atrocities should not be protected by the state.
<P>
	That is why the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that 
Canada strongly urges the establishment of a permanent 
international criminal court as a new instrument in the fight against 
human rights violations.
<P>
	Another advantage of the declaration is its universality. The 
countries which proclaim it found that it expresses values and 
norms shared by all their cultures. Many nations which became 
independent after the proclamation of the declaration also saw that 
their aspirations were reflected by the document.
<P>
	I recall speaking about human rights abuses in the Soviet Union 
and in eastern Europe. Indeed, many suffered for many decades 
under totalitarian rule. How many suffered and died in the Gulag 
for their beliefs? How many millions died in the Ukraine because 
of man-made famine in 1932-33? How many Polish officers, 
professors and priests were massacred in the Katyn Forest in the 
former Soviet Union, never to be heard from again? In my riding 
Canadians built the Katyn monument to mark this atrocity.
<P>
	Last week my wife's family, the Radziszewski family, received a 
telex from the Government of Belarus apologizing because, as the 
telegram said, the Radziszewski family was sent to Siberia in error. 
My wife was nine weeks old and together with her mother and eight 
other children were shipped off to Siberia. Now they get an apology 
because they were sent there in error. As a baby, my wife survived, 
but her 10-year old brother did not. This telegram does not bring 
him back to the Radziszewski family.
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the human spirit endured in that part of the world 
and since the collapse of the Soviet system we have seen the 
emergence of independent countries developing their democratic 
and civil societies. Countries such as Hungary, Poland, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Estonia and Ukraine are all moving in the right direction 
but the world must remain vigilant.
<P>
	I am reminded of a recent human rights case involving 
Alexander Nikitin, a retired Russian captain who has worked with 
the Bellona Foundation of Norway to highlight serious 
environmental dangers of the Russian northern fleet that has been 
found to be the source of radioactive contamination of both 
northwest Russia and the Arctic.
<P>
	The environmental report was compiled using knowledge and 
statistics available from open sources, yet Alexander Nikitin was 
imprisoned earlier this year by the Russian security police on 
trumped up charges of espionage and high treason against Russia 
for providing the Bellona Foundation with so-called top secret 
information. He remains in custody under threat of a death 
sentence.
<P>
	In my opinion this is a setback for Russian behaviour in human 
rights. Mr. Nikitin's imprisonment and the accusations against him 
are not only flagrant breaches of human rights and the rights of free 
speech, but also threaten human health and ecological safety, both 
in Russia as well as in neighbouring countries.
<P>
	In the spring of 1993, I served as an electoral observer in 
UNTAC, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. 
This was the first free and fair election in 14 years of civil war in 
Cambodia. Indeed, the Khmer Rouge did much to violate human 
rights in this country through intimidation and the most brutal 
killing the world had ever seen. I was horrified to see the killing 
fields where piles of bones lay like open graves.
<P>
	Today I read in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> that 5,000 photos of those 
who were tortured and killed by the Khmer Rouge will appear on 
the Internet next month. I shudder to think what the families are 
going to go through when they recognize relatives and friends.
<P>
	Ensuring sustainable human security means providing basic 
needs in a political and economic way, which includes the 
protection of fundamental human rights. When there is a 
breakdown to protect human rights there is also a breakdown of 
civil society. Civil society, that sector between the individual and 
the state, often is there to monitor the activities of the government 
and functions as a check and balance. The services offered by 
non-governmental organizations, otherwise known as NGOs, fit 
this description. NGOs are the lifeblood of the human rights system 
and it is crucial that the United Nations be accessible to them.
<P>
	Organizations such as Amnesty International or Ambedkar 
Centre for Justice and Peace, which is run by Yogesh Vahardi, a 
constituent of mine, offer important information and advice. 
Yogesh Vahardi has made it his crusade to speak against the caste 
system in India, saying that it is the root cause of Indian slavery 
and the exploitation of millions of children.
<P>
	The Canadian government has made the rights of children of 
utmost priority. Therefore, I recommend that the government make 
it illegal for Canadian firms to employ child labour abroad. Since 
the relationship between trade and labour standards is an emerging 
global issue, I also recommend that we strive for an international 
convention that any product which is made by children have 
marked on that item ``made by children''. With such labelling, 
hopefully no company, no country, no individual will buy this 
product.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to quote the former Secretary-General 
of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar:
<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I should like to say that the rights recognized by the Declaration exist truly only in so 
far as they are exercised by those who possess them. One learns to be free. One can also 
renounce freedom. The best and most scrupulously applied law means nothing if the 
people prefer assistance and dependence. Freedoms can die if they are insufficiently 
used, insufficiently valued, or insufficiently cherished.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever view one takes of the revolutionaries whose memory you will soon be 
evoking, they cannot be denied one essential virtue: They loved freedom. May we, 
like the authors of the Universal Declaration and the innumerable defenders of 
human rights share their enthusiasm, we who know by experience that world peace, 
progress and civilization are at stake and that henceforth it is our hopes that hang in 
the balance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2140)</B>
<P>
	Thus in honouring the memory of the founders of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights we are honouring their principles and 
their importance to the countries of the world. Let us work together 
for their universal attainment in order to ensure for our children a 
humane international community, firmly based on the pillars of 
human rights, justice, dignity and peace.
<P>
	I forgot to mention that I am sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am glad to participate in this special debate on 
the UN declaration of human rights which will be commemorating 
its 50th anniversary in 1998. As vice-chair of the Standing 
Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important 
issue.
<P>
	This document has been key in advancing the protection of 
human rights not only in this country but around the world. The 
drafting of a framework for human rights legislation is an 
accomplishment of which we as Canadians can truly be proud.
<P>
	Mr. John Humphrey, a native New Brunswicker, authored the 
original draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with 
the assistance of others in 1948. The preamble captures the spirit of 
the declaration by stating:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all 
members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The inherent dignity of the human family is not dependent on 
religion, race, colour, sex, language, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
<P>
	The act states in section 25(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and 
well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical 
care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the even of 
unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood 
in circumstances beyond his control.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As chair of the recent task force on disability issues I have heard 
many individuals from across the country express their desire for 
the federal government to outline its role regarding disability 
issues. This exercise has resulted in the final report entitled ``Equal 
Citizenship for Canadians with Disabilities: The Will to Act''.
<P>
	Canadians with disabilities need to know that no matter where 
they live in Canada they can be assured a decent quality of life and 
a level playing field. The federal government's role is significant. 
The challenge is to provide leadership. Leadership involves 
accepting responsibility to remove inequities, barriers and 
obstacles.
<P>
	The report suggests changes that include amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act and amendments to the Criminal 
Code and the Canada Evidence Act to improve access to the 
criminal justice system. Many more changes have been 
recommended and they are all a function of the fact that people 
with disabilities are first and foremost Canadian citizens. They 
have the right to expect that their government is doing its part to 
remove inequity.
<P>
	If you have a disadvantage, the Government of Canada has an 
obligation to do whatever it can to remove that disadvantage. I 
want to encourage the government, particularly on this anniversary, 
to accept the report's recommendations and applaud the former 
minister of human resources development for having the foresight 
to set up the task force to look at this very important human rights 
issue.
<P>
	In order to keep the community of nations united in shared goals, 
of dignity for all citizens, prosperity and freedom, each 
government needs to continue to look to each other and avoid the 
pitfall of looking only inward, of putting on blinders to the outside 
world. We need to keep watch, to question human rights abuses, to 
look out for each other.
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	I believe this government is continuing to prove its commitment 
to human rights issues. We have drafted legislation that will enable 
criminal prosecution in Canada of Canadians who go overseas to 
engage in prostitution related activities with children. We are 
addressing the problem of the propagation of hatred on the 
information highway. We have contributed to the human rights 
field operation in Rwanda and to the program of operations in the 
former Yugoslavia. We are currently looking into the issue of 
privacy in technology in the human rights committee of 
Parliament.
<P>
	We have participated in the United States world conference on 
human rights in Vienna and the fourth UN conference on women in 
Beijing.
<P>
	These are but a few examples of how the government is proving 
its commitment to human rights issues. We need look no further 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7371"> 7371 </A></B>
<P>
than our recent leadership role with respect to the refugee crisis in 
Zaire. That intolerable  situation is being resolved largely thanks to 
the Prime Minister and the ministers who convinced many key 
leaders to commit troops and resources to helping the refugees 
before it was too late.
<P>
	Canadians across the country can be proud of the influence that a 
middle power can have in such important international events.
<P>
	Much has been done but there is much yet to do. I hope that this 
anniversary will bring attention to the need for vigilance on every 
nation's part, vigilance against human rights abuses, infringements 
on personal freedoms and inequalities rising from gender, age and 
disability.
<P>
	I applaud the government for allowing this debate to take place. I 
commend all members who have participated. I offer my support 
and encouragement to the human rights committee of the United 
Nations association for Canada on its planned commemoration 
next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
share my time with my colleague, the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	To ensure world peace and security, to show our support for 
human rights and democracy and to contribute to the fight against 
poverty, we must stop considering the development of human 
rights as a marginal question and place it instead at the very heart 
of our foreign policy, at the centre of our concerns. The 50th 
anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, coming up two years from now, commands such reflection.
<P>
	For too long, the concept of human rights did not include 
women's rights. Fortunately, now it finally does. This shows how 
much progress has been made. The concept of fundamental rights 
has widened and become more all-encompassing.
<P>
	However, in all countries, without any exception, poor people 
are still mostly women. Women and children are by far the main 
victims of the conflicts in the world; according to data compiled by 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, women and 
children represent 80 per cent of all refugees. Furthermore, 
whatever the country and whatever the type of government, women 
are always underrepresented in politics.
<P>
	Why is it so difficult, even today, to have people recognize that 
human rights also include women's rights? The right to own 
property, the right to be protected against any form of violence, the 
right to solicit public and political office, these are all rights that 
are universally recognized, but that women cannot claim in many 
countries.
<P>
	Of course, women got organized and continue to do so to change 
this. At the world summit for social development that was held in 
Copenhagen in March 1995, political leaders from all over the 
world said, and I quote: ``Economic and social development cannot 
be ensured in a sustainable manner without the full participation of 
women''. They added that ``equality and equity between men and 
women is for the international community a priority objective that 
must be at the centre of economic and social development''.
<P>
	No one challenges the principle that women's contribution is 
essential to any social development. However, some doubts arise 
when we ask ourselves how women's fundamental rights are 
reflected in society and in the context of real equality with men: an 
equal presence, equal chances and an equal weight in the real 
governing of our world and our society.
<P>
<B>(2150)</B>
<P>
	From such an angle, we quickly realize that there could be a 
double standard here, that the issues affecting the freedom, health, 
security and working conditions of women could continue to be of 
secondary importance compared to those of men.
<P>
	Delegates from almost 200 countries reviewed these issues and 
others at the fourth world conference on women held by the UN, in 
Beijing, in September of 1995. Quite often during this conference, 
we were reminded that the first conference of its kind was held 
more than 20 years ago and that no country in the world had since 
seen fit to ensure that women enjoy full equality in terms of salary, 
status, opportunities or power. No country has as yet seen fit to 
ensure that the rights of women were truly considered as ``human 
rights''.
<P>
	The Beijing conference led to a concrete measure, the approval 
of an action plan for the year 2000. Negotiations on the content of 
this action plan were difficult at times, but in the end the main 
problems of poverty, health, violence, economic equality and 
human rights were taken into consideration. The action plan also 
stresses the fact that many women face other obstacles to equality 
based on race, religion, disabilities or other aggravating factors.
<P>
	Of course, in the end, a conference is only a conference; an 
action plan, only a few sheets of paper. But the Beijing world 
conference on women did still have at least two positive and 
concrete consequences for women in Canada and Quebec. It gave 
them the opportunity to see what is left to do around the world with 
regard to women's fundamental rights. It also showed them 
specific objectives towards which they can work at the family, 
community, national or international level.
<P>
	As important as it is for the Canadian government to preach by 
example, the best indication of its commitment to human rights is 
its accomplishments in this area. What is the status of women and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7372"> 7372 </A></B>
<P>
children in Quebec and in Canada? What impact do the basic rights 
of women and children have on our government's foreign policy?
<P>
	In Canada and in Quebec, children's rights are protected under 
the human rights legislation and the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. At the international level, they are protected under 
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
	Despite these political and legal instruments, poverty among 
children is increasing constantly here and elsewhere. In February 
1995, the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
warned us, and I quote: ``[Canada is] simply not doing enough to 
ensure that [our children's] future is a bright one. With close to 
one-fifth of our nation's children living below the low-income 
cut-off, our record of concern for children and their future, in 
comparison with that of other relatively affluent industrialized 
nations, is quite simply unacceptable''.
<P>
	In Canada, one child in five lives in poverty. This means one in 
five children does not have enough to eat, does not have decent 
housing, does not have the security to which all human beings have 
a right. On the international level, 250 million children between the 
ages of 5 and 14 are working, half of them full time.
<P>
	The Canadian government must finally acknowledge the key 
roles played by women and children in the community and in 
society. Not only must the highest priority be given to the needs of 
poor families, but it must also be realized that human rights, the 
rights of women and children, must at all times guide our actions, 
since they are the most vulnerable members of society.
<P>
<B>(2155)</B>
<P>
	Great principles are not enough on their own. There must also be 
concrete actions. The Canadian government is dragging its feet in 
this regard. Parents, especially mothers, should have access to 
employment or to better educational and training opportunities, 
and this must include the assurance that their children are being 
properly taken care of.
<P>
	All of this should-and this can never be said too often-fit in 
with the transfer of powers and funds to Quebec, in order to enable 
it to control all elements of an overall pro-family and anti-poverty 
policy.
<P>
	On the international scene, the least the government could do is 
to ensure that the conditions regarding the work of children are 
respected when it comes to its aid programs and international trade 
relations as well as its grants to promote international trade. 
Satisfying basic needs should be a priority on the national as well 
as international levels.
<P>
	One thing is for sure: respect for human rights will not come 
about automatically, either in isolation or through trade. Whether it 
be through legislation, promotion or protection, basic rights must, 
like anything else, find their place among the humanitarian 
priorities of this government. In real life, the principle that all 
human beings have a right to the same level of respect and deserve 
to be treated fairly is not always a top priority. It is important to 
change that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, before I start, may I raise a point 
of order and say that you will find there is unanimous consent for 
extending the debate beyond the time allowed, so that I can make 
my 10 minute speech and a few other hon. members can do so as 
well.
<P>
	Since you seem to be in excellent form and superb health, I do 
not think you will mind if we go on, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent to hear the members who wish to speak to the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, you have my undying gratitude and this also applies to the 
pages and the staff of the House. I also want to thank the security 
staff, and I hope Camille Dagenais is listening as well.
<P>
	That having been said, time or the lack of it should not make us 
unmindful of the importance of the debate we are having today, as 
parliamentarians, to commemorate the upcoming 50th anniversary 
of what in contemporary, in recent history was certainly the first 
text, with the text produced in the French Revolution, to actually 
define human rights in a legislative text, which has led us to try to 
establish an international public order.
<P>
	As I prepared my speech this evening, I wanted to briefly recall 
the role played by former U.S. president and democrat Woodrow 
Wilson, who was a professor at Princeton University. He was, 
without a doubt, one of the great driving forces behind human 
rights in the history of the 20th century. He gave his country and 
the international community a document entitled ``Fourteen 
Points'', which served as the basis for the League of Nations.
<P>
	You will remember that President Wilson was a visionary. He 
was convinced not only that men and women were equal, but that 
the countries in the international community must have the same 
rights and responsibilities.
<P>
	A Democrat who faced a great disappointment in his life, 
because the American Congress denied him the mandate he sought 
to ratify the Treaty of Versailles and join the League of Nations, the 
forerunner of the United Nations, President Wilson said something 
very important in his ``Fourteen Points''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7373"> 7373 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2200)</B>
<P>
	He pointed out that there had to be an international community 
with common interests and responsibilities. However, there also 
had to be a forum for discussion and the expression of 
multilateralism.
<P>
	Sir Wilson was a visionary. In his 14 points, which the pages 
certainly studied in political science and have not forgotten, 
President Wilson said there should be no more secret diplomacy. 
When President Wilson urged us to establish a lucid and 
transparent international order without any more secret diplomacy, 
he was surely thinking of the European system of the 19th century, 
of which Bismarck had been an architect, and which led over time 
to a very opaque system of concealed alliances which led to the 
mess we are familiar with and to what Clémenceau called the first 
European civil war, which was of course the war of 1914-18.
<P>
	All this has not been in vain, however, since it led us over a 
single century to believe that every individual has rights, regardless 
of where he or she lives in the world. That is what the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the 50th anniversary of which we 
will celebrate in two years, is all about. This is the basic idea.
<P>
	Nobody can say that the declaration is a long, dense, arid 
document. About 30 clauses make up the text and there are 5 
``whereas'' in the preamble, which you have surely read, Madam 
Speaker. This document is younger than you are-No, I mean the 
document is older than you are. I almost made a diplomatic faux 
pas that could have cost me dearly.
<P>
	These ``whereas'' point to something that is very important. 
They remind us that every state is a country and must make a 
commitment to promote human rights.
<P>
	The concept of human rights implies a number of things that are 
very clearly stated in the declaration. First, there is the dignity of 
individuals, which is above all about physical integrity. In a 
country unable to respect the physical integrity of its citizens, there 
cannot be respect for human rights.
<P>
	Moreover, in addition to talking about the physical integrity of 
individuals, the declaration mentions the right to own property, the 
right to take part in public life, which is part of the right to dignity, 
the right to run in a election, the right to live in a country where 
freedom of expression is recognized, and the right of all its citizens 
to take part in public life.
<P>
	It is awesome to think that in 1948, as the member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead and the secretary of state for 
multiculturalism reminded us a while ago, the declaration was a 
gamble that in international law, opposing parties could sit down 
together and agree that the rule of law must prevail, no matter what. 
In the history of international relations, this was a huge step 
forward, called multilateralism.
<P>
	True, this declaration does not have force of law. Each nation 
state wanting to follow through with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights is responsible for translating into policy the 
underlying principles of each of the 30 articles which are 
statements of principles, values, beliefs and duties.
<P>
<B>(2205)</B>
<P>
	Each of the 30 sections show a number of principles, values, 
beliefs and obligations.
<P>
	In Canada's case, this took a number of forms. First of all, it took 
the form of the Declaration of Human Rights that was put forward 
by former Prime Minister Diefenbaker and where it was mentioned 
essentially that, as a community, we are opposed to any form of 
discrimination based on religion, origin, sex, religious or political 
beliefs. This is an important part of Canadian law reflecting our 
belief in the equality of all citizens.
<P>
	Thereafter, we had the Canadian Charter of Human Rights in 
1982, in a context that it is not appropriate to mention tonight, for it 
has not always been in the interest of Quebec. This must be said 
because entire sections of the main language act, the only national 
redress act to have been passed by Quebec was invalidated.
<P>
	When I say this, I must also say, for the sake of truth, that in 
some respects the Constitutional Act and the 1982 charter had an 
extremely positive effect on human rights.
<P>
	I am thinking in particular of the whole issue of the rights of 
those who experience discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
The hon. member for Mount Royal knows how sensitive I am to 
this issue that always brings us to the same reality. The only reality 
that must prevail in a state is the rule of law. It is extremely 
important that the rights and obligations we all have before the law 
be codified in the legislation.
<P>
	Does that mean that there is no need to update the charter of 
human rights, the universal declaration of 1948? No, it does not 
mean that. It means that, for a document nearly 50 years old, it has 
aged very well. It remains just as relevant and topical now as it was 
then, to anyone who believes that we need clear authority on the 
matter of human rights.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that I am very proud to see that 
everyone in this House, members of all parties, all support a 
document like this one.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
almost 50 years ago, the United Nations approved conventions, 
principles of recognition and monitoring mechanisms, which all 
reflect the overwhelming desire of the international community to 
recognize all the various aspects of the indivisible, inalienable and 
fundamental rights of individuals. We are now having this little 
debate and you have just alluded to this important issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7374"> 7374 </A></B>
<P>
	We want gender equality, which means all the inalienable rights 
every woman and man should have in our society. The most 
sensitive and difficult issue in my mind is the fact that, in the past, 
we used to talk about ``droits de l'homme''. I think the time has 
come to replace that expression with ``droits de la personne''.
<P>
	Since the hon. member also referred to this issue earlier, can he 
enlighten us on the differences between ``droits de l'homme'' and 
``droits de la personne''?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, this is an extremely interesting 
question at this late hour. I am sorry not to have more time to 
answer it.
<P>
<B>(2210)</B>
<P>
	The fact remains that the first time I went to the UN-I am not 
sure if the hon. member for Mount Royal was part of the delegation 
but I do not think so-I was very surprised and very disappointed 
to see that all official documents in French still referred to ``droits 
de l'homme''. This is an extremely outdated phrase that should no 
longer be part of international terminology, since, as we know, 
women account for 52 per cent of the population. Countries with 
governments led by women are usually more successful than 
countries led by men.
<P>
	Indeed, we should speak of ``droits de la personne''. I subscribe 
completely to the comments made by the hon. member for Mount 
Royal. I hope Canada and its partners will press for the updating of 
titles and names of international organizations. I think that the 
current names are extremely discriminatory.
<P>
	If the Canadian government, through the foreign affairs minister 
or the Minister for International Cooperation, ever decided to make 
representations in favour of these changes, I am sure it would have 
the unanimous support of the official opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make an 
additional comment. This is precisely what Canada did at the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union. We proposed that the expression ``les 
droits de l'homme'' be amended in the statutes to reflect this 
equality, and in fact the even greater number of women than men in 
society.
<P>
	Unfortunately, France steadily opposed the proposal. It was 
debated in committee and in plenary. The executive and the 
committee of the whole rejected it, based on the fact that ``les 
droits de l'homme'' contains in its very conception the notion of 
women, and that it should therefore not be changed. What do you 
think? How are we to deal with France?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I know that the member for 
Mount Royal is a very gifted diplomat. Even though I have, in the 
past, found her more closely aligned with the Anglo-Saxon reality, 
I believe that, were she to give it all her charm, conviction and 
talent, she could persuade the motherland to change reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, today is International Human Rights Day. I 
want to draw attention to the anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, a year long celebration of Canada's 
commitment to human rights which will begin one year from today.
<P>
	The United Nations has invited all countries to organize 
programs of activities in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 
declaration. It has also proclaimed 1995 to the year 2004 as the 
United Nations decade for human rights education, calling on 
member states to develop plans of action to address the needs in 
this area.
<P>
	Last April the Minister of Human Resources Development was 
the first Canadian foreign minister to address the United Nations 
High Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. At that time he 
promised to keep the High Commissioner on Human Rights 
advised of Canada's plans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in order to ensure 
maximum international impact for the occasion.
<P>
	As our Minister of Human Resources Development said in 
Geneva: ``The celebration of the 50th anniversary should not be an 
occasion for complacency or sentimentality. Rather, it is the time 
for reaffirmation and renewal, for tough concerted action that will 
move the human rights agenda to the centre of a reformed and 
revitalized United Nations''. The minister described the universal 
declaration of human rights as ``the linchpin that joins us all, 
governments and citizens alike in our shared aspirations''.
<P>
	Canada has a special attachment to the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. A Canadian, the late John Peters Humphrey, was 
one of the architects of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the first director of the UN human rights division. His great 
personal qualities, enthusiasm and vision continue to guide 
Canada's strong involvement within the UN in the field of human 
rights.
<P>
<B>(2215)</B>
<P>
	Canada has played an active, often central role in the evolution 
of UN human rights principles and machinery. The 1986 all-party 
parliamentary review of Canada's foreign policy, and the 
government's response, emphasized the importance of human 
rights as a fundamental integral part of Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	The 1996 parliamentary review of Canadian foreign policy 
reaffirmed this commitment and made clear that respect for human 
rights is key to international peace, prosperity, development and to 
an environment where Canadians can best pursue their interests in 
the world. That the emergence since World War II of the principles 
of human rights in any country are a legitimate concern of all 
governments and a legitimate topic of discussion in international 
<P>

<P>
fora represents a quantum leap in the evolution of international 
relations and law.
<P>
	Of course, as in most other fields of international law what 
remains to be done is the hard part: ensuring effective, that is, 
timely and universal implementation and enforcement of the 
established norms.
<P>
	For instance in China, legal experts from both China and Canada 
are working together on a series of projects to strengthen the 
Chinese legal framework.
<P>
	The International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal 
Justice Policy, funded in part by the Canadian Development 
Agency is an excellent example of Canada's support to China's 
efforts to implement international standards for human rights. A 
transparent system based on the rule of law is of growing 
importance to the Chinese people. Another way to encourage 
internationally established norms is through support for democracy 
worldwide. Many of the countries that Canada supports through its 
human rights programming are in the midst of adapting more 
democratic forms of government.
<P>
	As the Minister for International Cooperation said, taking a 
human rights approach to development does not mean lecturing 
recipient countries about democracy or human rights. It means 
supporting projects and programs that enhance the will and 
capacity of developing countries to respect the rights of children, 
women and men, and to govern in an effective and democratic 
manner.
<P>
	I would like to draw to members' attention a few examples of 
such projects.
<P>
	In Asia alone, a region which is close to my heart, CIDA was 
involved in 72 human rights and democracy projects during the 
1993-94 and 1994-95 fiscal years. This does not include initiatives 
that address rights and democracy indirectly or as secondary 
objectives.
<P>
	CIDA has contributed to a peace fund in Sri Lanka. The fund, is 
aimed to promote peaceful resolutions to Sri Lanka's ethnic 
conflicts through dialogue. It provided for a wide range of 
activities including the production of educational material and 
support for Sri Lanka's peace committees.
<P>
	In Pakistan, CIDA provided support to the Women in 
Development Support Fund. This project's goal was to help remove 
discriminatory barriers to women's economic, social and political 
participation in society. One of its accomplishments was the 
creation of the Women's Desk at the Human Rights Commission of 
the Pakistan Secretariat in 1995.
<P>
	The relationship between trade and human rights are not 
mutually exclusive. In fact, they reinforce each other. We should be 
able to discuss human rights issues with our trading partners and 
we should be able to use trade as a tool to improve human rights.
<P>
D (2220)
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs said at the United Nations 
General Assembly in September: ``The celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be 
an occasion not only to reaffirm our commitment to its principles 
but also to further what practical steps remain to be taken by 
governments to implement them''.
<P>
	Let us prepare ourselves to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the secretary of state for his remarks. They bring the 
degree of clarity we need as we have been talking about trade, 
international law, human rights, freedom of expression, freedom of 
the person and the assurance that politicians and people who speak 
out do not end up being incarcerated because they have cared to 
speak about democracy and freedom and the right to 
self-expression.
<P>
	The member did not address the situations in Vietnam and 
Burma. He did address the situation in China. In the view of the 
secretary of state, what would be the outcome of isolating, of not 
trading or of undertaking sanctions against countries like Burma or 
Vietnam? I could mention many other countries in the same breath 
that have incarcerated their parliamentarians or that have ignored 
supposed open democracy. They have had free elections yet they 
have ignored those elections and in many cases put the elected 
persons into prison. What does the member believe we can do in 
the light of the work we have already undertaken at the United 
Nations and in the light of the helpful remarks made by the foreign 
minister?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. We have to look at those issues according to the situations 
in the individual countries. Situations differ between countries.
<P>
	It is very unfortunate that even though Canada has discouraged 
our business community from trading with Burma, many other 
countries like the United States, Japan, Australia and the Asian 
countries have been trading with Burma. It is very difficult for us to 
unilaterally impose sanctions on Burma. On many occasions we 
continue to speak out against the human rights situation in Burma, 
but we are limited in our ability to effect change.
<P>
	In countries like Indonesia the government has shown signs of 
co-operation. It has established a human rights commission which 
has demonstrated its integrity in its last report on the January 27 
riots in Indonesia.
<P>
	In those countries I do not think that isolation or trade sanctions 
would be effective, positive or constructive in pursuing human 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7376"> 7376 </A></B>
<P>
rights. The best way to go is to continue trading with them, to 
encourage them to open up their  countries and accept our norms on 
human rights. We have seen progress in those countries.
<P>
	In Vietnam we have seen there is higher degree of freedom 
among the civilians. They can pursue their own economic agendas 
and they are able to move around freely. At the same time, the 
dissidents and political activists are still facing a lot of trouble. We 
use every opportunity to share our views with them, to talk about 
those issues with them. During my last visit to Vietnam I actually 
raised individual cases with the prime minister. I made sure that 
human rights and trade could go hand in hand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to note that the 
Standing Committee on Human Rights and Status of Persons with 
Disabilities, on which I was privileged to serve as chair last year, 
recommended in its second report to Parliament this past June that 
the Government of Canada should set aside time today, on 
International Human Rights Day, for a special debate on the pivotal 
role played by the universal declaration of human rights in 
promoting human rights abroad and at home and to begin to make 
Canadians aware that December 10, 1998 will mark the 50th 
anniversary of its adoption. Therefore I am delighted that the 
Government of Canada proceeded to announce that a special debate 
in honour of International Human Rights Day would take place 
tonight.
<P>
<B>(2225)</B>
<P>
	Earlier this evening during comments and questions I spoke 
about human rights having as much to do with children in poverty 
as they have to do with the brave and courageous individuals 
around the world who fight for freedom in countries where 
intimidation, fear and oppression are daily realities.
<P>
	When we look at the question of human rights in this 
perspective, it is clear that in spite of the wonderful technological 
progress of this decade, there are still far too many who have 
shown too little responsibility for the vast majority of the human 
race.
<P>
	I speak of peace not just as a north-south issue. I speak of peace 
as well as a concerned Canadian who knows only too well the 
magnitude of the war on poverty we all have to make in our own 
country. Again, I do not speak here only of freedom from 
oppression but of freedom from hunger and hopelessness as well.
<P>
	Nelson Mandela made the same point in his speech to the joint 
session of the U.S. Congress on October 7, 1994 when he said: ``As 
the images of life lived anywhere on our globe become available to 
all, so will the contrast between rich and poor become a force 
impelling the deprived to demand a better life from the powers that 
be''.
<P>
	Here at home Canadians have built a compassionate country 
anchored with the spirit of tolerance and the idea of strength 
through diversity. Canada is a multicultural federation which is in 
many ways is a microcosm of the planet. Thousands of newly 
arrived Canadians enrich our national dream. Thousands more wait 
in immigration offices around the world seeking access to a 
country where the red maple leaf signifies peace and freedom and 
compassion and respect for the rights of the individual.
<P>
	Too many of us, in the rush to rise to the challenges of the world 
economic revolution, forget that Canada is seen as a special 
laboratory for social change in all corners of the planet.
<P>
	Today on International Human Rights Day we must reflect on the 
real priorities for Canadians. No society or country is truly free if it 
neglects the rights and freedoms of the most poor and illiterate, the 
most defenceless citizens among them. The true test of a 
civilization is how it treats the poor, how it treats the illiterate, how 
it treats the most defenceless.
<P>
	Antoine de Sainte Exupery once wrote: ``It is only with the heart 
that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye''.
<P>
	May this December 10 teach us to look with our hearts; we must 
look with our conscience. We must think of the tiny babies and the 
small children growing up in our decade.
<P>
	As a paediatrician I might add I often think of such babies and 
children. They do not understand globalization and computers, 
trade pacts and gross domestic product. But they are born among 
us, raised among us with rights, rights to shelter and good health 
care, rights to nourishment and protection, rights to societies which 
respect and love them. But most of all, they have the right to grow 
up in a country in which they have a fair opportunity to do their 
very best, a country where the right to equality does not depend on 
the neighbourhood they come from or the ethnic community they 
belong to, or whether they are of aboriginal parents in Winnipeg or 
whether they are of English parents on the Island of Montreal. You 
have the right to grow up equal and in some respects that is the real 
moral test of our time.
<P>
	Today we think and look with our hearts because the real 
essentials are invisible to the eye. We think back to that United 
Nations General Assembly meeting in Paris nearly half a century 
ago, when the first step in the long 1,000 mile journey toward a 
freer, fairer world was taken.
<P>
	Let us resolve and endeavour to answer the unspoken questions 
in every human heart: Why are we here? What are we to do?
<P>
	We in this House can take pride that this government under the 
creative and caring leadership of our Prime Minister remembers 
our humanity at home and abroad. Indeed we must remember the 
intended purpose and meaning of our being. We must remember 
our humanity.  This is the essence of today's celebration of 
International Human Rights Day.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> My intervention is 
more in the nature of a comment, Madam Speaker. I want to note 
that this debate has been most interesting. I am really delighted 
with the number of people who have participated for the 
government and on all sides of this House.
<P>
	It is particularly important to note that the last speaker for the 
evening is the past chairman of the Standing Committee on Human 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7377"> 7377 </A></B>
<P>
Rights and the Status of the Disabled. He was the guiding spirit in 
that new committee and certainly oversaw some very wonderful 
pieces of research, particularly in relation to the disabled. I want to 
congratulate him on the work which he and his committee did and 
to tell him how pleased I am that he who in, of and by himself 
speaks to human rights in his everyday life is a real testament to the 
nature of the kind of debate we had tonight for which I thank him 
personally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Pursuant to 
order made, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 10.31 p.m.)
