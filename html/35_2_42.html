announce the British Columbia winners of the Canada Day poster 
challenge.
<P>

	In British Columbia, the winner is 9 year old Eric Stockand, a 
young man who loves to draw, play the piano, swim and go 
camping.

<P>
	This is the second time I have had the pleasure of presenting the 
first prize for B.C. to one of my young constituents. Kevin Su won 
in 1994. Both Eric and Kevin had the same teacher, Mr. Kenson 
Seto. Mr. Seto is an art teacher who believes in Canada's 
multicultural nature and its unity.
<P>
	Eric Stockand was also one of the Honda poster finalists for the 
Future of Transportation competition and has won several 
colouring contests. His drawing, representing a dove in a Canadian 
context, has been described by Eric as reflecting Canada as a land 
of joy, a land where all people can live together in peace and 
harmony.

	Canada is lucky to have young people like Eric Stockand and 
Kevin Su and teachers like Kenson Seto. Congratulations to all of 
them.

	The Quebec urban community, which is directly affected, on 
April 23 unanimously adopted a resolution demanding that the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans reverse its decision and carry 
out an in depth assessment of the economic impact of the various 
options.
<P>
	I am asking the government to halt this direct assault against the 
Quebec economy. I am asking the government to listen to the

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, imagine 
for a moment that you have been working abroad for a number of 
years. You spent long periods of time away from your family and 
have endured many hardships. The only benefit to you was the 
overseas tax exemption.
<P>
	Suddenly you find out there has been a big mistake. Even though 
Revenue Canada accepted your tax returns for all those years, it 
now turns out that your company and all of its employees did not 
qualify for the tax exemption. You owe back taxes all the way back 
to 1991, big time.
<P>
	In my riding and all through Alberta's oil patch, there are people 
who now find themselves in this situation. These people should 
have been advised much sooner.
<P>
	Revenue Canada was lax in its enforcement and lax in checking 
the credentials of the companies involved. Therefore, the minister 
must take another look at such circumstances which allowed this to 
happen. The minister must do something to offer relief to people 
who now owe thousands of dollars which they cannot repay.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Canada-United States tax convention was modified, thousands of 
people living in Beauce, Quebec and Canada who are drawing 
American pensions are losing a sizeable chunk of those pensions. 
Their cheques have been cut 25 per cent, an extremely harsh 
penalty.
<P>
	The new convention hits those receiving U.S. disability pensions 
even harder, since most of them have dependants and the pension is 
often their main source of income. Some have experienced cuts of 
several hundred dollars a month.
<P>
	I am therefore asking the Minister of Finance to look at 
appropriate measures to lighten the financial burden we have 
recently imposed on these people, most of whom already had 
barely enough to live on.

hundreds of thousands of  dollars in grants, scholarships and

from across the country benefit from this work. Members also 
provide financial products and services such as insurance, savings

Wilfrid Laurier will be the first Quebecer to become Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	He said, at the time: ``I look forward to the day when Canada 
will have a population of 30 million people and when its word will 
shape the destinies of the world''.
<P>
	This and Canada's future were the subject of discussions by the 
people of Brome-Missisquoi last weekend at a forum bringing 
together the members for Burlington, Ontario, and

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to draw the attention of the House to the agreement reached at the 
international congress on antipersonnel mines in Geneva last week.
<P>
	Rather than completely prohibit the use of antipersonnel mines, 
the new protocol proposes that the 57 signatory governments make 
future mines detectible or self-destructible. These governments 
will even have nine years to implement it, and no verification 
process was established.
<P>
	This absurd agreement completely sidesteps the present situation 
caused by existing mines.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would like to express its profound 
disappointment at this agreement, because, between now and the 
next review of the agreement, five years from now, 50,000 more 
people will be killed and another 80,000 will be wounded or 
mutilated. It is just shameful.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the words of the auditor general in his May report with 
regard to environmental stewardship: ``Somebody needs to accept 
full responsibility for the overall implementation of the greening 
process. There is no one in charge who is reporting objectively on 
the status of the greening process across government and as a result 
there is no way to know if the government is meeting its 
objectives''.
<P>
	This is not the first time the auditor general has reported on 
Environment Canada's ineffectiveness. Like the past, probably 
nothing will change in the future.
<P>
	Reform has repeatedly asked for the Minister of the 
Environment to show objectiveness and reason. Sheila Copps 
would scoff at our suggestions and say: ``Look what we have 
done''. Well Sheila, look where you are now.
<P>
	The current minister is showing signs of moving in the same 
direction as Sheila Copps. If he continues to ignore the suggestions 
of the auditor general and of Reform, he may soon find himself in 
poor Sheila's shoes.

	There is a very simple solution to this dilemma. Today, all

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at a time when governments table their budget, and at a 
time when taxpayers are convinced that the fiscal burden could be 
better shared, we learned from the auditor general that some family 
trusts are believed  to have transferred assets of $2 billion to the 
United States, free of tax, with the government's approval. In fact, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2475"> 2475 </A></B>
<P>
senior officials from the Department of Finance made Revenue 
Canada reconsider its position and grant these exemptions.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How can the minister 
justify the fact that two family trusts were allowed to transfer over 
$2 billion worth of assets to the United States, without paying any 
tax on capital gains, this with the government's approval?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
believe that the Minister of National Revenue answered this 
question quite satisfactorily yesterday. This was something that 
happened under the previous government, in 1990-1991. Since 
taking power, we have put into place many measures to rectify this 
sort of situation.
<P>
	That being said, as the minister announced yesterday, we, too, 
are concerned about statements such as this one, and she therefore 
thought it best, and I agree with her, that the matter be referred to 
the finance committee for thorough examination.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would certainly not wish to play cat and mouse with the 
finance minister on a question such as this. He knows full well that 
the very minimal measures he has put in place do absolutely 
nothing at all toward resolving the case we have mentioned here. 
His measures will not resolve this case. It could happen again, it 
could have happened again yesterday. We need some clear answers, 
some real answers.
<P>
	We will simply ask him how he can explain that senior officials 
of the finance department, his department, who are still there, 
according to our information, applied very strong pressure on 
Revenue Canada to allow this tax free transfer of $2 billion in 
assets to the United States. How does he explain that these officials 
still have their jobs and that they work in his department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we obviously have here a situation calling for very serious 
consideration. Indeed, I would say that the questions asked by the 
Leader of the Opposition in a very serious and responsible tone are 
to the point.
<P>
	That said, the auditor general did not mention any pressure from 
finance officials. He said discussions took place, but there were no 
transcripts.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Let us be quite clear. Since coming to office, we have put in 
place many measures dealing specifically with family trusts. In 
fact, not only were measures dealing with family trusts introduced 
by our government in our February 1995 budget, but they went 
much further than recommended by the finance committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> I am 
sure, Mr. Speaker, that the Minister of Finance will not dispute the 
fact that, ever since the Bloc Quebecois was elected to the House of 
Commons, as everyone will recall, we have always condemned the 
unfair advantages attached to family trusts. The minister will also 
recall repeatedly turning the official opposition's claims to 
ridicule, saying that family trusts are no big deal.
<P>
	But the auditor general cited examples. After reviewing two 
cases, just two, he found that $2 billion in assets had been 
transferred. That does not seem insignificant to me.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance acknowledge today that the 
carelessness he has displayed over the past two and a half years, 
while we were demanding aggressive action on his part, is costing a 
small fortune to ordinary Canadians, who do pay their taxes and do 
not benefit from family trusts? If only two cases led to the 
discovery of $2 billion in capital being tax-sheltered abroad, you 
can imagine what the overall amount could represent for Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, the minister said yesterday that she would refer the 
matter to the finance committee. The auditor general himself has 
admitted that this is a grey area, and one that is highly complex. 
Because we feel transparency is of the utmost importance, I believe 
an open discussion in the finance committee is the best way to 
discuss the matter and find a solution. I am sure that the Leader of 
the Opposition will accept this as a responsible reply.
<P>
	Having said this, yes, the Leader of the Opposition is right in 
saying that the Bloc Quebecois were the ones to raise the matter of 
family trusts. That is, moreover, the reason we referred the matter 
of family trusts to the finance committee right at the start of our 
mandate. The Bloc Quebecois has continued to talk, while we have 
acted, doing away in our latest budget with any possibility of using 
family trusts as a means of evading taxes owed to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there must be no more attempts to pull the wool over 
people's eyes. The February 1995 budget contains no measure for 
avoiding such cases, for stopping Canadian capital from being 
siphoned off to the U.S., nothing. As for referring the matter to the 
finance committee, that would require the committee to meet. We 
have been calling for that for two months now, and there have been 
no serious meetings yet to review the taxation system.
<P>
	Since it is obvious that senior finance officials have intervened, 
and in highly dubious circumstances, does the minister 
acknowledge that it is his duty to cast light on the circumstances 
surrounding a decision which will mean the loss of hundreds of 
millions of dollars in revenue to the federal government and to 
Canadians?
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a shame that, in a debate as important as this one, the 
opposition finance critic is unable to assume the same responsible 
tone as his leader.
<P>
	Let me just repeat that, in our 1995 budget, we eliminated any 
possibility to use family trusts for tax purposes.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member, who advocates transparency, to 
tell me this: Is he afraid to see the finance committee review this 
matter? I think the important thing is transparency in showing the 
responsibility borne by the department of revenue, the department 
of finance and the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Let me put 
the question to the Minister of Finance again, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	If the minister is not afraid of reforming the tax system, why is 
he having the work done behind closed doors by the very experts 
who advise their clients to transfer $2 billion to the U.S.? That is 
what is happening.
<P>
	My question to the Minister of Finance is quite simple. Will he 
call for an independent review to be conducted immediately to shed 
light on both cases identified by the auditor general and any other 
case that may have surfaced since, particularly since he became the 
Minister of Finance, because he certainly did nothing to eliminate 
these scandalous family trusts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the House should be aware of what the opposition is asking.
<P>
	A situation had arisen under the previous government and in 
1991 the auditor general reported on it. As in other instances, this 
government takes very seriously the reports of the auditor general. 
We have said we believe that the Canadian people are entitled to 
have all of the facts. We think this should be looked at openly in the 
finance committee.
<P>
	What is the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois saying? He is 
saying: Do it behind closed doors. Do not do it in front of us. Do 
not let the Canadian people have the facts. Do not sit there in open, 
public debate to take a look at it. What is the matter? Are you afraid 
of the truth?

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I asked the Prime Minister whether he was 
willing to enter into a federal-provincial tax relief agreement to 
ensure that tax cuts given by provincial  governments like Ontario 
remained in the pockets of taxpayers.
<P>
	The finance minister responded by saying that the issue had been 
discussed extensively at federal-provincial meetings and that a 
general agreement existed that one level of government would not 
tax away tax reductions made by another.
<P>
	Does such a general agreement in fact exist, and if it does, will 
the finance minister table it in the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member asked this question yesterday and I answered it.
<P>
	I said that there was a general understanding among all of the 
finance ministers that it would be counterproductive for one level 
of government to fill in tax room given by another. What we really 
wanted to do was to get the economy going.
<P>
	He knows there is not a written agreement. I said that yesterday. 
I made it very clear the previous six times he asked the question. 
The matter was discussed among all of the finance ministers and 
that agreement exists. I repeat it here again in the House.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like to ask me the question another 16 
times I will give him the same answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government, through its GST harmonization 
program, temporarily left $170 million in the pockets of New 
Brunswick taxpayers, a tax reduction.
<P>
	Two weeks later the Liberal premier of New Brunswick 
announced that he was working on a new business tax to get that 
$170 million into provincial coffers, a case of one level of 
government taking away a tax reduction granted by another, 
precisely the thing that the finance minister had said the federal and 
provincial governments agreed not to do.
<P>
	Given the fact that his verbal agreement with the provinces is 
obviously being disregarded, will he commit to reaching a written 
federal-provincial tax relief agreement with the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because the leader of the opposition party cannot find anything real 
to talk about, he continues to set up straw men. Let me take the hon. 
member's situation.
<P>
	In order for the governments of Atlantic Canada, the 
Government of New Brunswick in this instance, to go through a 
period of profound structural change leading to very deep tax 
reform, the federal government embarked on a cost sharing 
proposal with Atlantic Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2477"> 2477 </A></B>
<P>
	Effectively that cost sharing proposal said that the provincial 
governments involved would pick up the first 5 per cent loss on 
their revenues and then there would be a sharing after that.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	It was very clear that the provincial governments were going to 
have to make up their losses in two ways: through increased 
economic activity and the possibility of tax increases elsewhere. 
The hon. member has talked about the shift from consumers to 
business. What may well happen in some of the provinces is that 
they may well go back and take some of that tax savings from 
business in order to keep the consumer cost down.
<P>
	The hon. member really ought to understand, first, what was 
done and, second, he ought to try not to contradict himself 
consistently every-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The leader of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> In other 
words, Mr. Speaker, a tax reduction granted by one level of 
government has been sopped up by another level of government, 
which is precisely my point.
<P>
	Yesterday Ontario cut its payroll taxes, something that the 
finance minister and everybody else has said creates jobs. 
However, the federal government is killing jobs by holding its 
payroll taxes high to support an inordinate level of UI contributions 
and proposing further increases to try to stabilize financing of the 
CPP.
<P>
	If there really is a federal-provincial understanding of 
harmonization for tax relief, why is the federal government 
creating upward pressure on payroll taxes while the Ontario 
government is trying to cut payroll taxes at the same time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me point out to the leader of the third party minus three that in the 
last budget, payroll taxes were cut by $1.2 billion.
<P>
	Second, as a result of the deficit actions taken by this 
government and by the provincial governments, interest rates in 
this country are close to 4 percentage points lower than they were 
over a year ago. That is a substantial tax decrease for Canadians.
<P>
	The question I would put to the leader of the Reform Party is 
this. If today he recommends that there be further decreases in 
unemployment insurance premiums, why did he not recommend 
that in his budget of a year ago but recommended instead that 
unemployment insurance premiums be kept at a very high level.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As we go into the second 
round of questions, I hope, and I will be looking for your 
co-operation, for shorter questions and shorter answers.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last Friday, the minister's remarks on the federal government's 
withdrawal from the area of manpower were distressing to say the 
least. So with no follow-up to the proposed agreement tabled by 
Quebec on January 18 and negotiations with Quebec at a standstill, 
the minister acknowledged that the time had come to sit down at 
the table, but with representatives of all the provinces.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the minister's response that Quebec 
should wait until all the representatives of all the provinces reach 
an agreement, when, in Quebec, a consensus was reached years ago 
on the patriation of manpower policies and programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, because the hon. member is 
right. The consensus in Quebec is well known. However, I think 
everyone would agree that, before the federal government puts its 
position forward, we should all be sure what we are prepared to 
propose.
<P>
	Quebec's proposal contains some very interesting points. Our 
commitment is simply that, when we have a proposal ready, and we 
should have one soon, we would like to put the federal proposal to 
the representatives of all the provinces. However, Quebec is 
obviously much further ahead in its approach, and the consensus 
there, which the member referred to, is well known.
<P>
	I hope that once we have clearly defined Canada's position on all 
the issues, not just on manpower training but also on active 
measures, we will be able to move rapidly by sitting down at the 
table with Quebec's representatives and reach an agreement.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has reassured me by saying that the mother of all 
negotiations is not dead.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm he is ready to negotiate with Quebec 
not only on manpower training but on all active measures, as 
requested by Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, of course, there will be rather 
significant differences among the 10 provinces and the territories 
with respect to the resources and networks needed to deliver 
programs. But, to get back to the situation with Quebec, there is no 
doubt that, even in Part II of the Employment Insurance Act, which 
is now before Parliament, all active measures are on the table.
<P>
	As I was saying to the hon. member, the first thing we want to do 
is look at the commitment made by the Prime  Minister and by 
others to withdraw from manpower training, but we are also 
<P>

harmonized GST: ``We think that Albertans will applaud this move 
to an improved tax system''.
<P>
	I invite the Prime Minister to come to Alberta and say that. I 
hope when he comes he brings a very large Inuit carving with him 
because he will need it, I guarantee that.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister explain how his taking a billion dollars 
out of the pockets of Canadians to finance a tax break in Atlantic 
Canada demonstrates the Prime Minister's commitment to equality 
and why will Albertans really applaud the picking of their pockets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what the hon. member requires is a bit of a lesson in understanding 
the nature of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The Canadian economy is very different in Alberta than it is in 
Nova Scotia. It is very different in Ontario than it is in British 
Columbia. For instance, would the hon. member suggest that the 
oil and gas taxation policy be the same in Alberta as applies to the 
manufacturing industry in Ontario? Clearly not, because they are 
different circumstances.
<P>
	We are dealing with deep structural change. It is the kind of 
structural change that let the Canadian government help the 
western grain farmers. At this time Atlantic Canada is going 
through a very positive set of changes and it is the responsibility of 
the Canadian government to enable and facilitate that change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
Canadians want from coast to coast is equal treatment.
<P>
	Ralph Klein, the premier of Alberta, has called for equal tax 
treatment. Even the Prime Minister's little buddy in Alberta, Grant 
Mitchell, has called for equal treatment. He says: ``Albertans 
expect to have the federal portion of the harmonized tax collected 
in Alberta reduced to equal the level collected in those provinces''.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister demonstrate his true commitment 
to fiscal equality by either lowering the GST for the rest of Canada 
or trashing this obvious payoff to Atlantic Canadian premiers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
equal treatment, is the member saying that  the same taxation 
regime should be applied to the oil and gas industry in Alberta as is 
applied to the manufacturing industry in Ontario? Is the hon. 
member saying that Ontario should not have been given a billion 
dollars in stabilization payments in the 1990s? Is he saying the 
federal government should not have helped out with tax reform in 
1972 to compensate for the revenues lost by provinces?
<P>
	If that is what the hon. member is saying, then it is very clear that 
he does not understand the Canadian economy, what holds it

deport Mr. Régalado for reasons of national security.

<P>
	The Minister of Justice has indicated in introducing legislation 
in the House that Parliament and not the courts should settle certain 
important issues. Why then is he content on the issue of same sex 
benefits to allow the courts and tribunals to settle those questions? 
Why will he not table legislation that respects the vote of 
Parliament that same sex benefits not be provided?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what vote my hon. 
friend is referring to.
<P>
	What the government has acted on is discrimination. That is 
what Bill C-33 is about, and any effort to divert the discussion from 
discrimination to collateral matters such as benefits or provincial 
matters such as marriage or adoption is simply an effort to avoid 
the true issue of Bill C-33.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
will check the record that Parliament voted on this in the fall.
<P>
	It was the minister who made this connection when he said in 
<I>XTRA West</I> on March 12, 1994: ``If the government takes the 
position that you cannot discriminate, it follows as a matter of logic 
that you have spousal entitlement to benefits''.
<P>
	Is that his position? If it is not his position, will he clarify any 
legislation before the House to ensure there is not mandatory 
provision of same sex entitlements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no need to clarify Bill 
C-33; it speaks for itself. It deals not with benefits, it deals not with 
marriage, it deals not with adoption. It deals with discrimination, 
which we are against.
<P>
	In terms of benefits and logic, I point out to the hon. member that 
in the years since March, 1994, when that quote was recorded, the 
Supreme Court of Canada decided the case of Egan and Nesbit. It 
decided that notwithstanding that sexual orientation is a ground 
within section 15 of the charter on which discrimination is 
prohibited, the benefits do not automatically follow; so much for 
logic, and that is the law.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	The Sims report on part I of the Canada Labour Code was 
divided in its opinion on the use of replacement workers.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Labour tell us his position on the use of 
replacement workers, commonly known as scabs. I would like a 
clear answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the member said, the Sims report was divided on the 
matter.
<P>
	In April, I consulted within the department. That is now 
concluded. Here again, unfortunately, there was no consensus. I am 
currently giving the matter consideration and will soon submit my 
position to cabinet and to caucus. When the amendments to the 
Canada Labour Code are tabled in the House, the hon. member will 
have the opportunity to learn the government's position, which he 
will no doubt comment on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the minister prepared to say that the use of strike 
breakers aggravates labour disputes and that anti-scab legislation 
would contribute to establishing and maintaining civilized 
negotiations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member that I could propose 
the best labour legislation in the House. If the parties do not bargain 
in good faith, there will always be disputes. So I hope I will be able 
to propose amendments that will bring some balance to collective 
bargaining so we may have industrial peace.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of National Defence tried to 
blame a $250,000 retirement party paid for with taxpayer money on 
his previous chief of defence staff.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	He said: ``We have a new chief of defence staff who has laid 
down the rules to senior military officers that they have to behave 
in a way with the public's money as the public would have them 
behave''.
<P>
	Will the minister today tell the House and Canadians specifically 
the new rule on spending limits on retirement parties?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I answered this 
question fully yesterday.
<P>
	Members of the armed forces must be very cognizant of the 
fiscal realities facing the country. They have to be very careful how 
they administer their budgets.
<P>
	The example given yesterday was obviously extravagant and 
unacceptable. I appreciate that in military tradition ceremony is 
very important, but this must be balanced with the need to be 
prudent with taxpayer money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the auditor general reported serious 
problems with the Department of National Defence's ability to deal 
with the government's increased demands on our troops.
<P>
	How can the minister allow expenditure of taxpayer funds on 
retirement parties when the auditor general reports that equipment 
deficiencies do not allow our troops to perform their assigned tasks 
within acceptable risk levels?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, much of what 
the auditor general said yesterday in his report has been debated in 
the House. It has been the subject of questions and answers in 
question period.
<P>
	Since this government has come to power we have addressed 
those concerns. We have re-equipped by announcing the armoured 
personnel carrier purchase. We have provided new bullet proof 
vests, new guns, new night time vision goggles. We have given a 
lot of new equipment to the army so it can do its job in 
peacekeeping missions.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Today is 
International Red Cross Day.
<P>
	On Parliament Hill and across Canada young Canadians are 
embarking on a worldwide campaign to ban the use of 
anti-personnel land mines. What will the government do to support 
this initiative by the Red Cross and young Canadians to ban land 
mines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, three weeks ago when I visited Bosnia perhaps the most 
disturbing sight was a number of young people who had lost limbs 
due to the vicious weapons of anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	That is why it was so encouraging today to go on the front lawn 
of Parliament Hill where young Canadians  were out showing their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2482"> 2482 </A></B>
<P>
faith and solidarity with other young people around the world to 
share some of the responsibility for bringing to an end the use of 
these awful weapons.
<P>
	Canada is one of the few countries that have banned outright the 
use of anti-personnel land mines. Furthermore, we are leading the 
fight in the United Nations and the OAS to have an outright ban. It 
was very encouraging this morning when the Prime Minister met 
with the German foreign minister who indicated they will work 
with us in a culmination of partnership to bring an end to the use of 
these weapons.
<P>
	That is the way we keep faith with the victims of land mines I 
saw three weeks ago.

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	A Canadian citizen, Stéphane Sbikowski, has been a prisoner in 
a Venezuelan penitentiary for 17 months now, without his case 
having even been heard.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, we asked the Secretary of State for Africa and 
Latin America if she intended to use political pressure to speed up 
the hearing of Mr. Sbikowski's case. Her reply at that time was that 
her department would contact us-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Would the hon. member 
please put his question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> -to inform us of developments. The response 
left something to be desired. Given the danger Mr. Sbikowski is

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the stated 
objective of the minister of fisheries is to downsize the B.C. fishing 
fleet by 50 per cent.
<P>
	The minister knows full well the practical effect of treaty 
negotiations is to reallocate half the fisheries resource. How can the 
minister justify asking the B.C. industry to finance its own 
downsizing when he is prepared to give away half its catch?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member would make up his mind. Two 
days ago it was 25 per cent; now it is 50 per cent. The truth of the 
matter is that this has been taken into consideration. Whether or not 
the hon. member can add, subtract or divide I have to say that the  
allocations will be put in place as part of the fine tuning. Those 
people who have to make the decisions will make the decisions on 
all the information that it is possible to provide them with at the

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. It concerns 
his handling of Patrick Kelly's section 690 application.
<P>
	In this House on February 4, 1994 the minister promised that an 
investigative brief would be prepared. He assured the House that 
standard procedures would be followed. Neither has happened.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Justice ever intend to keep his promises? 
Why did he break them? Why did he change his mind and why 
should we believe him in the future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will overlook the provocative 
nature of the question in order to first acknowledge that the hon. 
member had the courtesy of giving me notice before he asked it, 
although he did not tell me how he was going to ask it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if we could have 
the short version of the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is that an investigative brief 
is a collection of a summary of the evidence. I have done better 
than that in this case. I have given Mr. Kelly's lawyer all the 
evidence. He has had it in his office and Mr. Kelly has had it in 
British Columbia. They have got the evidence. They have got full 
disclosure. I am going to be fully briefed before I make the 
decision. We are going to do it in accordance with the rules.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to raise with the Chair the fact that there appears to have been 
distributed on members' desks at least two pieces of literature, at 
least they have been distributed in this corner. If I read it correctly, 
one appears to be a piece of literature in favour of Bill C-33 and the 
other, if I read it correctly, appears to be a piece of literature against 
Bill C-33. I would like to know who authorized the distribution of 
these.
<P>
	As a rule, parties distribute things on the desks of their members 
and sometimes the House leaves things on the desks for members. 
However, I have been here a while and I do not remember my desk 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2483"> 2483 </A></B>
<P>
ever being turned into a  post office or a propaganda platform for 
whatever position other members may wish to advocate.
<P>
	I would like the Chair to review this matter and at some point to 
make it very clear that people should not be doing this sort of thing. 
We have the right to come to an empty desk. If there are messages 
there from the House or from our respective whips, fine, but let us 
not get into this business of having junk mail on our desks when we 
come into the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fully concur with the sentiments of the hon. member that 
the kind of activity that was tantamount to lobbying on the floor of 
the House via pamphlets is unacceptable.
<P>
	Earlier today I discovered a document which was unsigned and 
was in only one language. I removed it from the desks of Liberal 
MPs, as it is my job as the government whip to do so. I had no such 
authority to remove it from the desks of other members. As to the 
second document, I did not authorize it in any way and only saw it 
after question period started.
<P>
	The two documents were not authorized by me. In the case of the 
first one, I personally removed it from the desks of hon. members 
because no such authority had been sought from nor given by me.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
a second point of order, I would like to register my objection to the 
fact that a New Democratic member was not recognized for 
statements today despite the fact that I was rising from one minute 
after until-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take the issues in 
reverse order.
<P>
	As to the second point of order, it is possibly a matter of debate 
and not a point of order. The chair occupants are conscious of 
members rising and to the best of our ability we see that members 
are recognized accordingly.
<P>
	On the first point of order raised by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona who is a long time serving member of this 
House, he raises a very important issue. I am pleased to hear the 
participation and the contribution of the chief government whip.
<P>
	I want to assure the House upon verification with the Clerk and 
his staff that no member of the House staff distributed those 
materials, so that in fact it would appear they were circulated and 
deposited by a member or members of this House.
<P>
	As your Speaker I would discourage that practice and join the 
hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona and the hon. chief 
government whip in their position on this matter.

restricted weapon registration system and (<I>a</I>), how many of these crimes have 
been solved by tracing the firearm back to the registered owner, and (<I>b</I>) how 
much money has the government spent since 1934 to implement, maintain and 
operate the restricted weapon registration system?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so far as 
the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada and its agency is 
concerned, the answer is as follows.
<P>
	The statistics requested respecting the number of crimes that 
have been solved by tracing the firearm back to the registered 
owner are not kept at this time and are therefore not available. The 
National Tracing Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 
Firearms Registration and Administration Sections (FRAS) which 
was implemented in January 1995 received 131 trace requests from 
Canadian police agencies up to December 1995. Of these traces, 64 
firearms were traceable to either a dealer or an owner. However, 
these traces involved unregistered firearms.
<P>
	The funds expended by the government to operate the restricted 
weapon registration system and FRAS are as follows:

<P>
	The source of these figures is the RCMP's finance and supply 
branch. Since 1978 the reports available do not have unit names or 
collator numbers identifying them. They are identified by unit 
financial code (UFC) and these may have changed over time. The 
only way to ensure that we are using the correct UFC is to factor in 
program activity structure (PAS) for that period. Unfortunately, we 
do not have a PAS before 1978.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFREPORTSTAGE">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF REPORT STAGE</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-33, an act to amend 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, as reported (without amendment) 
from the committee; and of motions in Group No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-33. This legislation will amend the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to include sexual orientation.
<P>
	Currently the act forbids discrimination against Canadians 
because of their race, national or ethnic origins, colour, religion, 
age, marital status, family status or disabilities.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2488"> 2488 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of this legislation is to insert into the act that which 
the courts have already declared into law in Canada. We know there 
is much emotion surrounding this bill. We also know this has been 
a policy of the federal Liberals since 1978, affirmed again at our 
last policy convention in 1994.
<P>
	We know also that this has been included in the acts of eight 
provinces and territories in Canada. My province of Ontario 
introduced sexual orientation into its human rights act in 1986, 
some ten years ago. We also know the human rights commissions 
of all remaining Canadian jurisdictions have recommended that 
sexual orientation be added to human rights legislation.
<P>
	There seems to be a lot of confusion and misinterpretation 
regarding this legislation. Much of it centres around its possible 
effects on the family. I remind the House the family is important to 
me, as it is to the people of Guelph- Wellington. Family must be 
the centre of our lives. I would not hesitate to speak out against any 
legislation which would end the importance of our families. That is 
why I am pleased to note in the bill's preamble these important 
words: ``And whereas the government recognizes and affirms the 
importance of family as the foundation of Canadian society and 
that nothing in this act alters its fundamental role in society''.
<P>
	Those are comforting words. The family is the foundation of 
society and must continue to be respected and promoted as such. 
The preamble's purpose is to remind Canadians and 
parliamentarians that the act deals with discrimination in 
employment and the provision of goods and services. The 
fundamental role of family will not be altered by this amendment.
<P>
	Canada is the best country in the world. We do not need the 
United Nations to remind us of that, although it continues to do so 
in poll after poll. It is the best country because of our cherished 
tradition of caring for one another. Health care, social services, 
education and public pensions are examples of why the world looks 
to us as a nation to copy.
<P>
	Canadians enjoy the unique privilege of being the world's best. 
Our federal government must lead by defending the principle of 
equality for all Canadians, everyone. Our social programs and our 
health care are not the only reason we are the best. We are the best 
because we have shown tolerance and understanding to each other. 
We care for our aged. We look out for one another in need and we 
do not accept bigotry, intolerance or discrimination.
<P>
	There seems to be a lot of discussion about the legislation which 
would in effect cover about 10 per cent  of the workforce. The act 
specifies that a person cannot be fired, denied a promotion or 
refused access to goods and services because of who they are. 
However, sometimes it is important to remind Canadians of what 
legislation does not say.
<P>
	In this case the act does not apply to religious, cultural or 
educational institutions. It does not apply to residential 
accommodation. It does not apply to retail and manufacturing 
businesses and it does not apply to provincial jurisdictions. It does 
not tell us what to do in our homes.
<P>
	Canadians cannot accept intolerance. Certainly no one, 
particularly those in positions of power or leadership, would accept 
that people should be fired or placed at the back of a room or a bus 
because someone else finds their colour, their religion, their age, 
their sexual orientation offensive. Or would they?
<P>
	It is possible there are still some Canadians who would rather 
fire an employee, no matter how good that person is, because a 
client or a customer is somehow offended by their colour or who 
they are.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Those ideas proved the worth of this legislation. Those ideas 
proved Canadians still need protection, not special rights, because 
they happen to be black, Jewish, Chinese or over 50 years old.
<P>
	Reformers argue they want to see the list of prohibited grounds 
repealed altogether, ensuring equal treatment for all Canadians. 
Obviously they do not all agree.
<P>
	However, let me challenge them to visit a seniors group and 
remind them they want to end protection based on age. Let them 
visit a synagogue, mosque or Christian church and tell the 
congregation they want to end protection based on religion. Let 
them visit women who have been fired or who lacked promotion 
because of the simple fact they are women.
<P>
	We need no lesson on equality from Reformers. The sad reason 
we need to protect people is that there are those in this great 
country who believe the back of the bus is the place for some of us. 
There are those who believe the back of the room is the place to 
hide while bigotry, racism and intolerance are accepted.
<P>
	We as a government, as elected officials, must take a stand and 
say we do not tolerate bigotry. We cannot accept that some 
Canadians, our sons, daughters, mothers, daughters, co-workers, 
employees and friends, are denied goods and services, are 
overlooked for promotion, are ignored or, worse, beaten because of 
who they are. The only thing we must be intolerant of is intolerance 
against others.
<P>
	This amendment has the support of such national organizations 
as the Canadian Jewish Congress, the YWCA, the Canadian 
Bankers Association, the Canadian Bar Association and the 
Anglican Church of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2489"> 2489 </A></B>
<P>
	I know there is concern about this legislation. Much of this 
concern has resulted from the importance of marriage and family. 
I know there are individuals who enjoy stretching the facts. These 
same people said that gun control would lead to confiscation and 
that Bill C-41 would lead to the legalization of pedophilia.
<P>
	However, what we are doing here is recognizing that certain 
Canadians require our protection in certain parts of their lives. This 
does not condone what they do elsewhere.
<P>
	Allow me to quote Sean Durkan from the May 5, 1996 edition of 
the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Telling someone they must sit at the back of the bus until such a time as a way 
can be worked out to place everyone at the back of that bus does not cut it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is time to get off that bus and back on the road to tolerance and 
understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
informed the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth would like to 
have Motion No. 8 withdrawn because it is substantially the same 
as Motion No. 7. I have consulted with the whips of the two other 
parties and they have no objection to this proposition.
<P>
	There is a consequential amendment, I have been told. Perhaps I 
could indicate to other members to examine Motion No. 1 because 
I think it is consequential to Motion No. 8; it has a direct 
relationship.
<P>
	In any case, I would like to now ask if the House would consent 
to have Motion No. 8 withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Do we have 
the unanimous consent of the House to withdraw Motion No. 8 in 
Group No. 3?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I have another point of order. 
There is also Motion No. 1 which I would like to ask colleagues to 
examine. I believe it is purely consequential by the information 
given to me. Perhaps after the next debate we could have it 
removed because it is consequential. Now that No. 8 does not exist 
that amendment does not do anything. If the House is satisfied with 
that I will come back to the House in a few minutes, perhaps after 
the next speaker.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member speaking about society.
<P>
	I stand in a House that was built on the principle of democracy 
and today I watched the government vote against democracy. By 
moving closure on this debate it is stopping the people from having 
their say. If members  want to talk about hypocrisy they had better 
start doing what they are supposed to be doing in a supposedly 
democratic House.
<P>
	I wish to express the strong opposition of my constituents to the 
government's legislation for adding the undefined phrase sexual 
orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Since I became a member of Parliament in 1993 no issue, no 
government action or inaction, has provoked such an outpouring of 
letters, faxes and petitions to my office. No issue has had a greater 
impact, yet closure has been moved in the House on it.
<P>
	People are concerned for many reasons. First is the needless 
haste, the almost diehard rush of the government, to ram this very 
important legislation through Parliament without giving the people 
of Canada adequate opportunity to study its possible impacts and to 
reach public agreement on whether it is advisable.
<P>
	The government is pretending, because the bill is so short, that 
there is virtually nothing in it. People give more apparent thought 
to getting the oil changed in their cars than the government has 
given to adding the undefined phrase sexual orientation to a list in 
the human rights act of forbidden grounds of discrimination.
<P>
	One other action of this government provoked a similar degree 
of public protest and that was Bill C-68, which will take police 
officers off our streets in order to process gun registrations for 
law-abiding Canadians while doing virtually nothing to end the 
criminal misuse of firearms. For that legislation the same justice 
minister made a point of bragging how he had consulted with the 
public.
<P>
	Day after day he read to hon. members a list of the groups which 
he visited, a list of the groups which supported that very 
controversial legislation. He apparently made a point of at least 
notifying such groups and now we hear from the groups that this 
was not true in all cases. But he did express this. He seriously 
considered amendments, if not outright in their opposition to his 
legislation, to at least seek consensus and to answer their concerns 
by modifying his original proposal.
<P>
	I believe his legislation was bad because there is no proof that it 
will ever reduce criminal misuse of firearms. At least the justice 
minister gave an appearance of listening to the people. However, 
not in this case.
<P>
	Currently the Canadian pension plan secretariat has been helping 
with hearings across Canada so that all Canadians can have the 
opportunity to speak about changes to their pension.
<P>
	When the subject of doctor assisted suicide came before 
Parliament during the first session, the other place held extensive 
hearings and produced a significant report. The government ap-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2490"> 2490 </A></B>
<P>
peared to listen because it did  not proceed with legislation. Even 
now the government is listening to different groups.
<P>
	Let us look at the Devco development, the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation, which will seriously affect the future of 
the Atlantic region, especially the Cape Breton coal mining 
industry. It is prompting serious Senate hearings to examine the 
plans put forward. Community members and labour leaders as well 
as local legislatures have had opportunity to come to Ottawa and 
lobby members, including officials of Natural Resource Canada, to 
try to ensure that the best possible decision is made.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We are all aware that sometimes such hearings are more for 
public relations than for the real purpose of listening to Canadians. 
However, the people of Canada can at least hope that the 
government will listen to them. The people can at least get the 
impression that Parliament, including the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet, is acting as responsibly as possible about issues which 
Canadians perceive to be important. Not in this case.
<P>
	Past governments have viewed it as being so important that 
people must have hope they will be listened to that they even added 
a special section to the Criminal Code so that some of the worst 
criminals in our history would be guaranteed the opportunity of 
getting a hearing for early parole, even if they have been a serial 
murderer who has been tried and found guilty. Sometimes they 
have even confessed their guilt for the killing of many people and 
for the terrible pain and suffering they have inflicted on the 
surviving family and friends. Supposedly even those murderers 
must be assured that there is some hope they will be listened to by 
the government.
<P>
	Surely the fact that every member of Parliament has received 
hundreds if not thousands of faxes, letters and petitions about the 
government's plan to add the undefined phrase sexual orientation 
to the human rights act ought to have convinced even this 
government that the people of Canada view this legislation as very 
serious business indeed.
<P>
	What do we get? We get closure. A gag order. That is the 
government's response to the people of Canada.
<P>
	Is the government listening? No. Is it showing respect for the 
fact that very often the people of Canada have a collective wisdom 
which is far greater than anything displayed by a government? No. 
Is the government holding cross country hearings? No. Will there 
be a Senate committee appointed to look into the issue? No.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is turning his back on the Canadian 
people. He is listening instead to a very small special interest 
group. He has not made any significant effort to seek a consensus 
from Canadians on how he should proceed.
<P>
	The government has brought forward Bill C-33 with the kind of 
extreme haste that reasonable people could only expect when 
dealing with a major national emergency. By contrast, the west 
coast grain handlers went on strike during the first session of the 
35th Parliament, putting thousands of people out of work and 
threatening Canada's international reputation as a reliable supplier 
of grain. Even then the government did not act with such haste.
<P>
	What effort has the justice minister made on Bill C-33 to contact 
groups which could reasonably be expected to have concerns or 
perhaps to oppose the legislation outright? What effort has the 
government made to seek the consensus of Canadians before 
proceeding with legislation to add the undefined phrase sexual 
orientation to the human rights act?
<P>
	The laws that are made and passed in the House will affect the 
people of Canada forever, yet the government refuses to consult the 
people. It is shameful.
<P>
	Unlike serial killers, which the government thinks must have the 
hope of special hearings, it gives people opposed to including the 
undefined phrase sexual orientation in the human rights act no hope 
at all that their concerns will be examined. Instead it substitutes 
name calling, like bigot, racist and homophobic to anybody who 
stands up to question the legislation. That is how much respect the 
government has for democracy.
<P>
	The second reason I oppose the legislation is that members of 
Parliament have not been given any proof that homosexuals and 
lesbians are not being paid fairly, are not being promoted or are not 
being admitted as students in our colleges and universities. On the 
contrary, we have proof. The member for Port Moody-Coquitlam 
pointed out to the government that the gay population in North 
America appears to have full access to a standard of living which is 
considerably above average.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The government usually presents hon. members with pages and 
pages of statistics regarding, for example, the recognizably lower 
household incomes of aboriginal peoples compared with 
non-aboriginal peoples, or the much smaller percentage of women 
compared with men in management positions. We gets reams of 
statistics on these issues from the government.
<P>
	Where are the pages, where are the statistics on this issue? 
Nowhere. The answer is clear. The government has no statistics to 
support this legislation. It has never had any statistics supporting 
this legislation.
<P>
	I would like to remind my hon. colleagues that the government 
also assured Canadians that passing the Young Offenders Act 
would not result in an increase of any youth crime. on the contrary, 
from 1986 to 1994, violent youth crime-

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to comment on Bill C-33, an act to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act which will prohibit discrimination on 
the grounds of sexual orientation.
<P>
	The proposals have generated deep, passionate and powerful 
discussion on both sides of the issue, and a maelstrom of notions of 
family, religion and entitlement to benefits. There are strongly held 
views among my colleagues in the House, among my constituents 
of Erie, among the citizens of this country.
<P>
	I respect and have considered the views of all who have written 
letters, placed phone calls to my office and made personal 
presentations. I am most appreciative of their time, their concerns 
and their prayers. I listened intently to the differing opinions and 
approaches of each individual and organization that made 
presentations to the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the 
Status of Disabled Persons. I have thought long and hard on this 
issue, at times with confusion, at times with anxiety, at times with 
anguish and finally with resolve.
<P>
	Now the time has come to take a stand, to cast a vote. In full 
knowledge of the free vote status of this decision, I have concluded 
that I will support Bill C-33 for a very good reason: It is simply the 
right thing to do. Let me explain.
<P>
	This issue is one of human rights, of dignity, of equality, of the 
universal principle that no individual should be discriminated 
against because of who or what they are.
<P>
	The federal government as well as every province and territory 
in Canada has human rights legislation. The current Canadian 
Human Rights Act contains a list of prohibited grounds of 
discrimination which includes race, colour, religion, age, sex, 
marital or family status and disability. Canadians are protected 
whether they are of Italian, Sri Lankan or English stock, black, 
yellow, brown or white, Jewish, Christian or Muslim, young or old, 
man or woman, married or single, parent or childless. The act does 
not create any special group or any special rights. This bill would 
add the term sexual orientation to that list, no special group, no 
special rights.
<P>
	The application of the Canadian Human Rights Act is restricted 
to employment in and the provision of goods and services by the 
federal government and federally regulated businesses such as 
banks, airlines and telecommunications companies. These 
organizations employ about 10 per cent of the workforce which 
makes for a very limited application. Most employers such as 
schools, small businesses and religious and cultural organizations 
are regulated provincially and would not be affected by the 
proposed legislation.
<P>
	There are four basic reasons why sexual orientation should be 
included in the Canadian Human Rights Act. First, as a matter of 
fundamental fairness, the amendment will ensure that Canadians 
cannot be discriminated against in the areas of federal 
employment, accommodation and access to goods and services 
solely because of their sexual orientation. This means, for example, 
Canadians cannot be fired for being homosexual or indeed 
heterosexual.
<P>
	Some may say it is not necessary in this day and age. Let me 
remind the House of the recent intemperate, base and 
discriminating remarks made against blacks and homosexuals by 
two Reform members of the House, the highest court in the land. 
These inexcusable comments sickened me and Canadians 
everywhere. Some may say it is necessary, very much so.
<P>
	Second, it is necessary to bring the text of the Canadian Human 
Rights Act into conformity with the charter. The Ontario Court of 
Appeal in Haig v. Canada held that the Canadian Human Rights Act 
would in future be read as though sexual orientation were already a 
prohibited ground of discrimination. It is already with us. The 
courts are already setting policy which should be a prerogative of 
Parliament. It is our responsibility, indeed our obligation, to codify 
this fundamental right and principle of equality. The courts are 
telling parliamentarians to do our jobs or they will do it for us.
<P>
	Third, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously held in Egan 
and Nesbitt v. Canada that sexual orientation is a prohibited ground 
of discrimination under the equality provisions of section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The problem is the 
charter does not apply to private companies and federally regulated 
industries. The Canadian Human Rights Act does. Accordingly the 
Canadian Human Rights Act is being amended to give protection 
on the basis of sexual orientation to gays and lesbians in the private 
sector workplace.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Fourth, the proposed amendment will bring the federal act into 
conformity with eight provinces and territories which have already 
amended their human rights legislation to include sexual 
orientation: Quebec in 1977, Ontario in 1986, Yukon in 1987, Nova 
Scotia in 1991, New Brunswick in 1992, British Columbia in 1992, 
and Saskatchewan in 1993. The nature of this legislation is not new 
or revolutionary. We are simply catching up to the provinces.
<P>
	My constituents are surprised on being reminded that in 1986 the 
province of Ontario added sexual orientation as a prohibited 
ground in its human rights legislation. Did this open the 
floodgates? Not as a matter of course, not automatically. Indeed 
eight long years later the Ontario government introduced specific 
legislation, Bill 167, directed at enlarging the definition of spousal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2492"> 2492 </A></B>
<P>
relationships in Ontario, that same sex couples were  entitled to the 
same rights as applied to common law heterosexual couples.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the bill was defeated. Let us not lose 
the logic of this event. Issues such as adoption by homosexuals 
were separate and distinct and did not automatically follow the 
adding of sexual orientation to the Ontario human rights 
legislation. No, we were not consumed by the flood waters.
<P>
	Let me continue with a brief but most important consideration of 
what the Canadian Human Rights Act does not do. It does not 
negatively impact on the traditional family nor change the 
definition of marriage, family or spouse. This is explicitly 
reinforced in the preamble where it is stated ``-the government 
recognizes and affirms the importance of family as the foundation 
of Canadian society and that nothing in this act alters its 
fundamental role in society''.
<P>
	In fact the Supreme Court of Canada in the Mossop case rejected 
claims that the term ``family status'' in the Canadian Human Rights 
Act includes couples of the same sex. This was the decision of the 
court then and remains the law now. It is good law that I agree with.
<P>
	It does not condone nor condemn sexual orientation, neither 
homosexuality nor heterosexuality. It does not extend same sex 
benefits to partners of gays and lesbians. Again the Supreme Court 
of Canada in the Egan case refused to support the extension of 
pension benefits to same sex partners in its decision that the Old 
Age Security Act does not violate the charter by defining spouse to 
apply only to couples of the opposite sex.
<P>
	It does not legitimize nor legalize pedophilia, which is a crime 
under the Criminal Code of Canada, whether the perpetrator is 
heterosexual or homosexual and is not a matter of sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	As mentioned, I also took note of submissions by the witnesses 
before the human rights committee which coloured an overriding 
element of this debate, the human element. I listened to the 
opinions of psychiatrists who confirmed that a homosexual 
orientation was not learned or influenced behaviour but set in the 
womb by the mysteries of conception and fetal development. I 
listened to a young female who stood in the top five percentile of 
the officer rank only to be honourably discharged from the 
Canadian Armed Forces solely because she was a lesbian.
<P>
	There was the love of mothers of gay and lesbian children all of 
whom struggled with their child's sexual orientation, fear, societal 
rejection and persecution and ultimately acceptance and peace, as 
well as the wasteful suicides of the many who did not. There were 
comments and support by the Ottawa-Carleton regional police 
chief and two officers from the bias crime units who denounced 
discrimination, intolerance and hate. There were the 
representations of various religious groups who  came down 
forcefully and convincingly on both sides of the argument.
<P>
	It is interesting that those who opposed the legislation for 
religious reasons adamantly affirmed their abhorrence for 
discrimination but feared the slippery slope which they felt the 
legislation could lead to. Am I to vote against the basic 
fundamental human right on fears that it may lead to something 
else? Is this correct, is this right, especially when one notes the 
familial interpretation of our courts to date?
<P>
	I also wish to send a message to members of the homosexual 
community cautioning them not to chortle with glee on the passage 
of this legislation. I strongly support the traditional family and 
heterosexual spouses. I strongly oppose same sex marriages, 
adoption or measures that advocate a homosexual lifestyle and 
would vote against legislative initiatives in this regard. Bill C-33 
does not fall in this category.
<P>
	Bill C-33 is not a gay rights bill as its opponents and the media 
delight in its reference. It is a human rights bill, pure and simple.
<P>
	Bill C-33 is not about special rights for anyone. It is about equal 
rights for everyone. All Canadians have a fundamental right to be 
free from discrimination. It is not enough to be against 
discrimination. We must act to prevent discrimination.
<P>
	Let me bring this discussion to a personal level. What parent 
could argue that a son or daughter who is gay or lesbian should 
have less protection from workplace discrimination or less access 
to services than anyone else? Not this parent of five children.
<P>
	It is often said that a society is judged by how the majority treats 
its minorities. Canada's world renowned and admirable human 
rights record speaks volumes of who we are as a people. Bigotry 
cannot be changed overnight. We must educate, we must learn. The 
objective of this legislation is to end discrimination, nothing more 
and nothing less. In all good conscience, who could not support this 
objective?

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, recently I was 
interviewed by a reporter from a major newspaper in western

experience as a politician and a parliamentarian.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2493"> 2493 </A></B>
<P>
	I explained to her that I had never been a politician before 1993, 
that it was the first time I had been elected to anything. When 
she asked me how I found politics I frankly told her that I certainly 
had had my eyes opened in the last two and one-half years. She 
kept at me asking me what I meant and what kind of experience 
it had been for me. I told her that to be bluntly honest, politics 
is a dirty, rotten, slimy business in Canada. When she asked me 
to explain, I said I could not think of a better way to illustrate 
and underline that than what was going on with Bill C-33.
<P>
	Hundreds and hundreds of letters and phone calls and faxes are 
coming from people from all over Canada to my office and to all 
the members' offices in Ottawa, to my constituency office and even 
to my home. The only other piece of legislation that has caused as 
much of an uproar in my constituency as this legislation has is Bill 
C-68 which as my colleague pointed out also came from this same 
minister.
<P>
	At least on Bill C-68, we had the opportunity for a full and open 
debate. Yes, the government adopted legislation that flew in the 
face of what a majority of Canadians wanted. Yes, the government 
forced its will on the people, but at least there was the opportunity 
for the bill to be debated in public for an extended period time. The 
justice committee had an opportunity to examine the legislation 
and propose amendments to it and to call witnesses. It was a 
protracted debate. At least there was an opportunity for Canadians 
to express their widespread opposition to it. Unfortunately in the 
end, it went through but at least the process was adhered to.
<P>
	In this instance, a piece of legislation is being rammed through 
this House of Commons without debate. The government is trying 
to get this legislation passed before Canadians wake up and realize 
what is going on.
<P>
	The government would like to have it a done deal before it has to 
face the music. Those who write editorials have not even had a 
chance to pick at this and highlight some of the discrepancies in the 
minister's statements and some of the discrepancies in what the 
legislation purports to do and actually will do. The government 
wants to have this all a done deal, put away in the closet before 
Canadians wake up.
<P>
	This bill is not about discrimination. As my colleague who also 
asked, show us where there is a problem with discrimination 
against homosexuals in Canada. Show us where this kind of 
legislation is required. It does not exist.
<P>
	This legislation is not about equality. It is about inequality. It is 
about special status. In the minister's own words, he says one thing 
to one group of people, one special interest group and then he 
stands up in front of all Canadians and says something completely 
different. He tells the gay community: ``This is a major win for you 
guys''. Then he tells Canadians: ``Do not worry, this is basically 
window dressing. It is an amendment to  the human rights code so 
that there is no discrimination against gay and lesbian people''.
<P>
	Clearly, there is a real hypocrisy going on behind the scenes that 
will not stand the light of day. I spoke with people outside on the 
steps of this House who are protesting what is going on in here. 
They know full well the hypocritical remarks the minister has 
made, the duplicity of the government's bill and its attempt to ram 
it through without debate, invoking closure time and again.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Unbelievable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> It is unbelievable and it is unacceptable. 
This is not democracy. This is a minister who has a very narrow 
agenda. He is imposing his will not only on the Canadian people, 
but on his colleagues as well. I am sure most of them did not want 
to see the legislation come before the House and certainly do not 
want to support it. However, this is the way democracy works in 
Canada today.
<P>
	It calls into question the parliamentary process and underlines 
the need for the changes that the Reform Party of Canada has 
proposed. But I will not get into that right now. I will stay on the 
subject.
<P>
	The justice minister has admitted in his public statements that 
Bill C-33 will lead to special status. I do not have his quote in front 
of be, so I will paraphrase: ``Obviously, when you recognize the 
sexual orientation aspect of this bill it must lead to same sex 
benefits and the recognition of marital status''. It cannot help but 
do that.
<P>
	The justice minister knows it full well because he said it. He is 
the representative of the Canadian public on justice matters. He 
cannot stand now and tell the Canadian people that that is not what 
the bill is all about. I know we are not allowed to use certain words 
in the House, and it is unfortunate because sometimes those words 
are needed to describe the actions of some members.
<P>
	I have received in my office about 180 calls and faxes from 
constituents. They have said very clearly and overwhelmingly: 
``Do not support this legislation. Vote against it''. On the other side 
I got one phone call in the last two weeks saying: ``I want you to 
support this legislation''. All the rest have said no. We are 
receiving petitions daily.
<P>
	The government is trying to ram and stuff this legislation 
through the House so quickly that members cannot get petitions 
through the clerk of petitions fast enough to get them into the 
House before the legislation becomes law. How can this be called a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2494"> 2494 </A></B>
<P>
democracy when people do not even get a chance to express their 
opinions by petitioning the government and have the petitions  duly 
noted and recorded before the legislation becomes reality?
<P>
	What is going on with this legislation? It does not stand the light 
of day. It is what gives Parliament a bad name. It is what the 
Liberals ranted and railed about when they were in opposition and 
the Conservatives invoked closure and time allocation time after 
time. Now, when they are the government they are doing exactly 
the same thing. Obviously, they were crying crocodile tears back 
then. They have no real commitment to democracy. They have no 
real commitment to opening up the House and allowing proper 
debate to take place. They have no real inclination to move with the 
Canadian people on these issues. They want to impose their vision 
on the Canadian people.
<P>
	There is a gulf between the vision of this government and its 
cabinet and the vision of the Canadian people. A gulf is widening in 
many ways. This is another example. It is undermining the faith of 
ordinary Canadians in their government and in the system.
<P>
	I submit that as long as we continue down this road that gulf will 
widen even more and the Canadian people will become more 
disillusioned. I also submit, as I have said many times in the House, 
this government by these actions, by this arrogant, top down social 
engineering attitude is going to destroy itself. It has to face the 
voters in the next election. It will have to explain to ordinary 
Canadians why it invoked time allocation and closure and why it 
rammed this legislation through the House of Commons, why it 
ignored the wishes of ordinary Canadians right across Canada. It 
will pay the price.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	In the meantime, it is certainly a sad day for our nation that the 
government is moving with as much speed as I have ever seen on 
any piece of legislation to ram this through and make it a done deal 
before Canadians even realize what is going on.
<P>
	I conclude by saying what I said to the reporter. Politics in 
Canada in 1996 is a dirty, rotten, slimy business.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
proud to rise today to support Bill C-33.
<P>
	I have listened for some time now to both sides of the argument. 
I have listened to some exaggerations sometimes on both sides. 
However, when we get right down to the essential facts of the issue 
we have to accept that it is clearly a human rights issue. There is no 
other way of looking at it.
<P>
	We can look at every aspect of it. If we look at the provinces we 
see that most have already adopted this measure in their human 
rights acts. It has existed for 20 years in Quebec and for 10 years in 
Ontario. It has not changed the interpretation of adoption in those  
provinces. In the Ontario legislature it had to be introduced as a 
separate bill which was defeated at that time. Therefore the courts 
have not used this section as a way of interpreting spousal benefit, 
adoption, marital status or whatever. It has nothing whatever to do 
with that. It strictly deals with discrimination, plain and simple.
<P>
	Many of us have in our lifetimes experienced discrimination. 
Those people who have never had to deal with it have no idea what 
it does to a person's sense of self-respect, self-being and the ability 
to continue on with their lives. I have experienced some of that in 
my lifetime. I come from a community where at the time that kind 
of discrimination was meted out. There are many other groups that 
still deal with that daily.
<P>
	As a country, we are proud to deal with minorities. We have 
always said we must protect minorities, otherwise we have no 
democracy. If it is strictly a rule of the majority then there is no 
democracy.
<P>
	This issue does not deal with pedophilia, as some people are 
suggesting. Pedophilia is a crime. To suggest this bill does anything 
but give people basic human rights is distorting the facts. We can 
distort and misrepresent people's statements all we want but the 
facts will not change no matter which way we look at it. We can 
read people's statements and misinterpret and misrepresent them 
but that does not change the fact that this is a basic issue of human 
rights and nothing else.
<P>
	We talk about families. All the amendments refer in one way or 
another to the traditional family and how this is to affect family 
structure. I defy anyone to tell me exactly what the perfect family 
is. Some of my colleagues will say it is husband, wife, children, 
perhaps adopted, and maybe pets. However, we have single 
mothers, single fathers, older siblings raising younger siblings, 
aunts, uncles and grandparents raising children. We have all kinds 
of family structures.
<P>
	We also have children who go from one divorce to another where 
the parent may have divorced two or three times. We have families 
from which someone has been abandoned. We have families in 
which there is abuse and the children must be taken away. We have 
a majority of good families, but family is a term that basically 
means a place where children are nurtured, looked after and raised 
with love, attention and stimulation.
<P>
	I have risen in the House many times to talk about issues like 
child poverty, child care and assisting parents with their children so 
that we do not have situations such as the one mentioned recently in 
the Toronto <I>Star</I> in which a mother left her five-year-old to look 
after a two-year-old in the library. Or another in which an 
eleven-year old was at home looking after two younger siblings 
because the mother was working. They are locked in the home after 
school hours. There are many cases of latch key kids in society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2495"> 2495 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	That to me is a moral issue. A society that does not make 
children its priority, does not ensure the development of the 
children both emotionally and nutritionally is protected, is 
hindering the future of those children. That is a moral issue.
<P>
	We do not have enough discussions about that. I do not hear a 
great deal of uproar and indignation about those issues in the 
House. I would like to hear members opposite talk about how we 
might eradicate child poverty in Canada, how we might address the 
fact that children are living on the streets and that education is 
being cut back in Ontario and in Alberta. These are moral issues. I 
do not hear any member opposite standing up and fighting for those 
issues. Instead I hear fearmongering on the issue of rights.
<P>
	I learned the other day that South Africa has a new constitution 
and a new bill of rights. Guess what? South Africa has written into 
its bill of rights sexual orientation without any qualifiers. South 
Africa not too long ago practised apartheid, which we fought by 
boycott. South Africa has acknowledged before we have basic 
human rights in its society, a very interesting twist.
<P>
	With respect to these changes we have heard talk about crime, 
pedophilia and all kinds of horrible things, and spousal benefits and 
whatever else. If anyone looked at the history of Canada, what has 
happened in the provinces, what has happened in Supreme Court 
decisions before this, that has not been the case. We cannot make 
legislation on the basis of prejudice. We have to make legislation to 
protect minorities. As a society that is the only way we can move 
ahead and ensure we have a society which reflects in its every day 
actions tolerance and respect for one another and which protects its 
minorities.
<P>
	I have no problem whatsoever supporting this legislation. To me 
it is a basic issue of human rights. It has nothing whatever to do 
with moral issues. There are many other moral issues on which I 
wish to spend my time and for which I wish to fight so we can enter 
the 21st century having eradicated child poverty. We must deal 
with the very issues on which members opposite are talking. We 
must strengthen individuals within society.
<P>
	When we talk about family we keep forgetting that gay and 
lesbians come from families. They are people's children. They 
have not just appeared out of thin air. They are children of 
heterosexual couples. I am sure they are loved and supported by 
their parents. We are not inventing these people. This is not a 
choice.
<P>
	I dare anyone in the House to tell me that being lesbian or gay is 
a matter of choice. If it were a choice, why would anyone choose to 
be discriminated against, to be abused, to be attacked physically 
and to commit suicide because life is so difficult? Why would they 
choose such a tortuous way to live when they could easily  choose 
another, much easier way to live? It is not a choice.
<P>
	The legislation must address that issue. We have to deal with 
basic human rights in Canada. I am very proud to stand here to say I 
support the legislation. I hope other members of the House will 
find it within themselves to deal with the realities and be generous 
enough to acknowledge the realities and to support the bill as well.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address at report stage Bill C-33 and to discuss the issue 
itself.
<P>
	There has been much debate about issues concerning the rights 
and status of gays and lesbians in society. It is an issue of vital 
importance. It involves many aspects of social policy.
<P>
	This is a divisive issue. Whether members argue in favour of this 
bill or against it, it should not be construed, as some in the House 
have done, that they are bigots, racists or prejudiced. There are 
solid arguments on both sides of this issue. There are many 
Canadians who feel both ways on this issue, as witnessed by many 
of the polls. Therefore it is our obligation to listen to what everyone 
has to say and not start branding and labelling each other as bigots 
and racists, as has been happening this past week.
<P>
	This issue involves two things, and the legal rights of the 
individual should not be construed as legal rights of groups. The 
first is the matter of discrimination and the legal rights of the 
individual. The equality rights provision in section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not specifically 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, although 
several court decisions and a number of analyses have concluded 
that section 15 is open and does cover sexual orientation. In other 
words, many argue and judges have ordered that it be read into 
court decisions, that it is there. Therefore many believe it should be 
specifically written in the charter along with race and the rest on 
the list.
<P>
	One of the amendments the Reform Party will be putting forward 
is not to have a list. We believe in the equality of all citizens and all 
peoples, and no one, no matter who they are or what they are, 
should be discriminated against, period. It is the list that causes 
confusion. It is the list that causes hatred. It is the list that needs to 
be removed.
<P>
	On the legal rights of the group, there is the slippery slope 
argument that if we add the words sexual orientation it will lead to 
same sex benefits and same sex marriage, which at the present time 
in Canada are not permitted. Spouse is defined in heterosexual 
terms, not homosexual terms. These are the fears many in Canada 
have, that this bill will lead to something else. They are against

discrimination, as I am, but they are also against  same sex 
benefits, same sex marriage, same sex adoption and erosion of 
the family.
<P>
	Why not define sexual orientation? Why not look at the list and 
not have a list? Those are some questions this party has asked. On 
that basis many on the other side are saying we are for 
discrimination.
<P>
	I stand before the House and I say I am against discrimination 
but I am also against same sex marriages, same sex adoption and 
same sex benefits because those are rights and benefits society 
gives, and they are privileges. It is not against the law for an 
employer not to grant same sex benefits. If they want to do it, they 
can. It should not be the law that they must. There is a fear that this 
will lead to that. I do not have that problem but some do. I am 
trying to point out there are arguments on both sides.
<P>
	If this bill passes, as it will because the Liberals have enough 
members to vote for it, if the homosexual communities then use the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to say in a legal argument, in a court 
case, that because company X has denied same sex benefits it is 
discriminating against them, that will be wrong. That will be totally 
wrong and it will prove that those people who voted against this bill 
on that slippery slope argument are correct.
<P>
	That is why both sides of this argument should have respect. 
That is why both sides of this argument should restore some sanity 
to this issue and look at it on a more rational and reasonable basis 
rather than getting carried away with the emotional element.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I have done something in my riding which is very important to 
the Reform Party. It represents how we are doing politics 
differently. We have our policies and our principles on which we 
were elected and which we are here to represent. We have policies 
and principles in our blue book which I will defend at all times.
<P>
	We also have a way to represent people between election years. 
If I get a sense that people in my riding do not wish me to vote with 
my caucus, or if they wish me to vote in support of the government 
on a certain bill, if my ears perks up-on this issue they have 
because it is a divisive issue-I will do what I did earlier. Two 
years ago in my first householder I talked about this issue and 
indicated what the Minister of Justice was planning. We had town 
hall meetings. I sent a survey to all households to which I received 
1,470 responses. In Calgary Centre the response was very strong 
that I should vote yes to support such an amendment.
<P>
	Since that time the issue has been percolating. I feel confident 
that people in Calgary Centre, that little cosmos, that little part of 
the world, deserve and should have the benefit of a member of 
Parliament who will take the time to find out what they think.
<P>
	Subsequently I conducted a scientific random sampling poll. I 
hired a professional firm. I have just finished the poll with the 
results. I have the report in my hands. There were three questions 
this time around. I asked the very same question as the Angus Reid 
poll which was held at the end of April, a poll that said 59 per cent 
of Canadians were in favour of amending the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.
<P>
	However, if the results were broken down by province, 57 per 
cent of Albertans were against adding sexual orientation to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. Manitoba and Saskatchewan were 
lumped together to produce a figure of 49 per cent against, even 
though they have provincial legislation that includes sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	There is proof that a lot of Canadians are against this. To call 
those people who are against this bill prejudiced and bigoted is not 
right. I wish the people on the other side would stop doing that. 
Everybody has a right to their opinions and everybody has the right 
to vote according to either their conscience or the wishes of their 
constituents.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No one has the right to discriminate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I agree, nobody has the right to discriminate, which is 
what this bill is about, and I agree with that. However, there is that 
slippery slope.
<P>
	For the member who has pointed that out to me, if groups like 
EGALE use this in a legal argument, that member might have some 
red in her face. She will realize our job is to look ahead to see if 
there are negative impacts of any bill. That is what some of these 
members are doing. They have the right to do it. Let us stop calling 
them prejudiced if they vote against this bill.
<P>
	Getting back to my survey, currently in Calgary Centre 60 per 
cent are in favour of amending the human rights act by adding these 
two words.
<P>
	I will be voting according to the sampling in the two polls I have 
conducted. I have a clear consensus in my constituency that this is 
what the people wish me to do. They also know my personal point 
of view. This is that extra step. To me this is how we can do politics 
differently and still be true to our policies.
<P>
	Not everybody in the country agrees with every Liberal policy. 
Not everybody in the country agrees with every Reform policy 
although they are card carrying members of each party. It is about 
time we recognized that and it is about time we tried to work on a 
participatory democracy. It is harder to do this, but in the long run 
it is worthwhile.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak in 
support of Bill C-33. Members of Parliament have an obligation to 
state the facts and clarify and dispel the myths that have existed in 
society. Only then can we ensure we are really giving valid 
information to our  citizenry and thereby proper support to this bill. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2497"> 2497 </A></B>
<P>
The bill will prohibit discrimination, the essence and soul of this 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	Let me start with the preamble of the bill. Let me restate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Government of Canada affirms the dignity and worth of all 
individuals and recognizes that they have the right to be free from 
discrimination in employment and the provision of goods and services, and that 
that right is based on respect for the rule of law and lawful conduct by all;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Who would disagree with the preamble? Show me a citizen.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within 
the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to 
the principle that all individuals should have an equal opportunity to make for 
themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have, consistent with their 
duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or 
prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, 
family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has 
been granted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose is very clear. Let us convey that message to all 
citizens and we will have a fuller understanding of the bill and its 
importance.
<P>
	It is important to underscore that the purpose of human rights 
legislation, as this amendment is to this piece of law, is to protect 
vulnerable groups, not to prey on them.
<P>
	Recently there was an advertisement in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
which raised a couple of concerns, that Bill C-33 will give special 
status to homosexuals, that the bill could have a profound effect on 
Canadian society and would threaten the institution of marriage 
and family.
<P>
	I respect their concerns, but they have been based on a 
misunderstanding of the bill itself and our laws and of the 
separation of the church and the state.
<P>
	Bill C-33 will not give special status to anyone. No one could 
credibly argue federal and provincial human rights legislations now 
confers special status on Catholics or Protestants, on husbands or 
wives, or on those with disabilities. Although each of these is 
expressly covered by the existing statutes, it is obvious no such 
special status is conferred.
<P>
	On the matter of the consequences of Bill C-33, we have to 
restate some of the fundamental principles. The Canadian Human 
Rights Act applies only to employment and the provision of goods 
and services coming under federal legislation. The Canadian 
Human Rights Act does not and cannot affect law on marriage. Ask 
any constitutional expert or any lawyer.
<P>
	Even the Supreme Court of Canada has already decided in a 
recent case that family status does not  include same sex 
relationships. Therefore we should not worry about that. The Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court came to the same conclusion that 
family status does not include same sex relationships.
<P>
	With respect to the possible effects on benefits, Bill C-33 does 
not change law on benefits. Again, the Supreme Court of Canada 
has said unanimously that sexual orientation is a prohibited ground 
of discrimination under the equality provision, section 15 of the 
charter. However, the same court also held that such discrimination 
did not support the extension to same sex partners of the pension 
benefits which were the issue in that case.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act and consequently the 
amendment now before the House have absolutely no application 
to marriage. The common law has always provided that marriage is 
the union of a man and a woman. The common law has equal force 
with any statute law.
<P>
	With respect to a need for definition, over the years there has 
been considerable understanding by which tribunals and courts 
have looked at discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
They have developed an understanding of this term. They have 
interpreted it to mean homosexuality, heterosexuality and 
bisexuality.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act and therefore Bill C-33 do not 
apply to churches and religious organizations. The latter comes 
under provincial jurisdiction. Even if for the sake of argument the 
Canadian Human Rights Act were to apply, the Supreme Court of 
Canada has already held that it is reasonable and justifiable for a 
given religious school to require that the religious views of its 
instructors conform with the view of the church.
<P>
	Moreover, we have to remember the Constitution is the supreme 
law of the land. It overrides all other laws, whether federal or 
provincial. It has supremacy over the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
Nothing that could be done in the Canadian Human Rights Act 
could take primacy over the charter of rights and freedoms or affect 
the freedom of religion, expression or association guaranteed by 
the charter.
<P>
	I state my full support for the bill. I hope that we all together 
clearly state to our Canadian citizenry the facts of the case, the 
governing Canadian constitution and its primacy over any piece of 
legislation things that are feared could happen will not happen. I 
suggest we all gather together and support the bill unanimously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-33, an amendment to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2498"> 2498 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation will add sexual orientation to the list of 
categories offered special protection under the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.
<P>
	I speak to this for two reasons, to be a voice for my constituents 
and to make the point as clearly as I can in such little time that 
Reformers are strong defenders of equality in this country.
<P>
	I begin by reading a quote from a clergyman, Martin Niemöller, 
in March 1984, on his experience during the second world war and 
on the lack of resistance to the Nazis. The quote was put on my 
desk earlier today by the member for Don Valley North. I have 
heard the quote before, but each time I read it I find it so powerful I 
think it is worth presenting again. It certainly gives me a message:
<P>
	``First they came for the Jews. I was silent. I was not a Jew. Then 
they came for the communists. I was silent. I was not a communist. 
Then they came for the trade unionists. I was silent. I was not a 
trade unionist. They came for me. There was no one left to speak 
for me''.
<P>
	Clearly we must stop this categorization of people in the country. 
That message was given very clearly in the quote. I will explain 
very directly and as succinctly as possible why Reform opposes 
Bill C-33.
<P>
	All Canadians are already equal before the law. This is a 
fundamental principle of Canadian law. Section 15(1) of the charter 
applies to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	It states: ``Every individual is equal before the law and has the 
right to the equal protection and the equal benefit of the law 
without discrimination''. The protection is in our law.
<P>
	This also incidentally and perhaps importantly is the first 
principle in the Reform blue book, our book of policy and 
principles. The very first principle says this same thing. That is 
why Reformers believe passionately in the equality of all 
Canadians. There is not nor should there be any Canadian more 
equal than others.
<P>
	I would like to end with one very short quote. I have to ask why 
this legislation is before the House. Does it mean that Liberals are 
all bad people or evil people? I say no. This quote explains why this 
legislation is before the House-

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 11. An affirmative vote on 
Motion No. 11 obviates the necessity for the question being put on 
Motion No. 15. However, if Motion No. 11 is defeated, the division 
will also apply to Motion No. 15.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, in view of the 
fact that Motions Nos. 12 and 14 are under the same name, the 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, I wonder if the House would 
be willing to give its consent to apply the same result for those two 
motions only.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<HR><B><A NAME="2520"> 2520 </A></B><P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 1, I 
rose in the House to pose a question to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, asking him to extend the May 24 deadline and to commit 
to begin serious discussions with representatives of the affected 
communities who had already chosen the people to negotiate on 
their behalf and had sent a group to Ottawa.
<P>
	This group had some difficulty in having complete meetings 
with the minister. He responded in a manner that left the May 24 
deadline still in place. He did say, however, that he would be going 
to the west coast the next day to meet with groups there.
<P>
	I was concerned, as were others, that the minister would avoid 
meeting the group that had been sent here by the communities at 
great expense. Instead of meeting with them, he opted to go to the 
west coast while they were still here in Ottawa seeking meetings 
with him.
<P>
	The next day the minister did met with a few groups that told 
him he was doing a good job. At the strong insistence of the 
fishermen's union, which still had representatives on the west 
coast, he did meet with some of them. A day later he spent 45 
minutes with the Pacific Salmon Alliance, which is the group that 
was in Ottawa and had gone back in an attempt to have a meeting 
with him. The community representatives that had been in Ottawa 
did get to meet with him for a mere 45 minutes.
<P>
<B>(2020 )</B>
<P>
	I find it amazing that among Liberal ministers they can spend 
half a day flying halfway across the country to get away from a 
group of legitimate representatives, in this case representing 
fishing communities, commercial, aboriginal and sports fisher 
people, environmentalists like the Suzuki group, the Georgia Strait 
group, and the Save Our Wild Salmon group. Instead of having 
serious meetings with them here in Ottawa to negotiate a workable 
plan, the minister chose to go off to the west coast and grandstand 
there rather than actually getting down to business.
<P>
	Since that time as well we know some licences have changed 
hands. The last report I have is that there are about 400 which have 
changed hands under the aegis of the new program. I am told that 
some owners have purchased up to 11 different licences. The cost 
of these would amount to many hundreds of thousands of dollars.
<P>
	This means we are leaning toward a new high investment type of 
fishery, probably an urban based and not a community based 
fishery. We have not really addressed with this policy the questions 
of commitment to the resource. An urban based fishery which has 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in licences alone is to care 
more about recovering its hundreds of thousands of dollars for an 
annual licence than it is to looking after future stocks.
<P>
	A community based fishery based on families doing the fishing 
from communities will make certain the fishery has a much longer 
life.
<P>
	If the minister is truly honest in his promise he made in the 
House when he responded to my first question to bridge some of 
the gaps, address uncertainties and fine tune the program, he would 
suspend the May 24 deadline, which I asked him to do, so true and 
meaningful discussions can take place with no guns held to the 
heads of the communities involved in the form of this deadline.
<P>
	Tomorrow Peter Pearse and Don Cruikshank will be in Ottawa in 
front of the committee, experts the minister could well afford to 
heed. I hope he will would drop the deadline and work out a policy 
that will leave the west coast with communities as well as with 
salmon enhancement capabilities. People, after all, are a necessary 
and important part of the west coast environment as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. I should add in preface that the minister 
went to the west coast and had met with numbers of representatives 
of all segments of the fisheries industry before his departure and 
has been meeting since. He had several meetings today.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary for the past month has met with all 
three fisher groups, seiners, gill netters,  trollers in Vancouver, 
members of the processing plant, the coastal communities and the 
union. The parliamentary secretary addressed the union at large 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2521"> 2521 </A></B>
<P>
meeting and met with the executive and addressed the coastal 
communities. There has been an extensive contact with what are 
called the stakeholders in this very important national asset.
<P>
	The government recognizes, and this is part of this extensive 
dialogue occurring and the reason for it, the Pacific salmon 
revitalization strategy is all about conserving the precious salmon 
resources and ensuring the sustainability and viability of the 
commercial salmon fishery in British Columbia.
<P>
	The fishing capacity of the commercial fleet far exceeds what is 
required to harvest the available resource and this situation is 
putting the conservation of the stocks at risk. No one, including 
critics of the strategy, disputes the fleet is too large and needs to be 
reduced.
<P>
	The revitalization plan is based on recommendations from a 
Pacific policy round table of some 70 salmon stakeholder 
representatives as well as the recommendations of the Fraser River 
Sockeye Public Review Board which identified various problems 
undermining salmon conservation efforts.
<P>
<B>(2025 )</B>
<P>
	Overcapitalization of the commercial harvesting sector was one 
of the key problems identified by the review board. The round table 
strongly recommended the fleet be reduced and the action be taken 
before the 1996 fishing season.
<P>
	The revitalization plan includes a federal government funded 
$80 million licence retirement program and licensing policy 
changes that are expected to contribute toward a 50 per cent 
reduction in the fleet over time.
<P>
	The licence retirement program will expire at the end of June. It 
is a short term initiative to kick start the fleet reduction, but it is 
only a start. It is expected to remove no more than 20 per cent of 
the existing 4,400 licences. Other licensing measures are expected 
to remove a further 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the fleet over time.
<P>
	Concerns have been expressed about the impact of the fleet 
reduction on coastal communities. It must be said that the future of 
those coastal communities that are highly dependent on the salmon 
fishery is not secure unless the salmon stocks are robust and the 
harvesting industry is viable, which has clearly not been the case in 
recent years. The revitalization strategy is necessary to give those 
communities a solid basis for future viability and prosperity.
<P>
	In meetings last week in Vancouver and again this week in 
Ottawa with representatives of various stakeholder groups, the 
minister indicated that he was prepared to consider what he has 
phrased as fine tuning adjustments to the strategy, although the 
core elements  of the strategy plan will remain intact. An 
announcement by the minister is expected shortly.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
evening I rise to expand upon a question I put to the Minister of 
National Revenue on April 25. At that time I raised the question of 
a ways and means bill which pertained to the issue of notional 
taxes, the GST on used cars.
<P>
	The previous day the minister had presented a ways and means 
bill including 100 proposals for the improvement of our GST. The 
GST has been a tax which has caused so much difficulty for 
business.
<P>
	For the most part Canadians never new that what is called a 
notional tax was even in existence. It was not in the vocabulary of 
most people. The fundamental change of the notional input tax 
credit was one of the major changes. I felt it was important for 
Canadians to realize that this important change was made in the 
bill.
<P>
	The way the GST was collected on used goods was certainly one 
which was of great concern to many, many people. It was an 
instrument of the tax system that was clearly not understood by the 
majority of Canadians. When the issue was raised Canadians 
simply did not understand it.
<P>
	In the case of the auto industry, prior to the change, a person 
buying a new vehicle paid GST on the full retail price. With the 
changes announced by the minister, the GST now only applies to 
the trade-in difference. This is a substantial saving of tax for those 
who apply the trade-in value to the purchase of their new vehicle.
<P>
	One element that remains unaddressed is the issue of curbside 
trade which continues to flourish in this country. Many curbside 
shops are still operating. They buy used products from private 
individuals and resell them. Of course, these people are not subject 
to the GST. We must address this. The point of my concern is that 
these people do not collect GST on their business transactions. In 
so doing, they directly compete against many storefront operations. 
This is an unfair advantage.
<P>
	As I conclude my remarks, I would like to say that the unfair 
practice will only end when the province of Ontario joins with all 
provinces in the harmonization of our provincial and federal taxes.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance if he would deal with this issue. What efforts are being 
made through the business community to ensure early 
harmonization by the province of this aforementioned tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Huron-Bruce 
raises an important question.
<P>
	On April 23 the Minister of Finance introduced over 100 
measures to streamline the operation of the GST.  One important 
simplification was the elimination of the notional input tax credits 
and the introduction of a change in approach for used goods.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2522"> 2522 </A></B>
<P>
	The credit allowed dealers to claim 7/107ths of the price they 
paid for used goods. It was assumed that the full credit was passed 
on to consumers. However many consumers felt that this was not 
always the case.
<P>
	The notional input tax credit system was criticized for being 
overly complex and susceptible to abuse. The tax will now be 
applied on the net difference in price when a consumer trades in a 
used good as partial payment for another good.
<P>
	The new system for trade-ins is easier to understand and limits 
tax compounding. The new rules came into effect immediately so 
that consumers would not delay making decisions on the trade in 
and purchase of automobiles. Such a delay may have led to revenue 
losses during any transition period for businesses in this sector. 
Delaying implementation may have also led to further fraudulent 
activity.
<P>
	In further response to the member's comments with respect to 
harmonization, he is absolutely right. A move toward 
harmonization in all provinces in this country will help to alleviate 
and eliminate the sort of problems he outlined.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. Again, thank you to the pages and 
everyone who stayed so late tonight.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 8.32 p.m.)
