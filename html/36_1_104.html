Fisheries and Oceans and the sport fishing lodges in 1995 to 
provide daily catch data to the department through the offices 
of the Sport Fishing Institute of British Columbia (SFI): (<I>a</I>) 
catch by anglers from sport fishing lodges accounted for 
approximately what part or portion of the total chinook sport 
catch; (<I>b</I>) what was the nature of this arrangement; (<I>c</I>) when was 
this arrangement negotiated; (<I>d</I>) When did the arrangement become 
operational; (<I>e</I>) why was it necessary (the Fisheries Act 
requires the lodges to provide the data to the DFO directly); 
(<I>f</I>) were there problems in the fishery in 1995 that made it 
important to have accurate catch data on a daily or weekly 
basis; (<I>g</I>) what were the nature of these problems; (<I>h</I>) what 
management actions were undertaken to deal with these problems;

fisheries scientists find the catch data provided through SFI to 
be accurate, timely and useful; (<I>j</I>) in addressing any of the 
problems identified above did DFO fisheries managers find the 
catch data provided through SFI accurate, timely and useful; (<I>k</I>) 
when was the catch data received through SFI from the Oak Bay 
Marine Group lodge <I>M.V. Marabell</I>; (<I>l</I>) was the catch data in (<I>k</I>)

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
(a) Approximately 60% of the north coast sport catch is taken by 
lodge clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The arrangement made between the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, DFO, Queen Charlotte Island, QCI, lodge operators and the 
Sport Fishing Institute of British Columbia, SFI, was that the SFI 
would collect and collate catch information from the lodges on 
QCI and provide the information to DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) August 1, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) On August 1, 1995 and the first report to DFO was August 8, 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Lodge operators were concerned about the confidentiality of 
weekly catch information from individual lodges and wanted only a 
summary to be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) Yes, a recreational catch ceiling had been imposed in 
statistical areas 1 and 2. Weekly information was required to 
track the catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) The catch ceiling was established to keep the north coast 
recreational harvest of west coast of Vancouver Island chinook at 
a level to achieve conservation goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) The recreational catch limit for chinook in statistical areas 
1 and 2 was reduced from 2 per day and 4 possession to 1 per day 
and 2 possession on July 19, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i/j) The catch data were provided as requested, and sufficient 
for both scientists and managers. The SFI was prompted on 
occasion to provide the data. Independent checks were done on the 
data provided and there was nothing to suggest the data were 
inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(k) November 1995; the <I>M.V. Marabell</I> left QCI the second week of 
July, before the agreement with SFI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(l) The information was not received during the summer of 1995 and 
was provided through SFI in November 1995 in a useable form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(m) The catch data were not useful for in-season management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(n) The catch data provided are considered accurate. The catch by 
guests of the <I>M.V. Marabell</I> form a very small portion of the 
total catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(o) The catch data for King Salmon Resort in Rivers Inlet were 
received directly from Oak Bay Marine Group in November 1995. The 
agreement with the SFI was to supply catch data from only QCI 
lodges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(p) The information was not received during the summer of 1995 and 
was provided through SFI in November 1995 in a useable form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(q) Catch data from Rivers Inlet lodges are not used for in-season 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(r) The catch data would be the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(s) (i) Information resquested: Number, sex, size, weight, species, 
product form, and other particulars of fish caught, processed, or 
transported by King Salmon Resort-Rivers Inlet, its clients and 
employees; and the time, and place all fish were caught and 
retained and the person and vessel which caught and retained the 
fish. The August 7 request was for the lodge to comply with the 
August 2 request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) Time period: No specific time indicated as it was believed 
the information would be for the entire 1995 season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) Information provided: In the form as required of the 
charterboat sport fish log book program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iv) The information was to be provided during the season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(t) (i) Information resquested: Number, sex, size, weight, species, 
product form, and other particulars of fish caught, processed, or 
transported by <I>M.V. Marabell</I>, its clients and employees; and the 
time, and place all fish were caught and retained and the person 
and vessel which caught and retained the fish. The August 9 
request was for the lodge to comply with the August 1 request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) Time period: No specific time indicated as it was believed 
the information would be for the 1995 season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) Information provided: In the form as required of the 
charterboat sport fish log book program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iv) The information was to be provided during the season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(u) No charges were laid for failure of the lodges to provide 
catch data to DFO on a timely basis by way of the SFI because 
catch data were received on August 8, 1995 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(v) All QCI lodges refused to give data directly to DFO and gave 
catch data to SFI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(w) The lack of catch data on a timely basis from sport fish 
lodges had a samll impact on the department's ability to manage 
the QCI sport fishery in season to within the established chinook 
catchcap. In the absence of this information fish managers 
anticipated catch levels based on previous data and other catch 
data. It did not compromise their ability to ensure the total 
catch was below the established ceiling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  Question No. 21 has been on the Order Paper 
since October 3, 1997 and the parliamentary secretary has 
repeatedly promised the House that he will make inquiries.  I am 
wondering if those inquiries have been made and, if so, when we 
could expect an answer to Question No. 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have noted the member's 
request.  As he will have noted in the last two days we have 
begun to clear a considerable backlog and a number of the

Question No. 56 this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Question No. 33 was asked on October 28.  I am still 
waiting for a response.  It involves a special relationship 
between the minister of fisheries and the Oak Bay Marine Group 
and I can understand the reluctance of the minister to reply to 
that given the fact that the charges were dropped against the Oak 
Bay Marine Group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering when I could expect an answer to that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the member has noted, he 
has received a reply to some of the questions and I was glad to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 8 consideration of Bill C-19, an act 
to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and 
Labour Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and 
of Motions Nos. 9 and 28.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has not been shut down.  The proof that it has not 
been shut down is that a moment ago the opposition concluded that 
there was nothing further to say about the issue because it was 
not putting up more speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am getting to, as the House will easily recognize, 
is that we are not shutting the debate down.  While I am speaking 
I am actually extending the debate and giving further opportunity 
for hon. members to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Chair has recognized this fully.  We will be able 
to participate constructively, explaining all the good reasons 
why the amendments proposed by some hon. members in the 
opposition are unnecessary and superfluous in some cases.  The 
bill as presented by my hon. colleague, the Minister of Labour, 
is the appropriate one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so the House fully understands this bill and the amendments 
that are proposed, this bill actually made its way through the 
House of Commons in the last parliament.  It then went on to the 
other place.  Unfortunately the consideration of the bill was not 
completed at the time of the last election and because of that 
the bill must start back anew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was started again, was fully considered, went through 
second reading and then went to committee.  In committee the 
bill was unfortunately stalled by the opposition.  As a matter of 
fact, opposition members filibustered the bill and we had to 
obtain the good services of many members of the government who 
stayed in the committee hours and hours listening to speeches 
from members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If 
I am not mistaken, I believe right now we are supposed to be 
debating Group No. 3 amendments at report stage of this very 
important bill, not talking about what happened in the last 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is absolutely correct 
but I assumed the government House leader was trying to draw a 
parallel between what happened in the last parliament and this 
bill, which I assume he will do very promptly in order to avoid a 
repeat of this point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I have just 
demonstrated how the opposition again is not listening.  In fact, 
I was describing the events in committee two weeks ago on this 
bill.  It was not in the last parliament but two weeks ago that 
his own colleagues were filibustering on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strange thing about it is that the amendments which are 
deemed to be necessary by the opposition at this point were not 
even introduced in committee after all the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
think if the hon. member wants to make a speech he should not 
have cut off debate.  We should be debating this in the proper 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that is not a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I notice that the hon. 
member is not too familiar with the bill, and that is okay.  He 
is also not very familiar with the standing orders because he 
rose on a point of order which was not one. But that is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that the government is fully interested 
in constructive debate.  We are going to have two more full days 
of debate on this bill.  We are going to be considering it at 
report stage today. 
We can remain on the same grouping, move on to the next grouping 
and so on all day, which we will gladly do.  At the end of the 
day today we will be voting on all the amendments, then we will 
have a full day again at third reading stage. Finally, the bill 
will go to the other place where it will receive full 
consideration by the hon. members of the other place who are 
going to give it all the usual good work—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been sitting here trying to understand what the government 
House leader is really talking about in Group No. 3 of the bill, 
which deals with successor rights and not what the Liberal 
government wanted to do or did do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side would like to debate the bill. If the government 
House leader has nothing further to say that is useful, maybe he 
should sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the government House leader 
is making efforts to come to the point of the amendments before 
the House in Group No. 3, as all hon. members strive to do in 
their remarks on any bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is trying to be lenient to ensure that members are 
relevant in their remarks.  I know we are looking forward to the 
government House leader's specific comments on these clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know there are only a 
couple of minutes left so I will attempt to summarize very 
briefly my comments on the bill and on the amendments.  I 
recognize the amendments have to do with successor rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I was making to the House is that the opposition has 
consumed all this time and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Get back to the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  That is what I am going to say right 
now if the hon. member will pay attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is pretending that we did not give this enough 
time for debate.  There are two things wrong with that 
argument.  One, the amendment in question that he is now 
describing was never put before the committee.  It should have 
been put before the committee and there was lots of time for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This member is far away from debating Group No. 3.  He is talking 
about the vote that was held 15 minutes ago.  He is talking about 
time allocation.  He should be talking about Group No. 3, 
specifically successor rights, which is what is of interest.  We 
resent the fact that he, having invoked closure, prevents us from 
speaking to the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Hon. members are raising points of 
order in respect of relevance. Sitting here for a large part of 
this debate I have heard a good deal of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on report stage amendments. Particularly after a time 
allocation motion has been put it is not uncommon to have a fair 
bit of discussion on time allocation.  I am reluctant to rule 
that out of order.  I did hear the House leader refer to 
successor rights earlier in his remarks and I know he has a great 
interest in the subject and in the bill.  Obviously his interest 
is so profound he has chosen to speak on the bill, which he is 
now doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope hon. members would want to hear his remarks because I am 
sure that at some point they are going to be pithy in relation to 
Group No. 3 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I conclude my remarks by 
congratulating the Minister of Labour for the excellent work he 
has done in piloting the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure I speak on behalf of all hon. members in also 
congratulating the parliamentary secretary who has done such a 
fantastic job of piloting the bill through the House and in 
committee in the face of the filibuster put up almost exclusively 
by the Reform Party, which does not want to see labour 
legislation advance in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the government and all Liberal MPs are very much 
interested in good labour legislation and it is unfortunate that 
the hon. members across do not share the enthusiasm that we in 
the government have demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, I support everything that has been done by the 
Minister of Labour. 
I do not support the Reform amendments.  After all, we are 
generally reasonable people around here and we cannot support the 
Reform amendments which have not even been subjected to the 
scrutiny of the committee.  Reform MPs were only interested in 
filibustering.  They did not even make the case in committee for 
what they are proposing now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The government has cut off time on this debate.  I can 
understand why the government House leader would want to make an 
apology for the government, but can we not spend time on this 
bill?  This is what— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, but with great respect to 
hon. members there seem to be a lot of points of order that are 
really points for debate.  The government House leader was 
addressing the amendments and indicating his opposition to the 
amendments.  I think he was on topic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will talk about successor rights as that is what we are debating 
today.  It is unfortunate that we are now facing time allocation 
which means there will only be a few more speeches on this topic. 
Ten minutes of it just went down the drain due to some kind of 
diatribe from the House leader which I will not describe in 
further detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the 40th occasion the Liberal government has introduced 
time allocation to restrict people's ability to debate things. It 
is ironic that in our own rules of the House, Beauchesne's 
describes that is the job of opposition and it is within the 
realm of the tactics of opposition to talk at length on a bill it 
opposes.  It is part of what an opposition party does in order to 
draw attention to the weakness of government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a weak bill although it depends on which you want to 
look at it.  It is a very strong bill in that it is unbalanced. 
There is too much emphasis on cabinet rights and union rights and 
not enough emphasis on general worker rights, which may not 
necessarily be union, and the rights of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successor rights clause is part of another one of these 
bills that give cabinet an awful lot of power to determine 
successor rights.  This is almost exclusively in the area of 
airport prescreening security measures.  There is a selection for 
us.  The government of the day picks a particular occupation, not 
just transport but in this case airlines.  Then it narrows it 
down further to just one part of the airline industry, the 
security industry.  Then it narrows it down further to one part 
of security, airport prescreening.  There is a special category 
in the bill that applies to those in airport prescreening and 
allows successor rights even when contracted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there may be a contract with an airport facility that 
involves prescreening security measures, this activity is the 
only one covered under this labour code that has the special 
provisions allocated to it.  It does not talk about maintenance 
of airports, it does not talk about air traffic controllers, it 
does not talk about a lot of things.  It talks about one thing. 
Who knows why that industry has been singled out as something 
that deserves successor rights.  We do not think that part should 
be singled out.  We think good labour practices apply equally to 
all people on both sides of the equation, workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good part of our airport facilities are contracted out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a decision of the Liberal government.  I fully 
supported it.  Why they have decided that this thing should have 
successor rights nobody knows.  I cannot understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people put in a bid for a job they should come in as bona 
fide employers in a jurisdiction and say they have experience, 
personnel and training.  They may be unionized; they may not be 
unionized.  That is a decision for the workers in the company to 
decide.  They make a bid in all good faith for a particular 
service.  They should be allowed to bid on an equal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in British Columbia?  Perhaps I can use an example 
not just of successor rights but of when there is not balanced 
labour legislation.  B.C. has an NDP government which is a lot 
like the Liberal government.  It decides that only unions can 
apply for particular road building contracts on Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A paid up, law abiding tax paying corporation of some sort with 
a long track record can be building roads to beat the band in 
British Columbia.  It could bid on a highway project and say that 
it will fulfil not just this labour code because it is provincial 
but all labour code requirements and that its workers will decide 
what union they belong to or whether they belong to a union at 
all.  They will decide what wages they work for because they have 
the power to withdraw their services as does every worker, and 
the corporation will be bid on the project accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP Government of British Columbia said that they do not 
have that right.  If it does not like the union, if they are part 
of the Christian labour union movement, for example, it is too 
bad.  It cannot bid on the project because they are not part of 
the unions the government likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highway goes ahead.  It is ironic that the biggest 
construction companies do not mind the law.  It gives them a 
chance to bid against a smaller number of bidders.  They are all 
in the same unions together, the biggest outfits, the ones with 
thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars of 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if a smaller outfit is just starting out or does not 
have a union that is affiliated, it is too bad.  Tough toe nails; 
it does not get to bid.  It does not even get to bid on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successor rights do a similar sort of thing.  They say to 
employers or maybe to a co-operative that wants to bid on a 
project, whatever it might be, that cabinet will have the power 
to determine these successor rights and that is just the way it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they come in and say they want to bid on a 
project, that their workers want to work for it, want to belong 
to a particular union or do not want to belong to a union, or 
whatever it might be.  Workers should have that right one way or 
the other.  They should have the right to bid on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It singles out a very small part of the industry. Unfortunately 
it says that part of the industry must have successor rights. 
Cabinet decides and that is the way it goes. If the job is worth 
$15 an hour or $12 an hour, it does not matter because once it is 
bid on it will pay the same as the last guy regardless.  The 
workers will put up with it one way or the other, and that is 
just the way it goes.  In other words, there is no choice.  There 
is no balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear a lot during the very limited amount of debate left 
about the necessity to have balance in labour legislation.  This 
group of motions shows that there is no balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by saying how unfortunate it is that 
again for the 40th time the government has brought in time 
allocation.  There is no crisis looming.  There is no work 
stoppage that has shut down the country.  It is not like the 
economy has been brought to its knees.  It is not like there is 
no current labour law in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have decided for their own political reasons to bring in 
time allocation to stifle debate in a democratic institution. 
That is the only reason.  There is no other crisis out there in 
the country.  There is no other crisis in parliament.  It is for 
one reason only.  They have decided that they do not want to 
debate it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is too bad.  Things like successor rights, final offer 
binding arbitration and the rights of workers to vote by secret 
ballot on their union certification deserve full debate in the 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says too bad but it is tired of the debate. There 
is no crisis or no other issue.  It is just tired of it and does 
not want to listen to the opposition.  It just shuts it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the 40th time.  Unfortunately members on the Liberal 
side seem to think it is all right to shut down democratic 
debate.  Just so the folks at home know, they will push through 
the bill this week.  There is nothing we can do to stop it.  It 
does not matter whether or not we want to talk on it.  Many 
members on this side of the House will be denied an opportunity 
to ever speak a word on the bill.  That is undemocratic and very 
unfortunate.  It shows a trend on the government side, the 
government that previously criticized Brian Mulroney's 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney's government on closure was a pillar of virtue 
compared to what the Liberal government has done since it came to 
power.  It continuously uses this hammer.  It is not a matter of 
negotiation.  It is just too bad: “It is my way or the 
highway”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate the government has decided to go this way.  It 
is a trend.  It does not bode well for this institution that the 
government has decided this is the way to force through 
legislation, controversial or not.  The government is just doing 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be pleased to speak to further motions if I get a chance, 
which is unlikely given the time allocation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest and I would indicate as a member of the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources that the debate we are 
talking about today should have taken place in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately my friends on the other side were more interested 
in a filibuster and now have all the speakers.  They did not have 
the speakers when we were in committee.  To suggest for a moment 
that somehow the government is stifling debate is ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee we started at 11 o'clock and went through to 8:30 
because we had to go to question period.  Again they were going 
through a filibuster.  If the members on the other side wanted to 
talk about serious amendments, and I would suggest that these are 
serious amendments, they should have been discussed in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the public record some issues I did not 
have a chance to do last week.  The official opposition suggested 
that the certification procedures under Bill C-19 were 
undemocratic and that the bill deprived employees of their right 
to vote on union certification applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with these statements particularly because there 
is nothing undemocratic about certification procedures under the 
Canada Labour Code.  Bill C-19 does not amend these procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basis of certification would remain majority support.  The 
board would retain its current authority to verify union support 
by holding a certification vote in any case.  Certification 
procedures under the code are similar to those in a number of 
provincial jurisdictions.  I am sure those jurisdictions do not 
consider their procedures undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard a lot about the remedial certification procedure 
under Bill C-19.  Members of the official opposition keep 
referring to the Ontario Labour Relations Board decision in the 
Wal-Mart case, a decision which members should be aware has been 
upheld by the courts, despite the fact that remedial 
certification procedures existed in five provincial jurisdictions 
for many years.  The Ontario Wal-Mart case is the only case 
members of the official opposition can cite to support their 
position that the provision has been misused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to statements made in the House last week, remedial 
certification in the Ontario statute was not brought in by the 
Rae government.  It was there before the NDP formed the 
Government of Ontario.  Interestingly the provision was modified 
but not removed when the current government reformed the 
province's labour laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week a member referred to the British Columbia Labour 
Relations Board decision in another Wal-Mart case.  It is 
interesting that contrary to the member's assertion the B.C. 
board did not use its remedial certification powers to overturn a 
vote in that case.  In fact the B.C. board ordered that a 
representation vote be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The absence of examples of use of remedial certification 
authority by provincial boards proves what the government has 
been saying about the provision. 
It is an effective deterrent to serious employer actions designed 
to prevent employees from exercising their fundamental right to 
organize.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rarely used and only to remedy the worst cases of employee 
conduct which make it impossible to measure employee support 
through the holding of a vote.  The certification procedures and 
remedial certification provisions of Bill C-19 are part of the 
overall package of task force recommendations which 
representatives of both labour and management in the federally 
regulated sector accepted as fair and balanced.  They should not 
be modified or removed from the package in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to speak to the 
Group No. 3 motions, the recommended amendments to Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not find anything in these particular amendments that we 
feel will move the bill forward or make it better in any way, 
shape or form.  In fact it certainly strikes us in the NDP 
caucus—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak regarding Bill C-19.  I know that this is a 
complex bill, but having listened to the comments made by members 
of the opposition on the motions in Group No. 3 I can only 
conclude that the members do not understand the successive 
contractor provisions in Bill C-19.  Either they do not 
understand or they are intentionally spreading misinformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say they agree with part of proposed section 47.3 which 
would protect the pay levels of employees providing pre-board 
security screening services in the event of a change of 
contractor.  Then they put forward Motion No. 28 which would 
remove the right of these employees to seek a remedy before the 
board if a successive contractor were in fact to reduce their 
wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the official opposition wants compliance with 
section 47.3 to be completely voluntary.  If a successive 
contractor does not respect the provision, too bad for the 
employees.  They would have no recourse and that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition have also talked at length 
about how the provision, if extended, could impact on railway 
short lines and the transfer of government services to the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision has nothing to do with either sales of business 
or the privatization of government services.  It would not even 
apply to such situations and to suggest otherwise is completely 
false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed section 47.3 would not grant successor rights where the 
federal government or an employer subject to the Canada Labour 
Code contracts out services.  Proposed section 47.3 would not 
even grant successor rights when there is a change of contractor. 
The successive contractor would not be bound by that collective 
agreement.  The bargaining agent would not retain bargaining 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the provision does is require a successive contractor to 
maintain wage levels, that is to compete on the basis of 
sufficiencies other than wage reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision will protect low wage employees who might 
otherwise lose their employment or be forced to accept pay 
reductions when there is a change of contractor.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pre-board security screening services are important to the 
safety of the Canadian public.  Employees providing such services 
deserve this minimal protection as would other groups of 
vulnerable employees providing such key services. These are the 
kinds of employees who would benefit from protection under 
proposed section 47.3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was important to set the record straight on these 
issues. I think it is important that we do so as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment that I was at the committee when 
the Reform Party was filibustering. Talk about wasting time and 
resources.  Talk about the abuse of parliament.  Talk about being 
childish.  All of this is from the party that claims there is a 
fresh start to be had in parliament and a new way of doing 
business.  That is rubbish.  I saw it firsthand and I was 
disgusted by it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could 
not help but respond to some of the criticisms that were levelled 
from across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the Reform Party was filibustering in committee— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You admit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Oh, indeed I do because filibustering is 
something that has been used by opposition parties since the 
beginning of parliament.  It is one of the few tools that we 
actually have to be able to change government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the Reform filibuster, Bill C-19 was changed so 
that people who were offsite workers, contract workers would not 
be forced to have their names given over to union organizers. 
That way their home addresses would not be violated by union 
organizers along the lines of ding-dong, knock knock, the unions 
calling at their home addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition was able to get some amendments to Bill C-19 as a 
result of our filibuster in committee. However there are things 
that have not changed. Successor rights is indeed one of the 
things the government has not changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are reasons we were enacting a filibuster and I am going 
to speak to this today. I would not have done so otherwise but I 
think it is important that people know why the opposition was 
doing that type of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way it works in this setting for the information of 
the folks at home.  The opposition puts forward amendments, much 
like we are doing today, substantive, real amendments like 
successor rights, but the government most often turns them down 
and does not give them fair and due consideration.  If the 
amendments are put forward in cabinet or if they are put forward 
by members of the government, whether they be in committee or 
privately to cabinet members or however that process may work, 
they are more likely to be considered and implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were given good information that there were people on the 
government side who had problems with successor rights as they 
stand in Bill C-19 and there were people who had problems with 
privacy concerns and there were people who had problems with the 
violation of the secret ballot as proposed in Bill C-19, along 
with a few other things.  We were giving those members time to 
bring those concerns forward in committee and they failed to do 
so.   Those members who said they had a backbone in the 
government caucus and said they had a backbone in the cabinet 
failed to have one and failed to bring forward those changes to 
Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Minister of Labour who said that he did not have the 
resources in his own office to fight his own departmental 
officials on those aspects of Bill C-19 that he thought were over 
the top, shame on him.  To the Minister of National Revenue who 
had concerns yet did not bring forward these things in committee 
and did not actually get a change when push came to shove, shame 
on him.  Shame on them. To the Liberal caucus members who sat in 
HRD committee and argued along with the Reform Party on some of 
these substantive changes that we wanted early on when we were 
questioning witnesses in testimony, shame on them for not having 
put forward those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to see those things brought forward. We will be 
speaking about them today at report stage and we will be speaking 
about them at third reading.  Shame on the government for not 
having brought those things forward.  We know that is the only 
way those things would have been given proper and due 
consideration.  The fact that the government put the 40th time 
allocation since it has been in office shows that government 
members have had little will or little backbone to stand up to 
the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 basically amounts to a departmental official being 
shuffled off for many years into a sideline of the labour 
department. 
Mike McDermott finally had his glowing chance and I talked with 
him many times in committee.  To him I say, I guess you finally 
have your chance to leave your glowing mark on Canadian labour 
legislation by going ahead and embedding successor rights, going 
ahead and violating the secret ballots in workplace democracy, 
going ahead and not allowing final offer selection arbitration, 
but shoving through instead more cabinet power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-19, in Clause 31, be amended by replacing lines 19 
to 21 on page 23 with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) The Minister may take only one action referred to in this 
section with respect to any particular dispute involving a 
bargaining unit and, in the case of one of the actions referred 
to in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) or (c), the Minister may take the 
action only with the consent of the parties.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased once again to take part in 
the debate on Bill C-19 through this logical amendment, which is 
consistent with the objectives of the new Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an amendment that might be described as ancillary, but 
which takes on its full meaning in the context of a labour 
dispute when the minister is called upon to use his authority to 
step in and appoint someone to resolve the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members probably know, there are three courses open to the 
minister:  he may appoint a conciliation officer, a conciliation 
commissioner, or a conciliation board.  I will read an extract 
from this clause on page 23 of the bill:

section with respect to any particular dispute involving a

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are adding, and to a certain extent this strengthens the 
intent of the legislation, is that such a decision may be taken 
by the minister only with the consent of the parties.  If a 
labour dispute were dragging on and tensions were mounting, it 
would be a bit ridiculous for the minister to decide to step in 
arbitrarily, on his own initiative, and impose action that is 
supposed to resolve the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the minister should have the consent 
of the parties to appoint a conciliation officer, a conciliation 
commissioner or a conciliation board, and that this should be 
done in a spirit of co-operation, without which such a decision 
on the part of the minister might well have the effect of 
worsening the situation, rather than resolving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only common sense that the government intervention 
provided for in the legislation should be desired by the 
parties. If it is not, it could have an effect opposite to that 
intended.  If the parties are not forced to consent to one of 
the three mechanisms available to them and thus perhaps reflect 
on how the situation is developing, things may get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is introducing this sensible amendment in the 
hope that the government and the other opposition parties will 
approve it, in order to improve the Canada Labour Code for the 
greater good of the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this motion would entirely 
remove the Minister of Labour's discretion to appoint 
conciliation assistance unless the parties were to consent to 
such an appointment.  Presumably it would require the joint 
consent of both labour and management before the minister could 
make an appointment under the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government prescribed conciliation services have had a long and 
distinguished history reaching back to the very beginning of this 
century when in 1900 the Conciliation Act established the 
Department of Labour and provided for conciliation of labour 
disputes.  Over the years the system has been modified. Currently 
the minister has full authority to appoint not just one but two 
consecutive levels of conciliation and that without the agreement 
of the party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presenter of the motion does understand that conciliation 
works best when the parties are committed to the process.  What 
he perhaps does not understand is that sometimes in labour 
disputes a party will want to have conciliation assistance but 
will not want to ask for it for fear that such a request will be 
taken as a sign of weakness.  That is where leaving discretion to 
the minister to appoint can be of great value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the extensive consultation process leading up to the 
introduction of Bill C-19, representatives of labour and 
management organizations subject to part I of the code, while 
critical of lengthy delays in the current conciliation process 
found conciliation valuable and praised the services offered by 
the federal mediation and conciliation service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour-management working group did not recommend that 
compulsory conciliation be abolished, only that the two stage 
process be replaced by a single stage which could take various 
forms. This consensus is reflected in a single stage, time 
limited conciliation process included in Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims task force found that conciliation remains an important 
function and that the federal mediation and conciliation service 
is a resource that helps reduce industrial conflict in Canada. 
Over 90% of disputes referred to conciliation are resolved with 
the assistance of conciliation officers without resort to work 
stoppages.  The task force—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think you will find that 
there is not a quorum in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am surprised. 
Reform Party members say they want to debate this bill and talk 
about the amendments and then the hon. member calls quorum and 
leaves the Chamber.  He does not even stay to listen to the 
debate.  It is really quite hypocritical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am sure that the hon. parliamentary secretary knows it 
is not proper to comment on the presence or absence of members in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Wetaskiwin is quite correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my apologies for 
pointing out that the member had left the Chamber when he called 
quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force recommended that because of the nature of the 
federal jurisdiction and the prevalence of industries providing 
services to the public it is important that every effort be made 
and be seen to be made to find an avenue for settlement before 
the parties decide to resort to economic sanctions to further 
their bargaining objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, the Minister of Labour requires the parties to 
take part in conciliation proceedings.  Conciliation has proven 
successful in assisting the parties to arrive at settlements in 
the vast majority of cases and should remain an option for the 
Minister of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elsewhere in the bill, of course, the conciliation process is 
being streamlined and modernized.  I have already mentioned the 
two stages being compressed into one stage.  The process is also 
being limited in duration unless the parties jointly agree to 
extend it.  This should please the presenter of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps just as important is the new profile being given to the 
federal mediation and conciliation service.  The service is well 
respected and the important role of the head of the FMCS in 
advising the Minister of Labour on dispute resolution will be 
formally recognized in the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the service will gain statutory recognition for its 
work in fostering harmonious relations between labour and 
management.  This will provide the platform from which to launch 
relationship building programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, Bill C-19 recognizes the value of conciliation and lays 
the foundation for its continuing development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
again find ourselves, for I think the 40th time, looking at time 
allocation in the House.  We believe this is a very important 
piece of legislation that should be debated.  We have noted that 
in the past when the Liberals were in opposition they thought it 
was absolutely deplorable that the Tories would move time 
allocation as many times as they did.  The Liberals wrote the 
book on time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer members back to the beginning of the 36th 
Parliament.  The first item on the Order Paper was Bill C-19.  It 
languished on the Order Paper until sometime in November when it 
was given first reading.  It remained on the Order Paper and just 
recently there was a big panic to put through the labour 
legislation which, I might add, was also an item of business in 
the 35th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly there is a big panic to get this legislation passed, to 
the point where the government is only going to allow one further 
day of debate at report stage and one further day at third 
reading.  I think this is an unprecedented abuse of the power of 
the government to lord it over the opposition. 
Our duty is to point out how we think we can improve this 
legislation and the government, I submit, is really hampering us 
in doing that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak specifically to Group No. 4, the amendment put forth by 
my colleague from the Bloc indicates that the parties should 
agree on who the conciliator or the conciliation board should be 
at a point when the two parties cannot seem to agree on much of 
anything.  This comes at a point when both labour and management 
have agreed to disagree basically on everything or negotiations 
would not have broken off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that if the member's motion had read that both parties 
would submit names of conciliation officers that they would 
approve of and if each side happened to recommend a person whom 
each one agreed on then that would be fine.  But to come up with 
a conciliator, an officer or a board, to make any sort of 
judgment on this is going to be extremely difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are looking at people who are going to come in to assess 
the situation and render a decision, I think that input from the 
two groups would be a good idea.  If they happen to agree on a 
person to arbitrate the case, that is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe, though, that my colleague's amendment has a 
chance in the world of passing since at committee, on at least 
one occasion, members of the government made remarks that they 
certainly were not foolish enough to entertain or to pass any 
amendments put forth by the opposition.  So I would caution my 
colleague that although his intentions are no doubt honourable 
and will, in his opinion, improve the legislation, he has about 
as much chance of having this amendment passed as the proverbial 
snowball in Hades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not prejudge the hon. member, but I think he may have 
overlooked one of the decisions the minister can make here.  He 
may appoint a conciliation officer, a conciliation board or 
advise the parties of his intention to do neither.  He may just 
say “No, I do not think it is appropriate for me to get involved 
at this time”, and the parties would therefore be forced into a 
situation where they would have to go back and negotiate and get 
down to brass tacks rather than just throw their hands up and 
turn it over to someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot said in the House about whether this party 
or that party supports the collective bargaining process. 
Certainly the Reform Party does support the right to organize 
peacefully, to strike and to negotiate through a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think the legislation, as I have said before in the 
House, is patterned after a report by Mr. Andrew Sims, and he 
named the report “Seeking a Balance”.  Certainly that is a 
noble goal for any labour legislation and indeed for most 
legislation, that it be balanced.  Page after page of the report 
concerns the empowerment of the union organizers, the union 
bosses, and not necessarily the rank and file people who pay 
membership dues to the union, and certainly not the people who 
provide jobs for those union members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
we first saw the amendment with the idea of reviewing the role of 
the conciliation officer et cetera, we viewed it in a favourable 
light.  Our caucus wrestled for quite some time as to whether we 
would support the amendment.  At this time we are satisfied that 
the changes made to the original Bill C-19 will address some of 
the things we recognized as being problematic.  Moving from a two 
stage process to a single stage process was a very positive step. 
Given the spirit and the history of how the amendments that form 
part of Bill C-19 were arrived at, we were very reluctant to 
upset that fine balance or compromise that went into the changes 
we see in Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that our caucus will not be able to support Motion No. 
10.  We will be voting against it, but not for the same reasons 
we have been hearing from the official opposition.  We are 
finding more and more that the tone of the official opposition's 
comments regarding this whole piece of legislation, no matter 
which group of motions we are talking to, has an underlying 
sinister quality to it.  There is an anger and a bitterness 
surging forward in all Reformers' comments that reveals their 
true attitude toward the industrial relations climate in Canada. 
I do not think it has its basis in the same spirit of 
co-operation that was in the original Bill C-19.  I am 
disappointed to that degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw some of the delay tactics that went on during committee 
stage and the filibustering that occurred during report stage.  I 
wonder what prairie farmers think as they view these deliberate 
stalling tactics which hold back a very worthy piece of 
legislation.  The agriculture industry in my province is looking 
forward to this legislation.  We are coming up to another season 
when grain will be shipped through the west coast ports.  The 
producers want the security that their products will be handled 
at those terminals no matter what kind of labour relations 
climate might exist at those terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its stalling tactics, at least until the closure motion of 
today, the Reform Party has jeopardized the possibility of moving 
this bill forward in a timely fashion, at least in time for the 
harvest season when grain shipping at west coast ports will be an 
issue again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tone of the rest of Reform's comments reminds me of another 
message I have heard for years.  It is a poison that has been 
sliding across the Canada-U.S. border in recent years.  That 
poison is called right to work legislation.  This seems to be the 
songbook that Reformers are singing their hymns from.  It is not 
original, but it seems they have glommed onto it as if it were a 
new idea.  It is sort of like the way they have glommed onto 
final offer selection as if it is some brand new idea they have 
just come up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody knows what right to work is about.  The Fraser 
Institute has just written a book and sent a copy to all MPs in 
an effort to promote this idea as the way we should conduct 
ourselves in the 21st century within the labour relations 
climate.  We have another book that shows the empirical evidence, 
the actual statistics, of what it is like to live in a right to 
work state.  One of those states had lower than average incomes 
and the poverty level was higher.  The right to work is really 
the right to work for less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is using the debate on Bill C-19 as a platform 
from which to launch its ideas on right to work legislation. 
They were frustrated in Alberta.  The Klein government looked at 
right to work legislation and found it was too radical and too 
conservative.

right to work legislation trying to be foisted on the Canadian 
people through the back door, through debate on a very worthy 
piece of labour legislation, Bill C-19.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, my colleagues listened carefully and, 
fortunately, there is a consensus on the amendments that must be 
made to the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are interested in how, based on the labour code's provisions, 
a vote allowing workers to go on strike or employers to initiate 
a lockout would be held. We object to the procedure, and we 
wonder where the government got this strange idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel the government is unduly trying to control, to say the 
least, the union in terms of how it operates and in terms of its 
relations with its own members. Indeed, the government is 
proposing a slew of means and mechanisms that have the effect of 
controlling the union a little too much, and this is why we are 
proposing these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 reflects our opposition to the 72 hour notice that 
is required under the bill, and that is supposed to be given by 
the union in case of a strike or by the employer in case of a 
lockout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this amendment, we are causing it to be withdrawn 
because we think there is no need for notice to be given to 
either party. The party that decides to hold a strike or lockout 
should decide on the most appropriate time to do so without 
necessarily being required à because this would become a 
requirement à to give notice to the other side that it plans to 
act on its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, regarding Motion No. 12, where the 72 hour strike or 
lockout notice is not acted on, section 87.2(3) provides that a 
new notice must be given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only for reasons of mere logic and consistency, we object to 
either party having to give a new notice where the strike or 
lockout initially planned did not occur. 
That is what Motion No. 12, which we feel will be passed by this 
House, is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 all concern the whole 
voting mechanism and the notices to be given. Once a vote has 
been held authorizing the union to initiate a strike, under the 
new Canada Labour Code as amended by Bill C-19, a strike must be 
initiated within 60 days of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider this to be an arbitrary, unnecessary deadline, 
which, as Canadians—which we will probably remain for a short 
time—would say, could cause serious organizational problems 
given how huge this country is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From coast to coast, from Newfoundland to British Columbia, 
unions could run into serious logistical problems if they had to 
hold a strike within 60 days of the strike vote.  Let us say, 
for example, that an agreement has almost been reached, and the 
union has decided not to strike within the 60 days provided 
under the law.  If an agreement is not reached, another strike 
vote has to be held.  Given the breadth of this country, we are 
not sure that the government is making a wise choice in imposing 
such a time frame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider that no time period should be provided, that, once 
the parties have the right to strike or to lockout they may do 
so when they consider it appropriate, without being overly 
restricted, as is the case here, by a time frame of 60 days 
following a strike or lockout vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last motions, namely Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 17 set out the 
terms of voting, the conduct of a vote and the procedure for 
having a vote declared invalid.  We have little sympathy for 
this sort of government intervention in voting activities and in 
technicalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amounts to inappropriate intrusion in the operations of the 
union.  I think they are going after the unions. 
There is also provision for an individual to invalidate a vote 
if they are not happy with it.  Labour relations are complex 
enough as it is, and I see no need for the government to 
intervene in such matters.  If there is one body in this country 
that is not in a moral position to interfere in the business of 
others and tell them how to behave it is the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of elections—of direct concern to it—the government 
is in no position to give anybody lessons on how to hold a vote. 
We all know that returning officers in this fine country are 
appointed on a purely partisan basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec we can count on our fingers the number of federal 
ridings where the returning officers have qualifications other 
than that of having worked for the Liberal Party of Canada. 
They come up with such inventions as postal votes, proxy votes, 
which are an open invitation to all unscrupulous organizers 
tempted to manipulate vote outcomes.  This has been done 
shamelessly in some Quebec ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering how lax the federal government is with respect to 
the Canada Elections Act, it is in a very poor position to 
lecture Canada's unions on how to carry out a vote, how to 
declare a vote invalid and all the procedures related to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be a good thing for the Canadian Liberal government to 
use its own bill as a model for inserting a bit more discipline 
into the Canada Elections Act, in order to clean up the mess we 
have got into in Quebec. 
Such practices as going after the senior vote by pursuing them 
to hospital rooms, waking patients up—it has gone as far as that 
à going door to door not to influence the vote, as our democracy 
is meant to work, but to get people out to vote.  So they are 
far indeed from being in a position to lecture others, as they 
are in Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unimpressive to see this government indicating 
non-confidence in the way unions have always operated.  The 
federal government is most certainly not the one who should be 
giving lessons to anyone in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that these words have cast some light on this matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this group of motions deals 
with the new requirement for exercising the right to strike or 
the right to lock out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-19 the right to strike or lock out will be acquired 
21 days after conciliation is completed, subject to the parties 
meeting new requirements regarding the holding of a secret ballot 
vote within the previous 60 days and the giving of a 72 hour 
advance notice of a strike or a lockout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions. Nos. 11 an 12 would delete the reference to the 72 hour 
notice requirement and the obligation to send a new notice if no 
strike or lockout occurs at the end of the notice period.  The 
new 72 hour notice provision implements the recommendation of the 
Sims task force.  Its purpose is twofold.  It will allow for an 
orderly shutdown or reduction of operations and resolve the 
problem of perishable items.  It will further focus the parties 
on serious negotiations and should encourage settlement of 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those unions which feel that this new requirement will 
frustrate the right to strike, it is important to point out that 
Bill C-19 will not require that a new notice be given once a 
strike or lockout action has commenced, even if it is temporarily 
suspended.  Furthermore, where the other side begins a strike or 
a lockout action, the 72 hour notice requirement will not apply 
to the other party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some unions, mostly longshore unions, have said that the 72 hour 
notice requirement will allow an unfair advantage to the shipping 
companies and agents in the negotiating process as it will remove 
the prospect of ships being held captive during a port work 
stoppage.  This position is echoed by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major economic impact of a port work stoppage is that the 
port is closed and the fixed capital remains idle.  Surely such a 
major impact on important investments is a significant pressure 
point and a reasonable offset for the loss of income employees 
must incur during a work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the code recognizes a union's right to exercise economic 
pressure on the employer engaged in a labour dispute, and the 
strike is one of the economic sanctions that can be used, it is 
only reasonable that both parties have time to prepare for its 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in the small number of cases under the code 
where the parties do resort to work stoppage action that the 72 
hour notice requirement will ensure an orderly shutdown or 
reduction of operations.  Who knows?  There may even be a last 
successful effort at settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has put forward five motions relating to the 
strike and lockout vote requirement.  These include the removal 
of the requirement that the strike or lockout vote be held within 
the previous 60 days, the removal of the entire section 87.3 
dealing with strike and lockout votes, the removal of the rules 
governing the conduct of the vote requirement, the removal of the 
procedure to contest irregularities, and the removal of the 
board's authority to summarily dismiss an unjustified challenge 
of votes and to order that a new vote be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to stress that with the exception of the current 
Canada Labour Code secret ballot strike votes are mandatory in 
all Canadian jurisdictions including Quebec as a prerequisite for 
legal strike action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the vast majority of unions subject to the code already 
hold secret ballot votes before declaring a strike, employees in 
the bargaining unit who are not union members may be excluded 
from participating in a major decision which directly affects 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strike votes are not always held in a timely fashion.  In some 
cases a strike mandate is acquired early in the bargaining 
process as a means of demonstrating solid employee support for 
union demands but may not be a true reflection of support for a 
work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions for a valid vote specified in Bill C-19 reflect 
the recommendations of the Sims task force.  They are similar to 
provisions found in a number of provincial statutes.  They are 
not onerous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to imagine that any democratically held vote would 
fail to meet these basic requirements.  These conditions will 
simply ensure that such votes are timely, fairly conducted and 
based on the entire workplace involved in the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty understanding why the Bloc Quebecois objects 
to a requirement for votes to be held in such a manner as to 
allow eligible workers a reasonable opportunity to participate in 
a vote and to be made aware of the results.  Surely this is 
fundamental to the democratic principles which trade unions 
recognize and practise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also proposing that there be no 
opportunity for an employee in the bargaining unit to allege 
irregularities in the conduct of a strike vote.  Surely there 
should be some recourse for employees who allege they have been 
unfairly denied the opportunity to participate in a strike vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without such a provision the requirements of this section could 
not be enforced.  Concerns have been raised that the 60 day 
period for holding a strike vote may cause difficulty in some 
cases, particularly where employees in the bargaining unit are 
employed across the country or do not work at a specific 
location.  By allowing the 60 day validity period for a strike 
vote to be extended Bill C-19 addresses these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 72 hour notice requirement and the strike and lockout vote 
provisions in Bill C-19 are fair and democratic.  I urge members 
to support them and to reject the amendments proposed by these 
motions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
Group No. 5 we see several motions put forth by the Bloc and 
unfortunately we can support none of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirement for a 72 hour notice before a work stoppage 
takes place is a reasonable one.  The Bloc wants to delete this 
provision.  We do not agree with that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 72 hour notice period is one of the few positive features of 
Bill C-19, at least one of the changes we could support.  It 
would allow innocent third parties that have goods in transit, 
for instance, an opportunity to seek alternate arrangements.  Or, 
if their goods were actually in transit, they would have an 
opportunity to carry on their journey prior to having the 
services withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times we find perishable goods stranded somewhere and by 
the time labour and management have resolved their differences 
the perishable goods have spoiled.  That is unfortunate and not 
fair to innocent third parties that ship these goods.  Of course 
it has a very detrimental affect on Canada's economy overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments put forth by my colleagues in the Bloc are not in 
concert with the idea of seeking a balance between labour and 
management.  The people who use these services must be considered 
more because when services are withdrawn, whether through a 
strike or a lockout, it is not just management and labour that 
are affected.  It is all the people who rely on the services in 
the area where federal industrial relations apply.  Oftentimes 
these are services for which there is not an immediate 
alternative. 
In many cases this is the only game in town as far as the 
services are concerned.  The provision for the 72 hour notice 
before a strike or lockout is a rather reasonable one and should 
not be amended as my colleague has suggested.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 60 days as referred to in Motion No. 13 is reasonable and 
sufficient to negotiate and give the employers and employees time 
to prepare for possible work disruptions.  As the parliamentary 
secretary alluded to several times in her statement, it allows 
for an orderly shutdown.  It also allows time for people to make 
alternate plans.  We concur with that.  We think it is 
reasonable. We think it is an area that would not be improved by 
the amendment put forth by our colleague in the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 14 in particular seems to be a continuation of Motion 
No. 13.  It would seem to deny worker and employee associations 
an opportunity to participate in a ballot vote.  Our party is 
very much in support of a ballot vote being taken to determine 
whether there should be work stoppage or a strike.  Also a ballot 
vote should be taken to determine whether or not a union should 
be certified.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Group No. 6 deals with the continuation 
of services where there is a situation in which the danger to 
public health or safety may exist and the minister would be able 
to step in and intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems very reasonable.  There are, however, no provisions 
in the bill that would allow for the continuation of service in 
order to protect Canada's economy.  For instance, in the 1994 
west coast work stoppage the estimated cost was in the range of 
$125 million.  That is the direct cost.  That is what was 
estimated it would cost the Canadian farmers by not getting their 
crops to market.  I suppose one could say they would eventually 
get their crops to market but if an item is not on the shelf, so 
to speak, it is extremely difficult to sell it.  I think this is 
one occasion where a work stoppage had a devastating effect on 
the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the direct costs at the moment of roughly 
$125 million.  Indirectly the figures vary but it has been 
generally stated that the indirect costs could be as high as $250 
million and a possibility of threatening $500 million in grain 
sales in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we say threatened grain sales in the future?  If 
customers come to Canada for a load of grain and they find their 
ships have to wait in the port for a week or two weeks or three 
weeks and they have to go down to Seattle or Portland in order to 
get a load of grain, in the future they are going to say why take 
chances on going to Canada and not get the supply order they came 
for, that perhaps they should deal with the United States in the 
first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be some protection in the bill to protect the 
economy and to protect the innocent third parties who rely on 
these services.  Services, as I have stated before, are not 
readily available.  It is not as though we have a multiple choice 
as far as where we can ship our grain.  Canada is not 
particularly well endowed with ports.  The ports we have are 
certainly well appointed and capable of handling a tremendous 
amount of traffic but we do not have very many. When we have work 
stoppages at Canada's major port on the west coast it has an 
absolutely devastating effect on the economy of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in the interests of all Canadians if we have 
reliable access to services.  Definitely it would help to keep 
employment within our borders and establish and maintain a 
reputation as a reliable worldwide supplier and exporter of 
goods. 
As I have said, we definitely have a world class transportation 
system and we should not allow it to fall whim to work stoppages, 
in particular work stoppages that occur at the highest traffic 
times of the year.  We will hear people say if you are going 
negotiate, to take some kind of a job action, the best time to 
take it is when there is lots of activity because you want to put 
optimum pressure on whomever you are bargaining with to come to 
terms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does provide for maintenance of services whenever 
there is a danger to public health or safety.  But I think the 
national economy is important enough that there should be some 
provision in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the bill we have seen the Canadian Industrial 
Relations Board, the replacement for the old Canada labour 
relations board, given all kinds of powers.  Indeed we see where 
the minister and the governor in council have all kinds of powers 
they can use as well.  We think it is only reasonable that they 
be given some latitude as to whether these work stoppages will 
have a devastating effect on Canada's economy and we have to look 
at the spin-off jobs damaged by the disruption in these services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 22 and 23 deal with amendments to the provision 
that ensures that grain once it reaches port will be shipped out. 
I would like to make it perfectly clear that the Reform Party is 
wholeheartedly in favour of farmers' grain being able to be 
shipped offshore unimpeded from the farm gate right to the high 
seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this bill does not guarantee that.  This bill does not 
address that.  This bill simply says that if the grain reaches 
the port it will be loaded on to the ships and the ships will be 
piloted out of the harbour.  It addresses the tie-up, loading and 
let go of grain vessels. We agree that is a good small step.  But 
what does it do for the farmers on the prairies who cannot get 
their grain to the port because there is some kind of a work 
stoppage somewhere else in the system, between the farm gate and 
the port?  This bill addresses no portion of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suggesting there should be some kind of dispute 
settlement mechanism in place that will allow services to 
continue in the west coast ports while negotiation takes place. 
We certainly agree that a negotiated settlement is far better and 
probably more long lasting than any kind of an imposed 
settlement.  Regardless of what our opponents will try to 
convince us of, that is our position.  We believe that to 
negotiate a settlement is the best way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are many other products, coal, sulphur, potash, 
dehydrated alfalfa, many petrochemical products as well, that 
depend on a deep water port to get their products to the markets, 
often to the Asian markets, and by sea is the only logical way to 
transport these products. The alfalfa dehydrators for instance 
export about $100 million worth of product a year and their 
product is perishable as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is put in a dispute settlement mechanism.  If 
the government decides the Reform Party has given too much 
profile to final offer selection arbitration and brings it in, it 
would be accused of caving into the Reform Party. Then let it 
come up with a dispute settlement mechanism of its own making, of 
its own naming, but something that would have the effect of the 
continuation of services at the west coast ports while we 
encourage those people to come to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the alternative over the years?  The alternative 
has been to legislate services back to work at the west coast 
ports.  Once that happens, there will be services reluctantly 
restored but there are none of the things addressed that brought 
about the work stoppage in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has used a dispute settlement mechanism over and 
over in the past in conjunction with back to work legislation. 
We are suggesting that a dispute settlement mechanism is needed 
here that would be far more effective than simply picking out one 
commodity and declaring it an essential service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly concur with the expedient movement of grain from 
the farm gate to the high seas.  We recognize the provisions in 
this bill are a small step in that direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-19 introduces for the 
first time in the Canada Labour Code provisions that would 
require the maintenance of activities necessary to prevent 
immediate and serious danger to public health and safety during 
work stoppages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also introduces a requirement for employers and 
employees in the ports to continue to provide services to grain 
vessels loaded at licensed terminal and transfer elevators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has put forward motions to amend these 
provisions.  One would make economic hardship to the national 
economy a criterion for requiring parties to maintain services 
during a work stoppage.  The others would require the parties in 
the ports to continue to provide their services to all vessels 
and to authorize the board to refer collective bargaining 
disputes in the ports for settlement by final offer selection 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these amendments would effectively remove the strike 
and lockout rights from all parties in the ports as well as large 
numbers of other employers and employees subject to part one of the 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an interventionist approach is contrary to the wishes of 
employers and unions who engage in collective bargaining under 
the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no precedent in Canada for the standing removal of 
strike and lockout rights from private sector parties as the 
official opposition is suggesting with respect to parties in the 
ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, no Canadian jurisdiction includes economic impact 
as a criterion for maintaining services during work stoppages, 
nor did parties subject to the code support such an approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims task force examined the issue of maintenance of 
activities and concluded that the right to strike or lockout 
should be removed from any group of workers or any employers 
subject to the code.  The task force did recommend that the code 
include specific provisions for the protection of public health 
and safety, criteria supported by both labour and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maintenance of activities provisions in Bill C-19 fairly 
balances the collective bargaining rights of employees and 
employers subject to the code with the public's right to 
protection of health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to the grain provision, grain has been declared to 
be for the general advantage of Canada.  It is a multibillion 
dollar industry exporting to over 70 countries worldwide.  The 
livelihood of over 130,000 farmers and their families depends on 
Canada's maintaining its reputation as a reliable exporter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These interests must, however, be balanced with the rights of 
labour and management to determine fair terms and conditions of 
employment through collective bargaining.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1972 there have been 12 work stoppages in west coast ports 
which have disrupted grain exports.  Nine of these work stoppages 
have involved longshoremen and their employers and were ended by 
parliament.  Only three work stoppages have involved grain 
handlers and in one case the major terminal elevators in 
Vancouver were not affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two independent studies found that longshore employers and 
unions have avoided their collective bargaining responsibilities 
by using disruptions to grain exports to trigger back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain provision in Bill C-19 is designed to reduce 
disruptions to grain exports caused by work stoppages in the 
ports, reduce the reliance of parties in the ports on 
parliamentary intervention in their disputes and maintain the 
strike and lockout rights of parties in both the port and grain 
handling sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claims that this provision discriminates against other resources 
by singling out grain for special treatment overlook the fact 
that grain has already been singled out by longshore employers 
and unions using it as a trigger for back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claims that longshore unions will use the revenue earned by 
loading grain to finance longer work stoppages are without 
foundation.  No more than 200 employees in a total west coast 
longshore workforce of well over 3,000 ever service grain 
vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the main port of Vancouver the percentage of longshore 
employees assigned to grain vessels is between 5% and 8%.  After 
tax earnings from this source would not sustain a lengthy work 
stoppage for the union which maintains no strike fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision has the full support of the grain industry and 
the grain producers who, unlike other resource producers, have no 
relationship or influence on collective bargaining between the 
longshore employers and unions. I also want to note that the 
government has committed to reviewing the effectiveness of this 
provision in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that if one had been at the hearings and 
heard farmers speak about this clause and knew how much the 
western farmers need this clause it would be hard to understand 
why the Reform Party is trying to hold up this bill.  It is hard 
for me to understand why it is holding the western farmers 
hostage in this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do urge members to support the provisions in Bill C-19 and 
reject the radical approaches being suggested by the official 
opposition which would conflict with Canada's International 
Labour Organization commitments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased once again to participate in this debate, particularly 
as it regards these two motions put forward by the Reform Party. 
Many things can be said about that party, but it cannot be said 
to keep its cards close to its chest. It cannot be said to hide 
the contempt it has for the workers or at least for labour 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since things in this House are not always spelled out, it is 
worth reading these motions for the benefit of our listeners and 
for your benefit, Mr. Speaker, to see what they are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first little masterpiece is found on page 28. Motion No. 18 
of the Reform Party concerns section 87.4, which deals 
essentially with the maintenance of certain activities, which we 
in Quebec refer to in more transparent terms as essential 
services, such as public safety and health, as the Canada Labour 
Code refers to. However, as you will see, the Reform Party has 
added a very cute line 
about public safety and health with respect to economic 
activities in this country. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>87.4(1) During a strike or lockout not prohibited by this Part, 
the employer, the trade union and the employees in the 
bargaining unit must continue the supply of services, operation 
of facilities or production of goods to the extent necessary to 
prevent an immediate and serious danger to the safety or health 
of the public. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ever the Reform Party came to power in Canada—poor Canada—this 
would be all the more reason for Quebeckers to leave this 
country. And there are plenty of reasons. 
The Reform Party wants to add the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“of the public or the causing of severe economic hardship to the 
national economy”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this actually does is undermine the very existence of the 
right to strike and form a union because, ultimately, unions no 
longer have the right to strike, which is one of the things that 
make society fairer.  Let us not kid ourselves; in the history 
of humanity, unions are a plus, not a minus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tactics as vicious as this, where a few little words completely 
undermine the real power, the equal footing at the heart of 
labour management negotiations, are a move—and a completely 
neo-Liberal one at that—to destroy the middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The middle class benefits from the distribution of wealth and, 
through social programs and collective agreements, from the fact 
that wealth in this world is no longer concentrated in the hands 
of a tiny few but has been redistributed among several thousands 
of individuals.  In the West, Europe, Scandinavia, North 
America, but unfortunately not many other places, there is a 
strong middle class that may also enjoy life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is at stake, make no mistake, if we approve such a 
motion, which adds a few words to ensure that strikes do not 
cause severe economic hardship to the national economy. 
They must not put anyone out.  “Go ahead and strike, but we will 
make sure that no one is put out”.  This is very hypocritical 
and cynical and members should be aware that it is part of an 
ideology that would see the gap between rich and poor grow as 
wide as possible and wealth increasingly concentrated in the 
hands of a tiny few, as it was before the industrial revolution 
and the appearance of unions in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same holds for the other amendment, which is undoubtedly a 
recommendation of the Sims report. 
It refers directly to the problem already experienced by western 
Canada, where there is a special provision for grain vessels, 
and the fact that grain vessels and all related port activities 
must continue to operate, strike or no strike, and this 
provision is imposed on employers and unions.  As I understood 
the witnesses, the wisdom of this provision is the envy of other 
sectors of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But grain shipping is an activity based on a perishable product 
and that is what lawmakers, in their wisdom, wish to illustrate. 
It seems that the members of the Reform Party and the right, 
those with a one track mind, cannot contemplate such subtlety in 
society, that is, they cannot contemplate our making legislative 
provision for perishable goods known as grains, which determine 
the economic activity of an entire region of this great country 
Canada, where those who testified, the farmers, are economically 
vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the code is attempting to remedy and what we 
support, but what is opposed by the spokespeople of big 
business, that is the oil and mining companies, which complained 
that one sector was getting special treatment while the 
necessary adjustments were not being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few people are aware of the fact, and I think the members 
all learned about it from a witness, whose name I have 
unfortunately forgotten, that this provision is contained in the 
Canadian Constitution, which would have to be amended in order 
to do away with this issue of grain crops and the special status 
accorded grains and wheat production in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the wording of the code is warranted.  The Reform 
Party, with Motion No. 22, is seeking to replace the words 
“grain vessels” with “let-go and loading of vessels and the 
move”.  Thus they are broadening the scope of the bill by 
changing its content and giving everyone the same treatment. 
There would be no more special status.

like a school of thought—which, we hope, will soon disappear—that 
of the impoverishment of the poor and the enrichment of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity 
to speak to the motions in Group No. 6 of Bill C-19.  I am sure 
my hardworking colleague from the official opposition, the critic 
for the labour file and the member for Wetaskiwin, recognizes 
this is a very important bill and a very positive step in 
amending the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure most of my colleagues in this House remember sitting 
in this House on a Saturday and a Sunday in 1994 in support of 
our western grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has proposed a change to section 87.7 
from a limited requirement for parties in the ports to continue 
services to grain vessels to a complete ban on strikes and 
lockouts in the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 87.7 addresses a specific problem identified by two 
independent studies.  That is, parties in the west coast ports 
have been using disruptions to grain exports as a trigger for 
parliamentary intervention in their disputes. Removing this 
trigger without removing the strike and lockout rights of the 
parties will force them to accept their responsibilities and 
develop their own solutions to collective bargaining issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of this provision claim it discriminates against other 
resources.  However when questioned before the standing 
committee, they admitted that it is in their interest to retain 
grain as a trigger for parliamentary intervention.  They know 
that as long as grain exports are disrupted, parliament will be 
quickly pressured into intervening in a work stoppage.  They want 
to be able to continue to use the 130,000 western grain farm 
families as pawns in someone else's labour dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 87.7 has the strong support of western grain producers 
and the grain industry.  These groups pointed out to the 
committee that the grain industry is unique not only because it 
is food and because the world continues to exist on an 18 to 21 
day grain supply, but also because of the political nature of 
production, transportation and marketing. It is this uniqueness 
of grain that has been detrimental to the labour peace at the 
west coast ports during contract negotiations.  In their view 
section 87.7 will help bring grain back to a more level playing 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is of the view, as was the Sims task force, that 
without the ability to interrupt grain exports, the parties in 
the ports will be forced to accept their responsibilities and to 
settle their disputes without lengthy work stoppages.  Those who 
oppose the provision claim and some even threaten that the 
provision will not work.  It can work.  The parties have the 
ability to negotiate with each other and conclude agreements 
which are good for them and for the health of the ports.  They 
should concentrate on solving their own problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadian ports are to remain competitive, the parties must 
work together to find workable solutions to collective bargaining 
issues.  Remove strike and lockout rights and you remove the 
incentive for the parties to deal with issues important to the 
future of the industry.

not going to rise to speak to this group of motions, but because 
of what I am hearing from the two sides I would like to comment 
on Motion No. 18 in Group 6.  As I understand this motion, a 
strike would not be allowed or would be ended if economic 
hardship could be demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question how anybody could be that painfully naive about 
labour relations to put forward a motion that would call for 
a strike to cease if there was economic hardship demonstrated. 
What is the purpose of withholding services if not to peacefully 
apply some kind of economic pressure on the other party?  That is 
the very nature of withholding services, to try to motivate 
somebody to your way of thinking.  There is a level of naivety 
there.  I hope it is naivety and not just plain ignorance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking against the idea that this motion should even be 
entertained.  Anybody who has some labour relations background in 
this House would see through that immediately and would not give 
it the time of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are putting this package forward should remember 
that Bill C-19 was born out of a truly co-operative consultative 
process which was almost an experiment.  It was almost a pilot 
project on how to amend labour legislation.  Labour and 
management worked together for more than two years to try to find 
the balance they were seeking, the balance recommended by the 
Sims task force.  They have done an admirable job.  Many of the 
motions we are dealing with today would tend to upset that 
delicate balance and would jeopardize the success of the whole 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other tripartite models of labour, management and 
government working together around the world.  Those countries 
are moving forward as nations and are doing a good job of 
elevating the standards of the living conditions of the people 
they represent.  Those countries have realized that it has to be 
a tripartite model.  The hostility and the adversarial qualities 
that we sense from the tone of some of the Reform Party motions 
will only hold us back as a nation.  There is no future in that 
kind of thing, with one party determined to stamp out the other. 
Instead the more civilized model is the three parties working 
together and moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are hearing from the Reform Party, in many of the 
motions it is putting forward, is a reworked version of the right 
to work movement.  Do we want to go in that direction?  We should 
be cautious.  We should look at those places where right to work 
is a reality before we take that particular road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>North Carolina is a right to work state.  Everybody has heard of 
the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire in 1913 that founded the 
whole idea that workplace safety and health is an issue.  The 
whole world agreed that it was too horrible to ever let it happen 
again.  I have news for members.  In the right to work state of 
North Carolina, 20 women died recently in a fire in a chicken 
processing plant because they chained the doors closed from the 
outside.  They were convinced that these low-waged women were 
stealing by-products from the chickens, like wing tips, to make 
soup when they got home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1913 to 1995 we have come the whole circle.  With that kind 
of environment, where there is no worker representation on joint 
labour-management safety committees, standards quickly erode if 
we are not diligent about trying to elevate the standards and 
working conditions.  Right to work is a step in the wrong 
direction in that regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the other motions deal with the movement of grain 
through the west coast ports.  This is key and integral to the 
whole balance I was talking about in Bill C-19.  The whole 
process of Bill C-19 was a trade-off, where none of the parties 
really came away very satisfied that they got everything they 
wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to have seen a lot tougher anti-scab 
legislation.  Nobody likes to give away the right to strike, the 
right to peacefully withhold services, and in this case they have 
not, but in actual fact the grain will keep carrying through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive side of this, the upside and the side that seems to 
be lost on the Reform Party, is that there are about 130,000 
Canadian farmers who are anxiously awaiting the speedy passage of 
this legislation so they can feel secure that their crops this 
year will not be interrupted by any kind of a dispute at the west 
coast ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk to pool elevator operators, the UGG or the whole 
agribusiness.  They want this bill to go through, and yet we have 
the Reform Party, largely made up of representatives from western 
agricultural districts, being an obstacle and a barrier to this 
very real benefit to the whole prairie agricultural industry.  It 
is a real contradiction.  I hope Reform members are thinking this 
through.  As they stand to speak they should be aware that the 
industry is watching these debates very carefully.  I am sure 
they are scratching their heads wondering right now how they can 
see fit to justify being a barrier to the speedy passage of this 
particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the favourite right-wing think tank of the Reform 
Party is the Fraser Institute.  The Fraser Institute, that tax 
deductible, right-wing melting pot for all their ideas, is 
pushing the idea of right to work.  Donated copies of the book 
promoting right to work as the answer for labour relations in the 
21st century have arrived in our mailboxes.  They are trying to 
imply that Canada is backwards because we believe in a more 
progressive labour relations climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fraser Institute and the Reform Party are going down a 
dangerous road as they advocate this particular labour relations 
environment.  It is the role of labour and the role of 
governments to provide the legislative environment in which 
unions can do their job to elevate the standards of wages and 
working conditions for the people they represent.  It is a matter 
of the redistribution of wealth.  It is a matter of spreading the 
wealth of this great nation among the working people.  Anything 
that we do to hold that back does not move us forward in any way 
at all.  It is a myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that fair wages benefit the whole community.  I do 
not see what it is about that concept that bothers the Reform 
Party, but it seems bound and determined to reduce the ability of 
unions to do their job in elevating the standards of the 
community.  Holding us back in that regard does not help anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is middle-class people with money in their pockets who can go 
out, purchase things and get the economy moving.  Screwing them 
down in terms of wages does not benefit anybody.  That is the 
empirical evidence.  The statistics of all the right to work 
states in the United States, the 21 right to work states, show 
that some of them have no minimum wage.  All of them have a lower 
than average industrial wage.  They have worse health and safety 
legislation.  They even have a higher infant mortality rate and 
all the predictable things one would see in the low-income 
category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in our caucus that society does not move forward 
unless we all move forward together.  The motions that are being 
put forward by the Reform Party are completely the opposite of 
that point of view. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I begin my speech I have to make a comment on 
some of the last things that have been said and some of the 
previous speeches just before me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe what I am hearing.  The member who has just 
spoken, as others, talked in a very rational, calm tone, saying 
things that are totally false and we cannot leave those things 
unchallenged in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to us as being naive and not thinking through 
things.  I would challenge him to think through some of these 
things himself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about defending workers, that this is their mandate 
and so on.  Some of the amendments that we have put forward would 
in fact protect workers better.  They would help protect the 
economy.  When we are protecting the economy we are doing what is 
best for workers.  The NDP ought to think that through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who suffers most when we destroy the economy in certain areas? 
Of course it is the worker.  What the NDP does not realize is 
that innocent third parties are being hurt and hurt severely by 
what is happening at the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke said that we do not represent farmers 
and have not talked to them.  I have talked to farmers and I have 
spent a lot of time with them.  They have talked to me about this 
legislation.  That is why we have proposed some of these 
amendments.  For example, we have an amendment here that would 
include other commodities that farmers produce in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members display their lack of knowledge of the farm economy. 
Farmers do not just grow seeds and grains.  They produce other 
things that, when shipped, look almost like seeds but will not be 
treated the same in this bill.  For example, they produce alfalfa 
pellets which are simply dry little pellets that are made from 
alfalfa grass.  Why should that be treated any differently than 
wheat, barley or canola? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members have not addressed this.  They have read these 
prepared speeches from the bureaucrats without realizing that 
they do not address the problem that we have come to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking on behalf of farmers.  Why should we divide the 
agricultural community as this legislation does?  It is totally 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that the government keeps saying over and over is 
that Reform is holding up the bill.  Look at the reason we are 
pushing for these changes.  It is the lack of democracy in this 
House that forces us to try to get the attention of the 
government as to the importance of these amendments.  It just 
does not listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has a good aim.  There are some very good things in 
it.  But if it can be strengthened, why not strengthen it?  It 
makes no sense to simply pass this bill through the House and not 
consider some of the very reasoned and good amendments that we 
have put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government not to just listen to us.  I 
challenge the NDP.  I challenge the Bloc.  Do not just listen to 
what we are saying.  I believe if they talk to Canadians 
generally they will find that we have very strong support across 
the entire spectrum for these amendments.  I challenge the 
government to find out the same thing that we have found out, 
which is, this is what people want.  We need to return to a real 
balance in labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like now to begin my speech.  That was simply in reply 
to some of the things that were said previously which are totally 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole debate today was led off by the House leader for the 
Liberal Party.  I would like to read a quotation.  “I am 
shocked.  This is terrible.  This time we are talking about a 
major piece of legislation.  Shame on those Tories across the 
way”.  Do you know who said that, Mr. Speaker?  It was the very 
person who introduced the motion to invoke time allocation upon 
this bill.  It was the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read another quotation.  “It displays the utter disdain 
with which this government treats the Canadian people”.  That 
was said by the foreign affairs minister when he sat on this side 
of the House in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another quotation.  “This is not the way to run 
parliament.  This is abuse of the process in this House”.  I 
will not tell you, Mr. Speaker, who said it, but it was a highly 
esteemed member of the government.  I do not want to embarrass 
anybody in this House at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We want to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Maybe at a later time, but not at 
this time.  I respect the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain is given a preferential treatment. 
We are asking for equality.  In my riding alfalfa producers are 
really protesting this inequity.  I hope the government will 
reconsider and allow its members at least a free vote on this. If 
there is going to be any reform or any freeing up of this 
parliament the government has to lead in reforming and 
democratizing the House.  We are only one small voice in this 
regard.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has been said is that we should not be 
singling out just grain.  There are many other commodities that 
deserve equal protection.  We need to protect the national 
economy.  We have already made that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain producers and many other commodity shippers have been 
held hostage by the labour disputes at the west coast.  Third 
parties that have no control are greatly harmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a discussion in the House in the last couple of 
weeks on hepatitis C and the victims who have been harmed. Third 
parties were harmed and they had no control over the 
circumstances.  This is not in the same category but here is a 
third party being harmed by a situation over which it has no 
control, that being strikes at our ports.  It is blatantly unfair 
to allow that to continue.  I hear the NDP, the Liberals and the 
Bloc defending this but it is basically most unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a better solution such as final offer selection 
arbitration why not consider that?  It has worked and it has 
worked very effectively.  It would prevent some of the great harm 
that is being done to the third parties that suffer because of 
the strikes that take place.  It would be protection for the 
economy.  There is a balance here.  It is not just the strike but 
also the lockouts so it helps both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interest of all Canadians that we have reliable 
access to essential services.  If we do not what is going to 
happen?  We are going to lose some of the jobs to our competitors 
such as the United States.  We would like to keep employment 
within our borders.  We need to establish and maintain what we 
now have and that is a reputable world class export system.  We 
need to continue to maintain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has had this transportation and communications 
infrastructure and many of these things will gradually have to be 
scaled back if we allow these strikes and lockouts to continue. 
The disruption in day to day operations of vital transportation 
sectors would inhibit the national economy from functioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of motions that we would ask the government to 
support also deals with proposing an extension to include all the 
other commodities.  I have mentioned one which I am very familiar 
with and that is alfalfa pellets and alfalfa products.  There is 
no reason why that cannot be included in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if members realize that the port of Vancouver 
alone in 1960—I think that is the right date—had $30 billion in 
exports.  Only $4 billion of that is grain. The government is 
dividing up and giving special treatment to a certain sector and 
we have no problem.  We appreciate the fact that grain producers 
will have this protection but it should be extended to all.  That 
is why we cannot accept what the government has done and so have 
proposed the amendments. Grain is only about 20% of the 
commodities that are shipped to the west coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on Bill C-19 which seeks to amend the Canada 
Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen to debate from across the floor and from members from 
the other party accusing the Reform of being anti-worker, holding 
farmers hostage and trying to make the middle class rich.  I ask 
myself what is the debate leading to. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour harmony is very crucial to the economic prosperity of 
Canada.  That goes for the workers, the employers and management. 
Economic prosperity is a partnership between the workers, 
management and those who run the businesses.  Any time we create 
an imbalance going toward one right against the other then we are 
creating a situation where in the long run it affects all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my hon. colleague talks about the Reform Party spending 
time working for the middle class, I would like to tell him that 
the majority of the middle class are workers for whom he is 
saying he is fighting for their rights.  I do not know whose 
rights he is fighting for but he seems to write off the middle 
class.  I would like to remind the member that it is the middle 
class people who are also the workers of this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, we are trying to create a fair balance, a 
balance in the rights of the workers and the rights of the 
persons who have put the time, effort and sweat into running the 
business.  We cannot have one held hostage at the expense of the 
other.  Both are partners in the economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party in general supports many of the good intentions 
in this bill.  Like my colleague said, all we are trying to do is 
strengthen the bill.  We are not taking anybody's right away 
despite the rhetoric that comes from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague quoted what members on the other side said when 
they were on this side.  As a new member of parliament it makes 
me agree with Canadians who say politicians do not speak the 
truth.  These are the members who said one thing on closures 
while on this side of the House and another thing on closures on 
the other side.  This is not a good example for upcoming 
politicians in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has brought in Motions Nos. 18 and 20 which 
deal with the national economy as a whole.  The federal 
government has approximately 10% of the workforce under its 
jurisdiction.  That 10% is working in an environment providing 
service to all Canadians which is very important and crucial.  In 
some of the legislation it gives them a monopoly.  Therefore 
these industries have a very serious potential of harming all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this bill in terms of these motions that is what 
we are talking about.  It is wrong to say we are trying to hold 
workers hostage.  We are just trying to say that we should not 
hold Canadians hostage.  As such, my colleagues have brought in 
amendments that are trying to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that the continuation of service must carry on if there 
is a danger to public health and safety.  That is paramount and 
critically important.  However, we also feel that the national 
economy needs to be protected but not by taking away the rights 
of the workers as was said on the other side.  We want to create 
a balance to ensure that services go on and we do not hold the 
Canadian public hostage. 
Being a member of the union as well as working in the business 
sector, I feel everything needs to have a balance. I have had 
experience both in strikes and running a business. I can see that 
antagonistic attitudes, egos and all these things get in the way 
and create a situation that harms the Canadian public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 22 and 23 deal with the transportation of grain. 
Once the grain reaches the port it can be shipped out.  There are 
flaws in this and it is absolutely ludicrous for anyone to say 
that we are holding farmers hostage.  We are not.  This is 
absolute rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we and the farmers are saying is that their crops are very 
important.  Grain must be shipped but so should the other crops. 
This is crucially important for our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot carry on. It is quite interesting, as my colleague 
across the way indicated, that grain is crucially important for 
the economy.  Grain is crucially important for Canada's 
international commitments.   I agree 100% that it is crucial but 
why are they speaking about only one aspect? There are all the 
other aspects which make up the whole picture. Members across can 
pick up on things that suit them and present their arguments. 
This does not give the whole picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think it is critically important for the nation and need 
to address it in a bill then let us address the whole issue, let 
us address the whole picture.   All farmers are equally 
important.  They have international commitments.  They have 
international obligations to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the grain farmers and we think the intent of that 
small portion is fine but we are asking that they all be included 
to give a whole picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that in supporting these amendments I am not going 
against the wishes of workers.  I am not being anti-worker.  All 
I am saying is let us look at the whole picture.  Both workers 
and management have an equal role to play and both are partners. 
Therefore this should not be viewed as anti-worker legislation 
but something to make the whole picture.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA LABOUR CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK54">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-19, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motions Nos. 18, 20, 22 and 23. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to address issues relating to Bill 
C-19 and the Canada Labour Code. I want to bring to the attention 
of the House my concerns both as to what the government has 
failed to include in the bill as well as the problems with 
proposed amendments to the labour code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first address an incident where the Canada Labour Code 
failed to protect the health and safety of a federal government 
employee and ought to be strengthened.  While the focus of Bill 
C-19 is on collective bargaining, the labour code itself deals 
with the health and safety of federal government employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to expect their government to be a model 
employer that takes great care to see that its employees are not 
unnecessarily put in life threatening situations.  Yet the facts 
suggest that the government has often been careless with the 
lives of its employees.  The labour code is the first line of 
defence of an employee of the federal government yet it often 
fails them. Let me give a specific example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dean Miller was a fisheries officer in Prince Rupert.  He was 
required to take white water survival training in the Kitimat 
River on September 18, 1996. Dean died of a heart attack that 
day.  He was forced to take a course that he probably did not 
need and definitely should not have been asked to participate in. 
Dean was a supervisor who worked in an office in Prince Rupert. 
There was no obvious reason for him to be ordered to take a 
rigorous white water survival course; his job never required it. 
Dean had a pacemaker and a serious heart condition.  He never 
should have been forced to take such a course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law requires that federal employees taking rigorous and 
demanding survival courses first be approved as medically fit by 
the Department of Health.  Dean was never approved as medically 
fit by the regional medical officer of the Department of Health. 
More than likely if such a medical test had been done, Dean would 
have been excluded from that course.  Perhaps he would have been 
alive today.  He certainly would not have died in the Kitimat 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minimal requirements of the labour code were never enforced. 
Dean had not neglected his health or his wife and family.  He had 
a check-up only months before his death.  The medical report from 
that check-up stated:  “His fatigue has continued.  In fact over 
the last four to five years it may be worse.  He finds that when 
he exercises he gets tired with some breathlessness”. 
Nevertheless Dean took the course because he believed it would 
protect his job and thus his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Dean's death the department of human resources stepped in 
and shut down the mandatory white water survival course under 
authority of section 145 of part II of the code.  A directive was 
issued to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans that stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1996 the undersigned safety officer conducted an 
investigation into the fatality of Dean Miller on the Kitimat 
River, a workplace operated by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans—being an employer subject to the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The said safety officer considers that a condition exists that 
constitutes a danger to an employee while at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees are participating in a swift water rescue—course 
without a risk evaluation having been conducted or physical 
fitness ability (medical condition) of employees having been 
conducted contrary to section 124 [of the code]. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now clear that DFO had been failing to follow the 
requirements of the Canada Labour Code for years.  No real action 
has been taken against those who required Dean Miller to take 
this rigorous survival course even though he had a pacemaker and 
a serious heart condition.  Dean died while on the mandatory 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully a safety officer acting under the Canada Labour Code 
shut down the program, but only after Dean died.  No action was 
ever taken against the DFO officials who ordered Dean to take the 
safety course.  The only person who has suffered was the DFO 
safety officer.  He was concerned by the lax attitude to employee 
safety in his own department.  He was forced out of the 
department for speaking out on the death of Dean Miller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought Dean's death to the attention of the minister of human 
resources on April 25, 1997.  I asked that a review of the 
procedures be undertaken that required a fisheries officer with a 
very serious pre-existing medical condition to take a white water 
survival course and for a copy of such a review when it was 
completed.  I have never received a satisfactory reply.  I ask 
again today for a reply from the minister on the death of Dean 
Miller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the amendments to the code contained in Bill 
C-19.  Section 87.7 has been of concern to employers in British 
Columbia.  It is said that section 87.7 has a laudable objective: 
to keep prairie grain moving to the markets.  I think we all 
agree with that point.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect the real intention of the bill though is to make life 
easier for the Minister of Labour and his staff.  They claim it 
is too much bother to deal with disputes that tie up the shipment 
of grain.  If the shipment of grain is too difficult for the 
minister, then let him step aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. industry believes that section 87.7 is a mistake.  It 
points out that Mr. Justice Estey has been asked to report to the 
government on grain transportation and handling.  It suggests 
that it is premature to take this action prior to the Estey 
commission even having completed its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry in my province believes that section 87.7 may lengthen 
labour disputes.  It believes that striking employees may have 
less incentive to bargain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. economy depends on trade.  Forest products and coal are 
no less important to the B.C. economy than grain is to the 
prairies.  If this provision has the effect of prolonging 
industrial disputes in British Columbia, then it is a mistake. If 
it makes our ports less competitive with their American 
counterparts, it is a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ports in Delta—South Richmond, the Delta port at 
Roberts Bank and the Fraser port facility.  I have yet to hear 
from any user of either that section 87.7 will advance the ports 
in Delta—South Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that the grain provision is counterproductive 
and fundamentally at cross purposes with the government's widely 
supported efforts on the international trade file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unreasonable and unacceptable that prairie grain shipments 
will have access to British Columbia ports during a strike, while 
B.C. based exports will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry leaders have outlined a number of negative consequences 
and equity considerations raised by section 87.7.  They point out 
that commodity producers in the forestry, mining, petrochemical, 
energy and manufacturing industries will not be able to export or 
import goods through a B.C. port affected by a strike, yet grain 
exports would continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing grain exports to continue during a strike will likely 
prolong and not shorten work stoppages as employees providing 
services to grain vessels will have less incentive to settle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is considerable potential for transportation handling 
business usually undertaken by Canadian ports and railways to be 
lost as firms re-route their products and services through the 
U.S. Many commodities currently handled at west coast port 
facilities can be transferred to facilities in Seattle or Tacoma, 
Washington, or Portland, Oregon.  Once business is lost, 
experience shows it is hard to get it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have yet to hear any business or spokesman for port employees 
in my province requesting this provision or speaking convincingly 
in support of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 27 the British Columbia Employers Association asked the 
Minister of Labour for relief from section 87.7.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that—the discriminatory grain provisions 
unnecessarily threaten Canada's economy by jeopardizing Canada's 
reputation as a reliable importer and exporter of commodities to 
world markets.  The impact on the western economy will be 
devastating. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Business Council of British Columbia has also asked the 
Minister of Labour for relief.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know from your consultation with western stakeholders as 
well as from numerous presentations made by western industries 
and associations to the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, the special grain provisions contained in section 
87.7—pose a serious threat to the competitiveness of west coast 
ports and the economy of western Canada as a whole—non-grain 
commodities represent up to 87% of the total dollar value of the 
cargo moved through the port of Vancouver alone—these 
commodities may remain stagnant in the event of an extended 
strike indirectly subsidized by the mandatory movement of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the tenuous position of the current western economy as a 
result of the drop in world oil prices and the Asia crisis, such 
a threat to future economic stability could not come at a worse 
time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weyerhaeuser Canada, a Vancouver based company, believes section 
87.7 needlessly threatens the forestry sector and potentially the 
communities of western Canada that depend on exports and imports 
through the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as a member of this House from British Columbia 
and having two major ports in my riding, I feel it is important 
that these matters and concerns be brought to the attention of 
this House and that the government take note.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the Group No. 6 amendments to 
Bill C-19.  From the debate we have heard it appears that 
whenever one challenges the established order, one runs the risk 
of being called names.  Symbolically what has transpired is that 
other parties in the House have been calling Reform names on this 
issue which is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty per cent of British Columbia's gross domestic product 
comes from exports.  The real question here is how to optimize 
society's benefits and at the same time create an enlightened 
framework for labour-management negotiations in those areas of 
federal jurisdiction.  Just so people do not get confused on this 
issue, we are talking about a small portion of Canada's workforce 
which is associated with federal areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a special place in my export file for forest products.  I 
do that because the products from our forests are Canada's 
largest net export.  This is something which is overlooked by 
virtually every walk of life in this country, particularly by 
politicians and our own bureaucracy.  They are not our highest 
value export but we import almost no forest products.  Having 
spent 20 years working in this business prior to my coming to the 
House of Commons, I know this has always been a bone of 
contention.  It is overlooked.  In any national strategy it is 
important to look at the net impacts of many of our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The automotive trade represents 26% of our exports which is 
wonderful and marvellous and does a lot of great things, but we 
have a lot of automotive imports as well.  It is a very different 
issue and a different strategy should apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this set of amendments Reform is saying that we need to 
extend protection to all commodities. We cannot selectively 
experiment with protecting one group or commodity.  To do so puts 
us in a perilous position.  It also distorts the collective 
bargaining process.  It tends to distort everything.  Other 
members of my caucus have talked about the employer groups, the 
producer groups, the manufacturer groups, the exporters, all west 
coast based and all very concerned that anything other than equal 
treatment for commodities will lead to all kinds of difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view any treatment other than equal treatment for all 
commodities will lead to a need for constant government 
supervision, constant government intrusion and discriminatory 
treatment which will lead us who knows where.  We will be 
monkeying with this legislation forever. We will be monkeying 
with the whole collective bargaining process.  This is not good 
news at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our backgrounders describes this as an uncontrolled 
experiment being conducted by the federal government. There is an 
ongoing commission to review grain handling and the 
transportation system.  It is reviewing that whole business in 
terms of labour relations.  It is the Estey commission. That 
commission will not report until the end of this year.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime none of the legislation is based on anything 
substantive or concrete.  It simply is not fact based.  To 
justify it on the basis that it is temporary when it is so 
arbitrarily discriminatory and targeted makes no logical sense. 
The only conclusion that one can come to is that there must 
either be some special interest at work or some collective 
feeling that somehow this will make someone's life easier in this 
jurisdiction.  Surely those are the wrong reasons to be doing 
what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been a suggestion that by somehow selectively 
targeting provisions in the act to only apply to grain will 
prevent labour disputes from escalating because grain can no 
longer be used as the commodity that will be at risk.  That is 
also illogical.  The same argument could be used for all other 
excluded commodities.  As we know forest products represent by 
far the largest dollar value commodity moved through Canadian 
west coast ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can identify no one who actually wants the legislation other 
than the people who created it and they are rather anonymous.  We 
also know there is a split in cabinet over it.  Once again we 
have the spectre of the west coast being burdened with a piece of 
legislation to its detriment by a non-west coast based group. 
This certainly does nothing to pull the country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also seem to have a non-recognition of the marketplace 
serviced by the port of Vancouver.  For example, the Asian market 
is the marketplace in the world that places the highest premium 
on predictability and timely delivery.  That is a crucial 
consideration.  The bill must address that issue and it must 
address it on a very even handed basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to softwood lumber.  We have a circumstance 
where the government's posture on the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber 
agreement is that the agreement gives greater predictability for 
Canadian exporters that are planning to ship softwood lumber to 
the United States.  There are thousands of British Columbians out 
of work because of that softwood lumber agreement.  It is one 
more example of how the west coast cannot seem to permeate the 
bureaucracy that creates west coast based legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
official opposition is trying to do in the House what it failed 
to do in the committee, that is actually to take a constructive 
part in the debate other than the filibuster we witnessed the 
other week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make clear what it is trying to do.  It is nothing less 
than to remove strike and lockout rights from employees and 
employers subject to the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 18 and 20 would add hardship to the national 
economy as a criterion for maintenance of service requirements 
while Motions Nos. 22 and 23 would prohibit all strikes and 
lockouts in the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition have stated that they support 
collective bargaining and the right of workers to what they call 
strike peacefully.  What does strike peacefully mean?  For most 
it means a work stoppage free of violence, but for the official 
opposition it would appear to mean that a work stoppage has no 
economic impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complete contradiction. The entire purpose of a strike 
or lockout is to impose economic sanctions in order to convince 
the other party to agree to terms and conditions of a collective 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In democratic countries such as ours the right of workers to 
organize and begin collective bargaining is a fundamental right. 
This right is recognized in the international bill of human 
rights and in International Labour Organization conventions to 
which Canada is a signatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In democratic countries the right to strike or lockout by 
private sector parties is limited only to the extent necessary to 
protect public health and safety.  That is exactly what Bill C-19 
proposes.  There is no precedent in Canada to my knowledge for 
removing the strike and lockout rights from private sector 
parties for economic reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federally regulated employers and unions that negotiate under 
the Canada Labour Code specifically told the Sims task force—and 
I know the opposition remembers the Sims task force because we 
talked about it ad infinitum during the discussions—that they 
did not want their lockout and strike provisions removed.  They 
did not want their disputes subject to binding third party 
determinations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federally regulated employers, transportation and 
communications, FETCO, which represents most major employers 
subject to the code said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want statutory authority to be given to the government 
to impose arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, or 
unilaterally determine some of the provisions of the collective 
agreement itself. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties subject to the code agree that the appropriate 
criteria for maintenance of service requirements is protection of 
public health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point the Business Council of British Columbia told the 
task force: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of a provision within the Canada Labour Code for 
designating “essential services” should be confined to matters 
deemed to be essential to the protection and maintenance of 
“public safety and health”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims task force did not recommend the removal of strike and 
lockout rights from any group of employees or any employer 
subject to the code.  The vast majority of parties subject to the 
code do not support the removal of strike and lockout rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House not to support these amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that every time I get up to speak to 
important bills it is just before question period.  We know that 
once again my presentation will undoubtedly be interrupted by 
that frivolous use of an hour of House time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise today to speak once again to Bill C-19, 
the labour legislation that is before the House, and specifically 
to the Group No. 6 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 18 and 20 by the official opposition deal with the 
fact that we are concerned the only provisions for preventing 
rail or shipping disruptions at the Vancouver port deal 
specifically with grain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder why as the agriculture critic of the official 
opposition and a grain farmer for close to 20 years in the real 
world I would be speaking to expand it and why I would not be 
speaking in favour of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do favour the fact that it is a small step in the right 
direction to have a process in place to ensure that the grain 
continues to flow through the ports, to meet our international 
commitments and to ultimately reach our foreign customers, the 
fact remains that it is specific to one commodity.  I do not 
think even farmers would feel that is fair.  There are many 
agricultural commodities other than grain that we ship abroad and 
on which we have important commitments to our foreign customers. 
It is very important that those commodities reach our customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can readily see that while a lot of farmers including many 
in my riding, I am sure, support the particular clause in the 
legislation they are concerned with fairness and equity. They 
wonder why they are singled out.  There has certainly been a 
history of rail and shipping disruptions at the ports that have 
cost the country and specifically farmers very dearly in the 
past.  It has cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
demurrage charges as ships sit waiting to be loaded.  That is 
ultimately reflected in the final payment that farmers receive 
from the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young farmer trying to eke out an existence in the Peace 
River country I too from time to time was very angry when I would 
view the ships waiting in the harbour for days and weeks.  I knew 
the mounting demurrage charges.  I wanted to jump in my pick-up 
truck, tear off the 1,000 miles south to Vancouver and load the 
ships myself.  I know many other young and older farmers felt the 
same way.  They would have liked to have just gone down and 
loaded the bloody grain themselves rather than see it sitting on 
the wharf and not being shipped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is up so I will continue after question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member still has about six and half 
minutes and will be recognized right after question period.

mandating Canadian content.  This drives a high demand for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to commend the many beef cattle 
farmers and ranchers in every province of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend them for supplying a safe, healthy, nutritious, 
convenient product at a very affordable price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend them for the large positive impact they have on the 
Canadian economy.  Over 54% of Canadian beef production is 
exported to countries around the world, earning cash to be used 
to create a better Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend them for the thousands of direct and indirect jobs 
they create for Canadians in rural and urban areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend them for their excellent stewardship of the land they 
use.  Cattle ranchers were saving endangered species through 
habitat preservation and improvement long before it became the in 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the men, women and children who operate as a family 
unit in one of the most healthy, wonderful lifestyles known to 
mankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would simply ask you and millions of other 
Canadians at your next beef barbeque to stop for a moment and 
give thanks to these farmers and ranchers.  They truly are real 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent discussions with a constituent I became intrigued with 
the idea of establishing a centralized resource centre for

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity for our government to enter the 21st 
century as innovators in trade by providing one stop shopping for 
importers and exporters alike to attend information seminars 
tailor made to their needs, to have information material at their 
fingertips and knowledgeable personnel a simple phone call away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we continue to march into the shrinking world of a global 
economy it is apparent that such a resource centre would be a 
much needed facility not only for our traders but also for those 
who wish to trade with us.

Fort Erie to become the highest volume port in the country.

Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian players are very competitive, yet when it comes to 
competing sports teams the Americans tilt the playing field and

subsidies provide unfair advantages to professional sport teams 
based in the U.S. and it is time for us to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian professional sporting teams have been harmed by unfair 
American subsidy policies which have reduced the operating costs 
of United States teams.  The NAFTA establishes clear rules to 
prohibit these unfair practices.  The Canadian government should 
initiate a dispute with the American government under chapter 20 
of the NAFTA and seek compensation for the unfair U.S. policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, in response to the devastating statistics on poverty 
released by the National Council of Welfare, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development could find nothing better to say 
than this, and I quote “Canada no longer has a deficit, so poor 
families are richer”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

is being very selective in his reading of the press clippings 
prepared for him, because I said many other things about child 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I said that it was a priority of our government, 
and that we had earmarked $1.7 billion for the new national 
child benefit, a partnership with the provinces for improved 
programs and services.

will go on with the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that he is the one who is making 
poverty worse by slashing EI, by being complacent, by allowing 
the surplus in the EI fund to climb to scandalous heights, 
despite the crying needs of the public?  Does he realize that 
the reason there are poor children is perhaps because there are 
poor parents? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, putting the economy back on 
track means taking decisions that are sometimes difficult.  But 
we were also bold enough to propose EI reforms, which have also 
had a favourable impact in a great many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we have amended EI to include a family income 
supplement for low income claimants with children.  Claimants 
receiving the family income supplement are exempt from the 
intensity rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  I am sure many 
Canadians were glad to see that the Canadian government deplored 
the detonation of nuclear bombs for testing in India yesterday. 
Many Canadians also deplore the way Canada contributes to the 
nuclear arms race through the export of nuclear reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government prepared in this context to reconsider its 
commitment to the export of nuclear reactors, in particular those 
being considered for Turkey in the near future? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are not pursuing a nuclear program aimed at helping 
any country develop nuclear arms.  More important, Canada has 
decided to recall its high commissioner to India for consultation 
in protest against the nuclear testing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this kind of action would have more credibility if we 
were not committed to exporting the technology to make bombs.  I 
ask the minister whether he would give more credibility to the 
Canadian position by finally showing some leadership within the 
context of Canada's membership in NATO and questioning the 
nuclear doctrine of NATO which holds that some countries should 
continue to have nuclear weapons forever.  When will he seek the 
abolition of all nuclear weapons no matter what country has them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has not provided any nuclear information to India 
since the early 1970s, so there could not possibly be a link 
between the unacceptable tests recently carried out by India and 
what Canada has been doing.  With respect to the hon. member's

the government bowed to U.S. pressure and agreed to lower our 
sugar quotas into the U.S. from 35,000 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes. 
After pressure from the sugar industry and the all-party sugar 
caucus we got it back up to 10,000 tonnes but the U.S. can ship 
100,000 tonnes into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this agreement Lantic Sugar in Saint John, New 
Brunswick announced that it will be closing.  This will put 240 
more people out of work.  What does the Prime Minister have to 
say to those 240 people, and their families, who will be out of

Canadians for its own convenience?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for

closing of an industry. 
I also should point out that Canada has taken steps in recent 
years to make sure that there is a viable industry in this 
country. I am sure my hon. friend will understand the terms of 
the re-export program and the fact that Canada would lose sugar 
producing industries to a greater extent if we did not have it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, Ontario released the results of its public 
consultation exercise on the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A poll conducted as part of this consultation shows that 87% of

including Quebec, even though the Bloc would have us believe 
just the opposite.

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my point of order arises out of something that was raised in 
question period but which I think should more properly be raised 
under a point of order.  The government has asked the RCMP to 
launch an investigation into the supposed leaks of the 
government's policy on the TAGS program, thus intimidating the 
media and public servants while at the same time and on the same 
day as this announcement is made we see the details of the 
government's response to the Standing Committee on Justice with 
respect to the YOA all over the newspapers this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are sort of two points of order, Mr. Speaker, but I hope 
you will hear them both at once.  There is the point of order 
having to do with the fact that the government is very concerned 
and sanctimonious when other people leak information and yet 
there is good reason to believe, although the minister denies it, 
that the government does from time to time deliberately leak 
details of responses or proposals that it is going to make the 
following day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other point of order which deals with the same thing is that 
if the minister is making a response to a committee report it 
should be done either in the House or in committee and not in the 
context of a media announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these things have to do with respect for the House of 
Commons and the fact that the business of the House of Commons 
should be conducted in the House of Commons.  We want to see— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The point of order the member brings up is 
surely an opinion which rightly takes place in debate. 
With regard to the leaks, from what I heard today there are two 
investigations going on.  I rule at this time that this is not a 
point of order.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA LABOUR CODE

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-19, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motions Nos. 18, 20, 22 and 23. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before question period I was speaking from a farmer's 
perspective to Motions Nos. 18, 20, 22 and 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was trying to speak from a farmer's perspective, having farmed 
for close to 20 years in the British Columbia Peace River region, 
growing grain, grass seed and oilseed.  I was remarking on how 
angry farmers become when they see the shipments of grain which 
are supposed to be freely flowing through the ports on to ships 
for shipment to our foreign markets, our overseas customers, 
delayed and held up in some cases for extended periods of time 
and the resultant cost that ultimately the farmers and the 
country pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from quite a number of farmers who grow these 
crops, the six standard grains, wheat, barley, oats, rye, flax 
and canola which I am assuming are included under this definition 
of exclusion from any possible strike action at the ports.  They 
are quite concerned because they want to see this bill proceed so 
that they do receive that protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result is that we are going to be enshrining inequity 
and unfairness with the passage of Bill C-19 as it is presently 
written. That is why the official opposition has put forward 
Motions Nos. 22 and 23.  It is to drop the inclusion pertaining 
simply to the standard grain crops.  We feel that it 
discriminates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard the answer from the government benches on 
whether specialty crops would be included under this protection. 
A lot of farmers are growing so-called specialty crops.  Lentils, 
peas, fava beans, sunflower, safflower, these types of crops are 
being grown on increasing acreage across the land.  In particular 
I am speaking about western Canada.  I wonder if they are 
protected under this same clause.  I do not think so.  I think 
this clause simply pertains to the standard grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we expand these markets for these specialty crops the bill is 
going to discriminate against some producers and thereby pit 
farmer against farmer when there are strikes or lockouts at the 
ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 18 and 20 put forward by Reform have been open to 
attack, in particular from members of the fourth party, the NDP, 
saying they are unfair because they pertain to expansion of this 
restriction of strikes to protect the national economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if it can be shown that a strike or lockout has 
a profound impact on the national economy, it would not be 
allowed.  Because of that, members of the NDP have suggested that 
we are being unfair to the unions and that no strikes would be 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to their arguments, we cannot consider Motions Nos. 
18, 20, 22 and 23 in isolation.  We must consider them in tandem 
with the Group No. 8 motions, which have not yet been debated. 
These deal with Reform's proposal for final offer selection 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make my point I refer to <I>Hansard</I> and quote the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre on February 10, 1998: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Manitoba where I am from we actually had 
final offer selection legislation for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actual fact is in Manitoba FOS was used very sparingly.  In 
fact, the Manitoba labour relations board received only 97 
applications in all the time that it was legislation in that 
province.  Of those 97 applications only 7 were ever ruled on by 
an FOS selector or arbitrator.  Four went to the union package 
and three were in favour of the company in those rulings.  In the 
vast majority of cases, 72 in all, the application was withdrawn 
because the parties returned to the bargaining table and found a 
satisfactory resolution by more convention means. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that by his very admission, the hon. 
member from the New Democratic Party is saying that final offer 
selection works.  In 72 of those cases the parties returned to 
the bargaining table and ultimately reached a satisfactory 
resolution to their dispute.  The process worked.  I add that as 
further confirmation that the Reform amendments to this 
legislation deserve serious consideration by all parties.  When 
it comes time to vote on these motions, I urge all members to 
consider that and vote accordingly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-19, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motions Nos. 18, 20, 22 and 23. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to take part in this debate today on report stage of Bill 
C-19, specifically Group No. 6 amendments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT55"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT55"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I am not happy about the way this is proceeding. 
In the last five years since I have been involved we have seen 
all too much of this in the House of Commons, that is, the use of 
closure to shut down debate on very important issues. It is very 
ironic. The Liberal government across the way was very critical 
of the Mulroney government for the use of closure and time 
allocation when the Liberals sat in opposition, but this is the 
40th occasion where it has been used in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a misuse of power by the government to use it in this 
manner.  There is a very important principle involved, which is 
that all members should have the right to debate these important 
issues.  This is the first opportunity I have had for a 10 minute 
debate on Bill C-19, the changes to Canada's labour code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area I would like to discuss stems from my role as critic 
for international trade.  It deals with the Vancouver terminals, 
specifically section 87.7 under Motions Nos. 22 and 23 being 
proposed by my Reform colleague, the member for Wetaskiwin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that if the principle of allowing movement of 
grain for 72 hours after a strike or lockout notice has been 
given is such a good principle, why it is not applied to all 
commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as Wednesday last week, I had a meeting with the 
hon. Pat Nelson, the minister of economic development for the 
province of Alberta.  She wanted me to bring the point to the 
floor of the House of Commons that it is very important to ensure 
we have good movement of our commodities through the terminals, 
through the port facilities, so we can continue to have good 
service and enjoy a good reputation worldwide. I am concerned 
that our reputation for delivery is not as good as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important also to note that Canada had the most time lost 
to labour-management strikes and lockouts of any industrial 
country except for Italy in the last 10 years. It is a deplorable 
state for a big country like Canada which relies on exports, on 
international trade to supply the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that the member from Regina, the former minister of 
agriculture, accompanied a group to Japan a year ago.  They were 
trying to reassure the Japanese of Canada's ability to deliver in 
a timely manner products through our ports both in Vancouver and 
in Prince Rupert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern has to do with grain itself.  The Minister of Labour 
and others in the government are trying to win support from grain 
farmers across Canada by saying that if something happens and 
there is a strike or lockout at the Vancouver port, they will 
continue to load grain into an ocean-going vessel for 72 hours. 
This is true. However, it does not deal with any of the problems 
originating from the farm gate to the terminal.  It does not deal 
with any problems in the railway system.  There are something 
like 20 different labour-management units along the way that can 
disrupt the flow of grain during that time. It does not deal with 
things that my colleague from Prince George—Peace River, the 
critic for agriculture talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it says grains, the grains identified do not include 
alfalfa pellets. In my riding of Peace River, we have the world's 
biggest alfalfa pelletizing plant, Falher Alfalfa.  It is very 
concerned that this section does not deal with Neptune terminals. 
It does not deal with Vancouver wharf. There is a $25 million 
operation that can be shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this principle is the sound principle the government is 
putting forward, why would it not extend it to things like 
specialty crops, like alfalfa, peas, lentils and all the other 
grains? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real problem here and we have an opportunity to 
correct that problem.  My colleague from Wetaskiwin has said that 
this is the first time the Canada Labour Act has been opened up 
in 25 years and it probably will not be opened up again for some 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for this opportunity to make substantial changes 
now when the debate is happening.  We encourage members in the 
Liberal government to listen to some of the reasoned amendments 
we are putting forward with a view to trying to improve Canada's 
delivery out of our port system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of other products are being handled in Vancouver.  In 
Prince Rupert there is coal.  We have sulphur. One of my 
colleagues has already mentioned that lumber is one of our 
biggest ones.  Chemical potash and various other products are 
being exported worldwide. This legislation does not deal with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party thinks a more reasoned approach to this would be to go 
to final offer arbitration.  What it does is it allows for the 
parties to negotiate for some time before the labour-management 
contract is finished.  I would think negotiations should start if 
it is a three year contract a year ahead to see if they can come 
to some kind of an agreement.  If they cannot, having a strike or 
lockout and withdrawing services has the effect of shutting down 
the terminal and in some cases shutting down the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a grain farmer myself in the Peace River country I know the 
devastating effects of having some 20 ships sitting in English 
Bay harbour at Vancouver and paying demurrage of about $60,000 a 
day for each ship.  It is a very big bill, millions of dollars. 
Last year it was approximately $60 million that grain farmers had 
to pay because of the ships that were waiting for product because 
there was a strike lockout situation at the Vancouver terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to correct that.  Canada has a reputation that has to be 
enhanced otherwise we are going to be bypassed. Products will be 
bought from the United States. I suggest we look at final offer 
arbitration as one way of resolving this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer arbitration needs to be explained a little. In a 
labour-management contract quite often when the contract is being 
negotiated the two parties will start a long way apart. If a 
labour union wants a 5% increase quite often it will ask for 7% 
or 8% knowing it will probably be negotiated down and it will be 
settled somewhere in the range of 5%.  On the other hand the 
company quite often starts at a position recognizing that it is 
going to be a 5% settlement and starts negotiating at 3%. This 
goes on for months and months before they finally come to some 
kind of a settlement.  Often there is time lost in that 
bargaining unit where labour is withdrawn or there is a lockout. 
This has a very devastating effect on the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer arbitration is a reasonable way to approach this. 
Approximately one month prior to the contract expiring if a 
settlement had not been reached by negotiations, each party would 
have to submit a reasonable final offer.  I suggest reasonable. 
They would not have to submit a reasonable one but an independent 
third party looking at it would choose the more reasonable of the 
two.  It would be in their best interests to submit a reasonable 
final offer.  The arbitrator would decide which one looks more 
reasonable than the other and would choose that one and the 
parties would have to live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that did not happen, if one party put in a very 
unreasonable final offer and the other party did not, we know 
what would happen.  The effect of that would be to have the two 
parties put in a reasonable offer at the start. It would prevent 
a lot of the problems we have in the labour-management area. 
Canada could enhance its reputation as being a reliable supplier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we miss this opportunity I think we are missing an 
opportunity that is going to cost future jobs.  Canada relies on 
our exports for about one-third of our gross domestic product. 
That means 40% of the jobs of every Canadian family, every 
community rely on our ability to export.  We know that some of 
our exports go through the United States but some go through our 
port cities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opportunity we want to seize. The government should 
look at these as reasonable amendments and adopt them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today in the House and speak on Bill C-19 
and the amendments that have been put forward at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of us will remember the eminent Canadian poet Robert 
Service who talked about strange things being done in the 
midnight sun in the Yukon.  There have been some strange things 
done here in the midday sun in this House today.  I have heard 
some.  I have seen some.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all the government is putting time allocation on 
another bill that is before the House.  The government when it 
was in opposition so quickly condemned the Conservatives for 
doing the very same thing and it continues to do this time after 
time.  That concerns me very much, the limit on our free speech 
and on the democratic process in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians should be concerned about the way the government 
is using time allocation to shut down democracy in the House. 
This is the parliament of all Canadians.  We come here to 
represent them.  If we do not have an opportunity to voice the 
concerns of Canadians here in this place, I ask all hon. members, 
where will Canadians have that opportunity if it is not here in 
the House through their duly elected members?  I am very 
concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very concerned when I hear NDP members taking shots at 
the Reform Party inaccurately telling the Canadian people 
untruths about us, saying that we are against fair wages.  What 
balderdash that we would be against fair wages.  That is absolute 
nonsense. I want to suggest that the NDP cannot teach the Reform 
Party anything about economic policy or fair labour practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member should go to my province of British Columbia 
to see what an NDP government has done to the economy of that 
province.  The member should see what kind of legislation it has 
tried to impose upon businesses in that province with unfair 
labour codes and see the kind of public revolt against that which 
occasioned that government to take the legislation out of the 
legislative docket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just gone through a devastating strike in my riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan at the Fletcher Challenge mill.  When we as 
Reformers say that we stand up for people who do not seem to be 
able to be heard in this country, that strike was another example 
of this very thing.  That mill produces pulp and paper which 
contributes 53% of the tax base of the municipality which it is 
in.  When its workers go on strike and labour and management 
cannot come to some kind of consensus, there are lots of third 
parties in that riding that are hurt far beyond the union members 
and far beyond the management and those who own the mill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the businesses suffer because of a strike that goes on and 
on. The small businesses lay off employees because people are no 
longer buying their goods. Car dealers have seen their sales 
plummet in January, February and March because of the strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members miss a big point in this whole debate when they 
only stand up for big unions.  Someone has to stand up for the 
little ordinary guy in this country who feels that he has no 
voice in these kinds of occurrences in our society when prolonged 
and protracted labour-management disputes paralyze other 
industries and other businesses. Something has to be done about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Motions Nos. 18 and 20, we are concerned that there 
is no provision in the bill to protect the national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about Motions Nos. 25 and 29 that prohibit the 
use of replacement workers if the CIRB determines their presence 
undermines the union. This was a slight modification from 
previous Bill C-66, but this provision still leaves too much 
control in the hands of the CIRB which may view the use of 
replacement workers as undermining the union.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision could very well stop the use of managerial staff 
from operating the company.  It restricts and infringes on the 
employer's rights.  Somewhere along the way in this national 
debate on restructuring this kind of thing employers have to be 
able to have their say in this House of Commons and the employers 
that we hear from are saying that this is unfair and it needs to 
be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It very well could shift the balance of power in labour 
management relations in favour of the unions.  The <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> on November 5, 1996 quoted Nancy Riche, the executive 
vice-president of the Canadian Labour Congress, as saying:  “I 
would go so far as to suggest that anybody who does work of a 
member of a union undermines the representative capacity of the 
union”.  She went on to say:  “None of the bureaucrats are 
going to agree with me—but we'll have to wait and see.  The new 
board will rule”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party have some real concerns about this and 
that is why we have proposed this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all hon. colleagues in this House will not close 
their minds so easily to the amendments that the Reform Party has 
put forth in this regard, that they will see all sides of the 
debate and realize that there is more to this country than big 
business, big government and big union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are little people, hard working little people, who need to 
be heard in this country and it seems that the only party that is 
willing to stand up for them today, as it did in the hepatitis C 
debate, is the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are speaking today on motions to amend Bill C-19. 
This bill provides for changes to the Canada Labour Code and the 
opposition parties have put forward a number of amendments, in 
fact eight groups of motions to amend the bill, and there are a 
few motions in each of these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are speaking to Group No. 6.  There are four motions in 
this group.  The first two motions essentially add to the grounds 
for prohibiting the cutting off of services in the event of a 
strike.  The bill provides for continuation of service in a 
strike situation if public health or safety is endangered.  The 
amendments that we have brought forward would also provide for 
continuation of service to protect the national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the comments of the member for 
the New Democratic Party on this series of amendments.  What was 
so interesting to me was that the member really did not address 
at all the substance of these amendments or argue that the 
national economy, in the short term, could not be affected, so 
therefore we do not need the amendments.  There was none of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total tone of his speech was attributing motives.  He talked 
about the deep bitterness of Reformers against workers, many of 
whom support the Reform Party, so I am not quite sure why we 
would be anything but approving of that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a labelling, an attributing of motives and a real 
agenda here.  I assure Canadians watching this debate that the 
agenda of the official opposition in putting forward amendments 
and in speaking to this bill is simply to protect Canadian 
workers and the well-being of Canadians in our labour legislation 
and in the way labour and business operate in our country. We are 
dependent on good economic results from the activities that take 
place.  That is our motive and that is what we want to do in a 
very balanced, sensible and thoughtful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the NDP and other parties to stick to the 
practical issues being raised and not to continue with their 
agenda of suspicion, conspiracy and some of the other things they 
seem to think are happening in this debate, because that is not 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no disagreement that services should be continued 
in federally regulated sectors if public health and safety could 
be endangered by services being cut off.  No one is disagreeing 
with that.  We would argue that danger to the national economy 
should also be a consideration.  Health and safety are immediate 
dangers and immediate harm could be caused by services being cut 
off.  The danger and harm to a national economy can cause every 
bit as much pain and hardship.  It can contribute every bit as 
much to the poverty of Canadian families as cutting off services 
in areas where health or safety is immediately impacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to think a little more broadly and long term when we 
give carte blanche to strikes and lockouts that impact people's 
livelihoods, their businesses, their incomes, their ability to 
pay their rent and mortgage, and their ability to put milk on the 
table for their children.  We have to think of those things.  We 
cannot just look at some immediate danger.  We have to look at 
the impact over a little longer period of time that can be 
equally devastating.  That is the intention of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a cost to Canadian families and to Canadian workers in 
particular.  Many of these workers are barely making ends meet as 
it is, thanks to the taxation policies of this government and the 
cost of living in Canada.  They depend on the viability of the 
whole local economy and a strike can be critical in impacting 
their short term and long term well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is designed to protect the national economy and 
thereby to protect regular Canadians with their day to day bills, 
their day to day need for income and their day to day need to 
make sales in their little businesses in the towns where they 
work.  We need to think about these things.  We need to protect 
the Canadians of this country.  If services are cut off in an 
area due to a strike or a lockout, and if it happens federally 
across the country, the industrial relations board needs some 
ability to determine what is going to be the impact on the 
national economy and thereby on the families and workers of 
Canada and those who are dependent on economic activity for their 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very sensible amendment that looks at the bigger 
picture.  It tries to protect people from some of the so-called 
unintended consequences of labour unrest and labour shutdown.  We 
need to look in a very balanced and logical way at whether this 
ought to be done.  We should not close our minds and shoot the 
messenger, we should deal with the message and its merits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all members to think about what is best for 
Canadians.  That is why we are here.  That is why we get the big 
money.  That is why we get the airtime.  We need to be very 
focused on what is best and look at the proposals on their 
merits.  I think this proposal has a great deal of merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also, of course, as a number of my colleagues have said, urge 
that other commodities be protected from disruptions in shipping 
besides just grain.  There are farmers who have interests in 
different commodities.  We know that some of the wheat pools 
support this legislation because grain is protected.  But again 
we have to think more broadly, not just in a narrow sense.  There 
are some very clear concerns about unintended consequences if 
only grain is protected from disruptions in shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people who work in the sector say that labour unrest 
and disputes will be extended and enhanced if only grain can be 
shipped because, in a sense, that commodity will be used to 
subsidize strike activities that hold up other commodities.  Some 
income would come in from that one narrow sector, but the other 
sectors will still be disrupted and there will be less incentive 
to settle those disputes because they are not as harmful to the 
participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments are designed to look at the big picture, to look 
at other products that need to be shipped, such as coal, lumber, 
chemicals, potash and other commodities.  I would ask that my 
hon. colleagues in this House look at these proposals on their 
merits.  I believe then they will be soundly supported. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is truly 
a privilege to be able to speak to the motions in Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the opportunity to talk about Bill C-19 a number of 
times in the House.  I have to start off by saying that it is 
despicable when the government uses closure on a bill like this. 
This bill will affect every single farmer in western Canada.  It 
will affect anybody, basically, who has anything to do with the 
movement of products across this country.  The government owes the 
Canadian people the opportunity for us to debate this openly and 
talk about this issue as it will affect all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sort of thing that this government persists in doing is 
despicable.  It is disgraceful.  It is anti-democratic.  It has 
used closure more than any other government in the history of 
this country.  Canadians are watching and are going to demand 
some accountability for this sort of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key thing about this amendment and the key thing about this 
bill is the protection of the economy of Canada.  That has to be 
number one.  We are talking about jobs and the standard of living 
that we have grown used to as Canadians, and we are falling 
behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to travel to many parts of the world 
and I have started to realize more and more what is happening to 
us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help thinking about last Friday when I was going to the 
airport.  The cab driver said to me “The Ottawa Senators are not 
going to lose another game.  They are way better than the 
Capitals and they will beat them hands down”.  That is a little 
bit like we sometimes hear the Prime Minister talk about Canada. 
The United Nations says we are number one; therefore, we do not 
have to work harder.  That is wrong.  We have to continue to 
work.  The world around us is becoming more competitive and we 
must be conscious of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In travelling recently to China, seeing the changes that have 
occurred there and having the opportunity to talk to some of our 
shippers and some of our businessmen, I asked:  “What do you 
think of Canada looking from here back there?”  The message that 
I got was “We don't deal with Canada as much as we used to”. 
They do not feel that there are the same opportunities, that 
there is the same aggressive tendencies to try to sell them 
something, particularly when it gets to things such as wheat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a brewer who is responsible for buying malt barley 
for 150 breweries.  He said he does not go to Canada any more for 
supplies.  He does not go to the Canadian Wheat Board because he 
is not sure about whether delivery will come or when it will 
come.  He indicated that there seemed to be many problems with 
guaranteeing delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a Japanese shipowner who indicated a problem.  He 
books his ships on a two year basis and allows so many days for 
sailing, so many days for loading and so many days for getting to 
the port of destination.  He said he could not come to Canada 
because his ship might be sitting for 30, 40 or 50 days as a 
result of some transportation blockage or of some strikes that 
are so frequent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is hurting us as Canadians.  We can talk about 
strikes and the national economy.  However, we have to ask 
ourselves, going into the 21st century, what happens when a 
strike is called.  We know for sure union bosses keep getting the 
salaries they have been getting.  We know union members who go on 
strike do not get the salaries they have been used to getting, 
and if they are out for very long we know they never make up that 
money again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly know the economy of the country is hurt.  We 
certainly know many people, for example farmers, are hurt. Let us 
just stop for a minute and look at the farmer.  He has a lot of 
decisions to make.  He has to decide when to plant, what to 
plant, what kind of fertilizer to use, what kind of seed to use, 
and then depend on the weather.  He should not also have to 
depend on the unions to get his commodity to market and 
ultimately get paid for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people are hurt.  The whole country is hurt in terms of 
our reputation because we do not have modern labour practices 
that allow us to be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question has to be asked.  There must be a better way than 
having strikes.  There must be a better way than Bill C-19 which 
is liberal in its makeup.  It goes a little way here and a little 
way there and does not stand for very much.  No one really knows 
what it means.  It certainly does not improve either the economy 
of country, the well-being of our people or our reputation 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of resting on our laurels it is time that we examine 
different ways of handling the situation.  The motions put 
forward would help us to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak specifically to Motion Nos. 18 and 20 which the 
Reform Party has put forward.  What effect would they have on our 
national economy?  That becomes the number one issue when we 
decide what will happen.  They also talk about protection not 
only of our economy but of third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going on to Motion Nos. 22 and 23 the key issue, as the previous 
member mentioned, is that all commodities be included. It is not 
enough to only include grain.  We should be including many other 
things that move through our ports.  On the prairies there are 
all kinds of different products.  Right across the country we 
have products that depend upon transportation and upon the 
movement of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at better ways.  We need to examine them.  I do 
not think it is fair to say that any one of us is anti-union. 
That is not the message. 
The message is that we have to find some other way to deal with 
the problem of labour disputes other than strictly going on 
strike.  I hope the day will come when strikes will be a thing of 
the past.

listening.  I suppose it would argue that because of the huge 
turnout it is listening and is here to understand exactly what 
the message is.

not help the economy or the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-19, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motions Nos. 19, 25, 26, 27 and 29.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank you for 
reading Motion No. 26 in its entirety. We asked you to do so on 
a matter of principle and as a symbolic gesture.  Given the 
importance of this motion, we wanted it recorded properly in the 
<I>Debates of the House of Commons</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very proud to see that the motion is seconded by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who was responsible last 
year for the brilliant and valiant work done on the Canada 
Labour Code, when he held the position I have this year. 
Considering the situation that prevailed last year, I feel I 
must thank and congratulate him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are with Group No. 7, which substantially represents our 
position with respect to this bill, and which refers in 
particular to the clause on replacement workers. 
It is of such importance that we cannot, in all conscience, 
support this bill with the present wording of clause 42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that our audience may understand this fully, I feel it is 
worthwhile reading in its entirety the position of the 
government, backed by the NDP, and I believe by the Progressisve 
Conservative Party, while the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois are opposed to clause 42, but for diametrically 
opposed reasons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read clause 42 in its entirety. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No employer or person acting on behalf of an employer shall use, 
for the demonstrated purpose of undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives, the services of a person who was not an 
employee in the bargaining unit on the date on which notice to 
bargain collectively was given and was hired or assigned after 
that date to perform all or part of the duties of an employee in 
the bargaining unit on strike or locked out. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have noted, as my colleague, the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, did last year, the convoluted wording, 
which is of no real help to anyone.  It is a nightmare, not to 
put too fine a point on it, to get at the meaning of using for 
the demonstrated purpose of undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives. It sidesteps the issue, and this is one 
of the secondary reasons, in addition to the fact that we are 
opposed to the substance, that we are opposed to the way the 
problem is set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that Canada—compared with Quebec obviously—is 
equipping itself with the means to move forward.  I think that 
everyone is going after a careful balance.  This is worth 
pointing out, because the whole thrust of the Sims report is to 
achieve balance. 
I think the result is something that is going to balance 
everyone into a corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the reasons—and it is both secondary and essential 
at the same time—we oppose this clause and accordingly the entire 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting to note, as I did earlier, that the 
Liberal party, the government party, is in favour of the bill. 
It is understandable that the New Democratic party supports it, 
given its close ties with the union movement.  The Progressive 
Conservative party is in favour, but the Bloc Quebecois is not, 
nor is the Reform party, for diametrically opposed reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It puts me in mind of Meech Lake, and this is part of the 
Canada-Quebec problem.  The Bloc Quebecois is against the bill 
because it does not give workers enough, and the Reform party is 
against it because it gives workers too much. 
It is so strongly opposed that it wants to eliminate every term 
that prevents the hiring of scabs or replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Reform Party there is no subtlety.  It even goes into 
the details where the board is given powers to declare the 
hiring of replacement workers when done out in the open an 
unfair labour practice, whereas here, with their balanced 
approach, the Liberals are claiming that replacement workers can 
be hired in order to undermine a union's representational 
capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party goes a long way.  Should it appear that 
replacement workers are being hired to undermine the union's 
representational capacity, it wants to deny the board the right 
to declare the hiring of replacement workers unfair labour 
practice.  That's that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives are after the same thing, but more subtlely. 
Their approach is worth describing. 
The government has grown in wisdom and in thoughtfulness in the 
past year.  It has added a very important word.  Last year, the 
wording read “No employer or person acting on behalf of an 
employer shall use, thereby undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity—”, while the 1998 version reads “—for 
the demonstrated purpose of undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity—”.

Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
denouncing the fact that the government changed its position, 
rather subtly, without boasting too loudly about it, from one 
year to the next. 
In 1997, speaking of replacement workers, it read “for the 
purpose of undermining a trade union's representational 
capacity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, obviously under pressure from management, the word 
“demonstrated” was added. It now reads “for the demonstrated 
purpose of undermining a trade union's representational 
capacity”. This will make it much more difficult for the union 
to prove to the court that replacement workers were hired for 
the purpose of undermining its representational capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union will be required to prove the “demonstrated purpose of 
undermining”. The fact that replacement workers are being hired 
is not enough. Now it will have to be demonstrated that it was 
“for the demonstrated” specific and actual “purpose of 
undermining the union's representational capacity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes the union's burden of proof even heavier, which is 
likely to have a negative impact on its members' morale and 
discourage them from getting involved in this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC's approach is even worse. I do not know whether it was 
inspired by its former leader, Jean Charest, the former member 
for Sherbrooke, but if that is the case, Quebec workers are in 
for a rough ride if Charest ever becomes the premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 27 moved by the Progressive Conservative Party reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2.2) For greater certainty, an employer shall be deemed not to 
have undermined a trade union's representational capacity by 
reason only of the employer's use of the services of a person 
referred to in subsection (2.1). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are saying that it must be “for the demonstrated 
purpose”, while the Conservatives are basically saying that even 
though scabs are hired, the employer is not trying to adversely 
affect workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a big joke. They are laughing at workers. They do not 
care about their right to strike, about their demands. Both the 
Conservatives and the Reformers are trying to undermine the very 
existence of unions. This is most serious and this is why I 
cannot support the clause in its present form. One can see that 
workers' rights are in jeopardy, given that the government—with 
just one additional word—and the Conservatives—with their 
proposed amendment—are making it a lot more difficult for 
unions to adequately protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Reform Party, it does not beat around the bush. 
For all practical purposes, the right to strike is completely 
undermined. With the Reformers, the issue is not the unions' 
representational capacity, but the right to strike. Under the 
Reformers' logic, even though workers are unionized and can 
democratically decide to go on strike, any employer could 
legally, with impunity, hire replacement workers to continue 
operations, and there would be nothing wrong with that. Under 
the Reformers' plan, it would all be perfectly legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way are they saying that this is an unfair practice. Under 
the Reformers' plan, even though the right to strike exists, 
even though a strike is legal, replacement workers could be 
hired with impunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel this is unacceptable, particularly to those of us in 
Quebec who have experienced something else, which we shall get 
back to at third reading.  For the last 21 years, we have lived 
in a society where the right to strike is respected and where 
the hiring of scab labour is banned as an unfair labour 
practice.  As a result, there are fewer strikes, they are not as 
long, and most importantly, there is no violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only go as far as Quebec City to see the difference. 
Recently there was violence at the port of Quebec, which is a 
federal jurisdiction, when there was a labour conflict and scabs 
were hired.  The authorities intervened too late, unfortunately, 
to prevent the violence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I see there are several 
motions with respect to the replacement worker provision in Bill 
C-19.  One motion is seeking to delete the provision while 
another is seeking to make the provision into a general 
prohibition on their use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 implements the majority recommendation of the Sims 
task force with respect to replacement workers.  The task force 
noted that the one point concerning replacement workers on which 
both labour and management agreed was that they should not be 
used by an employer for the purpose of ridding the workplace of 
union representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force majority did not recommend a general prohibition 
on the use of replacement workers.  It did recommend that their 
demonstrated use for the purpose of undermining a union's 
representational capacity rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives should be an unfair labour practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While maintaining their underlying opposing positions on the 
replacement worker issue, representatives of both labour and 
management in the federal sector accepted this approach in the 
context of the overall package of task force recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to concerns raised during the study of former Bill 
C-66, that the wording of the provision did not capture the full 
intent of the task force recommendation, the provision in Bill 
C-19 was redrafted to include the complete wording of the task 
force recommendation.  The new wording was requested by employer 
representatives as well as by the Senate standing committee in 
its report on Bill C-66.  The added words make it clear that the 
union filing the complaint bears the burden of proof and that the 
use of replacement workers by an employer for the purpose of 
continuing operations is not prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect of the new wording of the provision, the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce told the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and the Status of with Persons with 
Disabilities that the addition of the words “rather than the 
pursuit of legitimate bargaining objectives” in proposed section 
94(2.1) will ensure that any tribunal interpreting this 
legislation will be guided by the explicit obligation to consider 
the reason why the employer may have hired strike replacements 
rather than only the protection of a union's representational 
rights, as was the case under Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the federally regulated employers transportation 
and communications group told the committee: “The language we 
see in Bill C-19 is reflective of the spirit, intent and content 
of the Sims report in most of the critical areas”. FETCO legal 
counsel stated that the drafting concern they had with former 
Bill C-66, including the replacement worker provision, had been 
addressed. In my view, given these comments, additional language 
would be redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 includes a number of other provisions recommended by 
the task force which will protect the rights of employees who 
strike or are locked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 confirms the right of striking or locked out employees 
to return to work at the end of a work stoppage in preference to 
replacements.  It gives employees dismissed or disciplined during 
a work stoppage access to grievance arbitration.  It prohibits 
the submission of an application for certification or revocation 
during work stoppages without the consent of the board.  It says 
replacement workers are not entitled to participate in 
representation votes.  It recognizes the right of employees on 
strike or who are locked out to continue to be covered by 
insurance plans provided they pay the full amount of required 
contributions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has put forward a motion to add a paragraph 
to proposed section 87(4).  This motion would prohibit the use 
of replacement workers where employees of the bargaining unit 
continue the activities necessary to prevent immediate and 
serious danger to the safety or health of the public. I submit 
this is likely to generate unnecessary litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment sees a somewhat bizarre situation in 
which an employer seeks not only to have services maintained by 
bargaining unit employees but to recruit replacements to work 
alongside of them.  Add to this unusual circumstance a trade 
union ready to negotiate the maintenance of services by its own 
members and to accept that they will be working with replacements 
doing bargaining unit work; in all, an eventuality which is, to 
say the least, very unlikely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions in Bill C-19 respecting the use of replacement 
workers represent a fair and reasonable compromise to a difficult 
issue.  I urge members of the House to support the provisions in 
Bill C-19 without amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
debating Group No. 7.  I want to talk a bit about replacement 
worker legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this legislation does not come out with an outright ban on 
the use of replacement workers, it does leave, to say the least, 
a lot of discretion up to the CIRB.  It begs probably more 
questions than it actually answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discretion of whether to use replacement workers is going to 
be left solely to the board.  In any case of the use of 
replacement workers there will be tremendous pressure put on the 
board to agree with the union that this an undermining of the 
union, which is referred to in the vernacular as union busting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is likely that, under tremendous pressure, the use of any 
replacement workers, whether managerial or otherwise, will be 
seen by the board as undermining the fundamentals of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have read quotes by several union leaders which say exactly 
that.  They say they are going to impress on the board in every 
instance where replacement workers are used that it will be 
solely to undermine the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are instances where replacement workers will 
simply be used to maintain the viability of the business.  I do 
not think there is a union in the world that would like to have 
its employer broke.  It would be basically cutting off its nose 
to spite its face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of replacement workers, we are also told by union 
bosses that this is absolutely necessary to prevent violence.  It 
seems as if we are under some kind of constant threat.  If there 
is not an outright ban on replacement workers there may be 
violence. The unions are quick to cite examples of where there 
was violence on the picket lines.  Violence is one thing but good 
labour legislation is another thing.  There are laws which state 
that violence is not acceptable and having to pass labour laws 
under the veil of possible violence is doing it for the wrong 
reasons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the debate today we heard how naive some 
members in this House thought members of the Reform Party were 
because we made allusions to protecting the national economy from 
devastating work stoppages that would have an effect on the 
national economy.  A rather weak argument was put forth that of 
course any disruption of services is going to put economic 
pressure on somebody.  Certainly.  Of course.  We understand that 
the union wants to put economic pressure on the employer in order 
for the employer to see the union's way of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently, the people who made those comments had selective 
hearing.  We were talking about actions taken by employers and 
employees, strikes or lockouts, that would have a devastating 
effect on the national economy.  A devastating effect on the 
national economy filters down very quickly to the very people my 
colleagues down the way are purporting to protect. If there is a 
work stoppage of any type that has a tremendously adverse effect 
on the economy, it is the little people who support those 
businesses and who depend on those services who are ultimately 
hurt.

set of motions in Group No. 7 is a bit of a quandary for us. 
There are two motions which the NDP caucus is in favour of and 
others that we are not.  I presume we will have the opportunity 
to vote on them individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two motions we are in favour of deal with strengthening the 
anti-scab aspects of Bill C-19.  We have spoken in favour of Bill 
C-19 in total.  We recognize its value and we recognize the long 
and exhaustive consultative process it took to get us to this 
point.  However our one criticism of Bill C-19 has always been 
and still is that the reference to anti-scab is too soft and does 
not really follow through to the degree—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was getting at and the reason I rose to speak is that 
while we are happy with the package in total, our one criticism 
of Bill C-19 is that the anti-scab aspects of the bill do not go 
far enough to really fulfill what the parties had in mind when 
they sat down to draft Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the whole package was a compromise.  Nobody 
at the table really got everything they wanted.  There was a lot 
of give and take and a lot of goodwill. Finding a balance is 
never easy, but having reviewed the motions we have before us 
from the hon. member for Trois-Rivières, I believe Motion Nos. 19 
and 26 would serve the bill well in making it the piece of 
legislation Canadian industry really needs and should be asking 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The virtues of anti-scab legislation are obvious. We have the 
case study right in the province next to us.  We can look to the 
province of Quebec and monitor the experience and the benefits 
from its long tenure of the anti-scab bill.  We know from that 
experience there are fewer days of lost time due to strikes and 
lockouts.  The parties are not likely to risk pushing a 
bargaining session to an impasse knowing that their anti-scab 
legislation would preclude the ability of using replacement 
workers.  Naturally the parties are forced to a position where 
they have to work a little harder to find a reasonable solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the incidence of picket line violence is 
lower.  I agree with the previous speaker that we should not be 
charting our course by the lighting on a passing ship.  What I 
mean to say is that we should not be crafting legislation to 
preclude violence.  Nobody is going to be drafting legislation 
under threat or some veiled threat.  That is not the case.  The 
actual fact is that both parties often allow tempers to flare and 
incidents of violence do take place on picket lines when scabs 
try to cross picket lines.  If that is precluded or eliminated, 
then there is not that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to the scene of strikes in the city of Montreal.  I 
joined my fellow brothers with the carpenters union when they 
were striking in that industry in the city of Montreal.  The 
first thing I did was I went to a major site where I knew there 
were carpenters working.  I wanted to join them on the picket 
line, not really thinking through that there was not going to be 
a picket line.  There did not need to be a picket line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Picket lines are there to keep scabs out.  Once it has been 
shown that there is a strike, a couple of placards are put up and 
the public knows there is a strike at the site and the product is 
hot as a result. There are no scabs crossing the line.  There is 
no need for workers to be walking the line keeping vehicles from 
going in and out, et cetera.  That is where things flare up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the very fact that there is solid anti-scab legislation in 
the province of Quebec minimizes the number of days lost due to 
strikes and lockouts.  It minimizes the incidents of people 
stooping to violence on either side, whether it is the 
replacement workers or frustrated employees at the location 
trying to defend their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of Bill C-19 deals with anti-scab and I believe 
it needs to be improved. The burden of proof is currently on the 
union to demonstrate that the employer is using scabs in a way 
that undermines the bargaining rights of the union, or it is the 
intent to undermine the union by the use of scabs. Regarding that 
burden of proof, contrary to what we heard from the previous 
speaker, it is going to be very difficult to get any board to 
rule as to what was in the mind of the employer when the scabs 
were hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage is clearly to the employer in the current language 
of Bill C-19 if it is not amended.  I would certainly argue that 
it does not matter what labour leaders were quoted, obviously the 
advocates for the employees are going to argue that the union is 
trying to undermine the bargaining rights and that therefore the 
scabs should be outlawed. 
I frankly do not think that they would win.  It would be a 
terrible uphill battle and a very difficult argument to win. The 
Reform Party should take some comfort in that.  The way I read 
Bill C-19 on that aspect, the advantage is clearly for the 
employer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the most sensitive parts of Bill C-19 for our 
caucus at least and for the labour movement.  The right to 
withhold services in a way that puts economic pressure on the 
employer is the only peaceful means of negotiating benefits for 
workers that is available to us.  It is really the only tool in 
our tool chest.  When bargaining breaks down and we are trying to 
elevate the standards or the wages and working conditions for the 
people we represent, passive resistance and withholding service 
are the two things we can legally use to add weight to our points 
of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, these clauses and the motions put forward by the 
member for Trois-Rivières are very important to us.  They would 
add that small bit which is lacking in Bill C-19 to make it a 
truly satisfactory package that will add lasting labour peace to 
the Canadian industrial relations environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of strikes and lockouts may get more attention 
than it deserves in these debates.  It has been stated over and 
over again that over 95% of all rounds of bargaining are settled 
without any lost time.  While lost time due to strikes and 
lockouts is a problem in the industry, it is dealt with in a way 
that is out of proportion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba we lose approximately 50,000 person days per year 
due to strikes and lockouts which is a big problem.  Management 
howls about lost productivity and lost profits, et cetera.  It is 
a problem.  However we lose 550,000 person days per year due to 
injuries on the job and workplace accidents.  If they are serious 
about lost productivity, the answer is to clean up the workplace, 
to stop the carnage in the workplace.  Then those 50,000 person 
days lost per year will be put into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect deals with picket line incidents.  One of the 
positive aspects of Bill C-19 is that employees who are off work 
for a strike or a lockout will be guaranteed their jobs when they 
go back.  Those who may have been disciplined during their 
absence will have the right to the grievance procedure and 
arbitration.  This is a case of natural justice.  They should 
have access to some avenue of recourse.  If in the heat of the 
moment an incident happens, this provision in Bill C-19 will 
recognize that everybody deserves the right to the use of that 
avenue of recourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus will be voting in favour of Motions Nos. 19 and 26. 
We believe they are necessary and that they will add substance 
and weight to what is already a worthy piece of legislation.  In 
the interests of minimizing the lost time due to strikes and 
lockouts, I would hope the other members in the House can support 
the motions put forward by the member for Trois-Rivières.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big problems in what we are dealing with today is the 
replacement workers part of it.  This issue is one of the few on 
which the authors of the Sims report could not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of its authors argued in favour of a complete ban on the use 
of replacement workers as is the case in labour legislation in 
Quebec and British Columbia.  The majority of the Sims report 
argued against a general ban on the use of replacement workers. 
It states where the use of replacement workers is in dispute and 
is demonstrated to be for the purpose of undermining the union's 
representative capacity rather than pursuing a legitimate 
bargaining objective it should be declared an unfair labour 
practice.  There was a lot of confusion when it came to this part 
and I believe there still is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many motions are before us today and we will probably be here 
late tonight voting on them. When there are many motions on a 
piece of legislation it means there are many questions about the 
proposed legislation.  We have not dealt with this legislation in 
approximately 25 years and all of a sudden it is being put 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what is happening.  Let me take a bit of time to 
explain to our viewing audience and the people in the gallery 
what has happened today and what the government has imposed on 
this piece of legislation, on the House of Commons and on the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government is in a rush to get it out of here. It 
has invoked time allocation on the bill.  That means it has cut 
off debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in committee.  I agree; I was there.  A lot of 
consultation went on and we heard from a lot of witnesses.  We 
now have a chance to debate the legislation in front of 
Canadians.  When it comes to that the government cuts us off. It 
is unfortunate but is what happened today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government mentions consultation.  Yes, it did that but it 
certainly did not listen.  There are probably 50 amendments today 
and I do not believe very many of them will pass.  These are the 
concerns of Canadians but they do not seem to be what the 
government thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Bill C-19 there was Bill C-66 which contained provisions 
that were deemed to tilt the balance toward the unions.  The bill 
did not stipulate clearly that there was no ban on the use of 
replacement workers.  Instead it stated that no employer or 
person shall use the services of a replacement worker for the 
purpose of undermining a trade unions replacement 
representational capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During Senate hearings no one seemed to know how the terms of 
the bill would be interpreted.  That is still a problem today. We 
do not seem to know what the interpretation will be.

rejected, it would be better to completely eliminate the clause, 
so as to avoid any ambiguity that might give the board the power 
not to allow the use of replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Motion No. 26 proposed by the Bloc Quebecois seeks to 
completely prohibit the hiring of replacement workers, our 
amendment strikes a balance. Indeed, it is not reasonable to 
prohibit the use of replacement workers, because it would 
jeopardize the very existence of a business. What is the point 
of going on strike, if the business no longer exists at the 
conclusion of the negotiation process? 
Replacement workers must be available to provide the essential 
services that workers will not provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment, Motion No. 27, better reflects the spirit of the 
Simms report. It clearly states that replacement workers are not 
hired for the purpose of undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity. The motion is clear, and if it is 
passed, there will definitely not be many questions. But I am 
sure that this evening, the government will vote against it. The 
motion is too clear for the government, which prefers a bit of 
confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 29 is proposed by the Reform Party. Motion No. 25 
seeks to completely eliminate the clause on the use of 
replacement workers. If Motion No. 25 is passed, that clause 
will have to be deleted as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many motions before us today, and we think it is 
possible to make the bill fair. 
However, the government must listen to Canadians and to all the 
opposition parties which have made good suggestions, whether it 
is the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois or our own party. I 
wonder about the New Democratic Party, if you follow me. We 
have an opportunity to do a good job. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the new formulation comes closer to what the Sims task 
force on Bill C-19 had in mind, it is our opinion that it is 
still not made clear enough.  This is not a general ban on the 
use of replacement workers.  More important, it still does not 
properly address the meaning of the words used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker.  I 
will say right at the start so that it does not get a scurry 
going that this is not a quorum call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you hear me out on this issue 
because I am saying it in all sincerity.  Given that opposition 
members would like as much time as possible to raise points on 
debate on the various amendments, some of which we may not even 
be able to get to, and given that the government would like to 
limit the time available for debate, I ask if it would be willing 
to yield the floor to opposition members.  There is little time 
left and there is a whole group we have not be able to debate 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  I rise on the same point of 
order.  Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker.  The reality is that we had 
a whole day of debate last week in which members of the Reform 
Party refused to even discuss these motions.  We have been in 
committee.  They filibustered.  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
West Kootenay—Okanagan has asked for unanimous consent that the 
government yield to the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government give unanimous consent to yield to the 
opposition for the time remaining in debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleagues across the way and I am 
dismayed to hear about the fact that suddenly we have invoked 
time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members across the way where they were during the 
discussions on Bill C-19.  I would like to know where they were 
during the course of the filibuster when we had members of the 
official opposition obviously needing to go back to labour code 
101 to understand the basics.  It was very disappointing to see 
that of the 97 clauses there were nine amendments proposed by the 
official opposition, seven on clause 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the road to Damascus they suddenly discovered the light. They 
discovered all sorts of new amendments.  Where were they during 
the course of the debate that I participated in?  I understand 
that members of the New Democratic Party were there. 
Unfortunately the Conservatives were not there during the 
filibuster.  To suggest that the government is try to bring in 
closure on this important bill is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with the substance of the amendments before us, the 
approach in Bill C-19 is a very careful compromise on a very 
difficult issue.  We recognize an employer's right to hire 
replacement workers for legitimate purposes.  However, their use 
for the purpose of ridding the workplace of union representation 
would be unfair labour practice.  This was the recommendation of 
the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague opposite talks about the fact that it was not 
unanimous, but the majority of the members of the Sims task force 
supported it.  It was part of the overall package of 
recommendations which both labour and management considered 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions have been put forward which would radically alter this 
provision and therefore upset the overall balance of the proposed 
amendments we are trying to achieve.  One motion calls for a 
general prohibition of the use of replacement workers.  Another 
motion seeks to eliminate any restriction on their use.  Still 
another motion seeks to add additional wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision was carefully examined during the parliamentary 
study of former Bill C-66.  Again I hear that we are trying to 
rush the legislation through.  Bill C-66 died when the election 
was called.  We have been told time after time that this is an 
improvement on Bill C-66.  If we are rushing the bill, I would 
like to know where the opposition was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some employer groups raised concerns about the wording of the 
provision in the former Bill C-66.  They wanted the full text of 
the task force recommendations to be included.  This was also the 
recommendation of the Senate committee which also studied the 
former Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do?  The Minister of Labour responded to 
these concerns and changed the wording of the replacement worker 
provision in Bill C-19 to fully reflect the task force 
recommendation.  To repeat that for the opposition, to make sure 
that the replacement worker provision was fully implemented the 
task force recommendation was put into the bill.  Major federally 
regulated employers who appeared before the House committee 
during the study of the bill indicated that they were satisfied 
with the new wording.  If members of the opposition were there 
they certainly would have heard that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who wish to eliminate the provision I say there must be 
an appropriate remedy when an employer hires a replacement worker 
and then refuses to bargain in good faith.  This provision 
provides in my view and certainly in the view of the government 
such a remedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the television cameras are on we now get all the 
amendments.  Obviously we need to have television cameras on all 
the time in committee and then maybe we would have some serious 
work done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who want to prohibit the use of replacement workers a 
total ban on replacements would undermine the balance.  The bill 
is trying to achieve a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally to those who think more wording is needed I refer them 
to the position of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining its objection to the rationale for amending the code 
to include such a provision, the chamber representative told the 
standing committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that the federal government heeded our concerns 
with respect to the earlier wording of this provision and is 
proposing to amend the legislation accordingly.  In particular, 
the addition of the words “rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives” in proposed subsection 94(2.1) will 
ensure that any tribunal interpreting this legislation will be 
guided by the explicit obligation to consider the reason why the 
employer may have hired strike replacements rather than only the 
protection of a union's representation rights, as was the case 
under Bill C-66. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that the provisions that have been put forward in 
terms of the amendments be voted down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very anxious to speak after listening to all that 
claptrap and bafflegab by the Liberal member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is garbage about how we need television cameras in the 
committee room because then serious work will get done. We need 
something in the committee room so something serious gets done, 
but it is not TV cameras.  It is the replacement of the majority 
of the people in there who act according to what the whip tells 
them.  I have seen the whip's department in there watching how 
they vote on certain occasions to make sure they toe the party 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one time they made a mistake in the transport 
committee.  They actually had a Reform amendment that the 
hierarchy of the Liberal Party did not like, but it passed 
because there were a couple of Liberals who did not have their 
marching orders and consequently they voted according to what 
made sense instead of the directives of the Liberal hierarchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came into this place at report stage and the Liberals made an 
amendment that changed the one that passed in committee.  So much 
for the garbage spewed by the last speaker that we have to do 
things in committee where things are treated seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this business of replacement workers, it is really 
unfortunate that debate on this is going to be cut short. They 
say it should all be done in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee we have three members.  In this House we have 59. 
Basically they are denying 56 members the right to have a voice, 
to speak according to their constituents, to people they have 
consulted and according to their own beliefs. That is 
unacceptable.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about democracy.  They should not utter that word.  It 
should not be coming out of their mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I have a problem with the whole concept of replacement 
workers is that this act talks about who can decide when 
replacement workers can be used and when they cannot. The problem 
is where in here does it define exactly what a replacement worker 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you are working in a mill, operating a particular machine, 
and you go on strike and the company simply hires a different 
operator for that machine, that is a replacement worker. 
Frankly, I do not agree with that.  Some of my colleagues may not 
happen to agree with me. That is fine.  I think that is a 
replacement worker and I do not think that aspect of it should be 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If on the other hand the company is owned by a particular 
individual and his wife and their business partner and they are 
able to keep that plant operating, then I think it is their 
right.  It is their plant.  Who are we or the labour relations 
board or anyone else to tell them they cannot run their own 
business?  If there is a contract involved, they have to honour 
the obligations of that contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows the CIRB to actually make a decision.  If the owner 
of the company does something and the union says that is taking 
away its powers because they are still making some money, the 
board says it will just shut them down.  That is the power that 
this thing gives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bigger problem.  The bigger problem is strikes. If 
there were no strikes, in a utopian world, we would not be 
arguing here today about whether there should be replacement 
workers.  In a better world everybody would have a job. 
Everybody would be treated fairly.  Negotiations would go 
smoothly.  That would be just great.  Unfortunately this is not a 
perfect world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be a little more perfect if the other side would give us 
more time to discuss the possibilities and some of the 
things that might happen, but we get into this confrontational 
role and it does not want to hear other ideas. 
It is like the old adage, do not confuse me with the facts, my 
mind is already made up.  I see them sitting laughing over there. 
I think it is great, at least somebody is in here to laugh. That 
is rare.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as whether replacement worker definition should be 
amended better, one of the things that is really sad about the 
death of democracy caused by the other side's vote this morning 
to restrict the debate is that we are not even going to get to 
Group No. 8.  Group No. 8 would deal with something that would 
resolve the problem of replacement workers.  Group No. 8 deals 
with an alternative to a strike.  Would it not be wonderful if we 
could find a reasonable alternative to a strike? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the post office situation.  This is something the 
Liberals should really appreciate because they just went through 
this.  We had last year our fourth postal strike in ten years. 
Four times in the last ten years the governments of this country 
have allowed the post office, which is a monopoly, to shut down 
the mail service of this country. Each time the government says 
this is terrible, this is devastating, so it orders postal 
workers back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It compounded the mistake with another mistake.  The first 
mistake was to say “you can strike and restrict everybody and 
deprive them of their ability to have a mail service even though 
we have set it up so that there is only one possible alternative 
for you anyway to use the mail”.  Then recognizing it made a 
mistake it made a second mistake by ordering postal workers back 
to work but not putting into place an alternative to going out on 
strike in the first place.  Why should we be surprised if year 
after year, strike after strike we find ourselves right back in 
the same situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a mistake the first time I can understand.  But when the 
same mistake is made over and over again then we have to start 
questioning the relative wisdom of the group that is making the 
mistake.  The Liberal Party has certainly made that with the post 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a potential strike of the air traffic system. I hope 
it does not go any further. For years that could not happen, but 
now they have been cut loose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried in transport to get a provision put in that would 
provide an alternative to a strike-lockout dispute settlement 
mechanism.  The vehicle we wanted to use was final offer 
arbitration.  But the government in its wisdom chose not to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find ourselves in Bill C-19 arguing about replacement 
workers.  Of course the government is going to be right back into 
that.  It came up with the replacement worker concept for the air 
traffic controllers which basically put them in a situation where 
they could go on strike but when they were on strike everything 
carried on the same as always.  So what does this do for the 
collective bargaining system the government claims it cherishes 
so much?  It does not cherish it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk in terms of strikes, we do not talk about who wins 
and loses, because the winner is the person who loses the least. 
What is it going to take for the government to wake up? I am glad 
to see some of the Liberals are coming to their senses, coming 
over to the right side.  I hope in doing that their minds change 
as well as their position, because if that happens we would make 
some progress in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a strike, and we do not even talk about 
replacement workers, we have a company that is deprived of their 
revenues, we have workers who are deprived of their income and we 
have all the supplemental collateral damage that is done to 
people all over other areas.  Instead of talking about 
replacement workers, maybe we should be talking about replacing 
the dispute settlement mechanism in the labour code so that we 
actually have something that means Canadians will be able to keep 
their jobs and there will be a reasonable, viable alternative to 
going out on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going on strike or locking people out, if it happens to be the 
employer who initiates the labour disruption, is kind of like a 
duel where both sides shoot at one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I am even getting the victory sign from the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Labour.  I really like that. I think 
she finally realizes the error of her ways in the past and now 
she is actually ready to listen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else happens out of all this debate, if we can get 
through to one poor soul on that side, then perhaps this will 
have been worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of replacement workers is wrong. We are 
approaching it from who decides when they can have them.  The 
approach that should have been taken is what are replacement 
workers.  The CIRB decides what hurts, what is okay, what is not, 
maybe it will flip a coin in the event of a strike.  We cannot go 
tipping the scales by saying it is okay to change the formula for 
one side and not the other.  I hate even to admit there is the 
possibility of a strike.  We have to recognize we have a bigger 
problem and begin dealing with it with things like final offer 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as long as we are stuck in this system we need some 
kind of mechanism which states what constitutes a replacement 
worker.  As long as the company is not using that type of person 
it is free to take those types of actions.  Where we have someone 
who is clearly defined as a replacement worker there is no 
decision to make.  It is black and white. They are not allowed to 
be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really unfortunate that we are dealing with an opposition 
of minds instead of dealing with solutions.  We are in this 
confrontational position and unfortunately, because of the 
actions of the Liberal government today, the last and perhaps 
most important group, finding an alternative dispute settlement 
mechanism, will not even get debated. That is a shame. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I understand that in a few minutes we are going to be 
voting.  We have something like 47 votes to go through so this is 
sort of the end of debate before closure.  Closure happened 14 
times in the 12 years when we had a Liberal government under 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau and we thought he was arrogant.  This 
government has more than doubled that already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked on this bill at second reading and on Groups Nos. 
1, 2, 6 and now 7.  Group No. 7 deals with replacement workers. 
If there is one item where we can listen to rhetorical comment, 
polarized comment, entrenched comment, confrontational comment, 
unenlightened comment, blind comment or comment coloured by 
experiences, this is the one area of the bill where we are going 
to hear all that.  We do not need that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a vision that does not look at the past and does 
not lead us into poor management and poor union leadership where 
workers very often tend to come last.  That is not what we need. 
We all know how bad it can get.  We can count the ways very 
readily.  We had the example that is often referred to with the 
Royal Oak mine in the north where we had replacement workers 
brought in.  People lost their lives in an underground bombing 
over an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other end of the scale we have small businesses with 
certification whereby the total business would be at risk just 
from a short targeted strike on that business.  We need to 
balance all that.  It is an important issue.  It should be 
addressed in the collective agreement and if the agreement is 
suspended, which often occurs, both parties will agree to live up 
to their end of this bargain on replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not need is the CIRB to be put in the untenable 
position which this bill does of being able to prohibit the use 
of replacement workers if the CIRB determines their presence 
undermines the union. 
The CIRB should never be placed in that position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
West Kootenay—Okanagan is aware that a motion for time 
allocation was given with proper notice earlier in the week. 
A vote was taken.  According to the standing orders of the House 
of Commons, it is quite appropriate to proceed in this way.  That 
is all I will say on that point of order.

several deferred recorded divisions at the report stage of Bill 
C-26, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act.

applies to Motions Nos. 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

seek unanimous consent that members who voted on the previous 
motion be recorded as having voted on the motion now before the 
House, with the Liberal members voting nay.

<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to rise to speak to this motion which I do not 
support.  I wish to explain in some detail why I do not support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years ago I was in Washington to do some research in the 
archives.  I found the archives were closed, that it was a public 
holiday and quite an unexpected public holiday.  It turned out 
that it was Memorial Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had nothing to do because I could not work so I walked down 
into the mall area.  I found myself next to the Vietnam memorial. 
It was the first time I had ever seen the Vietnam memorial.  As I 
said, it was on Memorial Day so quite a few veterans were 
standing around the memorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be imagined.  The monument to the Vietnam war in the 
United States is probably one of the most moving monuments built 
anywhere in the world.  It is quite remarkable.  It consists of a 
huge slab of black marble.  A ramp goes down one end and up the 
other, and on it are engraved all the names of the people who 
died during the Vietnam war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the veterans were middle aged since the Vietnam war 
occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Many people of my 
age were standing around the Vietnam memorial to pay homage to 
their fallen comrades.  It was very moving.  I was surprised to 
see little Canadian flags everywhere from one end of the memorial 
to the other.  It was quite a shocking contrast to see the 
Canadian flags against the black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not realize that Canadians had served in the Vietnam war. 
I was very surprised to find that out.  I talked to some of the 
veterans there at the time who explained that they knew Canadians 
who fought with them in the rice paddies in Vietnam, Canadians 
who served with great courage.  Some were killed and some were 
injured.  Many of them believed in the cause the Americans were 
fighting for in Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On further inquiry I found out that approximately 10,000 
Canadians fought with the Americans in Vietnam.  There was such a 
surge of support for the war among young people in Canada that 
the Americans set up a special recruitment system whereby 
Canadians could cross the border to get a letter of acceptance 
and then go back across the border to join up and serve in the 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians who served in Vietnam did so because they thought 
they were fighting against communism.  They believed that 
communism as we saw it in North Korea was a terrible force in the 
world and they wanted to save the world from it.  True idealism 
brought those Canadians to actually risk their lives in that 
foreign war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not recognize veterans who served in foreign armies. 
We can see the wisdom of that decision when we consider Vietnam. 
Those young Canadians who went over there to serve in the 
American forces in Vietnam believed they were doing the right 
thing.  We now know subsequently that the war in Vietnam was not 
really a war of the United States fighting to save the free world 
and sparing it from communism.  It was really the United States 
intervening in a civil war that involved a struggle for 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vietnamese had been under the heel, literally speaking, of 
the French, the Vichy French and even the Japanese during the 
second world war and post second world war.  The Vietnamese are 
very proud people and were very determined to gain their 
independence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The war in Vietnam, as we know, led to some very terrible 
atrocities.  I think of My Lai in which Canadian soldiers were 
distressed by the fact that they could not see the enemy among 
the civilians so they killed the civilians. The Vietnam war was 
also a war in which the Americans resorted to chemical warfare in 
the form of defoliants and agent orange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would agree that Canada is probably very glad that it 
did not officially sanction the Canadians fighting in Vietnam 
because in fact despite their very best intentions they were 
fighting for a losing cause and a wrong cause.  That is the most 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the dangers when Canadians fight for other 
countries.  They may indeed take up a cause that later is 
discovered to be a cause that Canada would not want to associate 
itself with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vietnam war was from 1967 to 1973, the major portion of the 
war.  If we flip back another 30 years we come to 1937 and the 
Spanish civil war.  That war involved the forces of General 
Franco representing the state and backed by the fascists, backed 
by Germany and Mussolini but mainly by Nazi Germany, and the 
republican forces which were backed by the communist power of the 
day, the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union was instrumental in 
getting that war rolling because it had a philosophy until recent 
years of spreading international communism.  The Soviet Union 
made a direct effort to keep the civil war going in Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the Soviet Union's campaign to support the republican 
side involved the formation of international brigades.  These 
brigades comprised battalions and volunteers who were recruited 
from all over the world.  One of those battalions was the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 1,300 Canadians went over and joined the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion and fought on the side of the 
republicans during the Spanish civil war.  The Spanish civil war 
was a terrible war.  It was a brutal war.  Men, women and 
children were killed.  It was a war that is echoed by the civil 
war that is now occurring in Algeria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a different world in 1937.  As the young men from Canada 
went over to serve in the republican forces they could not see 
inside the Soviet Union.  They only knew the Soviet Union as a 
country that was supporting workers and they thought it was a 
grand new experiment.  They thought it was going to free the 
people, and so with the greatest good spirit they went over to 
serve in the republican forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most famous persons at that time was Norman Bethune 
who served in the Spanish civil war, not in the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion but by giving medical aid to the 
republican troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know in retrospect that far from fighting for democracy, 
as the member from Kamloops said, they were fighting on the side 
of the republicans who were supported by the worst dictatorship 
in the world.  The dictator was Stalin.  After the war we 
discovered that this was a communist rule, a dictatorship that 
would kill millions of people, millions of people in Ukraine and 
millions of its own people, the Russians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that Norman Bethune went on to China, served 
in the Chinese forces and became famous there.  However China 
became a dictatorship under Mao and it was one of the cruelest 
dictatorships in modern time.  These people killed millions and 
they were every bit as bad as Hitler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the dilemma that these people in good spirit and good 
heart went over to support a cause that Canada and all the world 
in retrospect realize was actually supporting a cause that was 
perfectly reprehensible and we would not want to have Canada 
associated with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the dilemma that the member for Kamloops wants to 
acknowledge the courage and contribution to history, the 
contribution in spirit of the members of the Mackenzie-Papineau 
Battalion 60 years ago.  He is right in his intention but wrong 
in the execution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can never take the chance of supporting foreign wars in 
which the outcome or result may indicate a political entity that 
is completely unacceptable to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by making a suggestion to the member for 
Kamloops.  In the United States the Canadian Vietnam veterans are 
recognized and compensated by the United States because of their 
service in the Vietnam war. I suggest very strongly to the member 
that he make representations to the Embassy of Spain to see if he 
can get Spain to make a similar recognition of the members of the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion and to get compensation from where 
it really ought to come and that is Spain. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member across the way for a very enlightening and well 
researched speech.  He made some very good points which I agree 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with the basic premise that the Mac-Paps were 
going across on some kind of a flawed premise that they were 
doing something noble and honourable and then found out they were 
actually pawns or were being used by a larger power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the group went over to fight fascism they were right. A 
couple of years later the Canadian government agreed and declared 
war.  That group recognized the fear of fascism in Europe earlier 
and chose to take up arms.  If the group can be criticized for 
being aligned with the communists by working with the republic of 
Spain then so can any of the allies as we joined forces in the 
second world war to do what we thought was right, which was to 
smash fascism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion as it was worded was to investigate 
ways to grant some form of recognition to these noble and heroic 
Canadians.  It did not limit us to any particular course of 
action although first and foremost the goal was to have these 
people declared and treated as veterans with the full status that 
veterans enjoy.  There are other options which I think we should 
be talking about today as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own research on this subject I was very interested to note 
that the Mac-Paps were named after Mackenzie and Papineau who led 
the 1837 Rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada. In fact the year 
the Mac-Paps were formed, 1937, would have been the 100th 
anniversary of that uprising.  I presume that is how the name was 
chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke on behalf of the government was correct. 
My research shows that 1,300 volunteer soldiers banded together 
from all parts of Canada to go abroad. Approximately half of them 
came home.  Not all of them died. Some were missing in action. 
Some actually settled in Europe and did not choose to return to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I would like to dwell on is that ordinary Canadians 
have to be diligent just as those young Canadians were diligent. 
When the extreme right wing raises its ugly head, ordinary 
working Canadians have to be aware of the risk and the threat to 
democracy as well as the threat to the treasured institutions we 
value and which make our country great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think that is what those people did.  In the 
1930s those young people were watching the newsreels in their 
local movie houses and saw the jackboot storming across Europe, 
the rise of fascism.  Canadians travelled overseas to see 
firsthand what it was like. Tommy Douglas was one in the 
mid-1930s to visit Europe to see whether it was true.  He wanted 
to find out if the rise of Hitler and the rise of fascism was as 
threatening as they were hearing.  People read about it in the 
newspapers and came to the very logical conclusion that fascism 
was the greatest threat they faced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than talk about it and rather than wait for the 
government to act, because the Canadian government could have 
been quicker in getting on board to smash Hitler and smash 
fascism, that group of people saw fit to put their own lives 
aside, leave their homes and loved ones and hike off to Europe 
unsanctioned in a formal way by the Canadian government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave them thanks by making them outlaws.  We threatened them 
with two years jail time for having the temerity to get involved 
in the battle.  It was a battle which we knew at that time to be 
just and right because within 18 months we were in the same boat 
as a country leading the fight as one of the early countries in 
the great struggle of World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young men and women realized the danger. Instead of being 
criticized and threatened with legal action they should be 
recognized and championed and given the full status and full 
rights other veterans enjoy.  They gave their youth for the fight 
for democracy against fascism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parallel can be drawn today in the need for us to be vigilant 
as pockets of the extreme right wing surface again across Canada. 
Even within political parties in Canada the right wing is rising 
up in circumstances similar to what we saw in the 1930s.  Many 
parallels can be drawn.  Fascism in Europe really grew out of a 
period of very poor economic times, tight fiscal policy, high 
unemployment, and general dissatisfaction.  That is when working 
people and otherwise decent people seem to seek out these extreme 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the rise of fascism in Germany, when Eichmann was 
interviewed in his prison cell he was asked what did he think 
Adolf Hitler would be remembered for most.  His answer was the 
great way that he solved the unemployment problem.  He said 
nothing about the killing of six million Jews.  It was the great 
way that he solved the unemployment problem.  They were really 
desperate for some kind of relief in the miserable lives they 
were living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the recent rise in right wing populism coming out of a 
period of tight money and economic fiscal policy. The Bank of 
Canada was trying to fight inflation with high interest rates and 
screwed it up.  It resulted in truly desperate times for a lot of 
people, especially where I live in western Canada.  They sought 
out extreme right wing solutions.  This is what led to the rise 
of the new right wing populism.  As I say we have to be ever on 
guard and ever vigilant because looking toward those kinds of 
options brings us all down and threatens the institutions that 
make Canada great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Spanish civil war in many ways acted as a dress rehearsal 
for the second world war.  When Canada saw the international 
brigades mobilizing, taking action and doing what was necessary, 
it probably served to inspire Canadian leaders and other world 
leaders to become motivated and get active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that it was not just Franco they were fighting. 
The Spanish fascists were being backed heavily by Mussolini and 
by Hitler. They were pouring money in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This courageous rather ragtag group went over there on dimes and 
nickels.  They passed the hat around to pay their way over.  They 
were poorly armed.  We can imagine how much courage it took to go 
into that kind of armed conflict against some of the greatest 
world powers of the time.  That should be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norman Bethune's name was mentioned.  He was certainly one of 
the more famous persons to go over during that period.  He was an 
honourable and noble man.  He dedicated his life to elevating the 
standards of the poor.  In health care he broke new ground in 
terms of transfusion techniques some of which actually was 
learned on the battlefield in the heat of battle doing triage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only valid criticism I have heard against Motion No. 75 is 
if we do it for this group, how many other groups are we going to 
have to recognize in some way and apologize for?  Nobody is 
asking for apologies.  We are just asking for some serious second 
consideration in this case.  We are looking at a situation where 
we believe there should be some kind of recognition. If people 
cannot see fit to grant the full veteran status that we are 
asking for, then surely they can do two things.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One was made reference to by the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
In a letter about this recently he came back reminding us that an 
order in council was passed at the time making it a criminal 
offence for Canadians to serve on either side of the Spanish 
civil war.  No charges were actually laid but technically these 
people committed a crime against Canada by going to fight the 
fascists on our behalf.  The very first and foremost thing we 
should be doing is striking that, eliminating that stigma which 
these 40 or so living Canadian veterans of the Spanish civil war 
still have to wear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we can do, and I think there is interest in this 
and in fact we have some interest on the government benches, is 
to put up a monument to the Mac-Paps on the grounds outside the 
House of Commons.  That would be a popular move.  It would be the 
very least we could do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the debate this evening is on Motion No. 75, that in the 
opinion of this House the government should consider the 
advisability of giving members of the Mackenzie-Papineau 
Battalion and other Canadians who fought with the Spanish 
republican forces in the Spanish civil war between 1936 and 1939 
the status of veterans under the federal legislation and making 
them eligible for veterans pensions and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of this motion is a little strange in that it says 
consider the advisability.  We can consider anything.  I wonder 
whether a motion that is worded quite so tentatively is going to 
get much of a result.  In any event, that is the motion before 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a little background on the Spanish civil war.  The 
Liberal member opposite who spoke earlier gave some excellent 
background as well.  As he said the Spanish civil war was a 
savage conflict.  It took more than half a million lives.  That 
was long before the days of modern weapons and modern technology. 
It was noted as a war of terrible atrocities and also some very 
dramatic acts of heroism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historian Hugh Thomas noted that politically the war was a 
hodgepodge of monarchists, fascists, anarchists, liberals, 
Trotskyites, communists and others seeking to use the war to 
advance their particular programs.  Thomas has done a very 
definitive work on the Spanish civil war.  It is very interesting 
reading if anyone is interested in getting more background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Soviet Union supported the republic but it was careful not 
to do so directly.  What it did was set up an organization to 
purchase arms and transport them by covert means to assist the 
Spanish communist forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communist leader in France, Maurice Thorez, suggested that 
aid be given to the republic in the form of volunteers raised 
internationally by foreign communist parties.  They would be 
organized by the Comintern, Communist International, and would be 
led by foreign communists exiled from their own countries and 
living in Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international brigades were seen to have great propaganda 
value for the communists and were seen as a possible nucleus of 
an international red army.  Such an organization could be the 
chief recipient of any Soviet aid in Spain and ensure that Soviet 
arms would be secure in the hands of reliable party members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be interesting to note that before Soviet weapons were 
actually used on Spanish soil, the entire Spanish gold reserve 
had been dispatched to Russia as security for payment.  Russia 
was not just altruistic in this wonderful battle against fascism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the ablest leaders in the Comintern were employed in 
raising volunteers for the international brigades, for example, 
Joseph Broz who became Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, and Enrico 
Togliatti from Italy who later became leader of the Italian 
communist party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historian Thomas tells us that about 60% of the volunteers were 
communists.  Another 20% became communists during their 
experiences in Spain.  Most were young men and members of the 
working class.  A high percentage were unemployed.  Many of the 
Europeans had the experience of street fighting against the 
fascists in Berlin, Paris and London.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these men were adventurers.  Some were hard line 
communists.  Many were idealists, as other speakers have 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal motivations for joining the cause varied widely. 
It has been suggested that somehow these were visionaries who 
happened to see the evils of fascism before everybody else did. 
Unfortunately, they did not see the evils of the extreme left 
wing which was also raising its ugly head at the same time and 
they were seconded into that cause which proved equally perilous 
and brutal for many people in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a third died in the action in Spain.  Several suffered 
political or professional ostracism because of their Spanish 
experiences.  Many of the eastern Europeans who participated in 
the campaign were executed in the purges of eastern Europe in 
1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canadian experience, approximately 1,500 
Canadians served the republican cause during the Spanish civil 
war.  They served in several military formations and the 
unofficial section became to be called the Mackenzie-Papineau 
section in honour of William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis Joseph 
Papineau who were leaders of the failed 1837 rebellion against 
the British ruling classes in Upper and Lower Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mac-Paps eventually became a separate battalion, but fewer 
than a third were Canadians.  Most were Americans, as were their 
first commander and their first political commissar.  Both of 
these men were killed in fighting along the Ebro River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mark Zuehlke, in a recent book, says that the group sent a cable 
to Prime Minister King, who was of course the grandson of William 
Lyon Mackenzie.  The cable read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We implore you from the depths of our hearts to do everything 
possible to help Spanish democracy.  In so doing you are serving 
your own interests.  We are here for the duration until fascism 
is defeated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>King never replied, but I think the cable is an indication of 
how idealistic the people who sent it were.  Unfortunately the 
cause they served turned out to be equally as brutal and 
oppressive as the fascist cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that the Canadians who served in the Mac-Pap 
battalion were not thought well of and not respected in Canada 
was simply because they broke the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There had been the non-intervention agreement of 1936, supported 
by all the major European powers as well as Canada, which was in 
full accord with the agreement.  What happened was that the 
countries agreed on what Churchill called “an absolutely rigid 
neutrality”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government in Canada in the mid and late 1930s did 
not want to get involved in any international problems and, in 
fact, would not support some of the rather tentative measures 
that were put forward by the League of Nations at that time, a 
pretty toothless organization such as it was, of which Canada was 
not a strong member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, Prime Minister King had little sympathy for the 
republican cause and considered communism a great threat at home 
and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada revised the Foreign Enlistment Act in 1937 to give legal 
force to its policy of non-intervention.  Travel to Spain and its 
territories was forbidden.  Those who went to Spain to serve on 
either side of the war from Canada did so in defiance of their 
government and at their own risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the basis upon which these individuals were not only not 
accorded the respect and gratitude due to those who fought on 
behalf of their country but were in some cases prosecuted because 
they had broken the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the law was right or wrong is not the issue.  I think 
there are a lot of laws passed in this House that some people in 
the House do not agree with.  However, that is not a reason for 
simply breaking them.  We need to respect the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the position of the Royal Canadian Legion. 
The legion studied this issue and stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an offence under Canadian law at the time to fight on any 
side during that war.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legion supports the rule of law and does not view it as 
appropriate to advocate a position at this late date which would 
in effect legitimize that which was illegal at the time.  This 
could set an untenable precedent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many idealistic and heroic acts during the Spanish 
civil war.  We know about the skill, courage and sacrifice of Dr. 
Norman Bethune, and the dedication of Jean Watts of Toronto and 
Florence Pike of Falkland, the only two Canadian women to have 
served in the International Brigades.  We know about the wounds 
suffered by playwright Ted Allan and the hundreds who served and 
died.  It is fitting that these individuals be remembered by 
their friends, supporters and communities for their idealism and 
sacrifice, and some have been thus honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, it is not appropriate to grant them the status of 
Canadian veterans.  Consequently, in view of all the many factors 
to be considered, I cannot support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to the motion introduced by my colleague, 
the member for Kamloops, regarding recognition of veterans of 
the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, too, like the member for Châteauguay, would like to see the 
Canadian government finally recognize members of this battalion 
as full-fledged veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the battle they waged against fascism, a battle that now 
seems avant-garde, these soldiers of freedom are still not yet 
recognized as real veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada also took part in the fight against fascism in Europe, a 
few years after the Mac-Paps<B> </B>fought in Spain, and I therefore 
think that it is necessary, imperative really, that the Mac-Paps 
be recognized as real freedom fighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devotion of these men and women was complete and it was 
primarily governments that waged an all-out battle against 
fascism in Europe.  Some 1,300 Canadians joined about 10,000 
French, 3,000 Americans, and Czechs, Yugoslavs and British 
citizens for the sole purpose of stopping fascism in its tracks 
in Madrid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we know that these freedom fighters were too thin on the 
ground and did not have the back-up they needed, because not long 
after their return to Canada, all of Europe was battling 
fascism, and did so until the bitter end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fascists, having triumphed in Spain and already wielding 
power in Germany and Italy, set their sights on all of Europe, 
bolstered by their victory over the international brigades and 
the Spanish republicans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international brigades, including the Mackenzie-Papineau 
battalion, fought bravely on the front lines and we must 
recognize the nobility of their contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must remind this House that the Spanish civil war was not like 
any other war past or future.  All wars are unique, iniquitous 
actually. However, this one marked in a most particular way the 
involvement of civilians in an armed political conflict, in 
spite of the inaction of their government, in fact in spite of 
its orders to the contrary.  They were labourers, teachers, 
journalists, and intellectuals, who left their occupations 
behind in order to engage in a battle for the defence of 
freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Spanish civil war is far more than a mere civil conflict, a 
simple internal matter within Spain, as the governments of the 
day claimed it was.  This conflict will remain the symbol of the 
commitment of men and women from all over the world to 
safeguarding freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of that civil war is precisely that international 
commitment to preserve freedom.  There were few professional 
soldiers in the ranks of the Spanish republican forces; most 
were people who believed in freedom and were prepared to 
sacrifice themselves to preserve it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Spanish civil war is also and perhaps particularly so the 
commitment by intellectuals to the very essence of a political 
conflict.  It was first the Spanish intellectuals who refused to 
give in to the military coup.  The Frederico Garcia Lorcas, the 
Pablo Picassos and the Joan Miros fought for liberty.  Ernest 
Hemingway, André Malraux and George Orwell traded pen for gun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion not also led by someone who 
lived by the pen rather than the gun?  What else but the simple 
belief that our most precious possession needed defending at all 
cost would cause Edward-Cecil Smith to leave his paper in favour 
of the trenches? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the ardent defenders of freedom who went to fight 
alongside the Spanish whose government, the government they had 
just freely chosen, had been toppled by the military.  It was 
these people whose courage, convictions and determination tested 
the mettle of the Condor legion sent especially by Hitler in 
support of the new strong men of Europe and the weapons and 
military tactics that would soon rout all the armies of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was these defenders of liberty who understood long before 
governments the stakes involved in this little war, the stakes 
involved for the future of Europe and for the protection of 
freedom.  This is the commitment to freedom we are being asked 
to recognize by giving the members of the Mackenzie-Papineau 
Battalion the status of veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must act now, before it is too late to do so. 
Is Canada, with the United States, not on the short list of 
countries refusing to recognize the involvement of their 
citizens in this war?  The list may be short, but in my opinion 
there are still too many names on it—Canada's in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some oppose this motion for reasons of cost or potential 
administrative problems.  Others because they fear it might 
encourage our fellow citizens to become involved in any sort of 
conflict.  We must not forget our history and we must remember 
that, as parliamentarians, we make decisions that soon will come 
under the scrutiny of historians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us therefore assume our responsibilities and recognize the 
great valour in the commitment of the members of the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very honoured to rise today in the House to speak in support of 
my colleague's motion, M-75, regarding the Mackenzie-Papineau 
Battalion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had personal experience with members of the Mac-Paps who 
have worked so courageously to bring forward this issue.  I would 
like to congratulate the member for Kamloops for bringing forward 
this motion to provide understanding and education about this 
issue and to bring forward to Canadians the wrong that was done 
to the 1,300 volunteers who very bravely went to fight fascism 
before it was understood even by the Canadian government at the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we read the history of the Mac-Paps we see the courage that 
these men and women had and the dedication they displayed in 
fighting fascism.  The fact that they were then vilified and 
castigated by not just the Canadian government but by the RCMP 
and by society generally is something that is a real black mark 
in the history of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what this motion does is bring this issue back to the 
Canadian people, to say that we must give recognition to this 
noble and heroic group of Canadians who were willing to stand up 
to be counted, to make a personal sacrifice, to go to another 
country because they believed so strongly in defending democracy 
not only in Canada but also abroad.

they were politically unreliable, these Canadians who had made 
this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a motion where members of this House can remember the 
history here.  It allows us to give recognition to what is 
regrettably a very small group of remaining veterans.  There are 
about 40 members of the Mac-Paps who are still alive. It is 
important that we remember what they did.  It is important that 
we right a wrong in history.  It is important that all parties 
and all members of this House stand up and give recognition to 
the work and the commitment the Mac-Paps have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask other members of the House to put aside partisan politics, 
to put aside what may have happened back in 1936 and to say that 
these Canadians must be recognized.   What better place to do 
that than in the House of Commons.  There are members of the 
community, members of their families, their children and their 
grandchildren who are watching this debate.  They are watching to 
see what we do in the House of Commons to give acknowledgement to 
the sacrifice these people have made, many of whom have now died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on members of the House to do the honourable and right 
thing, to recognize the Mac-Paps and to see what we can do to 
grant some form of recognition to this truly heroic and 
courageous group of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I advise the House that if the hon. 
member for Kamloops speaks now he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to say a few closing words in this debate on Motion No. 
75, an effort to give appropriate recognition to the 
MacKenzie-Papineau brigade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that Canada has shown leadership in the past 
by acknowledging past wrongs and issuing apologies.  In some 
cases we have provided financial compensation.  I refer 
particularly to the Japanese Canadians who were treated so 
inappropriately during the second world war.  There was an 
apology and compensation was provided, similarly for first 
nations peoples humiliated in residential schools.  There was an 
appropriate apology and an indirect form of compensation was 
indicated. We have seen nations apologize and acknowledge the 
past wrongs of the Holocaust, apartheid in South Africa, and one 
could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says an awful lot about a country that can admit it has made 
errors.  Previous governments had debates around some of these 
issues but they made inappropriate decisions.  They were in 
error.  They made mistakes.  It takes a great deal of courage for 
a person to admit to making mistakes and then to move on.  It 
takes some courage for a government and a parliament to say we 
made a mistake to those who volunteered to fight fascism even 
before we as a country did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to my colleagues from all sides of the House when they 
vote on this motion to set aside minor problems which have been 
identified and issues that would make the implementation of this 
acknowledgement difficult.  Do the right thing.  For the handful 
of veterans who are living today in Canada, do the right thing 
and indicate that we appreciate the fact that they led the way to 
combating fascism for our country and in the world.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in response to the reply given on March 26, 1998, by the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions to 
my question on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had asked why the federal government was refusing to use the 
surplus in the employment insurance fund to help all the 
unemployed from coast to coast. 
Right now, fewer than 40% of unemployed workers are receiving EI 
benefits.  This is all the more serious when one realizes that 
the surplus in the employment insurance fund is up around $15 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government allowing the surplus in the employment 
insurance fund to mount up when people throughout the country 
are suffering because of the changes to EI eligibility criteria? 
It is often forgotten where this surplus comes from.  It comes 
from the workers and employers of this country who pay EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the program's name indicates, this is insurance for the 
difficult times when one loses one's job.  Everyone hopes not to 
have to turn to this insurance, but the nature of work being 
what it is today, it is sometimes unavoidable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this government not acknowledge that more than 60% of 
unemployed people do not qualify for insurance?  They are not 
entitled to their own money.  Not because the government lacks 
money, either, as there is a surplus of $15 billion in the fund. 
It is hard to understand why the government refuses to act on 
this serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the National Council on Welfare announced that child 
poverty was at its highest in 17 years.  Their report emphasized 
the direct link between increased poverty and the changes in 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the northeastern part of my province of New Brunswick, the 
unemployment rate is 23%.  One person in four is trying to find 
a job, and finding nothing.  There are thousands of families 
living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was even announced yesterday that the unemployment rate in 
New Brunswick was around the 13% mark. 
Often, the hon. members over there do not believe me when I say 
that people are suffering because of the changes to employment 
insurance.  This National Council on Welfare report confirms 
this, in black and white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time to do something is now.  This government must start 
working for the people of this country and must address the 
subjects of concern to all Canadians, such as the elimination of 
poverty, job creation, and a health system that meets everyone's 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start on this right now by reviewing the employment 
insurance eligibility criteria.  Canadians have suffered enough. 
With $15 billion, we can put contribution rates back to 60% and 
cover 70% of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some calculations earlier.  A person working 420 hours in 
a fish plant or who has a low paying seasonal job with a minimum 
salary of $7.50 an hour, for example, will receive $3,150 
divided by 14 and multiplied by 55, the percentage under 
employment insurance. He will get $123.75 a week.  Nobody can 
live on that. All the same, with the considerable surplus that 
is in the employment insurance fund, this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government waiting for?  Do the Liberals want the 
poverty rate to climb?  Let us change the employment insurance 
criteria in order to remedy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International 
Trade has the floor.

<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is 
committed to job creation and economic growth and it is making 
considerable progress on that front.  Evident from a steadily 
declining unemployment rate, we intend to see this downward trend 
continue.  The EI premium rate must ensure that there is 
sufficient revenue each business cycle to pay EI costs at 
relatively stable rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current surplus makes prudent provision against rate hikes 
in the event of unforeseen economic and global changes.  It also 
allows the government to address unemployment where it is most 
severe.  For example, similar in concept to the 1997 and 1998 new 
hires program, the 1998 budget gives employers who hire more 
young Canadians in 1999 and 2000 an EI premium holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that just three years ago the federal 
government's deficit was $42 billion.  At that time the 
government looked at all aspects of the fiscal situation and 
there is no denying that EI surpluses played a role in restoring 
fiscal health.  This was not done in isolation, however, and 
complemented other difficult decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premium rates have been declining since 1994.  This year's 
decrease from $2.90 to $2.70 will save Canadians $1.4 billion in 
1998 and premiums will continue to decline as the fiscal 
situation permits.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK301"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
opposition to the multilateral agreement on investment, the MAI, 
has been massive and is still growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the citizens of Canada who are realizing that the 
MAI is a very bad deal.  Also our provincial governments are 
beginning to realize what a bad deal it is in terms of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of this year I asked a question of the Prime Minister, 
expressing increasing concern that, for example, in my province 
of British Columbia government initiatives like the jobs and 
timber accord and legislation to protect young people from the 
exploitation of tobacco companies are threatened by the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response I received from the government was pathetic. What I 
was told by the government is: “There is nothing in the 
negotiations that would threaten the ability of Canada to 
function and operate its own house”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know and understand differently. More and more 
Canadians are understanding that the fundamental impact of the 
MAI will be to undermine our democratic institutions and to 
undermine the ability of elected governments to set public policy 
in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia the provincial government is so concerned 
about the impact of the MAI that an all-party committee to 
undertake public consultation has been struck.  The mandate of 
the special committee is to inquire into and make recommendations 
regarding all aspects of the MAI through broad public 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the committee will be appointed shortly and the 
committee is expected to report to the provincial legislature in 
British Columbia in the coming year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to this issue in B.C. the minister responsible, Mr. 
Farnworth, said make no mistake, the MAI is not dead.  While he 
expressed optimism that the MAI treaty was not signed in Paris 
when it was anticipated, he does point out, and I and many other 
Canadians would concur, it is imperative that we take advantage 
of this delay to continue to press the federal government to have 
full public debate and hearings and finally to stop this deal 
from going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister for employment and investment, Mr. Farnworth, from 
British Columbia has written to the Minister for International 
Trade calling on the federal government to hold hearings in all 
regions of the country and has advised the federal minister not 
to assume that the MAI will automatically cover provincial 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know why the Liberals are so afraid to debate 
this issue of the MAI.  I have been involved in a number of 
debates in my own riding and in Vancouver where not one Liberal 
would show up to the debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling on the government today to be honest about the 
MAI, to tell Canadians why it is that it is pushing it through. 
We want to say to the government that the opposition is 
increasing.  There will be such opposition that we believe the 
deal will not go through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK302"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, economic 
isolationists all over the world are opposed to agreements like 
the MAI.  There are those who believe that one can build a wall 
around the country and operate its economic system within that 
wall and in so doing bring prosperity, good health and happiness 
to all its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was tried at the beginning of 1917 in the Soviet Union.  At 
the point of the collapse of that regime, the financial state was 
so severe that the country is still in the throes of going 
through a serious catharsis in terms of recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has learned in recent years that our economy is certainly 
dependent on international interaction and international trade. 
Forty per cent of the jobs created in this country are created 
because Canada exports.  Agreements are absolutely essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We learned a long time ago that Canada works best if there are 
rules.  We are not a large country that can simply operate in the 
jungle.  We have investors in other countries who are small 
businessmen.  They cannot go over there with batteries of lawyers 
to engage in litigation.  It is much more satisfactory if we have 
the rules set up and we understand where we are going.  As a 
result Canada is prospering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will continue to prosper as long as we continue to reach 
out and interact with all nations of the world.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DISASTER RELIEF 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise this evening on a matter of equity for all 
Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 19 and on subsequent occasions in the House I asked 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food why he has not extended 
disaster relief to farmers in the Peace River region of British 
Columbia and Alberta who do not qualify under the disaster 
financial assistance arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These farmers have endured two devastating years of crop losses 
due to excess moisture.  These arrangements are known as the 
DFAA.  Farmers in the maritimes who suffered last summer under 
the worst draught in a decade have also been denied disaster 
relief by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the past two years we have seen special disaster 
relief programs set up outside the DFAA on four different 
occasions.  The precedent has been set.  The federal government 
has shown that compassion and compensation are available outside 
the DFAA criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Saguenay and the Red River floods special subsidiary 
programs were established outside the DFAA for farmers suffering 
losses.  More recently the federal government shelled out an 
extra $50 million again outside the DFAA for part time Quebec 
farmers with losses resulting from this January's ice storm. Then 
again in March the minister of agriculture proudly proclaimed an 
additional $20 million in federal funds outside the DFAA for part 
time Ontario farmers with losses from the ice storm.  These were 
farmers who do not qualify and did not qualify under the regular 
DFAA rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that in each of these four cases farmers were 
deserving of the special arrangements that were made to get them 
through the devastation caused by these disasters.  What is 
difficult to understand, however, is that the government will not 
apply the same rules and compassion to all disaster besieged 
farmers.  They have done it not once, not twice or three times 
but four times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has indicated that when the DFAA is not 
sufficient, when it does not adequately provide financial 
disaster relief to farmers, the rules can be changed and special 
programs can be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Peace River and maritime farmers the DFAA is insufficient to 
meet their needs. The minister of agriculture has stated in the 
House that these farmers have been treated exactly the same for 
coverage as farmers in other areas.  This is simply not true. 
Until Peace River and maritime farmers receive the same kind of 
subsidiary assistance programs as their counterparts have in the 
Saguenay region, Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario, this injustice 
will continue.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the simple facts.  In trying to justify his 
inequitable treatment of these farmers the minister has also 
indicated to the House that special subsidiary programs have not 
been put in place, particularly in Alberta and B.C., simply 
because those provinces have not asked for it.  He made this 
ridiculous excuse even though the $50 million special subsidiary 
Quebec program was established unilaterally by the federal 
government without the co-operation of the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see recently that the Alberta minister of 
agriculture, the hon. Ed Stelmach, called his bluff.  He formally 
asked the federal agricultural minister that a special subsidiary 
program be established for Alberta farmers in the Peace River 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just learned that Minister Stelmach's request has been 
denied.  I am unaware of what excuse the minister of agriculture 
used other than maybe his compassion does not exist west of 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the government is making up the rules as it 
goes along.  If it is to design special subsidiary programs to 
address Quebec and Ontario farmers who do not qualify under the 
regular DFAA rules, it should change the criteria for western and 
eastern farmers as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK305"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we realize that 
farmers in northern Alberta and British Columbia have experienced 
two wet seasons in a row and have suffered significant production 
and income loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also aware of the drought condition that impacted on 
parts of the maritimes and Ontario in 1997.  However assistance 
under the standing federal-provincial disaster financial 
assistance arrangement does not apply to the situations cited by 
the hon. member because it does not cover income losses.  It 
deals with reconstruction and does not provide assistance where 
insurance is available, particularly crop insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extension of DFAA assistance to Quebec part time farmers is 
based on the same rules and the same procedures that applied in 
previous major disasters such as the Edmonton tornado, the 
Saguenay floods and the Manitoba Red River flood.  The magnitude 
of these disasters in terms of the broad economic impact were 
such that a comprehensive subsidiary agreement covering 
agriculture and industry were implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the existing combination of crop insurance, net 
income stabilization account, NISA, and companion programs has 
the best potential to provide the needed support for all Canadian 
producers in cases of drought and excessive field moisture.
