      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, however, I would like to take this opportunity to wish a happy new year to my hon. colleagues, Parliament Hill employees and all my constituents in Laval.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would implement the refugee appeal division. The Bloc Québécois has to put this bill forward to have a provision of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act come into force, which is rather ironic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proper appeal process for refugee claimants ought to have been put in place as soon as the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act enacted in 2002 took effect. This is one of the significant changes required to ensure that asylum seekers are treated fairly and equitably. To persist in not making this change is to allow a situation that is unfair to asylum seekers to continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, I have some examples to share of people who are experiencing or have experienced difficulties in recent years because the refugee appeal division was not in force. Pierre Gauthier from the refugee outreach committee of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Ottawa appeared before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration on November 2, 2006. He reported that, for more than 16 years, the refugee outreach committee of St. Joseph's Parish on Laurier Avenue in Ottawa has been helping newly arrived refugees in Canada's capital area. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, they helped a woman who had applied for refugee status and who was ordered deported without a complete and just hearing. After spending a year in a sanctuary with their help, Maoua Diomande was authorized to remain in Canada. Once all the facts had been uncovered, the minister decided to issue the permit on compassionate grounds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, religious institutions are forced to offer sanctuary only because the refugee determination system is not working properly. Countless other refugee status claimants—hundreds and maybe even thousands—have been turned down by Canada because they did not have the opportunity to fully present their case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Samsu Mia, who lived in sanctuary at First Unitarian for 18 months, illustrates some of the problems encountered within Canada's citizenship and immigration system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mia came to Canada in 1995 as a domestic employee of a senior official in the Bangladeshi High Commission. He was treated as a slave. His wages were withheld. He was not given his contractual trips home. He had to sleep on the floor, and his shoes and passport were confiscated. In 1999 he escaped and attempted to recover his wages and passport.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, his family at home, and his Canadian rescuer, were all threatened. Mr. Mia's initial refugee claim was turned down by a single judge on the grounds that this was simply a personal dispute between two individuals. The judge ignored the fact that one individual was an illiterate cook and the other a powerful official.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after he was turned down, Mr. Mia's brother in Bangladesh was threatened by a different official, who had been transferred home from Canada. This was new evidence, and evidence of continuing danger, but there was no way to present it under present procedures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 his son in Bangladesh was beaten and admonished to “Tell your father to be quiet and go home”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2003, the pre-removal risk assessment noted that this beating was not documented. The result was a removal order. It would have been better if a decision on removal had been delayed to allow time to document the son's beating.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of one of our contacts, a Canadian who operates several orphanages in Bangladesh, documentation was finally obtained, but it took some time. However, there was no procedure in place to allow him to present this new evidence; the decision had been taken.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para391926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does happen that a refugee may not be able to produce such evidence; whether more time is required or because someone did not understand in time the need for that evidence. There should be an appeal process and a process than makes it possible to present new evidence. The final decision should not depend upon religious institutions or the compassion of the minister. Justice should be rendered without the necessity to call on the intervention of strong and well-organized pressure groups. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mr. Mia received permission to remain in Canada. However, he must deal with numerous administrative complications. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government maintains that a safety net already exists by virtue of the opportunity to request a pre-removal risk assessment, through judicial review by the Federal Court and through a request for permanent resident status on humanitarian grounds. These do not in any way offer refugees the protective measures that the refuge appeal division would provide. The Federal Court provides only for a judicial review and does not provide for a review of the facts of a case. Since the Conservative party came to power, neither the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development </A> nor the  <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</A> have established the division, even though in the past the Conservative party had supported all demands for that to be done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many groups in civil society in Quebec, across Canada and in the international community have called for establishment of the RAD. Among these are the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United States Committee against Torture, the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Bar Association, Amnesty international, la Ligue des droits et libertés and the KAIROS group. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are four reasons why the refugee appeal division should be established. The first is efficiency. In dealing with applicants who have been denied refugee status it is more efficient than the Federal Court for pre-removal risk assessment or applications on humanitarian grounds. The second reason is the improved uniformity in the law to ensure unified jurisprudence, in terms of analysis and in legal interpretation. In other words, an appeal mechanism helps the system to make decisions by establishing precedents. The third reason is justice. The denial of refugee status has grave consequences. because human errors occur in any decision-making process, it should be normal to have an appeal process to offset the fact that decisions are made by a single person. The fourth reason is political. By not establishing the refugee appeal division, the federal government is going against the will of Parliament and the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees was adopted by the United Nations in 1951. According to this convention, Canada cannot directly or indirectly return refugees to a country where they will be persecuted. Article 33 sets out the responsibilities of states for protecting refugees:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the definition is limited, it is nonetheless a major legal component.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refugees find themselves in very difficult situations and are very vulnerable. They have left a situation where their lives are in danger. Often they do not understand French or English. They arrive in a precarious economic position. The Bloc Québécois is dismayed by the lack of justice shown by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration when dealing with refugees since the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Bill C-11, came into force in 2001.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, two panel members would hear refugee claims. Only one member had to rule in favour of the refugee's request for asylum in order for it to be approved. Now, with only one member, there are many shortcomings and a great deal of injustice takes place because quite often there is not the balanced view that prevails when two people make a decision. The former chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Peter Showler, confirmed before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration that:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Showler also said:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para391939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believed that these increases toughened the requirements that refugee claimants had to meet and made it more difficult for immigrants to enter the country. Still, we felt that the refugee appeal division balanced the loss of two-member panels. That is why we voted against this bill. However, we asked that the refugee appeal division be reviewed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to know what an appeal division would cost, as such a division has never been set up. However, we do know that the human costs would be much higher than the financial costs. Considering that the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and the various components have financial resources of some $116 million for 2006-07, the annual costs of the RAD represent only 7% of the total budget. When we look at the costs of the appeal division, we must take into account the savings it generates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This political inaction must not be allowed to continue, because there is an urgent need for the refugee appeal division. It is unacceptable that this appeal division is not yet in place in 2007.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding alone, I employ someone who spends 40 hours a week working on these extremely important, time-consuming cases, which I would describe as “humanitarian cases”. Most of the people who come to see us would be entitled to be heard by the government, through the refugee appeal division.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, on December 14, 2004, the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration adopted the following motion: </div>
    </p><a name="Para391944"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration requests that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration implement the Refugee Appeal Division or advise the Committee as to an alternative proposal without delay. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para391945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every committee member from the Conservative Party voted in favour of the motion. We do not understand the delay in implementing an effective refugee appeal division. Furthermore, in April 2005, the Conservative Party published a report on a national consultation on Canada's immigration system. It recommended reviewing the appeal process. There is no real appeal process. The refugee appeal division has to be set up. Decisions have to be made by more than one person.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the previous minister did not show any willingness to implement this appeal division. This safety net is very important because we cannot accept that failed refugees are denied the opportunity to seek permission from the Federal Court, Trial Division, to request a judicial review. Currently permission is granted in a very small number of cases, roughly 4% of the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, many people have called for a refugee appeal division for a number of years now. The Bloc Québécois has called for one a number of times and it is certainly not alone in doing so. Even before the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act came into effect the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was calling for such an appeal division. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has always felt it was necessary to have an appeal mechanism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2004, the United Nations Committee against Torture condemned Canada for still not having a refugee appeal division. The Canadian Council for Refugees has also repeatedly spoken to the need for an appeal division. That is why I am asking all my colleagues in this House to support this bill, which will allow greater fairness and greater justice for refugees.</div>

I am therefore not familiar with every piece of legislation that has been debated in this House.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why that is. But that is not surprising, coming from either the Liberals or the Conservatives. When in office, they act a certain way.

It is clear that she and her colleagues, and in fact all of us, want to see a refugee system that is fair and efficient as well as compassionate. These qualities are what we, as compassionate people, hope to see in the systems and programs of our government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can take pride in our humanitarian, compassionate nature. That is why Canada's new government welcomes refugees, and over 32,000 were welcomed last year. I am sure all members of the House and all Canadians understand Canada's obligation as a member of the global community to provide protection to those in need. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also understand the importance of having in place a refugee determination system that is fair and consistent in the application of the rules. As recently as last November, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees praised the fairness and quality of Canada's refugee system in being one of the best in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians also see the value in our system. Last October, Ms. Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, appeared before the House Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. I fully recognize that she supports Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2159677,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2159677&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-280</A>, but it is worth noting what she had to say with respect to the existing system.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>--I think it is fair to say from our perspective that the Canadian refugee system...has a lot to be said for it....One of the great benefits of the Canadian system is that we have invested in a very competent first-level decision process. Rather than wasting time making a first decision that has to be overturned most of the time on the appeal, we have a first-level refugee determination that, generally speaking, is good. </small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para391970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, an applicant for refugee status in Canada can begin the process knowing that at the first-level hearing the members will be generous in listening to claims and deciding them. Applicants actually can make representation and present evidence and of course the matter is determined in accordance with the judicial principles of fairness and justice. This is the first step.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system, which earns high praise from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, currently includes a review mechanism for errors that may have been made by the first-level decision maker. In the current system, if an individual's claim for refugee status is denied by the Immigration and Refugee Board, that person may apply for a judicial review of the claim by the Federal Court of Canada. Ordinarily this review proceeds while the claimant is able to remain in Canada, with full social benefits throughout the process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that there is a common belief that the court considers only errors in law in determining whether a case will be returned to the IRB for another look. This is not correct. The Federal Court can overturn and has overturned IRB decisions based on errors in finding of fact. The appeal division at the heart of this bill will not in fact be bringing that much more to the applicants in this sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, we see that it can do a number of things, including declaring the order invalid, setting it aside, or referring it back for further consideration. Some of the grounds the court looks at are that the first tribunal acted without jurisdiction or beyond its jurisdiction, that it failed to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that it was required by law to observe, that it erred in law, or that it based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it. Those are the grounds, along with others, that the Federal Court can consider.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the section that this private member's bill wishes to bring into place, we note that it allows the appeal division to look at the record, just like the Federal Court can, without calling new evidence, without calling viva voce evidence. This particular tribunal can of course either affirm the decision or refer it back to the first tribunal for further decision, as the Federal Court can; in fairness it can substitute its own decision. When I asked the registrar of the Federal Court whether the number of grounds set out in the Federal Court of Appeal were actually broader or more extensive than the ones the refugee appeal division proposed, the answer was yes, that is correct.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para391975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refugee determination system is noted as being fair and a model for others to use. If a judicial review with the federal court is not successful, the claimant has the right to apply for a pre-removal risk assessment. This process addresses situations where there is new evidence, a change in circumstances, or a concern with respect to danger in terms of removal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another avenue available to a failed refugee claimant is provided by the Immigration Refugee Protection Act, and that is on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This is one that a good percentage of applicants take advantage of for their benefit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the bill, we must also consider whether opening another level of review, creating yet more processes, will enhance what is already regarded as one of the best and most generous refugee determination systems in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of putting the RAD in operation is estimated to be a minimum of $2 million in start up costs alone and an additional $30 million on an ongoing annual basis to the federal and provincial treasuries. This includes the cost of items such as the provision of health care, legal aid services and other social assistance as necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not small sums and we must consider the impact on our partners in the provincial and territorial governments. It is they who bear much of the responsibility for the welfare of refugee claimants while they await the determination of their claims and the hearing of their appeals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider if you will, Mr. Speaker, a study carried out by immigration officials which followed 100 random refugee claimants from 1998 to 2004 and the number of processes that were required from beginning to end.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2004, 71 claimants had achieved some kind of resolution, while 29 had not. It took 2.1 years on average from claim to landing as refugees. It took four years on average from claim to landing in other categories, such as humanitarian and compassionate grounds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that implementation of the sections of the act dealing with the refugee appeal division would add at least another five months to the refugee determination process. As we all know, that is on a minimal basis, but there will be perhaps a year, nine months or more, added to what already is not functioning as efficiently as it should.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of concern. As praiseworthy as our system is, if Canadians express one concern about it, it would be to have less delays in the refugee determination process. All quarters and all parties have expressed this concern. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it was the previous Liberal critic who said that she found the current process allowed delays by failed claimants ad infinitum. I might just quote a portion of what was said by the critic:</div>

<td><small>--I think it's important that when we look at the RAD, we see it not as being off and by itself but within the context of all the other types of appeals to which refused refugee claimants have access.

Because right now that's what the system allows, almost ad infinitum. I would make the suggestion to the committee that when we come to our suggestions and recommendations for the minister and the House on the role of the RAD and whether the RAD should exist, we should put it in the context of all the appeals that are possible for refused refugee claimants. We should try to bring some kind of homogeneity and logic to the whole system of appeals on behalf of the refugee claimants.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acting chief administrator of the Federal Court of Canada administration services said he agreed 100% with that aspect of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some mention made about two members being better than one, but in tracking the decisions of a two member board, less than 1% of the cases resulted in a split decision. The question now is, when we take those factors into account, that alone is sufficient basis for implementation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all hon. members understand that when Parliament passed the Immigration Refugee Protection Act, it gave government the authority to decide when to implement these sections of legislation. It did so by making the sections come into force by governor in council resolution. The bill proposes to sidestep that and to make it effective on a sooner basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians trust the government and the governing party's judgment. Canada's new government is listening to Canadians.

It also increased the budget by 25%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians would be right to question whether a fourth avenue for appeal would make the system any fairer, especially when they are already seeing some people in the system for many, many months, and even years in some cases.</div>

    </p><a name="Para391995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a long tradition and a compassionate history of receiving refugees from around the world, refugees who are escaping unfair persecution and severe injustices, and are seeking a new and peaceful life. Canadians recognize that welcoming legitimate refugees is not a feel good exercise, but a right and moral thing to do as a country which believes in the principles of equality, fairness, opportunity and justice. Also, a privileged country like ours has obligations under international treaties to contribute to providing relief in the global refugee crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para391996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is one of the very few countries in the world that has made a conscious decision to take every refugee claimant very seriously. Claimant applications are first reviewed by a quasi-judicial refugee board where each case is examined based on its own merit and circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para391997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, if a refugee application is rejected, the applicant is entitled to apply for a federal judicial review. A pre-removal risk assessment is also conducted to ensure that circumstances that led to the negative decision have not changed. However, under the existing Immigration and Refugee Protection Act there are clauses that allow for the creation of an appeal process that would enable failed claimants to have their applications reviewed and have a negative decision re-examined.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pause here to remind the Conservatives that we, the opposition parties, have the responsibility to evaluate and analyze how they govern, while it is their responsibility to govern according to what Canadians expect of them.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is not asking us to introduce anything new or change our procedures drastically. It is only reaffirming what is already on our legislative books. There are probably many reasons why these clauses have not yet been applied, but it is hard to deny the intent and the objectives of this bill. Stakeholders and human rights advocates have been calling for the need to strengthen and reform our refugee application examination process. This step will further enhance the transparency and credibility of our system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon my colleagues across all party lines to vote in favour of sending this bill to committee. In a country where we pride ourselves on championing justice and equality, we must not turn our back on implementing a process that would ensure the application of justice. Not only do we want to pursue the application of justice, but we must also be seen as doing everything we can in that pursuit.</div>

It is unbelievable that the House should have to revisit legislation, passed after a full debate, to call on the government to implement the provisions of the law in Canada. However, that is just what the bill does, and it is sadly necessary because the current Conservative government refuses to implement the law of the land and the former Liberal government and the former Liberal ministers of citizenship and immigration, the members for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79018,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79018&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bourassa</A>, <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78669,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78669&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">York West</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78499,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78499&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Eglinton—Lawrence</A>, all directly refused to implement the law of the land.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today would implement the sections of the current Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or IRPA, pertaining to the establishment and operation of the Refugee Appeal Division, or what we commonly call the RAD.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRPA, including these sections related to the RAD, was passed in Parliament in 2001. It is the law of the land. However, Liberals and now Conservatives have decided that they know better than Parliament, despite their participation in the legislative process in Parliament, and that they can ignore the decisions made here. I believe that kind of decision making shows contempt for Parliament and for the law.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be on the record. I want to give officials and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration this notice. After an election, should I be in a position of responsibility in government, and I am an optimist by nature, as the minister of citizenship and immigration, I expect the department's file, with a detailed plan to implement the provisions of the existing Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Refugee Appeal Division and with the accumulated dust of years of Liberal and Conservative inaction and contempt blown off it, to be on my desk the moment I walk into the office. If I am ever in that position of being minister, I will, as the first act of my time in office, implement the Refugee Appeal Division. I have made this commitment publicly many times. It is the only possible decision, the only possible action, if one respects the law, if one respects Parliament and if one is concerned for fairness and justice for refugees in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is the Refugee Appeal Division?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RAD was a compromise reached during debate on the immigration act in 2001. In exchange for reducing the Immigration and Refugee Board, IRB, hearing panels from two people to one, MPs agreed to establish the RAD to ensure there was an appeal of errors. It was to be the fail-safe. The only appeal of a decision of a refugee claim by the IRB in our system is to apply for leave to appeal in the Federal Court, and only 15% of claimants that apply for leave to appeal are granted an appeal by the court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RAD was, and is, a key ingredient of a fair and just refugee process. It is a paper-screening process, and it is not expensive. The former Liberal government estimated the cost at $2 million to establish it and $8 million a year to operate it. These figures have recently been jacked up in estimates from the Conservatives, but remain very low in terms of the overall immigration program.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Council for Refugees, the key organization working on refugee issues in Canada, which is made up almost every refugee serving agency and organization in Canada, has taken a strong stand on the need for the Refugee Appeal Division and on the miscarriage of justice that the failure to implement it represents.</div>

<td><small>—it is hard for us to understand how governments can fail to implement the appeal provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and not face some form of meaningful censure. It was on the promise of a fair and timely appeal system that the legislation carried. The executive branch's failure to fulfill this promise is a sign of obdurate defiance of democratic authority. In the absence of an effective right to appeal, many parishes and denominational congregations are placed in the position of having to make agonizing decisions of whether or not to grant sanctuary. As other witnesses I'm sure have testified...it is very rare that churches choose to grant sanctuary, notwithstanding the many requests they receive. They do so only after close examinations of the facts before them, through an extensive process of communal deliberation. Granting sanctuary, then, for these churches is an exercise of their informed conscience that must take into account the prospect of breaking the law, risking fines and imprisonment, or violating conscience and the imperative of hospitality. When all other recourse has failed, I think granting sanctuary is a way to call the government's attention to an exceptional injustice and a way to denounce a specific and unacceptable failure of the immigration system in faithfulness to the Lord's own call to hospitality as justice. We recommend, therefore, that the committee unanimously call upon the government to implement a rigorous, transparent, and timely appeal system, as required in the act.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument has been made by Liberal and Conservative governments that our refugee appeal process is too complicated and that the RAD will only further complicate the system. I do not accept that argument. The RAD is a necessary level of appeal against an incorrect decision by a single member of the IRB. Having a functioning appeal at this level will stop some cases from going to the Federal Court. Having a hearing at the RAD will be far cheaper and less time consuming to the system than having a full blown court appeal in Federal Court. Having a functioning RAD appeal will ensure that fewer failed claimants, denied and appeal and denied leave to appeal in Federal Court, will disappear underground. It will also ensure that fewer refugees will end up in sanctuary in churches in Canada, supported by communities that believe, communities that know, they did not have a fair hearing in our refugee determination system. Rather than complicating the system, I believe the RAD will simplify the system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chair of the IRB also did a lot of work. Peter Showler, who was the chair at the time, and the current chair told us that it was a purely political decision. “Purely political” means that someone somewhere is accountable to Canadians and the House for not having established the appeal division. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to remind the House that there have been several requests for amendments to the Immigration Act in recent years. Since 1978, it has undergone two major overhauls with a view to making it easier to understand. For most of my colleagues in the House, the Immigration Act is very complex. From meeting with citizens who have been through the system, we realize that this act is quite inflexible. Furthermore, we do not have the means to react efficiently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one of a number of reasons why this act carried, and that is the spirit underlying it. It has to do with all the considerations related to security. So instead of talking about integration and the way we want to welcome immigrants and refugees, we have a bill focused on border control and security issues. From this stems a series of processes and forms of recourse that affect a part of the population that to my mind is disproportional. Refugees are people who arrive at our borders from countries in which there are conflicts. These are people seeking our help. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155">(1155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may have the best of systems in place. I think that the IRB’s intention is to process these files quickly in order to administer justice. But we have to look at the substance of things. It is possible to appeal a parking ticket, for example. Quite unreasonably however in my opinion, it is not possible to appeal a decision affecting the life of a human being. That is what we are talking about today. We are talking about provisions. We are talking about sections of the act that are not implemented and are harming people whose only wish is to make a positive contribution to our society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is regrettable that the Conservatives are doing an about-face. There were lots of signs allowing us to think that we could be optimistic about the implementation of this appeal division. One need only reread the discussions that were held in 2001. The way in which the appeal division is being proposed now was indeed supported by a Conservative colleague. Last year there was also a political document drafted by the Conservatives that supported implementation of the appeal division. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Bloc Québécois introduced a proposal in committee to establish the appeal division, we had the unanimous support of the Conservatives. I hope that by the next time we debate this bill in the House in March, we will have seen a positive turnaround for refugees, for the people who are currently being denied this right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past five years, not one of the ministers of Immigration has kept that promise. Mounting evidence lays the blame squarely at the feet of the government, which shamelessly accepts that fundamental errors can come up anytime and that there is no way to fix them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that human beings are at risk of being deported to countries that allow torture, and that these errors can cause them great harm, it makes sense for the Canadian Parliament to demand greater care in the application of principles of justice and equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, today we are asking all of our colleagues to support bringing into force all provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I believe that the federal government has a moral responsibility to do this. Furthermore, it has the means and resources to do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a court, made up of experts in protection, would make it possible to correct errors of fact and errors of law at the very beginning of the refugee claims process. This means hiring, at most, 20 people. I think this is important because we are talking about the lives of human beings, about refugees, and we know that our country, Canada and Quebec, was built by and continues to grow because of the contribution of several communities that were welcomed here as refugees. In my opinion, the appeal division must be established immediately.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities discussed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> at five of its meetings.

    </p><a name="Para392054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the House are aware that the government is concerned about stakeholders and listens to stakeholders, especially those stakeholders, such as municipalities, and those levels of government.

Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> was read for the first time in the Senate on that very same day.

    </p><a name="Para392055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate committee met a total of seven times to study the bill and it heard a lot of testimony.

As well, it heard testimony from four stakeholders in particular: the Bridge and Tunnels Operators Association; the City of Windsor, to which this bill is very important as it is important to its citizens; the Canadian Transit Company, the owner and operator of the Ambassador Bridge; and the teamsters union. These are the same stakeholders who appeared before the House Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities when we were studying the bill. They were very informative and provided us with a lot of very valuable information.</div>

He indicated that the government had demonstrated its willingness to consider stakeholder input at all times and that it was very important for the government to listen to stakeholders and implement their needs if they meet the needs and priorities of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons did amend the bill in response to concerns raised by a municipal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During its clause by clause review of the bill, the Senate standing committee on transport and communications made five technical amendments. The amendments were to ensure consistency between the English and French versions of certain sections that had been previously amended by the House at third reading. Another important thing that the government does is it listens to the communication issues that we have in our great country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was passed in the Senate on December 12, 2006. In Canada there are 24 vehicle and 9 railway bridges and tunnels that link our country to the United States. No one needs to hear how important our trade with the United States is to Canadians and how important it is to have a border that our citizens can cross back and forth to encourage trade between our nations and the relationship of our nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bridges that carry vehicle traffic, 14 of them are located in Ontario, 9 in New Brunswick and 1 in Quebec. The rail bridges and tunnels are all located in Ontario except for one which is located in New Brunswick.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, when enacted, will be the very first law to apply to all of Canada's international bridges and tunnels. It took the Conservative government to take this initiative and follow it through.</div>

First, the bill declares that these bridges and tunnels “to be works for the general advantage of Canada”. Therefore, it reinforces the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction with respect to these structures as stipulated in the Constitution and reinforces the government's priority on the safety and security of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the proposed act would also require governmental approval for construction or alteration of new and existing bridges and tunnels, which is because it is so important. It would also require governmental approval for all sales or transfers affecting the ownership and control of these international bridges and tunnels, another important first by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the bill would authorize the government to make regulations regarding bridge maintenance and repair, safety and security, and operation and use. These regulations are very important to those people using the bridges and tunnels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passage of this bill would not be the end but simply the beginning of more work in this area. It marks the first step that a Conservative government had to take the initiative on to actually implement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government officials would also need to develop guidelines for the approval or alteration of international bridges and tunnels. They would need to begin the regulatory process and consultations with stakeholders would again take place so that these regulations reflect the intention of the bill and the intention of we in the House of Commons and the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on this bill we often heard that the development of regulations was a lengthy process. I and Canadians would urge departmental officials to begin work immediately so that we do not leave these bridges and tunnel structures vulnerable to the safety and security matters that are so important in this post-9/11 world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank all members of the House and of the Senate for their great work on this bill. I would also like to thank the members of the transport committee, with which I was personally involved, for all their work in getting it through so quickly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to especially thank Madam Bacon, chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, for her leadership during the Senate standing committee meetings. The discussions in this committee were very candid and thought provoking and helped us push this agenda through. I appreciate the committee's diligence in making several technical amendments so that the French and English text better reflect each other and the consistency of what we in the House of Commons intended.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the stakeholders who appeared before both the House and the Senate committees: the Bridge and Tunnel Operators Association, the City of Windsor, the Canadian Transit Company and the teamsters, all members of which are very important. The contribution of stakeholders who are directly on the ground, who would be tremendously impacted by this legislation, is very important for all bills that we pass through the House. The significance of their contribution highlights how this bill would affect them and their membership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the passage of this bill will serve Canadians and our international visitors well by ensuring that our international bridges and tunnels remain safe and secure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage my colleagues to pass this bill, as amended by the Senate, so that the government can proceed with drafting the guidelines and regulations authorized by it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone in the House and most people who are listening today know, sections 92.10 and 91 of the Constitution give exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government for international bridges and tunnels. Despite this exclusive legislative authority, no law up to now in the history of Canada has ever been adopted that applies to international bridges and tunnels. It took this Conservative government, this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and this minister to get it to the point that it is at today.

As I mentioned previously, there were five particular amendments put forward to make sure that the English and French translations were perfect and worked together toward the initiative that we wanted to put through the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member that a lot of work was done on this bill prior to this. There were three years of consultations. It pretty much follows through with everything the previous government did for 13 years, and that was talk with no action. This is about action. This government, after looking at the results, got action. I am proud to be part of a government that actually gets results. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After only nine months of working on this particular bill, it went through the House, the standing committee and the Senate and here it is today, 12 months later, ready to be passed. I am hoping members of the Liberal Party, and all members of the opposition parties, will support us in that initiative.</div>

The parliamentary secretary began to thank the previous government for its initiatives in this regard. In that spirit it is important to acknowledge that the bill deserves support if for no other reason than it is but a small portion of its predecessor, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, as the parliamentary secretary indicated, was an initiative of the former Liberal administration. I will say a few more words about that in a moment. That bill, which was very comprehensive, strategic, forward looking and proactive in its nature, has now been reduced to something a little bit smaller and has a very specific role. I want to compliment all of those members of Parliament who worked on the House committee, especially the members on this side of the House from my party, including the previous critic for the role they fulfilled so admirably. We in this party are going to support the bill. I will explain the details in a moment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was especially struck by the chronology of events the parliamentary secretary thought were significant enough to warrant 10 minutes of parliamentary time. I want to digress for a moment from the courteous diplomacy and positive demeanour I have just indicated and become a little bit more harsh.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In harshness I would say that some people in the morning must get awfully tired of putting salve on all their nicks after shaving as they look at themselves in the mirror and puff themselves up. I do not think the Conservative government can claim it has done something very positive when it spent 13 months during the previous administration trying to tear down a bill that was much more comprehensive than this one and then say that they did something in nine months and it is great news and that none of the members of the other opposition parties in the House ever did anything for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Liberal Party devoted all of their time to ensuring that the bill would pass. It was part of a comprehensive, strategic, proactive forward looking piece of legislation that came out of government policies when the previous Liberal administration was in power. Why did they do that? This cannot be puffery on the part of the Liberals. We do not engage in that sort of thing. We deal with realities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A> had an interest in this and always made sure that that interest was focused on his party rather than on the government that was doing its job. That member's party was not looking at the things that we in the government at the time felt were absolutely crucial and important: one, security and two, economic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not mean to switch the two, but obviously in a post 9/11 environment, security issues from political and terrorism points of view were extremely important. They were also important from an infrastructure point of view. The government of the day through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, the predecessor to this bill, said that we must pay very special attention to the means and mechanisms by which the Government of Canada would assume the responsibilities for ensuring that there be a safe and secure environment from a political perspective, one that would be coordinated very closely, but not subordinate to, the interests of homeland security defence in the United States. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were establishing a period of cooperation to ensure that our borders would be safe; safe politically, safe for the purposes of maintaining our sovereignty, safe for the purposes of maintaining our economic viability and durability. We proposed a bill and the opposition parties of the day, one of which is currently the government, objected to it every step of the way. That bill focused on putting in a place all the mechanisms necessary to provide the security to keep Canadians safe and assured that their country would be beyond attack, and that the mechanisms for response in the event of any kind of action would be readily available and quickly dispatched.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That security is not just political. We cannot conjure up images of people with grenades, missiles, et cetera, at our borders in all instances. No, part of the security, as we know, is economic.</div>

We need to make sure that that $1 billion a day of business is maintained in its security. We need to ensure that the crossing points between our country and our neighbours to the south are always maintained in a fashion that the people of Canada can be assured that their business, their commercial relationship with the United States and the interests of all the businesses that generate activity are always within the reach of the powers of the Government of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the difficulties? I note that the government member did not mention any of them. They have to do with building and maintaining an infrastructure, as I am sure the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A> will indicate in his presentation, to ensure the free and quick movement of truck traffic now, but also rail traffic across our two boundaries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government of the day had already begun a series of initiatives that were designed to move that commerce quickly to give substance to that just in time economic theory, to ensure that all goods would traverse the border points without undue delay. It is not only people that cross the border but also the goods that provide us with the lifeblood of day to day work environments. We wanted to ensure that all investments made by companies on this side of the border because of the advantages that the Canadian environment provides, would always reach their market in a timely fashion, but to do it with due consideration for the environmental strategies of our country, of the Liberal government of the day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these issues that appear to be, if I can judge the parliamentary secretary's 10-minute rendition of chronology, the government's priorities, i.e., one detail after another, do not strike at the heart of what it is that causes legislation to be tabled. It is strategic, as I said. It is always about being proactive. There has to be a purpose to government. There has to be a purpose to the importance of the jurisdiction of the federal government in this affair. That affair is security and economy. It is engendering greater economic interest in the areas being served by the targets of this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary said that there are 14 border points, tunnels and bridges, in Ontario where the bulk of that trade takes place. Were something to have happened at any of those places, the economy of southern Ontario in particular but not exclusively would be in grave danger. We were moving to ensure that would not happen. He said there were another nine in New Brunswick and one in Quebec, almost as an afterthought.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225">(1225)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand why there would be an afterthought, because for the Conservatives it was of little interest. When we were trying to promote this legislation two years ago, the obstructionism from what is now the government side was palpable. They had no interest in it: why have that bill pass? Today, the Conservatives want to take credit for the fact that we are going to support it, as I said, in its reduced form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would love to have much more, because at the time we were putting substance behind our thoughts. We were putting reality behind the political rhetoric that the government of today likes to think is a matter of substance. There was a $300 million infrastructure program specifically addressing the issues in southern Ontario. There were more in other places, including Quebec and New Brunswick, with those other 10 points, the points of contact. For us, there was a material need to ensure that people engaged locally, regionally, provincially and nationally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not come as a surprise to anybody on that side of the House, whether in government or opposition, to know that we on this side will support this bill. The bill retains some of the strategic components that we put into Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It retains, even if in a reduced fashion, the understanding that we must have a macro view to economic survivability. It thinks in terms of, as I said, a proactive role for the Government of Canada. By grouping into one all of those pieces of legislation that governed each and every one of those points through various parliamentary acts, it recognizes that the federal Government of Canada has the responsibility to coordinate all of those issues that ensure the viability of our security, our sovereignty and our economy so that we will have one repository of responsibility and action. With that repository of responsibility and action comes as well an incumbent accountability to be able to say that we have to plan for tomorrow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a lot of people who thought that perhaps we should not get involved because, as the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A> indicated, there is a private owner. People in the NDP do not like private enterprise and said that was bad and that these people were holding us to ransom. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Our response of the day, the fact of the matter, which has now been put into this bill even though nobody wants to give credit to the minister of transport or the former Liberal government and the Liberal government as a whole, is that what we do is safeguard the role of that private owner as we safeguard the maintenance and the management of all of the border crossings, but now the Government of Canada can exercise its authority to ensure that no harm comes to the Canadian economy or the Canadian people, its authority to be proactive and to direct that certain things be done in the public interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a pretty strong thing for the Government of Canada or any government to do. I imagine the current government has accepted that principle because, faced with having a minority government, it cannot control, except by subterfuge. It must do what has to be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at this because we are talking about security. In the last several days, we have been deluged with issues relating to CATSA and to the way the government is dealing with security issues with the agencies that have been established to ensure that Canadians can sleep well at night in the knowledge that all of those agencies--and the government--that are to take control or care of security issues are functioning properly.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230">(1230)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government loses a most valuable member of the board, General Baril, the chairman of the board of CATSA, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority. We do not know why, except that it is reported that he no longer has the energy or the will to address all the tasks and challenges that have emerged in this last year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we imagine? Because the chairman of that board disagreed with the government in trying to establish an appropriate modus operandi and to ask for the resources necessary to effect those tasks, he is gone. As for the very terse statement that he just did not have it any more, the Canadian public deserves a lot more. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of oversight and responsibility envisaged by the framers of the bill in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, its origin, demanded that the minister not only assume the responsibility but divest that responsibility in an open and transparent fashion, open to public criticism, good or bad. We do not see that now. The minister is not here to explain the relationship between him and his department and an organization that is absolutely crucial to air transport and travel in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to keep something in mind in the context of transport issues, especially since the Auditor General has filed a report that does not appear to be very favourable to the minister. We have to take it in the context of what the ambition, the focus or the goal of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> was initially. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was to ensure that the Minister of Transport be vested with the authorities necessary to ensure that the sovereignty, the security and the economic well-being of the country be handled expeditiously, with great dispatch, but with accountability, to ensure that it would be his responsibility by virtue of his mandate as minister. We do not see any of that in the actions of today, but we can say that at least with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> we now have the opportunity to give to the minister of the Crown responsible for those things the tools he or she needs--in this case he--to ensure that this begins to take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great responsibility. I am not sure that the government opposite is up to that task, but we are going to give it that responsibility because we believe in a parliamentary system that functions for the betterment of its people.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would that have done? It would have given the opportunity for border crossings to actually expand, twin or do what they want with no accountability.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the motion comes at a time when it is counter to the Detroit River international crossing study being done and the Windsor border corridor that was set up by the previous administration, the member's own government.

I do not know what he wants to accomplish other than to draw unto himself all of the credit for having reached this point, because he knows quite well that I was the minister responsible for Ontario when all of those studies were begun and when all of the infrastructure initiatives and solutions were being put in place by our government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows quite well that none of those studies to which he has made reference can take place without environmental assessments. In fact, the environmental assessments were cascading one over the other. What people were looking for was a way to bring everyone together for that specific issue, on both the American side and the Ontario side. No one wanted to take things away from those who had a legitimate right to them in the private sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What everybody was looking for at the time, and I believe that to be the case today as well, is the cooperation for one large national goal. We must keep in mind the fact that the Detroit-Windsor corridor is not a local issue alone. It is a very important national issue. It is, at the very least, a very central issue for the southern Ontario economy, and so the Government of Ontario, the municipal council of Windsor, regional councils in the area, Michigan, the governor, the City of Detroit and the Government of Canada were all engaged.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member knows quite well that there were some mechanisms put in place to move traffic much more quickly. That involved Customs and Excise Canada. He knows that it involved the homeland security department. He knows that it involved CBSA. He knows as well that Environment Canada was part and parcel of all of the assessments and deliberations as we went along. Never at any time was the Government of Canada of the day interested in curbing growth, investment and development in the context of an environmental, political and economic security environment.</div>

It was the interpretation of the motion at the committee by government officials and also by the clerk that such was the case, that there was a circumventing of the Environmental Assessment Act by that motion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we grant that, why would it be the Liberal Party's position that we would actually have the circumventing of its current programs that it has laid out for accountability? Why would the Liberals allow a twinning? Why would they allow non-consultation? Why would they, by a motion in that manner, allow somebody to run roughshod over an entire process that involves four levels of government?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what happened. That is what was proposed. That is what was on the table. I would like to know if that is the position of that party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important because this border crossing element has been complicated, difficult and problematic. Why is it that we still see the emergence of the private sector interest above the public interest? It is not just the private sector component that is affected, that being the Ambassador Bridge. It is the whole auto industry. It is the corridor and all the businesses that depend upon the border crossing, from the Windsor-Detroit region all the way to Montreal. All of them are affected because we have the highest fares by far compared to any other border crossing and that is because of the conditions we have right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the extra cost, the delays and the lack of accountability, why would the Liberals want to return to that type of agenda? Why was that motion tabled in the committee? Do they want to preserve the environment that is happening right now?</div>

I am actually surprised by the member's indication that economic partners in southern Ontario, including the auto workers and including what I think he said is the auto industry private sector, all of them, have an interest in what goes on at that border crossing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really surprising is that somebody from the NDP can speak with such a straight face on an issue like this, an issue that could have been resolved two years ago when we had all of the energies and synergies in place, with all of the levels of government on both sides of the border, the CAW, the auto industry, the trucking industry and the railway industry all determined to make sure that this border crossing was going to be efficient and effective. They had all the mechanisms in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the NDP members do? They decided they wanted to bring the government down so they could have instead, if we can believe it, a Conservative government, and now they are happy that we actually have something going. Good heavens. I am not sure whether these guys are talking about politics or economics, or what they live in; I guess it must be blue Kool-Aid now.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall the infamous project known as VIA Fast. Once again, I must take to task the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78957,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78957&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A> for not telling us that the Conservatives were against drafting the legislation that created VIA Rail and that would have given rise to the VIA Fast project for a high-speed train linking Montreal, Windsor and Quebec City. That was the aim and VIA Rail never hid that fact, nor did the Liberals. This is why the new Liberal Party critic, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78499,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78499&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Eglinton—Lawrence</A>, will represent the Liberals on the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. Naturally, I would like to acknowledge and say hello to him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, at that time, the Liberals were themselves divided. The minister at the time, Mr. Collenette, wanted to make a concerted effort and provide VIA Rail with a good opportunity to develop. However, not all Liberals agreed on the subject. It must therefore be understood that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>, before us here in the House today, constitutes just one small part of an interesting platform. This was backed by the Bloc Québécois, especially with respect to the new legislation that would have made VIA Rail Canada an independent corporation. Thus, VIA could have taken care of its future and development, and secured its own loans in order to ensure its development. VIA Rail was refused this by a group of Liberal members who were against it, who were divided.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that, at that time, there was a considerable division between the Chrétien camp and the Martin camp. Moreover, as we have seen, the Conservatives have presented no new legislation regarding VIA Rail, because they are very afraid of VIA's development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the Liberal Party critic talk to us about safety. That is fine. However, problems with safety do exist, as we have seen. It was mentioned that General Baril, Chairman of the Board of Directors of CATSA, is taking early retirement on this count.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains that there are some difficult situations. Some reports have indicated that there are security breaches at Trudeau airport in Quebec. Journalists have to play the role of politicians, to investigate and find flaws. However, in the meantime, the damage has been done insofar as the public is concerned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, VIA Rail was right to develop a market. However, it is wrong to believe that people who are afraid to fly because of television reports on airport security are going to eagerly buy airline tickets. They will use other means of transportation. The Bloc Québécois truly believed that the legislation to create VIA Rail should have been enacted and that this company would have had the opportunity to develop and to compete with airlines by providing Quebeckers and Canadians with another quick and efficient form of transportation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were not talking about high-speed trains, but of the VIAFast concept. For those who remember, this was a rapid rail service that could easily have served the Quebec City-Montreal-Windsor corridor, and perhaps even the Quebec City-Montreal-New York line. We could have opted for development of this service and provided Quebeckers and Canadians with a safe and rapid rail service which would not have taken anything away from the air system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make efforts to continue to ensure the safety of air transportation and strengthen this market. However, we must also provide other means of transportation considered to be just as safe or safer to those who wish to travel . That was the objective.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I find that what has been said does not line up with what took place.

Yes, he did mention that fact, but he did not say why.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives were dead set against new legislation that would have created VIA Rail. The Liberals were as well. The Liberal critic did not mention that Bill C-44, which his party had introduced, was never passed because many Liberal members were against legislation that would have created VIA Rail Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already said, there was a huge debate, a huge competition between the Martin and Chrétien camps. But Quebeckers and Canadians are the losers today, because no investment was made. VIA Rail was not given a chance to develop fully and provide faster, safer rail transportation in order to compete with air and road transportation. It would be a good way to encourage travel, to help the economy run properly and to allow people to do business more expeditiously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, there were internal debates among the Liberals and the Conservatives, who likely were keen to protect WestJet in western Canada. They were afraid that the airline would suffer serious financial difficulties, when it is actually in very good shape, and they knew it at the time. Quite simply, the Liberals and the Conservatives are digging in their heels, because their personal interests run counter to the public interest. That is what the Conservative government is doing, just as the Liberals did before it and are still doing today. Personal interests are taking priority over the public interest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can be sure that this is not true of the Bloc Québécois members. They are always prepared to defend the public interest. That is what we are doing in the case of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>. We will therefore vote in favour of Bill C-3, which is but a small portion of Bill C-44, even though, as I said earlier, we have only one bridge that will be subject to this legislation, the Sutton bridge. In the event there should be other bridges in future, we have volunteered to monitor the situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will review part of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>, which required some rather difficult and tough debates, because when the legislation was first introduced by the Liberals—and then reintroduced by the Conservatives—it included three major parts. Of course, the first part deals with the construction and alteration of bridges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be realized that these international bridges come under the responsibility of a number of bodies, both in the United States and in Canada, and may include provincial or municipal governments. Sometimes, private owners are also involved. In each case, individual agreements are reached for every one of these bridges. I can understand why some members who have such bridges in their ridings were really affected by the debates on this legislation. Indeed, we wanted, among other things, to ensure that those who have an interest in these bridges would be able to express their views.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, whether we were dealing with the construction, alteration, maintenance, security or safety of these bridges, provincial and municipal governments were included in the discussions. That was the purpose of the amendments that were made and that were supported by the Bloc Québécois. We want to allow the administrations, and all the stakeholders, which have to make decisions regarding these most important structures and which have to deal with these situations, to have a say. I believe that, ultimately, with the amendments proposed by the Senate, this objective will be achieved.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a case of being able to bring about change when making a decision. Indeed, the first sections that I referred to earlier, clauses 6 to 12, deal with construction and alteration of infrastructure. When alterations are to be made or construction is proposed, the Government of Canada must be informed. That was not the case previously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to understand that many of these bridges are very old and date back to the 1900s. Agreements were signed by private companies who were the owners. They signed contracts with different levels of government. These were separate agreements. I believe that at some point we have to be able to do things and to say to all those bridge administrators that there is now a law that transcends all those arrangements. In other words, regardless of the agreements signed in the past, the law now applies in the same way to everyone. I believe that idea was also well received by the witnesses who appeared before the committee and by the industry, with some minor changes or observations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plans for construction and alterations are therefore to be submitted. That is a request that will have to be enforced. Any time someone wants to make alterations to these structures or to build new ones, they have to contact the federal government and also discuss the matter with the provincial and municipal authorities concerned. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, in clause 13, <i>Maintenance and Repair</i>, through clause 16, <i>Operation and Use</i>, there is clearly a whole procedure dealing with operation. When work has been done and so forth, there is always a question about cost because many of these facilities collect a toll. Obviously, a whole structure of provisions has been incorporated into Bill C-3 to ensure that the federal government has something to say about the setting of prices. Moreover, a role was added for the provincial governments and municipalities because the places where these infrastructures are located should also have a voice in setting the charges and fees that are often related to the maintenance work that is carried out on these bridges. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third important issue is the matter of security. Obviously, the government must be able to establish certain standards of security. Since September 2001, we have recognized that safety and security are of the greatest importance. It was time therefore to include in the law an obligation for the administrators of these bridges to meet standards of safety and security. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that may have hit a snag in committee was the question of hazardous materials. In fact the government did not want to go any further in this bill with respect to hazardous materials because there is already legislation for the transportation of hazardous materials. Still, I wish to make the same observation I made to the committee, namely that we are prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt. It is true that there is legislation respecting hazardous materials, but it might have been important to include this aspect in this bill. We will see.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois is going to be keeping a very close eye on this bill and I am going to do the same thing. I am going to urge my colleagues in the House of Commons to bear this bill in mind when problems arise concerning the transportation of hazardous materials crossing these international bridges and going through these international tunnels. We could have gone further with this bill, pushed things and even clarified the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. We are told that there will be a future amendment to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and that we should not confuse things. In my opinion, though, always trying to go further and to see things more clearly does not confuse anything.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we were good losers. We rallied the majority who did not want to see this point in this bill or to discuss the whole section on the safety of transporting hazardous materials. I still think there will always be a safety and security problem and obviously giving carriers clear standards and guidelines suits us. This also goes for the operators these bridges so that there are some very significant security standards when the time comes to transport hazardous materials. This has to be clarified in all the bills having anything to do with transportation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill respecting international bridges and tunnels obviously affects the transportation of all products, people, goods and services, but also the transportation of hazardous materials.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may understand why the government did so, but I would say the stronger the better. We could have added to the bill all the standards to be met by operators regarding hazardous materials and taken the opportunity, every time transportation and safety came up, to subject all these people to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act and made things clear. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255">(1255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The title of the bill reads as follows: An act respecting international bridges and tunnels and making a consequential amendment to another Act. This other act created various administrations to manage the bridges. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is amended. When we passed an entire clause on the transportation of dangerous goods, we could very easily have amended the 1992 Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the officials at Transport Canada obviously did not see it this way. They managed to convince the other parties that the best approach was to deal with the transportation of dangerous goods in another act separate from the one on international bridges and tunnels. Apart from these small suggestions for our colleagues that we should closely follow the recommendations made by the operators of the international bridges and tunnels on the transportation of dangerous goods, the Bloc Québécois fully supports this bill. We are in favour of the amendments that were made. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to return now to what I said in my introduction. I want it to be very clear to the Quebeckers and Canadians listening to us that when it comes to Bill C-44, they should not pay any attention to the parliamentary secretary when he says that the bill tabled by the Liberal Party, that is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, died on the order paper. A bill often dies on the order paper because the parties do not all cooperate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> at the time, which was the original of today’s Bill C-3, died on the order paper, it was because the parties did not all cooperate in the House. I said it before and will say it again: the Conservative Party was against Bill C-44 for one single reason. Obviously, it was not because of all the clauses on bridges and tunnels because they agree now and tabled a bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, they introduced another bill on railway noise. They agreed with all of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> except for the part enacting the Via Rail Canada act that was the heart of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important part of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> was the act to create VIA Rail and give the company the support it needs to develop its service. It was as simple as that. VIA Rail would have been transformed from a Crown corporation to a private company. It would have been called VIA Rail Canada and would have been an independent company subject to the Canada Business Corporations Act. It would have managed its own development and created VIA Fast, a project supported by the Bloc Québécois. VIA Fast would have been a fast train linking Montreal to Windsor or Quebec City to Montreal, thus offering an alternative to air travel and developing a safe rail transport network.</div>

It died on the order paper. The Conservatives were against it and they did everything they could to make sure it did not go through. As for the Liberals, they were divided. Chrétien's camp was in favour, but those backing the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> were not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I congratulated the critic on his new portfolio in the Liberal shadow cabinet, but he did not mention Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>. I hope that he will be among those who support VIA Rail's development, not among those who oppose it. We will have opportunities to discuss this in future debates, debates that we hope will be marked by wisdom and transparency. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> is fine, but the Bloc Québécois is very disappointed that Bill C-44 died on the order paper because it would have brought into force legislation creating VIA Rail Canada, thus enabling VIA Rail to develop and introduce fast train service between Montreal and Windsor. Eventually, it would also have introduced a fast train between Quebec City and Montreal and Montreal and New York. <i></i></div>

    </p><a name="Para392191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite right. Investing in rail means in investing in the transportation of the future. We must also make sure that air transportation is secure. As I mentioned earlier, we went through that with Montreal-Trudeau. The airport had its share of security flaws. Reporters were able to go wherever they wanted, proving that evil doers could endanger travellers' lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has created some anxiety about air travel. Some Quebeckers and Canadians do not feel comfortable travelling by air.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ongoing investment in air transportation is needed for security reasons, but at the same time, we have to enable a secure, competitive means of mass transportation to develop. That is what the Conservatives and a segment of the Liberals did not want to do. They did not want to enable VIA Rail to develop transportation in the Quebec City-Montreal, Montreal-Windsor corridor more quickly. Once again, this clearly would have facilitated economic and tourism development, and with a more environmentally friendly means of transportation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bad decision by the Liberals at the time, the Liberals under the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, and the Conservatives are continuing to make the same bad decision. There has not been a bill to reopen discussion on the future of VIA Rail. Rest assured, knowing them, there will not be any bill on the matter. They do not want VIA Rail to be able to develop or compete with air transport or anything else. Let us be clear, it is not their personal interest or what they have invested in WestJet that is at stake. They have to rise above personal interest and ensure that the public, Quebeckers and Canadians, are able to choose a mode of transportation in a reasonable and safe manner.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rail transport is a very interesting solution that the Bloc Québécois supports. I want to thank my colleague for his question.</div>

However, the issue of VIA and a fast train along the Quebec-Windsor corridor is one that goes well beyond the last administration and, indeed, the previous one before that. It is one that was raised in 1989 by the then Conservative government of the day and it was abandoned almost immediately. It was not even willing to do the environmental assessment and feasibility studies associated with enhancing that train travel or any kind of upgrade of the terrain and of the rail itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague knows very well that about four years ago, during the Chrétien administration, there was a request by VIA Rail for additional funds to do the appropriate feasibility and environmental studies. Those were the ones being put forward and there was total agreement among Liberals to ensure that it took place. I especially thank him for having recognized that the Conservatives were so narrow-minded in their approach to transport issues and to political objectives in the House that they caused the collapse of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, which would have gone well beyond where we are going today. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he move away from his desire to reflect on past Liberal Parties and think in terms of going forward with a Dion environmental technological approach to the new transportation modes tomorrow? Would he be so kind as to reflect on that continuity and say that he would like to join that process? There is room over here, by the way, if he says yes.</div>

It is very important that we get some type of accountability. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what has been lacking on our 24 international bridges and tunnels that connect us to the United States. There has not been a standardized process to ensure safety, security, pricing, and a whole bunch of operational issues. That is why we want to see this bill pass in the House of Commons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the perfect bill. It is something that I tried to improve with a number of different motions. Some actually got through and some did not, but at the end of the day this is an opportunity to do something good for our commerce and our prosperity for the future. It is more than just the operations that we have to be concerned about. It is the investment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first want to outline the summary of the bill. It is important that people understand this context. It did not really come into the national perspective of the sensitivities and difficulties at border crossings until 9/11 in 2001 with the terrorist attacks and the shutting down of the border with the United States. We in Windsor, Ontario and many other jurisdictions across the country understood the infrastructure, operational and accountability deficiencies, but were unable to successfully penetrate it to a national level that would get it to the point where there would be action taken by any particular level of government. That was very important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that episode happened, new challenges began to emerge that became very important, not only to the people who lived around the immediate facilities of the border crossings but to those who live in an area that has four border crossings in total; who live along the 400 series highways, the Golden Horseshoe area; Montreal; British Columbia; and those who live in areas of border crossings right across the Prairies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of different challenges began to emerge, but when it came to international bridges and tunnels, there was no actual mandate for the federal government to have some type of accountability standards or procedures and to ensure there was oversight. That is very important because there are border crossings that are privately held. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the 24 are very unusual in the context of the overall infrastructure portfolio this country has, but they are very significant ones. Second to that, there was also no standardization for the other ones owned by the federal government, provinces and municipalities that had some type of vested stake in the actual border crossing. This brings a greater perspective for all of us in relation to this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary states:</div>
    </p><a name="Para392213"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This enactment establishes an approval mechanism for the construction, alteration and acquisition of international bridges and tunnels and provides for the regulation of their operation, maintenance and security.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para392214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is important to note. Looking at the titles of the different chapters, it is about interpretation and application for actual border crossings, construction and alteration, maintenance and repair, operation and use, security and safety, changes of ownership, and operational control. These are all things that are very important to how the border functions and operates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was discussing earlier, it is not just about the operator of the border crossing, whether it be a public or private entity. It is about the repercussions that are faced by the goods and services trade, people and vehicular flow across these border crossings into other regions. The less efficient they are, the less accountability that happens with regard to public safety and investment in infrastructure to ensure it is preserved in perpetuity, the less investment there is to actually expand and meet the challenges and, on top of that, the less there is to do with accountability about pricing, which is an actual trade barrier to our country being successful with the United States. Whether it be the tourism aspect, where people pay a higher price by going along a certain border corridor or transport trucks being charged far greater than what they should be, all of these affect our economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important to note about that is that in the auto industry and other types of industries these are significant costs. At the border, for example, in Windsor, Ontario an automobile can quite literally cross the border six times before it is completely finished. Between all the parts and different operations that are exchanged, the vehicle will cross the border to Michigan and return to Ontario multiple times. If there is a lack of investment, all of these additional costs will have a significant impact not only on our current infrastructure and economy but also on decision-making. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been involved in this since 1997 when I was a city councillor. We have been arguing for this investment as a way of showing Ontario and Quebec in particular that we could solve the border problem to ensure it was fast, safe and secure. This would enable goods to get to markets very quickly and it would be done in an accountable way. This would provide for possible plant expansions. I have heard from different corporations that they have withheld funding for plant expansions because of their concern about the border question. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have this problem in the Windsor-Detroit corridor despite all the rhetoric and all the bluster in many announcements. There is yet to be the political will to invest the capital to fix our current problems. We have not seen anything. It is important that we at least get the operational aspect under control. It is not sinister. It is not something one would think there would be problems with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that we have to deal with the most important border crossing between Windsor and Detroit which is owned and operated by a private American citizen. We have to ensure that Canada's interests are represented. We have to ensure the infrastructure is safe and sound. We have to ensure the infrastructure is going to have the proper operational supports so in times of emergency there can be an appropriate response. We have to ensure that the planning process will be done in conjunction with the community and the province and country at large.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the previous administration's lack of political will, the Windsor, Ontario area has become a literal battleground with respect to who wants to own and operate the next border crossing. People are receiving letters. TV commercials, airwave commercials, propaganda of all sorts is being received by people in the area from private proponents about why one proposal should be supported over the other. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous prime minister promised that this would impact positively on the quality of life of citizens in the area. We wanted the trucks off our city streets. We wanted to ensure a free flow of economic goods and services without the hazardous materials and the pollution flowing through our streets. We are still being confronted with congestion and safety issues on a regular basis. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would provide some remedies to these problems. There is actual incorporation. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A> and myself have been pushing hard for amendments to make the local municipality engaged on this issue. This is one of my concerns about the bill. It would give the minister greater influence. However, we could not allow no accountability whatsoever. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand right now we do not have any rights on private property where these privately owned and operated border crossings are located. Public crossings need consent. This is a problem. How can we assure the general public that proper procedures are being followed? How can we assure the general public that the necessary investment is being received?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ambassador Bridge in my riding has made millions of dollars over the years with respect to tolls. I do not have the official number but some of the estimates are $50 million to $60 million a year. This is significant. However, at the same time we have to ensure that investment will be made to the infrastructure at the end of the day for perpetuity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a definite problem because the toll rates at this particular operation are much more expensive than at other operations such as those at Sault Ste. Marie, Sarnia, the Blue Water area, and Niagara Falls. All of these areas have lower toll rates for passengers as well as for transport trucks. This has caused extra costs to be added to businesses, especially local and regional commerce, in order to compete. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industries in Ontario, for example, have been suffering significantly from manufacturing competition from the United States because it has invested in these types of facilities in order to maintain them and to keep and grow the jobs. Canada has not been as aggressive. Beyond this is the issue of other developing countries which have really had a profound impact on the actual manufacturing base of our economy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really important is that we are demonstrating, and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> does this to a certain degree, that we are actually going to rein in some of the issues about the border. The second step to this which is very important and something I could not get through the bill but I believe is so important, especially for the Windsor economic region as well as the rest of Ontario and the Montreal area, is that in the Windsor corridor we need to get a border authority developed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border authority is something that New Democrats have been pushing for that area for a long time. Sarnia has one, Sault Ste. Marie has one, Fort Erie has one and Niagara Falls has one. Everywhere around the region are these border authorities. They are binational organizations that have representatives from different government agencies as well as the communities that provide solutions and ongoing contact about how to manage the border. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at our most important corridor, being Windsor-Detroit where we have 42% of the nation's trade, we have an issue. We have a rail tunnel that is privately held. We have a city tunnel for vehicle traffic and transport trucks that is owned by the City of Windsor on the Canadian side which we just got back after many years. It is paying a profit back to the people and has lower fares and will do so in the future. The Detroit side of it is owned by the City of Detroit and outleased to Macquarie North American, a private infrastructure leasing agreement that was decided upon. The Ambassador Bridge is privately owned by an American citizen. We have the ferry system which is also owned by a private American citizen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have four different border crossings and there is absolutely no coordination whatsoever from an overall perspective. When we have issues develop, such as the unilateral action by the United States with the new bio-terrorism act that requires more standards and more procedures to be followed by commerce and particularly in goods and services from agriculture. That is particularly important for the County of Essex and Chatham and Kent as we have a big greenhouse industry that actually produces a lot of different vegetables that go to the United States market. If they are delayed there are additional costs which causes problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not only the effect of that legislation with the extra cost being introduced but second to that are new procedures for the physical infrastructure at the border and the processing that needs to be done. Therefore, we need a border authority to help coordinate and advocate for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in the Niagara Region when the NEXUS program was introduced and the American customs officials on the other side of the border were opening every single trunk. For those who do not know what NEXUS is, one goes through a pre-clearance inspection. Persons are validated on who they are and agree to certain terms and conditions so they can traverse across the border more quickly than if they go through the regular channels. There are limitations on what they can bring and what they can bring back but it is a bonded agreement between the person and the department of homeland security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole point of that is to move vehicles quicker. In the Niagara Falls area they were opening every single trunk which was basically defeating the whole point of NEXUS, after people had gone through all the screening. It has a commission that can advocate for the changing of that practice. That is what happened in that region which was very successful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Windsor and Essex County area we need the same type of body to deal with legislation coming forth in the United States in terms of lobbying. The bio-terrorism act is a classic example. The then Minister of International Trade found out about it, did not bother to tell anyone, and later on the Canadian Trucking Association found out about it two weeks later with the general public and it caused quite a bit of havoc.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that we are going to present a common front together especially when legislation like that is not even warranted. I do not want to get into the details of that legislation, but it is one classic example of the challenges that we face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that we tried to get into the bill which was very important for the areas that are affected by the border is a community investment fund. We have seen significant problems with backups and environmental degradation. In the Windsor <i>Star</i> today, our home town paper, a study is reported that came out of California which shows that if persons live along an area with traffic congestion within a 500 metre radius, they are more likely to have different types of diseases and can contract problems related to health, be it heart and stroke or a series of different problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had wanted an investment fund on the environment so that the local communities would be able to actually extract remedies for their areas on the environment.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the big battles that is going on right now through the new process that we have on the border in Windsor and Essex County, the DRIC process. It is binational. The American federal and state governments and the provincial and federal governments on our side are trying to come up with a plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environmental degradation of a new border crossing and where it would go is a big issue. The New Democrats want some type of investment fund so that local leaders, advocates and municipalities could cope with the problems on the border. That would give people who live with those types of problems hope and an opportunity to participate in the betterment of their communities. On top of that, it would improve our image on the borders between Windsor and Detroit and all across Canada because everyone would be entitled to this type of support structure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also wanted to enshrine an open process for the border competition regarding what was going to happen in the future in terms of ownership and new crossings. That was very important to us but we were not be able to pass that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope no other community goes through this, but as I mentioned earlier, a ground war is going on in my community. The Ambassador Bridge is pushing ahead its particular proposal and the Detroit River Tunnel Partnership wants to ram a rail tunnel through an area. It has been a divide and conquer situation, basically spending a lot of money and requesting basically a public subsidy at the end of the day for their operations to move ahead with their particular proposal despite there being a planned process in place. We wanted to see that move to a more transparent level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been calling on the government for public ownership of the next border crossing, similar to the one that is being built on the east coast, but there has not been a commitment. There have been many studies and evidence that public border crossings actually have lower fares. The most recent study was by Citigroup in the United States. It looked at the public benefit of corporation owned versus privately owned border crossings. It looked at interest rates, equity, corporate income and sales tax and compared the advantages of each different sector. It found that privately owned infrastructure facilities usually require toll rates that are 35% to 40% higher.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives me great concern that if we do not have the same commitment for the next Windsor-Detroit region border crossing to be publicly owned and operated, we would then add another cost factor into that infrastructure that would affect the viability of commerce going between our two nations. Once again, there is approximately $1 billion a day in trade through this corridor. If we were to add on another layer of cost it would certainly be a net detractor from further investment in Ontario and other areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make sure that the toll rates are low and relatively stable. More important, like many other publicly owned and operated crossings, we want to make sure that the money actually goes back into the management and operation of the facility and also toward future expansion and community issues. The Peace Bridge in Fort Erie has done a series of work for the community around it to help offset the impact on having the border there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also wanted more protocols regarding hazardous materials and procedures to be implemented for bridges and tunnels. Unfortunately that motion was defeated. There is enough evidence to warrant that we are not doing the best job we could on this. The government's logic was that this could be moved to the hazardous materials act. I am hoping it has a great interest in doing that. The government said that was going to move that forward quickly in this session and I would expect it to do so. I wanted it in this bill because we have a series of regulations that will involve those types of operations. People need to understand the significance of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States a number of municipalities have worked to ban the transportation of certain gas materials and hazardous materials through their regions. Cleveland has done that. It could be anything, such as chlorine gas that could cause quite a bit of a difficulty. It is a safety issue for thousands of people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wrap up by saying that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2162139,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2162139&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> is just the start of the real accountability that is needed at our border crossings. It will improve things. It is not a perfect bill but it is necessary at least for the public safety and security of all bridges and tunnels in our great land.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for everybody who is watching the debate to understand that everybody should want political security, security against terrorism, economic security as well and to understand its complexity, and environmental security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I gather, his concept of environmental security is to accelerate the time it takes for a truck to go through a particular border crossing without due consideration for the quantum of emissions that would spew from such a vehicle so that it is spread someplace else and not in any one specific place. He has not taken into consideration what we had already planned to do and which he agreed was a good thing but not good enough to support the government of the day so that now he bemoans the fact that now there is actually a government that is inimical to those issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he will find some way to turn himself into a pretzel and say, “We are going to support the government forever and a day because at the very least we were able to get something piecemeal, even though it is not anything coincident with our party's environmental policy, does not coincide with our party's economic policy, and really does not involve the local political process because we really did not want it. We wanted to involve the people directly. Finally, it would allow us to compete, maybe, because we really do not think competition is a good thing unless it is driven by the government itself. It will allow us to compete with some of the other border crossings at Fort Erie, Niagara Falls and Blue Water”. I am not sure what he wants. Maybe he could take a couple of minutes and explain it to us and it will be typical NDP--</div>

There are issues that we have to deal with. Our primary responsibility as members of Parliament is to make sure the public interest is protected not just in terms of commerce that flows, but also in terms of the safety of individuals especially at borders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a number of different security measures being introduced. In Windsor as well as other areas in Canada, we have seen the introduction of Black Hawk helicopters, drone planes and river gunboats at border crossings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a border crossing facility is owned by a private American citizen we have to be accountable to our own citizens to make sure that the border crossing is inspected properly, invested in properly and is run for the benefit of not only individual Canadians crossing there but also the businesses that we represent. That should be the primary interest of any infrastructure that we have connecting ourselves and the commerce that is so important for the vitality of Ontario and other regions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this bill at least is a start. I am concerned about certain aspects of it just like other things in the legislature here, but it at least provides a level of accountability. We will be waiting to see what type of regulations the government comes up with and how quickly it does that. We certainly want to make sure that problems are avoided. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent one I noted was the concern of the municipality as well as an aboriginal population that there was disruption of work on that piece of property which was on traditional lands. They are asking for some accountability. We are asking for specific things to provide Canadians with the necessary safety and security which they deserve.</div>

I will repeat a couple of those points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in the Windsor-Essex county area, the legislation is crucial in terms of the need to have this for a lot of the time that has gone by. Issues that we have confronted at the local community level badly needed to be confronted at the national level but were not because we did not have the legislative infrastructure, which the bill will go partially toward addressing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to set in context the impact that the trade agreements have had not only on communities like Windsor and Essex country, but on the country as a whole in terms of the huge increase in truck traffic in particular and visitors, with passenger vehicles going back and forth across our borders not only in the Windsor area, although it is clearly by far the busiest one in the country, but in other places as well, such as the Montreal area and the Seattle, Washington to Vancouver area on the Pacific coast. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use some examples of how significant it is, if we go back 20, 25 years before the trade agreements, on average 2,000 to 3,000 trucks would cross our borders in the Windsor area on a daily basis. That figure now, and there is some dispute between the people who follow it, is at least 11,000 a day. There are certainly days, particularly in the summer months, that figure will go up over 13,000 a day. Those are just trucks. Passenger cars are in addition to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused horrendous problems from an environmental standpoint in the corridor that runs from the Trans-Canada Highway, the 401 in Ontario, through to the Detroit, Michigan side. It has caused a great deal of safety concerns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, referring to our local newspaper, an article this week talked about a lawsuit settlement to a women who was killed by truck traffic as she was trying to cross. She left a young family. We have had a large number of accidents, so it is both an environmental and a personal safety issue for us in our community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have been identified, those conditions have continued for at least a decade, if not more like 15 years. With the trade agreement, we knew the impact in terms of that increased traffic. We heard my colleague, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A>, say that just within the auto sector, because of the trade that goes on and the parts that move back and forth across the border, one part may cross the border five or six times before it is actually put into a motor vehicle. That traffic is a constant problem for our communities. It has spilled over into the streets of Windsor. It is not just the main thoroughfares, but our side streets, our residential streets, as well. It is a huge problem, one that has existed for quite some time. It has not been addressed anywhere near satisfactorily to the city council of Windsor, to the county council and to the residents of our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we think about it, both our major tunnel and our major bridge were built just before the depression. They were finished in the late 1920s, early 1930s. We have had them all that time. We could say the same thing about a number of other crossings across the country. There are 24 international crossings between Canada and the United States: 14 in Ontario, 9 in New Brunswick and 1 in Quebec. Of those 24, only five of them are owned directly by the federal government through Crown corporations. For the other ones we would pass, on an ad hoc basis, legislation that would authorize the construction of that crossing, not a satisfactory mechanism to provide controlled regulation of those crossings.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That became quite clear to the United States, and we followed a somewhat similar pattern in its history. A good number of years ago it went to national legislation, so it had that infrastructure. Even to this day we do no have that, but hopefully this legislation will go through in the next few days, on to the Senate for final confirmation and then go into force. It is a totally unsatisfactory situation, so it is quite important that the legislation go through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I refer some of the points that my friend, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A>, made. This is not the be all and the end all. It will address some of the issues we have confronted in the Windsor area, as we have dealt with the proposals to construct a new crossing between Canada and the state of Michigan. It will go some distance I think, and I am hopeful, to addressing the major concerns that not only the automobile industry in particular has but also commercial interests generally have with regard to the problems we are experiencing at our border crossings in moving product in a speedy, efficient manner. That has been a major problem for us since 9/11 and it continues to be a major problem for us. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who are in leadership positions in our communities know that there is almost a freeze on investment, particularly in the auto sector, in our communities right now, waiting to see if there is the political will to address the problems and correct them. The major way we will do that is to construct a new crossing and do so in a brief period of time given all the issues that surround the problems of building a crossing that is internationally run, in dealing with four different levels of government on both sides of the border.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will indicate that the federal Government of Canada is serious about addressing some of the issues. Hopefully we will see additional legislation or policies at the very least come forward to address some of the other issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the roles of the federal government is to provide its country and citizenry, including commercial interests, with a secure working environment. We do not have that in our area at the present time. As I have already said, there are issues from environmental, personal safety and commercial standpoints that are not being adequately addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great fear in the Windsor-Essex County area of the political will on the Canadian side of the border to build an additional crossing. The process is underway. It is ongoing. It seems to be very slow. To some degree, this type of legislation answers the question of whether we are serious about addressing these problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a few minutes to talk about what is not addressed, in particular the role that the local community needs to play in the management regulation of border crossings. From some of the incidents that have taken place since we began discussing a new crossing some seven or eight years ago, we know about the perspective of the provincial government and the federal government and how significant it is to have local input and decision making to some degree on how a new crossing will be determined, constructed and then operated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude has been overwhelmingly one of arrogance on the part of upper levels of government toward local municipal councillors and mayor, one of “we know best”, in spite of all, let us say, the negligent decision making that has gone on. For instance, in the 1950s we decided we would stop the cross-Canada highway on the outskirts of the city of Windsor and would run some 10 or 12 kilometres to the international crossing through city streets. That decision was made by upper levels of government. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350">(1350)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can repeat many times that kind of ignorance and that kind of lack of vision in decisions that were made. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our community, it has always been a band-aid approach, a piecemeal approach, as opposed to looking at it as being the most significant crossing in our country by far. Thirty per cent to thirty-five per cent of all trade between Canada and the United States goes through the Windsor-Detroit border crossing. It is still being treated as if it is a backwater. This attitude still exists to a significant degree both here in Ottawa and in Queen's Park in Toronto. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation to some degree says this attitude is no longer satisfactory. It goes a long way in recognizing how significant these crossings are, not just in the Windsor area but in areas right across the country, and doing something about them. A significant change in attitude has to occur. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recognize the significance on the local community of these crossings, we need to have a local border authority. We heard from my colleague that we have them elsewhere such as in Sarnia, which is some 50 miles away, and in Niagara, Sault Ste. Marie and further. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my perspective, this is not just a question of the nuts and bolts of how vehicles are moved over the crossing, although that is certainly very significant. This is also about national security. I know from talking to our local police, fire service personnel, our emergency personnel and some of our intelligence services at the border crossings, that the lack of coordination is appalling. It is a level of negligence that is simply not acceptable in light of 9/11 and in light of our responsibility to provide protection and security to our populace. The border authority would go some distance toward providing coordination.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a hard time communicating between ourselves and the security services on the U.S. side of the border. This is not only our fault; it is also their fault to some degree. However, we are moving ahead. If in fact we are serious, then we go with the border authority. We have to provide our local law enforcement community with some real authority to deal with these issues. The border authority would deal with a number of crossing issues such as getting vehicles across in an efficient way as well as dealing with security issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would liked to have seen how much it costs to cross the border at the present time and how much it will cost in the future. We may still see this to some degree in the regulations. There is a dramatic difference in fees between some of our crossings just between the major motor vehicle tunnel and the bridge. When we compare these fees elsewhere in the province, there does not seem to be any logical pattern as to why some tolls are higher than others. This issue needs to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to see either policy or outright legislation requiring the upper levels of government to provide local communities with specified funds to, in effect, mitigate the impact on new border crossings in particular and existing ones as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our community suffers major environmental consequences as a result of the number of trucks going through it because the trucks are left idling and are not efficient as they move across the border. An idling truck will increase the amount of pollutants in the air by as much as 80%. This condition is being imposed on my community, on the city and the county. It is causing health problems across the populace. It could be corrected by the proper infrastructure, both physical and from a policy standpoint.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Windsor West made the point about what we see occurring on the U.S. side of the border. I am not at all suggesting that we mimic that but we need to be in a position, from an administrative standpoint, where we have the infrastructure in place to say that this is proper and that this is the way we should proceed.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joni's roots are deep in Saskatchewan, but her career has taken her to the very peak of the music world. From the folk sound of the 1960s, she evolved into one of the most influential artists of the 1970s and beyond. Songs like <i>Woodstock</i>, <i> Big Yellow Taxi</i> and <i>Help Me</i> captured a place and time and have become the soundtrack for an era.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continues to perform, but this past weekend she was honoured for her songwriting. Thousands of groups and individuals, old and new, perform Joni Mitchell songs, including Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Judy Collins, and Sarah McLachlan, to mention just a few. Joni's is truly a living legacy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all very proud of this music icon from the Prairies who has enriched the cultural fabric of the nation. I ask all members to join me in celebrating the achievements of this outstanding Canadian artist.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbé Pierre nurtured a warm relationship with Quebec. In 1995, he received the Ordre national du Québec for his work and devotion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Pierre Foglia wrote last Tuesday, "Abbé Pierre was the last in a long line of good people who indignantly refused to accept poverty. ... Now that Abbé Pierre is gone, all we have left are good people. ... Without a sense of indignation, we become accustomed to doing good works instead of working for social justice." I would add that we need more prophets like him who are not afraid to be indignant and who work to achieve justice and equality for all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392363"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to unpaid taxes on corporate profits transferred to foreign jurisdictions with lower rates of taxation:  (<i>a</i>) how many investigations are currently active; (<i>b</i>) what is the current estimated value of recoverable taxes; (<i>c</i>) what is the current cost per day to the government of monitoring and pursuing the full recovery of these taxes; and (<i>d</i>) what is the total amount of tax recovered from corporations in this regard in each of the past five fiscal years?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Carol Skelton (Minister of National Revenue, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para392585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, has included the following contextual information to provide a framework for its response to the honourable member’s question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is part of a global trade and financial system.  Countries compete to attract investors and trade partners, and this competition extends to tax systems.  Countries offer tax concessions and favourable tax rates to all or some industries/investors.  Some of these competing countries are tax havens.  Every country has the right to structure its tax system to meet its needs and these are issues of tax policy for each country, not for tax administrations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents of Canada must report and pay tax on their worldwide income.  The CRA has no view on where Canadian businesses or individuals invest so long as they report their income and pay taxes as required under Canada’s tax laws.  The CRA’s concern lies with the abusive use of tax havens; i.e., when taxpayers use bank secrecy laws, or the absence of effective exchange of information with other countries, to conceal assets and income that should be taxed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abusive use of tax havens is an element of what is known as “aggressive tax planning”.  Aggressive tax planning consists of transactions that offend the object and spirit of the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, or of treaties.  As part of the strategy to combat aggressive tax planning, the CRA established 11 “centres of expertise” across the country in 2005-2006, and created teams of experts from the specialized audit areas of international tax and tax avoidance to, among other things, combat aggressive tax planning and the inappropriate use of tax havens and tax shelters, both domestic and international.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) In the context mentioned above and at any given time, the CRA has a number of active audit cases of corporations whose business transactions include offshore jurisdictions (though not necessarily lower rate jurisdictions and/or tax havens).  As of the end of November 2006, there were 305 such audits underway.   (Please note that the CRA uses the term “investigations” to describe suspected cases of criminal tax fraud, whereas “audits” are carried out to ensure compliance with tax laws.)</div>
    </p><a name="Para392590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) In this context, the CRA refers to “additional taxes assessed” rather than “recoverable taxes”.  The value of additional taxes assessed is only known when audits are completed.  In 2005-2006, the CRA assessed additional taxes of $174 million directly related to aggressive international tax planning and, in the first six months of 2006 2007, the CRA assessed additional taxes of $215 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) As the number of audits, auditors, and the amount of time spent each day on any specific file can vary at any given time, the CRA does not monitor the cost per day of carrying out its compliance activities.  Rather, the CRA captures the total audit time on a file.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) While the CRA does capture information on the component parts of additional tax assessed for each completed audit, it does not aggregate each of the components across all 300,000 plus compliance actions each year.  The CRA does report additional tax assessed in total and for each of its programs such as large business and GST/HST audits in its annual report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the 2005 federal budget allowed for specific funding for the aggressive international tax planning program.  In 2005-2006, the CRA began tracking results related to aggressive international tax planning separately.  Statistics are not available for years prior to 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005-2006, the CRA assessed additional taxes of $174 million directly related to aggressive international tax planning and, in the first six months of 2006 2007, the CRA assessed additional taxes of $215 million.</div>

    <center><b>Question No. 116--</b></center><b>Mr. Robert Bouchard</b>:<a name="Para392595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the use of CF-18s:     (<i>a</i>) what are the international training standards for the CF-18s used in Canada for training on firing ranges; (<i>b</i>) what benefits could CFB Valcartier offer with regard to the international standards for CF-18 training; and (<i>c</i>) regarding the exemption granted in 2005 to allow some air-to-ground missions to be carried out at the Valcartier firing range for the CF-18s from CFB Bagotville, what are the restrictions pertaining to this exemption?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Gordon O'Connor (Minister of National Defence, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para392596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the response is as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para392597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	CF-18 aircrew use the North Atlantic Treaty Organization training standards to qualify air personnel in air-to-ground delivery of weapons on firing ranges.  These standards are based on North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allied Command Europe Force Standards Volume 3, Annex A to Chapter 2, which describes weapons employment standards for weapons in the CF-18 munitions inventory declared to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	CFB Valcartier is used for air-to-ground training by the CF-18 aircrew based at CFB Bagotville, Quebec.  Access to the range allows the aircrew to train in order to be able to meet the internationally recognized North Atlantic Treaty Organization training standard adopted by Canada.  Although the range at CFB Valcartier is one of a number available for required training, it is considered extremely valuable because it is the only range within flying distance of CFB Bagotville, where a number of CF-18s are stationed.  Without access to the CFB Valcartier range, CFB Bagotville CF-18s would have to deploy from their main operating base, an expensive proposition in terms of time and financial resources.  </div>
    </p><a name="Para392599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	The exemption highlights different safety standards of the army and air force at CFB Valcartier due to different training needs.  The CFB Valcartier air weapons range is safe for bombing exercises, and that is why it was issued an exemption.  Under the existing waiver, the air weapons range at CFB Valcartier is authorized for strafe, rockets, and single release of Mk-80 series bombs, both live and inert.  There are also a series of risk mitigation actions for the use of live weapons, including restricting access to the range and currency requirements for the aircrew.  Additional restrictions, to increase safety at the range, include the following:</div>
    </p><a name="Para392600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	The secondary tower is unmanned during live bomb deliveries;</div>
    </p><a name="Para392601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Only essential personnel are allowed into the master tower for all missions;</div>
    </p><a name="Para392602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	Visual confirmation by the range safety officer, RSO, that the aircraft is lined up properly must be achieved prior to the aircraft arming its delivery system; and</div>
    </p><a name="Para392603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.	In order to develop range familiarity, each pilot must practice inert bomb deliveries prior to a live drop.

    <center><b>Question No. 117--</b></center><b>Hon. Larry Bagnell</b>:<a name="Para392604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the purchase of high frequency, surface wave radar systems to monitor off-shore activity in the Canadian North: (<i>a</i>) did the Department of National Defence cancel this purchase and, if so, was it curtailed (i) because of funding cuts, (ii) because the Department is looking for new frequency bands so that these monitoring systems can be implemented, (iii) because of other reasons; (<i>b</i>) how soon can these systems be implemented and the cancellation of this purchase rescinded; and (<i>c</i>) what role will these systems play in relation to existing monitoring and surveillance systems in Canada’s Arctic as well as the preservation of our Arctic sovereignty?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Gordon O'Connor (Minister of National Defence, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para392605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, there was never any intent to establish northern sites with the high frequency surface wave radar, HFSWR, network project.  The sites under consideration for the network project as outlined in the statement of work in June 2004 included: Flagstaff Point, Nfld.; New Harbour Head, N.S.; Hartlen Point, N.S.; Estevan Point, B.C.; and Topknot Point, B.C.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The high frequency surface wave radar network project was cancelled by the Government of Canada primarily because the Department of National Defence was unable to secure unrestricted operational use of the technology due to commitments under an international agreement on the use of the radio frequency spectrum.  This added significant and unacceptable risk to the project.  </div>
    </p><a name="Para392607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of the high frequency surface wave radar hinges on evolving the technology from its current state to one that not only meets the operational requirement, but that also satisfies Canada's obligation under international agreements.  As research and development was not the stated goal of the high frequency surface wave radar network project, the project, as it was originally conceived, was cancelled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) As discussed above, the current technology will not be considered for implementation, due to obligations under an international agreement on the use of radio frequencies.    </div>
    </p><a name="Para392609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) There is no body of evidence that indicates high frequency surface wave radar technology provides capability in the northern environment.  The technology was developed on the east coast of Canada, and was developed to accommodate the environmental, ionospheric and geographic conditions of Atlantic Canada.  While it is scientifically reasonable to assume that this technology would function reasonably well on the Pacific coast, there is no such assurance that this could be applied in the north, given that high frequency surface radar technology would be impacted by the significantly different operating conditions in the Arctic. For this reason, northern sites were never considered for the HFSWR network project.  </div>

    </p><b>Hon. Monte Solberg (Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para392611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, with respect to programs and spending administered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, within the riding of New Westminster-Coquitlam:</div>
    </p><a name="Para392612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social housing: CMHC currently administers 342 co-operative housing units which provide housing for singles and families. These co-ops receive annual subsidies of $518,383. Under program design, there is no CMHC funding specifically earmarked for maintenance. Co-operatives set housing charges at levels sufficient to cover project operating costs including maintenance expenses and the provision of an allocation to a capital repair reserve fund. The funding provided by CMHC is used to offset or reduce these project operating costs and/or to subsidize housing charges for households in need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, CMHC provided funding to another 967 units in the riding of New Westminster-Coquitlam, committed under various programs, which provides housing for singles and families. Of this total, there are 552 units benefiting from a preferential interest rate and some of these units are also benefiting from a forgivable capital contribution grant equivalent to 10% of the original project cost. The remaining 415 units are currently receiving annual funding of $902,637. On June 19, 2006 CMHC signed a social housing agreement, SHA, with the province of British Columbia. CMHC annual funding contained in the Canada-B.C. SHA is currently some $140 million. British Columbia also received this year a one-time lump sum amount of $24 million for risks associated with future inflation, changes in interest rates and loan losses.  The administration of these units was transferred to the province on January 15, 2007.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be additional units receiving on-going federal assistance under various federal-provincial programs already administered by the province of British Columbia which are not included in the above. The province has the lead role for these units and does not report subsidies by project to CMHC. For the first nine months of the year the Province had claimed federal funding of some $75 million on these programs, covering some 27,000 units across the province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovation programs: On December 19, 2006, the Government of Canada announced a $256 million, two-year extension of the housing renovation and adaptation programs, effective April 1, 2007. The funding will help improve the quality of housing for an additional 38,000 low-income households in all regions of Canada. For 2006-2007, British Columbia’s allocation for these housing renovation programs is approximately $16.2 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under federal renovation programs in the riding of New Westminster-Coquitlam, some $218,870 has been committed for 23 units between January 1, 2006 and December 20, 2006. CMHC is unable to provide a forecast of how many units and dollars will be committed in 2007, since this will depend on the number of applications approved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affordable housing initiative/Canada-B.C. affordable housing program agreement: Under the $1 billion affordable housing initiative, AHI, over $130 million has been allocated to British Columbia.  As of September 30, 2006, 4,404 affordable housing units had been committed or announced, representing federal funding of $126.6 million. The province of British Columbia and others are matching federal AHI investments.  </div>
    </p><a name="Para392618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia Housing, B.C. Housing, administers the Canada--British-Columbia affordable housing program agreement. According to information provided by B.C. Housing, there have not been any commitments under this program in the riding of New Westminster-Coquitlam in 2006. B.C. Housing is not required to provide forecasts of units planned by riding to CMHC, but it does report on projects approved during the year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing trusts: The 2006 budget provides for a one time investment of $1.4 billion towards helping Canadians find safe, adequate and affordable housing in all provinces and territories. This investment is being made through three housing trusts with provinces and territories to invest in affordable housing. This includes an affordable housing trust of $800 million, a northern housing trust of $300 million and a trust for off reserve aboriginal housing of $300 million.  Funding for these housing trusts, which was confirmed on September 25, 2006, will be allocated over three years.  B.C.'s share of this funding is $156.9 million.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was remiss in not noting in my opening comments the very hard work that my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A> did on this legislation and the whole issue of border crossings, tunnels, bridges and other methodology. I did not point out the specifics of his work with regard to pressuring the government for amendments to take into account our responsibility at the federal level and the role that the municipal governments and local authorities have with regard to border crossing issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to convince the House that it would be appropriate given the proper set of circumstances that the federal government, in particular the minister responsible for the legislation, would consult. I praise him for his success in having amendments made to clauses 7 and 15 of the bill so that local communities and municipal governments in particular would have the opportunity to consult with the minister on issues around construction and operation of border crossings in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discovered just how important that was when we began dealing with the idea, which is all it was at that point, of having a new crossing in our community in order to deal with the congestion and related problems. It was amazing how difficult it was to get any serious attention from both upper levels of government for the local community. There seemed to be a willingness on the part of the federal government and the provincial government to throw away the concerns of the local community, especially with respect to the environment and safety. They seemed to procrastinate, indefinitely at times, on the commercial interests around speeding up the shipment of cargo and enhancing trade opportunities at our crossing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, these amendments did not go as far as we wanted them to go. We would have wanted a mandatory consultation process. However, it was as far as we could push the government and the official opposition on the issue. It is one of those we will experiment with over the next few years. If it is wanting, we will be back before the House proposing amendments to the legislation to bring into line the needs of our community at the local level vis-à-vis the issues that are encompassed by the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to address the regulations that are coming under the legislation and the need for government regulations to address the issue of the tolls, the fees that are charged at our border crossings. The variation in fees that are charged at various points across Canada is quite shocking. We feel this most particularly in the Windsor area because of the level of fees that are charged at the Ambassador Bridge, which is a privately owned consortium. It is privately managed. Before this legislation, there was very little ability on the part of the federal government to in any way control the operation of that bridge crossing. It has resulted in a huge variance in the fees that are charged for trucks and passenger vehicles as opposed to what is charged across the country. We will be watching as the regulations come down to see that the government addresses this issue. </div>

I am still pleased that they are prepared to compliment the previous government's action in this regard but I do want to set some of the record straight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much praise is being given for the authority being provided to the minister to consult. The previous government did not need the authority to consult; it actually did it. The member opposite knows quite well that the mayor of the city, every member on the regional council, the member himself and the other member of Parliament for the Windsor area had the opportunity to speak with the minister responsible for the Canada Border Services Agency, the transport minister, the minister responsible for the area, the minister responsible for the environment and the people working with the binational panel on both sides of the border.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to get at is that we had a formula in place to take into consideration all of the interests in the area, including the interests of the aboriginal communities and all private citizens. All those opportunities were taken advantage of by those seriously interested in the development of the economic potential of those border crossings, of the economic directions of the industries related in that area and as far away as Montreal as indicated earlier, those in the trucking industry, the auto industry and the service industry. All of them were always brought to the table. There is nothing new here. What is new is that now the minister has the obligation to do it whereas before we were doing it because we believed in good government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the NDP not support the government of the day? Earlier I heard someone say they did not have the numbers so they could not have had an impact on the government of the day. Because the government of the day did not have the numbers and could not keep the government in place, the NDP decided to support the other side because with them they could have the numbers and defeat the government. The member delayed the opportunity to do something for his own community a year and a half ago. The member should be ashamed.</div>

One, I am definitely not ashamed. Two, I would ask the member, a former minister of the Liberal government, to stop whining in the House. It is really getting sickening. It was not the NDP, it was not the Bloc, it was not the Conservatives who threw his party out of power. It was the people of Canada who threw his party out of power because of his party's corruption and incompetence. I could go down the list. It really is revolting the amount of whining that goes on in the House by the Liberal Party on that issue. It is time that the Liberals focused on what really happened.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was listening to the member I could not help but think of George Orwell's <i>1984</i>. The member is rewriting history from his own perspective and his own desire of what he thought he would like to have seen go on. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him and the House that the consultation process, so-called by the former government, around this issue with the city of Windsor and the county of Essex was almost totally meaningless. Whenever there was any discussion, it was ignored by the Liberal government. I will use one example. At one point the Liberal government dumped on the municipal council of the city of Windsor what was called a nine point plan. It was supposed to be the solution. It was a joke. It had been repudiated by council long before it was ever presented formally, point by point. They said it could not be done for this reason or for that reason, but they went ahead, both the provincial government in Queen's Park and the federal government. That is one example. That was repeated over and over again. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that this legislation will have some mandatory consultation available to the minister is definitely an improvement, but it does not in any way reflect the quality of what occurred under the former Liberal administration. The Liberals did not consult in any meaningful way with the community that I come from.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very outset, I want to begin by thanking the opposition parties for their support for the legislation. I think it enjoys broad support because it really does strengthen both the Canada pension plan, through improvements to allow people to get their disability pension, and old age security, through improvements so people will automatically receive guaranteed income supplement as their income rises and falls. I will say more to that in just a moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of a larger agenda the government has to affirm our support for the Canada pension plan, old age security and the guaranteed income supplement. These are extraordinarily important parts of Canada's social safety net. Even more to the point, they really do in a way show our government's commitment to seniors and our determination to ensure we do everything we possibly can to stand up for Canadian seniors who have done so much to build our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no exaggeration to say that because of the efforts of those who have gone before us we stand today in this great chamber. This country is built on a tradition of supporting human rights and democracy and ensuring we do everything we can so all Canadians get a fair shake, that they get an opportunity. For those people who, for whatever reason, can no longer participate in the labour force, they will still enjoy some support from the government and will have a decent standard of living.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think fair-minded members on all sides of the House understand the importance of those kinds of social programs, and that is certainly true of the new government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> as well. In fact, the Prime Minister has gone to some lengths to underline his support for seniors by appointing a new secretary of state for seniors, Senator Marjorie LeBreton. I am thrilled to be working with her as she works with seniors, listens to their concerns and finds ways to support the programs that serve them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we get into the actual amendments, it is important to point out just how important these programs are. The Canada pension plan today serves three million Canadians. It is one of the cornerstones of our social programming for seniors. The old age security goes to four million Canadians. The guaranteed income supplement goes to 1.5 million low income seniors, who are mostly women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada pension plan and old age security pays out $50 billion a year. GIS pays out $6.2 billion a year. We understand, as Canada's new government, how important those programs are. We want to build on those programs, make them better and make them stronger so we have them today and in the future. In fact, as I speak of the future, I need to point out that we are facing some big challenges as we go forward today. Roughly 12% of Canadians are seniors. In 25 years those numbers will double. It is very important that we have strong and sustainable social programs going forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of the amendments today are twofold. We want to modernize and streamline how benefits are delivered, and that really brings me to the first amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment has to do with changing the rules surrounding old age security so when seniors apply for it, they will only ever have to apply once in their life and at the same time will automatically receive the guaranteed income supplement if their income warrants it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will change the rules so in the future we will take tax information from peoples' tax forms and use that to help us determine who should get guaranteed income supplement.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it works this way. If seniors are a recipient of the guaranteed income supplement and all of a sudden their income rises, making them ineligible for guaranteed income supplement in the following year, they will then have to reapply the year after to qualify if their income falls again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes, supported by my friends in the opposition, will end that, and that is important. Seniors have more important things to do than spend a lot of time filling out paperwork to reapply. In some cases the sad fact is that people do not reapply and do not receive benefits for which they are eligible. These changes will largely end that. It will mean that seniors will automatically requalify should their income fall below that threshold according to their tax information. This is extraordinarily important. This really modernizes an important piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government acknowledges as well that not everyone fills out a tax form every year. We will continue to do the outreach we are vigorously doing today to ensure that seniors are aware of these programs and that they understand how they work so if they do qualify and have not filled out a tax form, they can still get the guaranteed income supplement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment that is very important has to do with the disability portion of Canada pension plan. As we know, the Canada pension plan, through the disability portion, provides thousands and thousands of disabled Canadians with an income supplement, which is critical for them to manage and maintain a lifestyle. The changes that we are proposing in the legislation will make it easier for disabled Canadians to qualify for Canada pension plan disability. As the rule stands today, we have to be contributors for four of the last six years we pay into CPP before our disability makes us unemployable and takes us out of the labour force. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose to change that from four years to three years. We project this will bring another 3,700 people into eligibility for Canada pension plan disability by the year of 2010, plus another 1,000 of their children, according to the data we have at present. This will ensure that more people, who cannot qualify because they have been knocked out of the workforce early by their conditions, will now be able to receive this important disability pension. This is a very important step. It demonstrates that Canada's new government is committed to helping people with disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago I was in Vancouver where I sought a meeting with Rick Hansen, who is a well known advocate on behalf of disabled Canadians. He was first made famous as the “Man in Motion” when he travelled the world in his wheelchair to draw attention to the devastating impact of spinal injuries. He has since established a foundation and has become a tremendous spokesman and an inspiration for people around the world on issues of disability. He is doing a tremendous job of drawing attention to these issues. He gave me great insight into the challenges that people in the disabled community face, and we will use those to help us guide our government as we move forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who represents the community of Medicine Hat, which has twice as many seniors as the national average, I understand the challenges that seniors face. I think all members understand that and appreciate the contributions that the seniors who have gone before us have made. Many of today's seniors are people who have gone through the Great Depression, the second world war, Korea and the social unrest of the 1960s. They have seen and done a lot of things. They have raised families. In many cases they have gone without so their families could have a higher standard of living and a chance to have an education. We really do owe them a great debt of gratitude.</div>

That along with some of the other steps we have taken to raise the age credit, to allow pension income splitting, to cut the GST are all indications of how important we see the role of seniors in society today. We want to recognize them with this important legislation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank members on all sides for their support of the legislation. I commend the legislation to the House and trust that it will pass quickly so we can deliver these important changes to seniors and to the disabled as soon as possible.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when the Reform Party's environment critic said that global warming was a myth. I remember its agriculture critic saying that marketing boards were not a good system for the markets and that we needed to get rid of marketing boards. Those two things have now changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remember hearing that particular minister, when he was the finance critic for the Reform Party, talking about the Canada pension plan and how it needed to be radically changed or eliminated and maybe let the people use the money they invest in the Canada pension plan in a private RRSP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I hear the minister, on his road to Damascus, saying that the Canada pension plan is a very important vehicle for seniors. I congratulate him for that because he is absolutely correct.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year Statistics Canada made an error in calculating the certain percentage of CPP compared to OAS. Many people have been asking whether the government will correct that error and allow the certain percentage of CPP-OAS contributions to increase more than the 0.5% they have received, in fact the 1.5% to the 2% that they have been asking for, which is the correct Statistics Canada figure.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However this government has moved in other ways to ensure that seniors are allowed to keep more of their income. One of the most important changes and one that sometimes people do not consider to be part of social programming is the cut to the GST. Approximately 30% of Canadians who do not pay income tax benefit by the cut in the GST, and that certainly applies to seniors. It goes some distance to helping them cope with the everyday difficulties of making ends meet. That is only one of a number of initiatives that this new government has undertaken, but we are doing what we can to ensure that seniors enjoy a better standard of living.</div>

Seniors and Canadians with disabilities are some of the most engaged citizens we have in this country. I look forward to working with them and to ensuring the solutions they have been working on for a long time will be presented to the government. In my experience as chair of the subcommittee on persons with disabilities, I hope this can be a non-partisan issue in which we do the most we can for our most vulnerable Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is shown by the combination of the bill presented today, the issues around full citizenship, the ability to contribute and the issue around income security are things shared both by seniors and persons with disabilities. It will be extraordinarily important for us to understand the complexity of this and the need for the government, the provinces and the territories to work together. I think all of us who have worked in this area know that one of the real problems has been the gridlock involved in the fact that income security and human rights can be seen as a federal issue, but the supports and services are very much provincial and territorial. It becomes a real problem if we cannot work across government departments and across jurisdictions to do what the people who need us most know needs to be done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada pension plan is the basis of Canada's retirement income system. As the minister has said, there were many irritants and difficulties in the administration of that. We are grateful to the minister for bringing in these changes that will make the application of these benefits much simpler. As we know, it provides the retirement pension, disability benefits, benefits for survivors, children's benefits and a death benefit. As the minister alluded to, in 2005-06, four million people received benefits totalling $25 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Liberal Party is the party of income security. Lester Pearson and Paul Martin Senior brought in the CPP program in the first place. It was the policies of Prime Minister Chrétien and the former finance minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, that stabilized the pension funds and guaranteed a secure public pension system for the next 75 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that we mention the issue of guaranteed income supplement, old age security and the retirement benefits under the Canada and Quebec pension plans which provide our senior citizens with monthly taxable benefits. For seniors without other income, the amounts received from these programs are, unfortunately, very modest. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guaranteed income supplement was first introduced by the Liberal government under Lester Pearson in 1967 to help improve living standards for lower income seniors. The GIS is a monthly benefit paid to residents of Canada who receive full or partial OAS pensions and who have little or no other income. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see the proposal to waive the requirement for a renewal application for the GIS once an initial application has been made. Many seniors forget to reapply for their GIS or are late in their reapplication which results in a decrease in income for the following year. Administrative process should not be an obstacle to deserved benefits and I am glad to see that the government has recognized that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to state that the Liberal government increased the guaranteed income supplement for seniors by $36 per month for single seniors and $58 per month for couples. This was a $2.7 billion investment that directly benefited 1.6 billion Canadian seniors. Unfortunately, as all parties in this House have recognized, there are many difficulties in ensuring that all seniors who qualify for GIS apply for it and receive it. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555">(1555)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many seniors fail to apply for GIS because they have no taxable income or they have health problems, mental or physical limitations, or literacy and language barriers. In fact, estimates by policy analyst, Richard Shillington, in 2001, with the help of Susan Pigott at St. Christopher House in Toronto, suggested that 320,000 eligible Canadians were not receiving the GIS and associated spousal and widow's allowances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the last Liberal government there was a fantastic partnership between Human Resource Development Canada and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency which helped provincial organizations and grassroots volunteers to educate seniors about the GIS. There is no point having a program that seniors do not know they can access. It is the responsibility of governments to ensure everyone entitled to a program gets what they are entitled to, which means serious efforts must be made for outreach and education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the government will undertake a similar initiative to ensure that seniors are knowledgeable about the supports available to them. Failing to reach low income elderly people with funds that can make the difference between comfort and privation is a serious concern.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1997, the Canada pension plan was restructured to respond to the growing needs of an aging population, to ensure its viability and to stabilize contribution rates. Experts said that, as a result of those changes, the CPP would be viable for at least another 75 years. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para392765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a family doctor, I can testify as to how important the changes are in this bill in terms of the flexibility in the Canada pension plan disability. It is a huge deal to someone who has become slightly disabled and whose attachment to the workforce has become less regular. The difference between qualifying with three out of the past six years as opposed to the previous four out of the past six years is huge to so many Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal record on income security is clear. Although I am supportive of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, we must hold the government to account on this issue.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para392767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Canadian retirement income system is to work, it is essential that everyone contribute as much as he or she can for as long as he or she wants to or can. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, when it is time to rely on the community, everyone will be confident that he or she will be considered and treated with respect and dignity; and each person will have a real sense of belonging. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That means that we have to avoid bureaucratic nightmares. Canadians must be able to receive what they are entitled to without a lot of administrative red tape. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para392770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side are supportive of all of the proposed amendments: the simplification of access to and delivery of benefits of the OAS, the ongoing renewal, the agreements to co-administer similar provincial benefits to simplify the reporting of income for couples and seniors and the OAS-consistent benefit entitlements, the OAS clarity of legislation and the proposed amendments to the Canada pension plan, both the full funding and the CPP tri-annual review, the long term contributors Canada pension plan disability, and the CPP business transformation amendment, the administrative amendment as well as the proposed common OAS-CPP amendments. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, we know that both seniors and persons with disabilities are still fighting the major challenge of poverty. Income security programs must ensure that income is secure. It is extraordinarily important that when we are evaluating these income security programs we are always asking the question: does this Canadian feel that his or her income is secure and that he or she will be able to continue with his or her housing?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is really important that we continue to listen to fabulous organizations like the National Advisory Council on Aging and the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. These partnerships have been very important in setting the priorities from the bottom up and in listening to the Canadians who will be most affected by the policies. I believe the bill today shows that the government is listening, or at least is doing what we as a government have heard before. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With seniors the fastest growing age group in the country and the increase in their numbers in the last 10 years being enough to populate mid-sized Canadian cities, we have to understand that we also must look carefully at the disaggregated data in terms of where poverty exists. And the poverty exists for women.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is going to be extraordinarily important as we go forward to make sure that we continue to bring together these uncoordinated income based programs, according to the National Advisory Committee on Aging and its report, “Aging in poverty in Canada”. It is this multitude of uncoordinated federal, provincial and territorial income based programs that is a nightmare for our seniors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, my twinned riding was Calgary Centre. There, we can look at the Kerby Centre and how it began by having a kiosk that seniors could come to in order to find out what level of government handled each program. If we look at that centre, we can begin to see that if we create programs from the bottom up and listen to seniors, we can start to bring these things together, as I hope this bill begins to do today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the worst case scenario, sometimes the cumulative effect of additional income may well be a net loss of an income. Seniors with low incomes are trapped due to the disincentives mentioned. They are discouraged from earning additional income to make their lives more enjoyable, or indeed, they may no longer qualify for subsidized housing or for the additional benefit. I think it is extraordinarily important that we as governments and as Parliament understand that the devil is in the details and that the net losses or the incomes from our programs have very real people attached to them in terms of their stories and whether they are actually better off or worse off. It is extraordinarily important that we listen again to these people who know best and hear their priorities for action. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council on Aging has said that we must increase the GIS so that the combined GIS and OAS benefits are equal to or greater than the low income cut-off. We must correct the GIS shortcomings and decrease the number of late applicants and not unduly penalize them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, as we have said, improve the coordination of income based programs and ensure automatic or compulsory sharing of pension rights under the Canada pension plan, employee pension funds and retirement savings plans following divorce or legal separation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, our partnership with the Council of Canadians with Disabilities brings to our attention the fact that, with the aging of the population, people with disabilities make up a growing proportion of the Canadian population. One-third of aboriginal Canadians are living with a disability. Canadians with disabilities are more than twice as likely to live in poverty than other Canadians and they face exclusion from quality education, employment and participation in their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in combating poverty and exclusion is to ensure that people have access to disability related supports and services. This is something that we as parliamentarians and the federal government need to do in partnership with our provincial and territorial partners. This is just too complex for us to allow people to fall through the cracks and for us not to work together to understand that it is only in consultation with persons with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities that we are going to get this right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPP disability deals only with Canadians who had a previous attachment to the workforce. We learned in our subcommittee that to go forward we need to ask, first, if a person can work and, second, whether that person would be able to work with appropriate training or education. If the answer to both these questions is no, then the federal government needs to work together with the provinces and territories and find a secure income for these people. CPP disability was only ever designed as an adjunct and it is still only those who had a previous attachment to the workforce who qualify.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we go forward, I encourage the minister to look at the extremely important and extraordinarily good report of the Subcommittee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities from the 37th Parliament and see what we learned in our report entitled “Listening to Canadians”. There were eight recommendations. I hope the minister will look at those recommendations and will bring together the kind of flexibility that it is going to take to actually incorporate into our society persons with cyclical diseases like mental illness, HIV-AIDS and MS.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot more to do, because we have to work together on the quality of life of all Canadians, on their dignity and respect.

This bill is just one tiny step.</div>

That is because of this agreed upon partnership between the tax system and HRSD. I think that becomes a really important partnership, but I also think that in terms of the community we have come to understand that social isolation is as detrimental to Canadians' health as smoking, </div>
    </p><a name="Para392800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do whatever we can to get seniors participating in places like St. Christopher House or the Kerby Centre in Calgary, the places that have the supports and services. If we can get seniors connected in the community, not only is it good for their health, but it is good for their income in terms of how they then come to find out about these things they are properly entitled to. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is probably that two-way approach we need. One way would be to encourage all Canadians to file an income tax return, because they may be surprised and get something back. As well, we must really, throughout the country, try to do everything we can to give this sense of belonging that we know is extraordinarily important for peoples' health, particularly their mental health and well-being.</div>

In “Pensions In Canada: Policy Reform Because Women Matter” produced by Women Elders in Action in Vancouver in December 2004, it talks about the fact that first nations women who have lived a traditional rural life were especially vulnerable to economic hardship. The average annual income of an aboriginal woman is $13,300 compared to $19,350 for a non-aboriginal woman. As well, discrimination, childhood poverty and lower educational achievement exacerbate their already poor economic status into old age.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in part this bill deals with housekeeping, but again, first nations, Métis and Inuit women are largely absent from the discussion in terms of how they would access Canada pension, old age security and any kind of livable income.

One of the problems with the Canada pension plan is again the attachment to the workforce that is required and the fact that women's attachment to the workforce tends to be much shorter because of child bearing or whatever. Also, women who have stayed home to raise their children, including aboriginal women, end up having much less at the time of retirement and, as we have seen in some of the other studies, particularly if their spouse dies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many papers have looked at how we will ensure the income of women, whether with spouses, without spouses or whatever, and how we would go forward on this. Our responsibility to aboriginal people and aboriginal women in particular is clear. We are not there yet and it will only be in consultation with elders and aboriginal women that we will sort out a system that would work for them.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all I would like to say that I am very proud to transfer the file on seniors and persons with disabilities to my new colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105599,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105599&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Repentigny</A>, who I think will defend this file with as much enthusiasm, passion and determination as I did, and as all my colleagues of the Bloc Québécois who held the file before me have done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very important bill, which for us in the Bloc Québécois answers some of the requests that we have been making for many years and certain demands that we have concerning seniors, the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in our society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I have to say that there are still some shortcomings in this bill. As in all bills that interest us, we have done our homework. We have been in touch with the various seniors’ associations, the various organizations of seniors in Quebec and even some in Canada, to check with them and their representatives whether the bill was satisfactory in their view, if it met their needs, their concerns, and whether we could go ahead and support it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset, when we had the first information session, I was very pleased to see that finally this request made for so long concerning the guaranteed income supplement had been met, that is, that the supplement should become automatic, that people should have to apply for it only once and then it should become automatic. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the first day, I was ready to say yes, to support this bill, to fast-track it and pass it right away so that people could start receiving their income and money in time for Christmas, so that they would be pleased to see that the guaranteed income supplement had become automatic. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reminded myself that we should never be in too much of a hurry and that we have to be very careful, even if sometimes something looks like an excellent solution overall. Indeed the automatic GIS was the good news we had been waiting for for nearly ten years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, other aspects of this bill, which could harm seniors and might be negative for them, told us we had to be careful before giving our assent too quickly, because we wanted at all costs to be right concerning the guaranteed income supplement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shows once again that when the Bloc Québécois deals with an issue that affects Quebeckers and Canadians and a segment of society that is very vulnerable and fragile, it pays attention to what it is doing and the decisions it makes. We are very careful. I think it is worth it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We certainly support this bill in principle. It is hard to be against virtue itself. However, the hon. members will recall a few years ago my colleague Marcel Gagnon, who is no longer in the House, defending this cause with great determination and courage. He toured all of Quebec and even some parts of Canada. He defended the guaranteed income supplement and the need to find people to whom it was owed. We managed at the time to find about 40,000 of the 68,000 people there were in Quebec. We suspected that there were 68,000 people just in Quebec who were entitled to the GIS but were not getting it because they did not know it existed. We found 42,000 of them. This means that there are still 24,000, 25,000 or 26,000 who have not been found yet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is being done for these other people who have not been found yet for all sorts of reasons? They are people who never applied for the GIS because of a physical or mental health problem, a physical limitation, illiteracy or a linguistic barrier. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625">(1625)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some citizens were even deprived of considerable amounts of money and did not get the GIS even though they were entitled to it. The Department of Human Resources and Social Development apparently had difficulty contacting particularly disadvantaged clienteles such as people who have never worked outside the home, people who do not file income tax returns, natives, residents of remote communities, people with few literacy skills, people who do not read or speak either official language, people who are handicapped or ill, and finally, the homeless. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we think of all the people involved, we have to wonder whether this bill will give use the tools we need to contact them and give them the money they are owed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said earlier, we consulted various organizations and groups that work with seniors in Quebec. One of them, the Conférence des Tables régionales de concertation des aînés du Québec, took time to read the bill, study it and send us their thoughts on it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be remembered that this is a rather large association that includes most Quebec seniors, since it is made up of Quebec's 17 regional round tables. As we know, Quebec is divided into 17 regions. This is the only group that covers all of the Quebec territory. It also has a key link with the Quebec seniors council and helps it fulfill its mandate by supporting its initiatives in the regions. We also know that the conference and the round tables are the primary contacts of the Quebec Minister of Family, Seniors and Status of Women. This is important. When these people talk, or when they look at a bill, we listen very carefully to what they have to say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can already tell the House that, for a long time now, regional tables for seniors had been asking to group together applications for old age security and guaranteed income supplement, so that a single application would be necessary for those who are entitled to both amounts. This is what Bill C-36 purports to do, and we are very pleased about that. As for the changes to the disability insurance, we think that this insurance is well adjusted to today's labour market. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing either on the fact that interests can be collected on overpayments—which is normal—but the government should also pay interest on the money that it owes to pensioners, because this is also as it should be. If one wants to get something, one should be prepared to give something. This works both ways. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 25 make it possible for a larger number of third parties to have access to personal information on the contributor. This raises privacy issues and requires the establishment of strict rules to ensure a monitoring process, so that not everyone has access to such information. It is a good thing that the requirement for spouses or common law spouses to provide information on their income or family status was abolished, when that information is already provided by the other spouse or common law spouse. This will make it simpler to file income tax returns. However, there is no indication of the Canada pension plan, the old age security benefits or the guaranteed income supplement being indexed. It is also most unfortunate that there is no retroactive measure regarding the guaranteed income supplement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FADOQ is another seniors group in Quebec that serves hundreds of thousands of people, which is not a small gathering that can just be ignored. Hundreds of thousands of seniors belong to this group. Their concerns are the same, but we believe there may be room to make other changes to the Canada pension plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, they are saying that the measures proposed in Bill C-36 only concern the continued renewal of the guaranteed income supplement application and not the initial application for receiving the GIS for the first time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is not to reduce the number of seniors who are eligible for the guaranteed income supplement, but to reduce the number who do not receive it. However, in Canada in 2003, despite the progress made in the past few years, 37,000 seniors who were eligible for the guaranteed income supplement still had not received it. These uncollected benefits totalled $204 million in 2003, for all of Canada—$204 million! Since the guaranteed income supplement is used as an eligibility criterion for a number of other programs, non-participants also miss out on the benefits the provinces and territories give to low-income seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Laval we have 40,000 seniors 65 and older of whom 38% are over 75. That is a significant number. In other words, many people who are over 75 are likely entitled to the guaranteed income supplement. It is not always easy to find these people since they are not used to asking for services; they are used to taking care of themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is the fact that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> says nothing about the clawback of old age security benefits imposed since 1989 on high income seniors, whereby they have to give some back. With respect to those seniors who have already reported high incomes and seen their pension clawed back after filing their income tax returns, the federal government seems to take for granted that their income level will remain unchanged, and advance pension deductions are made the following year. This means that, while these seniors do receive a monthly pension, the amount received is reduced based on the previous year. Members know that the income of seniors often varies, which makes this practice unworkable. Some seniors have told us that such a measure was likely to deprive them of a part of their income to which they are entitled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, seniors who foresee significant changes in their income have to file pro forma tax returns with the Canada Revenue Agency. It might be simpler and more appropriate to have them report their income directly to the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, since that is the department responsible for administering the old age security program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 1990s, the FADOQ, Mouvement des aînés du Québec, has been calling for the OAS clawback rate to be lowered, as it reduces excessively the income of retirees who have managed to put a little money aside. The FADOQ even suggested increasing the threshold in personal income beyond which benefits may be clawed back through income tax.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all these shortcomings and oversights, the Bloc Québécois recognizes the very exciting measures contained in this bill. We will support the bill in principle, so that it can be referred to committee, where it can hopefully be amended to some extent to make it even more exciting for our seniors, who are for the most part disadvantaged people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that Bill<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> C-36</A> will make it easier for disadvantaged seniors to benefit from the guaranteed income program by allowing for automatic application renewal and payment of the guaranteed income supplement to couples on the basis of only one spouse's income tax return; given that Bill C-36 enables seniors who are faced with a sudden drop in their employment or pension income during the fiscal year to apply for the guaranteed income supplement using an estimate of their employment and pension income; given that Bill C-36 explains and clarifies sections of the Old Age Security Act to correct inconsistencies; and, finally, given that Bill C-36 makes changes to the Canada Pension Plan—which does not affect Quebec and its constitutional jurisdictions—we will support this bill in principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bloc Québécois is opposed to broadening restrictions on new Canadian citizens who immigrated to this country.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Bloc Québécois, there cannot be different classes of Canadian citizens, regardless of how they came to be here. Every citizen has access to the guaranteed income supplement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following clauses pose a problem by creating different classes of Canadian citizens: 11(4), 19(3), 19(6)(<i>d</i>)(ii), 20 and 21(9)(<i>c</i>)(ii), which refer to persons in respect of whom an undertaking by a sponsor is in effect as provided under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These clauses exclude new Canadian citizens who are still being sponsored.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee and the Bloc ask that the committee amend the bill so as not to limit the rights of new citizens, as referred to here. The obligations of the sponsor, who vouches for and looks after a person who has immigrated here, generally take effect as soon as the sponsored person obtains permanent resident status. This commitment cannot be terminated, and it remains in effect when the person obtains Canadian citizenship, separates or divorces, or a moves to another province. It would remain in effect even if your financial situation were to deteriorate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we allow ourselves to leave seniors destitute, simply because the person who was supposed to sponsor them has suffered a loss of income or has lost his or her job? Many textile factories are closing their doors because the government did not think to support the textile industry. Furthermore, many people will not have work in certain areas, such as at Bell Helicopter, because the government did not bother to confirm with the United States whether something could be done to ensure that people from various cultural communities could obtain the contracts offered by Bell Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other jobs are being lost in the wood products and forestry industries. People born outside of Canada often hold these jobs. These people often act as sponsors of another individual whom they have helped come here. Unfortunately, and through no fault of their own, they can no longer properly take care of the senior whom they have taken into their home.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we simply leave these people in need, in difficult situations, because the person hosting them is also having difficulties? In my opinion, we must pay attention and ensure that everyone who decides to live here has a decent minimum income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois also recommends that the committee examine the obligation to pay the full retroactivity. Last year in this Parliament, in 2005, we decided unanimously to reimburse individuals and give them full retroactivity. What has happened since then? A government, a new government, which had voted in favour of the motion of my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78704,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78704&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</A>, has now decided that it will not respect its commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking the government to pay the full retroactivity, or at least that the committee study the obligation to pay the full retroactivity and to not limit it to 11 months, as provided by law regarding the guaranteed income supplement and spouse's allowance. This policy would allow for retroactive payment covering the full period of eligibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will also ask that the Privacy Commissioner testify with regard to the broadening of the third-party group to which the contributor's personal information may be forwarded. We will also ensure that amendments to the current regulations will not restrict the scope of the guaranteed income supplement. We will continue our longstanding fight against the government to have it put in place all the elements required to ensure that seniors who qualify for the guaranteed income supplement have access to it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, too often when we talk about seniors, we talk about seniors in general, and very often we forget that, for the most part, seniors are women. That is because women have a much longer life expectancy than men. Yet, despite all the difficulties that women face it is hard to go into great detail on this subject. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stated earlier, 38% of seniors in my riding are over 75. That means that most of them have never asked for any kind of help. These people have always been self-reliant. They have always managed to get by and, unfortunately, today they find themselves in a difficult and deplorable situation. We do not have access to these people because, having never asked for help, they are not known to local health agencies and welfare groups, or to social workers. They do not know that they are entitled to help and that they have a right to GIS benefits. They are in dire straights because they are not aware of their rights. They do not know that if they had access to the guaranteed income supplement they might be able to eat better instead of spending their money on medication. They could perhaps decide to spend money on heating instead of having to wear layers of clothing because they do not have the necessary financial means to pay for housing, medication and food as well as for heating. Frequently, these people have to do without a telephone. Often they have no visitors because they have been predeceased by other family members. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not many years ago, when someone retired at 65, it was thought he or she would be around till age 75 or 76. They had put aside enough money for 10 years or so. Today, these people are 90 or 95. What they managed to save, often with great difficulty, has vanished. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest rates that banks pay are not very generous. Indeed, our banks are very stingy. In fact, interest rates have been reduced to 1%, 2%, or a generous 3%. As a result, these people have neither capital nor income. They do not know whom to turn to for their basic needs. It is essential that we do our utmost for— </div>

Our caucus will support the bill at second reading so that it can go to committee where we can move significant amendments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon I listened carefully to the minister's comments. Judging by the rhetoric, he would have Canadians believe that through this single piece of legislation, he has once and for all ensured that seniors no longer need to worry about their economic security in retirement. No one more than I do wishes that were true. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors across our country are profoundly and legitimately worried about their retirement incomes. They are worried about the solvency of their private pensions. They fret about the adequacy of both CPP and public income supports. They are keenly aware that the rate of inflation is higher for seniors than it is for other Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government's response to these very legitimate fears? It introduces a bill that is essentially just housekeeping in nature. It is administrative. It streamlines some services and application processes but it does nothing to redress the inadequate benefit levels of seniors' incomes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politicians on all sides of the House pay lip service to the fact that seniors built our country and that we owe it to them to ensure that they can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve, but in reality, through successive Liberal and Conservative governments, seniors are falling farther and farther behind. In my hometown of Hamilton, one-quarter of all seniors are living in poverty and senior women over the age of 75 have a poverty rate of 36%. Nationally, over one-quarter of a million seniors are living under the low income cut-off, or as we call it, living below the poverty line. In 2004 about one-third of seniors, most of whom were single women, had little other income and were dependent on OAS and GIS for an average annual income of just $12,400. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in poverty is hardly a retirement lived with dignity and respect. That is compounded by the fact that increases in the cost of living hits seniors disproportionately harder than any other segment of the population. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Statistics Canada determines the annual cost of living upon which adjustments are based, its basket of goods includes electronics like iPods, plasma TVs and computers, all goods which are coming down in price and reducing the cost of living figures. Frankly, those are also the goods which seniors are not buying. The items seniors are spending money on are essentials like heat, hydro, food and shelter, the increasing costs of which are all outpacing their incomes. What is the government doing to address that issue? Absolutely nothing, not in this bill and not in any other piece of legislation that the Conservatives have introduced in the House to date. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would like to remind members of the government of an issue that I raised with them in question period before the House rose in December. Statistics Canada has miscalculated the consumer price index since 2001. In response to my question, the then minister of human resources and social development acknowledged that this error meant seniors had been shortchanged for years in the increase to their CPP, OAS and GIS entitlements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is continuing to make seniors pay for its mistake. Admittedly, that mistake originally happened during the Liberals' 13 years in government, but expecting the Liberals to act responsibly with taxpayers' money is, as Justice Gomery reminded us, like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Conservatives started with a blank slate and they have now tabled Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, purportedly to deal precisely with CPP, OAS and GIS. Yet nowhere in the bill nor anywhere in the minister's comments does one find any reference to righting this wrong for retirees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have started a national petition campaign on this issue. I would encourage the millions of Canadians who I know are watching this afternoon to go to my website, download a copy of that petition and send it back to me, or they could write to me postage free here at the House of Commons and I will personally send them a copy to circulate among their friends. Surely in what may well be an election year the government will not be able to ignore the voices of millions of Canadian voters, but judging by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, the government will need to be pushed to do the right thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June I had the privilege of introducing on behalf of our caucus a motion in the House of Commons to create a seniors charter of rights. One of the enumerated rights in the charter is the right of all seniors to income security. To my surprise, the Conservative government supported my motion and the motion was passed by a vote of 231 to 52. However, the Conservatives have neither introduced nor supported a single legislative initiative in the seven months since the motion was passed to enact any of the rights the seniors charter guarantees.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need the government to do more than talk the talk. It is time that it walked the walk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the Conservatives have been disinclined to help seniors living in poverty. In the last federal budget, the one and only item that came even close to addressing the income of seniors was an increase to $2,000 in the pension tax credit. Who benefits from that tax credit? Not a single senior whose only income is CPP, OAS and GIS. The tax credit only applies to private pensions. The seniors who need the money the most get no help from their government at all, not a single red cent for the neediest in our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Conservatives increased the income tax rate in the lowest bracket from 15% to 15.5%, which means that many seniors are now getting $10 less on their monthly CPP cheques. They would have to spend $1,000 a month to recover that money from the much talked about 1% cut to the GST.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government reported a surplus of $13 billion in its last federal budget and yet it did not spend a dime on alleviating poverty for seniors. I ask that I be forgiven for not doing cartwheels over the administrative tinkering that is before us in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>. it simply represents a missed opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything of value in the bill at all? Yes, there is. For example, I welcome the fact that the government will finally waive the requirement for a renewal application for the GIS and allowance benefits after an initial application has been made. That change, of course, was long overdue. What about the 130,000 seniors who are eligible for the GIS but are not receiving it? Why not just eliminate the application process altogether so that every eligible senior will be getting what is rightfully theirs?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have proudly been working with the seniors and poverty working group in Hamilton which made it its mission last year to do the necessary outreach to ensure that seniors became aware of their public income entitlements and provided assistance to access them. It has been an absolute privilege to work with this dedicated group of community activists but it has also been an eye-opening experience to observe how community leaders who are already overworked have been forced to step up to the plate because the government has dropped the ball.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as seniors are not getting timely access to the GIS, so are many of them failing to apply for all of the benefits to which they are entitled under other income supports. CPP and OAS are the other two major programs that millions of aging Canadians rely on for income security in retirement. The same barriers exist for these programs as for the GIS. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot simply refer seniors to a website and assume they can navigate their way through the information highway. In-depth counselling is often a prerequisite to seniors learning about all of their entitlements and ensuring that they fill out their applications properly and in a timely manner. That job used to be performed by government specialists who worked for Services Canada. These were people like Irene Smith in Hamilton who contacted me and my colleague, the member for Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, last November to inform us that she and her small cadre of colleagues were no longer permitted to give specialized attention to individuals seeking in-depth pension counselling. Instead, her job description was rewritten to make her a generalist who deals with everything from boat licences to EI. This will lead to hundreds and potentially thousands of elderly Hamiltonians being unable to access all of the financial benefits to which they are entitled in a timely fashion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, restrictive clauses on retroactivity make it impossible to recover from early filing errors. These clauses too need to be changed but Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> offers absolutely no redress. Depriving seniors of what is rightfully theirs is hardly retirement lived with dignity and respect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we debate Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> here today, we need to ask ourselves who will ensure that current and future retirees will be made aware of their entitlements. Who will help them access what is rightfully theirs? Why is Bill C-36 silent on these crucial elements of implementation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to note that the bill would facilitate the application process for seniors who apply for income tested benefits and who have suffered a loss of income due to termination or reduction of employment or pension income by requiring that seniors report estimated pension and employment income only. However, who will be there to explain to them what that means? Who will explain to seniors when it might be advantageous for them to withdraw an OAS application where the pension has not yet been paid? I know that for some this will prove to be a positive change in the legislative framework but only if they are aware of how to access that permissive clause.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will explain the expanded restrictions on income tested benefits for immigrants subject to sponsorship agreements or does the minister hope that nobody will notice that part of the act?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors whose sole income support is OAS and GIS are hardly in a position to hire lawyers and accountants to figure it out for them. That is why the NDP's seniors charter included the creation of a seniors advocate, someone who would be dedicated to conducting public education and awareness initiatives on the rights of seniors. Without that, a right that cannot be accessed is, frankly, no right at all. However, we can bet that the government has already put plans in place to enforce the punitive provisions of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill strengthens the ability of the ministry to recover overpayments and interest where it has accrued, both with respect to OAS and CPP. We can bet our bottom dollar that those provisions have a staffing plan in place and yet why is there not even a mention of reimbursing pensioners with interest when an error of underpayment is made by the government? Seniors deserve better. Seniors have worked hard all their lives and have played by the rules but now that they need the system that their tax dollars helped to build, they are confronted by barriers to access.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government wants to be taken seriously with respect to its treatment of seniors, it needs to do more than talk the talk. It needs to walk the walk. It needs to live up to the commitment it made by voting for the seniors charter. It needs to ensure that seniors have timely access to all federal government services and programs. It also needs to ensure that seniors can rely on protected pensions and indexed public income supports that provide a reasonable state of economic welfare. Only then will seniors finally be able to retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised the alarming figure regarding the incidence of poverty among seniors in spite of genuine efforts in the last couple of decades to address and eradicate the embarrassingly high incidence of poverty among seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one mitigating factor that I would raise and ask her to comment on. In the first Conservatives' budget, they did not reduce taxes for low income seniors. They actually raised taxes to low income seniors in two ways. First, the lowest tax rate went from 15% to 15.5%, a seemingly small amount but significant when one is living hand to mouth. The second thing they did was to lower the basic personal exemption for everyone by $400 a year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person is collecting another pension from another source, which may have been offset by a break they gave to pensioners of $1,000, but if one's sole source of income is OAS and guaranteed income supplement and the basic personal exemption was reduced by $400, it means one is paying taxes on $400 more per year. When I work that out at 15.5% it amounts to about $62.50. That does not sound like much per year but that is $5 a month and, because it happened July 1, the Conservatives doubled it for the six months of the year, which makes it $10 a month. That is half of a week's groceries for a person living on GIS and OAS.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my comments earlier, they would need to spend $1,000 to recoup that money from the 1% GST cut that was also in the budget. They do not have $1,000 a month to spend. In fact, they are in very real danger, and many of them have, of losing their homes, not because they still have mortgage payments that they are confronting but because the their basic costs, such as property taxes, heat and hydro, have risen at a rate that has simply outpaced their incomes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a government that talks the talk about wanting to help seniors but in fact for the most vulnerable seniors in our country they are taking steps back every single day. What we need to do in the House, which we have called for it by putting a motion on the order paper, is to have a comprehensive review of the public income supports on which seniors rely so that they can be lifted out of poverty. Our seniors built this country and they now need this country to stand up for them and ensure they can live out their years of retirement with dignity and respect.</div>

Poverty among seniors is disproportionately large for women in our community. The reason for that is that many women were not in the workforce and therefore do not have CPP to supplement their OAS which would make them eligible for the GIS. It is one of the reasons that poverty is rampant and about one-third of seniors who are living in poverty are women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at policies such as these and legislation that we want to bring forward, we need to do a gender analysis. The reason members of the House supported my seniors charter last June was that it contained provisions to look at income security, to look at affordable housing and to put an advocate in place who could inform seniors of their rights. Those are things that would help senior women in our country tremendously. I would urge all members who voted for the motion to take their commitment seriously and to act on it. I ask them to not let their record on that one vote to be their record on senior's issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to give meaning to those rights and we need to ensure that seniors access their rights. If we do not do that then the charter will become meaningless.

However, all of us must remember and perhaps take a look at some historical facts. One of Canada's greatest achievements, and our hallmark, is its retirement income system for seniors. It is a program, as has been mentioned before, that has helped millions of seniors across Canada. I know that not only our party, the Liberal Party, but all other parties in the House have always promoted investments with and for our seniors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every previous Liberal government demonstrated this commitment by investing in our seniors and ensuring they would have the very best and lived their lives with dignity and respect. It was a previous Liberal government that implemented the old age security program, the Canada pension plan, the guaranteed income supplement and reinstated the new horizons program. It did this to ensure seniors would live with respect and dignity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government also wanted to ensure that seniors would have a voice at the cabinet table. This is why the former Liberal government appointed a minister of state for seniors. In 2005 it also announced the creation of a seniors secretariat to ensure there would be a focal point within the federal government for collaboration to address many of the issues highlighted here in the House today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1990s the Liberal government demonstrated its commitment towards seniors and ensured long term stability in the funding for Canada pension plan and old age security. Today, the Canada pension plan fund itself stands at over $100 billion and remains safe for many generations to come. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004 the Liberal government also increased the guaranteed income supplement by $2.7 billion over two years. This alone was the largest single increase that had ever been made since 1984. This increase directly benefited the many low income seniors, who we have mentioned here in the House today. It is due to the 13 years of Liberal government, its commitment and its investment in seniors that fewer Canadian seniors are now living in poverty. Public pension benefits such as the old age security, the guaranteed income supplement, the Canada pension retirement plan, survivor and death benefits have been vital components of Canada's retirement income system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's retirement income system has successfully and dramatically reduced the rate of low income seniors. Low income among Canada's seniors who are over the age of 65 has been reduced from 11% in 1993 to 5.6% in 2004. Even though this is a lower percentage, we all realize there are still many single seniors who live in urban areas and many seniors, who are single women, who still continue to face significant challenges. Due to the fact that many seniors continue to live on fixed low income, they are likely to remain in low income for an extended period of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the previous Liberal government increased the GIS benefits for low income seniors, it is imperative in moving forward that we, as parliamentarians in the House, continue to ensure we invest in Canada's retirement income system to ensure that the policies and programs the new government is creating will ensure that a greater number of seniors actually live their lives with dignity, with the resources and tools they need and to not live in poverty.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPP funds must be used for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is for future pension payments. With the economic update that was put forward in the House in the fall of 2006, the Conservative government actually set a goal to eliminate Canada's net debt by 2021. While on the surface this sounded like a great idea and a very laudable goal, the reality of it is that it is a very different picture. Canada's national debt currently stands at about $480 billion. In the past decade, again thanks to years of Liberal fiscal management, it has decreased dramatically from its record high of more than $560 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have pledged to pay down $3 billion per year on the national debt. However, a simple calculation shows us that at this rate the national debt will be eliminated by the year 2166. However, this is where the difference between the net debt and the national debt comes in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national debt is the amount of money that the Government of Canada actually owes to its creditors, mostly international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It is basically the equivalent of a national mortgage and the accumulation of all past deficits and surpluses. Net debt is a national debt and all the other liabilities held by government plus all of the national assets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single largest national asset that is held by the Canadian government is the Canada pension plan. It is currently at a value of more than $100 billion and by 2021 will reach a value in excess of $400 billion. At current trends in 2021, the nominal values of the national debt and the CPP fund will converge, essentially cancelling each other out since one is a negative and the other is a positive. This is what has allowed the Conservatives to announce their goal of elimination of the net debt by that particular year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is completely misleading and irresponsible to attach the CPP fund to the national debt. Implicitly, the government has announced that the CPP fund will be used as collateral for future borrowing when in fact we in the House all know that the CPP fund exists for one reason and one reason only, to pay future CPP benefit payments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net debt has been the accumulation of all assets and all liabilities. In making their pledge to eliminate the net debt, which incidentally did not contain anything new since paying down $3 billion per year on the national debt had already been booked well into the future by the previous Liberal government, the Conservatives have ignored one of the biggest liabilities that face the government, future CPP payments which continue to increase on a daily basis as our Canadian population increases and ages. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and the year 2030, the population is projected to grow to 38.6 million. By 2030, the median age, which is currently at 38, is also expected to increase to 44. During this period the proportion of retirees will also increase significantly from 13% to 23% or almost nine million people. Those 80 years or older will also significantly increase from the current 3% to 6% of the general population. This group represents one of the fastest growing segments of the population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, when we take a look at the statistics, there were 21 retirees for every 100 people of working age. By 2030, it is expected that this ratio will almost double to 41 retirees for every 100 persons of working age. These demographics and this research highlights the necessity for the government to be able to respond to the changing conditions and our aging population. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government must be committed to poverty reduction among seniors, single women seniors and our aboriginal seniors. Government must ensure that all seniors can maintain their standard of living in retirement. Public policy must be able to respond to the financial future pressure on the public pension system so that all seniors from all walks of life, not just high income seniors, are guaranteed a decent quality of life in their latter years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than 50% of seniors benefit from a private pension plan. Women are far more likely to depend on the old age security and the guaranteed income supplement as important sources for their income. Both of these programs together account for 32% of women's income versus a men's income.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the improvements the bill is going to make to ensure some efficiency, the government's policies have not helped Canada's seniors since the Conservatives have been in power. We need only look at the issue of income trusts. On October 31, 2006, the Conservative government broke its promise to Canadian seniors and actually started to tax income trusts, another promise broken by the Conservatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians throughout the country had invested their money based on this promise. I know that many of my own constituents, many seniors in my own constituency of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78612,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78612&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brampton—Springdale</A>, had invested their hard-earned life savings in income trusts. Many of them depended on and took the Conservatives at their word. On the day the decision to tax income trusts was announced, many constituents and many seniors across Canada lost their hard-earned savings. They were wiped out in a matter of moments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was ironic that when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> appointed Senator LeBreton Secretary of State for Seniors, she herself could not see the devastating impact that the decision on income trusts actually had on seniors and stated, “I have not seen any evidence that people have individually lost large sums of money”. This was absolutely no consolation to the thousands of seniors who lost their hard-earned savings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the same government that less than a year ago proposed to the provinces to put all future federal surpluses into the CPP account. This was widely shot down by many of the premiers, who did not want or were wary of any type of political interference in the fund, because they also believe that the CPP fund should be kept at arm's length from government and managed by the CPP Investment Board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that the principles behind the CPP account cannot be compromised. I know that many of my hon. colleagues in the House have spoken about increasing efficiency, about ensuring that the most vulnerable seniors who need access to the GIS, the guaranteed income supplement, actually have the opportunity to get access, but I think we must also ensure, moving forward, that we provide access to the many thousands of seniors across Canada for whom English or French is perhaps not their first language. We must be able to reach out to the cultural communities to ensure that they also have the opportunity to learn of the benefits and the resources available to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we will be supporting Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> today, I think it is imperative that we all work collectively in the House of Commons, as I believe ensuring the respect and dignity of our seniors is really a non-partisan issue. Many of the members of the House have put forward great initiatives, policies and program ideas. I hope that we all work together to ensure that our seniors have the very best.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors must not live in poverty any more. There must not be low income seniors. We must provide policies, programs and resources to ensure that they actually live outside of poverty and have the very best, that they live in an environment of dignity and respect.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague was not here then, but we remember it very well. Statistically, most of the public service pensioners are women and their average income is $9,000 per year, but when the Liberals froze the wages of public servants for seven years straight, the actuarial impact was to create a $30 billion surplus in the plan. Rather than saying that they would improve the plight of these people making $9,000 a year, largely women, and distribute it among the beneficiaries, they said, “Hey, we found $30 billion. Let us use it to give $100 billion worth of tax breaks to our wealthy friends and corporations”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the hon. member agree with me that this mindset dramatically affected in a negative way the standard of living of some of Canada's poorest Canadians, the women who were in fact pensioners from Canada's public service, many of whom are in Ottawa, many of whom are living in my riding, and many of whom, I am sure, live in her own riding?</div>
    </p><a name="Para392959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could just add to and qualify this, at the same time, Bell Canada had a pension plan surplus. Bell decided that it would take one-third for the company, have one-third for future use and give one-third to the beneficiaries of the plan. In fact, one-third was a credit, I suppose, a contribution holiday. Would the hon. member not agree that this would have been the humane and decent thing to do for the pensioners with the $30 billion surplus instead of the government taking it all and not one penny going to the beneficiaries of the plan?</div>

It had a commitment to seniors. I know that many reforms took place in the late 1990s to ensure that there would be security and stability for the Canada pension plan. Over $28.5 billion was invested in the old age supplement. There were also the guaranteed income supplement benefits in budget 2005. Numbers of initiatives for seniors were announced. There was a commitment of over $2 billion a year in direct tax credits such as the age credit and the pension income credit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that under the Liberal tenure there was a variety of investments. Commitments were made on behalf of seniors. I know that many of my colleagues in the Liberal Party want to ensure that we have seniors who do not live in poverty. Seniors should not live on low incomes. We tried to ensure that there were resources and tools available to them at that particular time. I would hope that in moving forward the Conservatives would also start supporting that investment and that commitment to our seniors.</div>

    </p><a name="Para392963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we have to remind members of the House and the public that the Liberal Party is the party of old age pensions and the party of old age security. I recall vividly having a discussion with my friends on this very issue about seven or eight years ago. Many people, and certainly people of my generation, have felt that there probably will not be a pension when people of my generation retire. I think that probably if we had listened to the NDP's recommendations we would not have a pension plan now nor would we for future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Liberals in fact brought about great stability.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to keep straightening out the record because my hon. colleague from the NDP, when he asked his question, certainly was forgetting the fact that the system was practically bankrupt and that my generation would not have been able to benefit from the plan we have today. There was an incredible amount of work done, and there were some sacrifices, yes, but we brought stability to it and in fact the plan that we have today is guaranteed. That guarantee would not have been there. This is something the NDP member somehow always forgets to mention when he states his facts.</div>

How did they rationalize that? </div>
    </p><a name="Para392971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question finds its origins in the fact that the government knew there were 300,000 seniors who were eligible for the guaranteed income supplement--it knew this by their tax returns--but who had never applied. The onus to apply was on them. When we complained to the government, it said it could not just tell them that they were eligible as it would violate their privacy to use their tax returns for any reason other than taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, did it rationalize that kind of pretzel logic in that it was doing people a favour by not giving them the income supplement to which they were entitled, especially when we consider that they are the lowest income people in the country? People do not even qualify for a guaranteed income supplement until there are earnings of $12,000 a year, and up to, I believe, $22,000 total, or in that range.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not satisfied with the answers I have received so far regarding the guaranteed income supplement and what the thought process of the Liberals would be in denying worthy and deserving seniors the income supplement they are entitled to and then only going retroactive for 11 months even when they are guilted into it.</div>

For many seniors across the country, that resulted in an additional almost $36 per month for a single senior and $58 a month for couples. For seniors who are living in poverty, that is a substantial amount of money. This $2.7 billion investment was made because of our commitment to seniors and to ensuring that they would have the very best. </div>

The Bloc Québécois and myself feel that this legislation includes some interesting improvements for our elderly who—and we tend to forget it all too often—built this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being elected for the first time, I quickly realized how the federal government was so incredibly indifferent to the plight of the elderly, particularly the most vulnerable ones. The government tends to be more receptive to the demands of groups that are more powerful, more vocal and more organized. Therefore, the most vulnerable and isolated seniors in our society are not a real priority for the federal government. This is one of the reasons why the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act were flawed in a number of ways. Fortunately, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> seeks to correct several of these flaws, particularly as regards the guaranteed income supplement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that until the Bloc Québécois began to work on it in recent years, this guaranteed income supplement was anything but guaranteed; it was pretty hit-and-miss. One had to be unusually motivated and prepared to battle in order to get it. In 2001, the Bloc Québécois made sure that the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities studied the guaranteed income supplement file. Again it was the Bloc Québécois that organized a huge operation to identify the seniors who were entitled to the guaranteed income supplement, but who were being kept in the dark. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, it was estimated that over 68,000 seniors in Quebec and 270,000 seniors in Canada were not receiving the guaranteed income supplement although they were entitled to it. The parliamentary committee looking at the question pointed the finger at administrative complexity, ineffective, inadequate and poorly targeted advertising, over-zealous public administrators and, more generally, the conflict of interest caused by the astronomical sums saved by the federal government at the expense of the most disadvantaged. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the reasons why so many seniors were deprived of the guaranteed income supplement. Between 1993 and 2001, close to $3.2 billion in all of Canada, including $800 million in Quebec alone, was not paid to seniors who were entitled to it and was reallocated to other purposes by the government of Mr. Chrétien, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> and the leader of the official opposition—I cannot mention their names.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misappropriation of employment insurance, misappropriation of support for seniors and dumping of problems onto the provinces, these are the three pillars on which Ottawa’s zero deficit and debt reduction were built. What an edifying and inspiring example for future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the Bloc Québécois, close to 42,000 of these people were discovered in Quebec alone. This effort accounts for some $190 million more that has been redistributed to the people who need it most. In 2004, when I was elected to the House, I quickly saw that the main problems of access to the guaranteed income supplement involved lack of familiarity with the program and the hugely complex application form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited seniors' centres in my riding and met dozens of struggling individuals, in order to tell them about the guaranteed income supplement. Those few thousand additional dollars were enough to relieve much misery. I can guarantee that. However, once individuals are identified, not everything is solved. The question of renewal also posed a problem. For many seniors, especially those with less education, having to fill out complicated forms year after year constitutes a heavy burden.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para392993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our seniors did not have the opportunity to learn to read and write. They have managed to get through life despite these limitations, but they are very discouraged by the complicated forms found on the Internet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, I have been very happy to see that these forms have been simplified and that, finally, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> introduces an automatic renewal system. It was about time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> introduces another important element, namely, the adjustment of the guaranteed income supplement if there is a drastic drop in the recipient's income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, one of my constituents came to my office. This gentleman, who worked part time in a sawmill, saw his hours drop from about a dozen hours a week to none at all. At that time, he had to wait eight months for his guaranteed income supplement to be adjusted to his new situation, which had a direct impact on his income and his quality of life, and caused him considerable stress that he could have done without.</div>
    </p><a name="Para392997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to be very clear on one point. The Bloc Québécois supports this bill because it is a step in the right direction. However, I would like to see the government take the next step and launch an information and awareness campaign about the guaranteed income supplement. Older people who are eligible for this benefit but who are still not receiving it should automatically have access to it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Bloc Québécois will continue to fight for full retroactivity of the guaranteed income supplement for everyone who has the right to it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para392999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the federal government withheld much-needed money from our poorest seniors. By failing to ensure awareness of this program and by producing forms that were not well-suited to older people, the federal government made things even worse for the most vulnerable members of our society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $3.2 billion was not distributed to the people who contributed so much to building this country. This is a flagrant violation of two major principles: inter-generational equality and the gratitude these builders deserve. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to correct this situation and make amends is to give these older people full retroactivity. Full retroactivity. For the Bloc Québécois and for me, this is about honour and justice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is upsetting to learn that for all these years, both Liberal and Conservative governments have allowed a profoundly unjust and cruel situation to persist. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Bill C-36 will bring about some progress. Still, we will continue the fight to ensure that the federal government gives the people who made Quebec and Canada the nations they are today what they deserve.</div>

    </p><a name="Para393008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that women who today are 70 or 72 years old were never in the labour market 50 or 60 years ago. Many of these women were farmers' wives and thus had no income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, according to Statistics Canada, women represent 52% of the population. Statistically speaking, as women age they become increasingly poor. Women live to the age of 82 or 85 and these women are poor. They are not in the habit of looking for information because they had no money prior to that point. They reach the age of 65 and they receive a pitiful pension. Furthermore, these individuals feel rich because the meagre amount of $450 per month is sufficient given that they had nothing before. Yet, we must explain to them that they are entitled to a guaranteed income supplement in order for them to have a certain quality of life, and not in an attempt to manage poverty, which is not self-evident. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons this bill must be adopted in order to help these women, especially these women and these men who built this country and who brought up those sitting here today. </div>

It deals with the guaranteed income supplement, and the fact that 300,000 Canadians were eligible for this guaranteed income supplement. The government knew they were eligible, but chose not to tell them and never did pay them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cooperation with the Bloc and NDP, when we finally forced the Liberal government to reinstate the guaranteed income supplement to Canadians, it only agreed to retroactivity for 11 months instead of the full reinstatement. Can the member explain or help enlighten us by what cruel logic the Liberals would decide they would only reimburse people for 11 months of what they owned them whereas if people owed taxes from five years ago, the government would go back retroactively until time began to get back taxes? Could she enlighten us, please?</div>

I am therefore unable to explain why these people are trying to hold money back from those it is owed to. If you want to know why they did not agree to retroactivity, I suggest you ask them.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the new government, while the Conservatives keep blaming the previous government, the fact is that their party has been in office for a year. Where I come from, new means a short time, not a year and a half. It is their role now to form the government and, as such, to give seniors what they are owed. They should stop blaming the previous government. The Conservatives ought to play their role properly and pay these people their guaranteed income supplement retroactively.</div>

Actually, I have had to deal with this in my own riding because some people did not even know it existed. Some older people applied for it but after a year still had not received it. We had to help these people for several months. There are still people in my riding, though, who have not yet received the guaranteed income supplement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important, therefore, to implement this legislation so that the government realizes that this guaranteed income is fair and equitable for everyone entitled to it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guaranteed income supplement report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities was adopted in December 2001. Unfortunately, it is still pertinent after five years of Liberal rule during which nothing was done to implement it. The Conservatives have been in power for one year and only now are they starting to think about it. This is a serious problem that should be corrected as soon as possible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee provided an interesting overview of the situation, which we should review today along with the necessary solutions. The Department of Human Resources and Social Development administers three income-maintenance programs for seniors, namely the old age security pension, the guaranteed income supplement, and the Canada pension plan. We are going to focus on the one that is closest to us. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guaranteed income supplement was designed to provide an additional benefit to low-income retired people residing in Canada. The money is added to the old age security pension. I did mean low-income people. I am very close to some people who are having difficulty. It would be only natural for us to help all low-income people so that they can finish their lives in a dignified, equitable way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that people now have to apply every year. These renewals are usually made when eligible people file their income tax returns. This is a source of grave injustices, however, because many people do not file income tax returns or are illiterate and have difficulty understanding what needs to be done to get the supplement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been estimated that in the past, 15% of seniors used food banks and never received the guaranteed income supplement. These less fortunate people never received this supplement. Imagine how important an income supplement is to the survival of someone who uses a food bank. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is simple. Why do so many people not apply for the guaranteed income supplement, which could be of great help and perhaps even necessary? Filling out an application is not easy for a person with an inadequate level of literacy. The current government is cutting literacy programs and will create even more illiterate seniors. This system absolutely needs to be made as simple as possible, unless we can teach people to read and write or provide them with other ways to obtain this supplement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will say that people can consult the Web site. Have you ever seen a food bank user able to use the Internet at that age? They are not familiar with this new technology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical or mental health problems, physical limitations and language barriers have deprived a number of people of significant amounts of money. That is why so many people did not receive the guaranteed income supplement to which they were entitled.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755">(1755)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para393025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes us wonder who makes up the client base. Who are these people that did not receive the supplement? They are people who never worked outside the home, people who did not file income tax returns, aboriginals, residents of remote communities, poorly educated individuals, who do not read or speak either of the official languages, or people who are disabled, sick or homeless. I want to emphasize that, because there is a growing number of homeless people over the age of 65.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my tour of Quebec last year, I met homeless people who were 70, 75, 80. These people are increasingly being kicked out of their homes. Since they have no fixed address, they cannot receive the minimum required to live a decent life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing stood out to the committee addressing this issue: the fact that Human Resources and Social Development Canada was aware of the under-subscription to the guaranteed income supplement. This has been a problem since at least 1993. What did the Liberal government do about it at the time? It did nothing, even though it knew about the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to this problem is to take action to help people directly. That is important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the Bloc is also proposing and recommending that the committee look at requiring the government to pay full retroactive guaranteed income supplement benefits, rather than a maximum of 11 months, as the legislation provides. This would mean a retroactive payment covering all eligibility periods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government have a double standard, requiring taxpayers to retroactively pay long overdue sums of money, yet refusing to do the same when it owes them money? It makes no sense. It is unethical and unfair. It is truly immoral.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will also make sure that the amendments to the current legislation do not restrict eligibility. The guaranteed income supplement should be available to everyone who needs it. The Bloc Québécois will ask the Information Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner to testify about expanding the group of third parties to whom personal contribution information could be provided. Because there are people who do not understand, others must ask questions on their behalf.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will continue the fight it began long ago so that the federal government—we could even talk about the two successive governments—ensures that all seniors who are entitled to the guaranteed income supplement can receive it easily and on an ongoing basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the matter of interest charged on overpayments. The Bloc Québécois will make sure that this bill treats all taxpayers equally and that there are no abuses by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Bloc will make sure that the limitation period for claims of government overpayments is proportional to the period during which individuals can claim amounts owing. The government is not proposing full retroactivity, yet it seems to do away with any limitation period when it comes to the money it is owed. As I said earlier, this is true especially of income tax. It could even be said that the government has a double standard: it acts one way when it is owed money and another way when it has to pay money to people who have been paying their taxes for years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a question of ethics and setting a good example. The government should hold itself to the same rules as others. I would also like to say that the guaranteed income supplement should be available to everyone who needs it and that the application process should be simpler, so that people are not required to apply every year. It must be paid on an ongoing basis.</div>

British Columbia does not allow it. Its senior supplement is for one year. The widow's pension is for one year in Alberta. Saskatchewan has an income plan for one year. Manitoba has a guaranteed annual income for one year. Ontario's drug plan program is for one year.

    </p><a name="Para393037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a program in any jurisdiction that we could compare this to so that we could understand how 11 months would not be generous enough?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently in the process of creating fear about the fact that there will be more seniors than before. Yes, it is true that we have never on Earth experienced this situation in our capitalist system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remember one thing: for every income received in society, no matter how small, this income is multiplied by three in terms of spending. It is not just a loss: it gets people working, employs everyone and fuels the economy. Thinking that only producers of goods and services fuel the economy is a very bad way of seeing things. That was the argument used in Ontario when a number of teachers were laid off. It soon became clear that the economy was taking a hit because the money the government used to pay the teachers was money that multiplied by three.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to fear population aging. Generally speaking, people are aging with a lot more money than before and will be able to take care of themselves. For those who will not be able to do so, for the less fortunate, we have to ensure that the measures are in place. Those measures will be economically viable and will add to our economy.</div>

The enactment also eliminates the ability of estates or successions to apply for income tested benefits and ensures that sponsored immigrants are treated the same for the purpose of determining entitlements to income tested benefits.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich industrialized country like ours must ensure excellent standards of living for senior Canadians so that they can live out their golden years in dignity and comfort. Seniors in Canada have worked all of their lives and they should not have to worry about financial issues when they retire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party is the party of the Canada pension plan and old age security. Our party continues to recognize the duty we owe to those Canadians who have worked for so many years and made so many valuable contributions to our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberal policies in the 1990s returned the Canada pension plan funds to stability and ensured a reliable public pension system for 75 years to come, the longest we can possibly forecast. The Canada pension plan fund currently stands at over $100 billion. It is safe for generations to come. This is no small feat as just a few years ago many were predicting its demise. Due to good management by the previous government, future generations of Canadians can depend on the Canada pension plan as previous generations have for four decades.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of Parliament I often meet with seniors in my riding. Seniors in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78451,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78451&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Oak Ridges—Markham</A> are worried about their pensions, savings, health care and day to day living issues. Unfortunately, many seniors in Canada are nervous about the policies of the Conservative government. I wish to explore these areas of concern. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is an issue with which the House is very familiar and that is rural mail delivery. In October the House unanimously supported my motion to have rural mail delivery restored. Losing one's mailbox delivery is inconvenient for anyone, but it is especially hard on the elderly. Elderly Canadians rely on mail delivery for communicating with friends and family and for receiving their pension cheques and other important material. Elderly Canadians were disproportionately affected by the cessation of rural mail delivery. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the government has directed Canada Post to reinstate this unique mode of delivery. The minister has set a timeline of an additional 18 months before delivery is back. It has already been 12 months since my constituents lost rural mailbox delivery. This is much too long a period for elderly Canadians to wait.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter I wish to raise this afternoon that has greatly concerned seniors is the government's income trust decision on October 31. The decision to tax income trusts wiped out more than $25 billion in savings overnight and reversed a key Conservative campaign promise. Many seniors invested their money based on this promise and their faith in the Conservatives cost them thousands of dollars of their hard-earned savings. This kind of move really hurt the trust and confidence seniors have in the government. Many do not believe that the government has their interests at heart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third Conservative policy that is of concern regards what this bill fundamentally involves and that is the Canada pension plan. The Conservatives cannot claim to be the defenders of a sound public pension system. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> launched an attack on vital Canada pension plan funds with his net debt goal announced last fall. It is unwise and potentially dangerous to tie the Canada pension plan account to the national debt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support reducing Canada's national debt. Reducing the debt frees up interest payments and allows us to make important investments in Canada's social safety net and to decrease taxes and to make sure that Canadians are able to enjoy more of their hard-earned dollars. That being said, I do not believe that Canada pension plan funds should be used to lower the national debt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net debt announcement attaches Canada pension plan funds, the contributions of taxpayers, to our national debt to artificially balance the books. This is another attack on the security of pensioners. That money is not for debt repayment or future collateral to borrow funds. It is for pension payments. Future payments from the Canada pension plan fund represent a massive liability on the fund, a liability that was not considered by the minister in his net debt policy move.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government reduced the debt, lowered taxes and ensured the long term sustainability of the Canada pension plan. Why is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> so determined to attack the Canada pension plan? Why does he want to use it for ends for which it was not intended? A balanced approach ensures the survival and sustainability of taxpayers' pensions while reducing taxes and investing in the priorities of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that we have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A> in front of us. It allows us an opportunity to debate and to discuss the overall theme of pensions. I welcome what the government intends to do in this bill, but it must remain mindful of its responsibilities toward Canadian seniors. This means ensuring they have a decent quality of life, have access to sound investments over which promises are not broken, and can fully depend on all pension plans. </div>

    </p><a name="Para393065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that the member for Oak Ridges—Markham said it was the Liberal Party that created the old age security system as we know it today. In actual fact, I would point out that in 1926 it was the member for Winnipeg Centre at the time, the founder and first leader of the CCF, J.S. Woodsworth, who went to the minority Liberal prime minister of the day, William Lyon Mackenzie King, and cut a deal with him that the CCF would support the Liberal government if it finally yielded to its demands and introduced some measure of old age security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Winnipeg Centre at the time was smart enough to get that in writing. A letter exists today in the archives of the New Democratic Party. Kicking and screaming, the Liberals were forced to introduce some measure of old age security for seniors back in 1926. My colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78437,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78437&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint Boniface</A>, remembers that; apparently, he is older than I thought he was. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, something that he might remember is that in 1942 the hon. Stanley Knowles took the place of J.S. Woodsworth as the member for Winnipeg Centre. Stanley Knowles was widely agreed to be the father of the Canadian pension system because he dedicated his career from 1942 to 1966 fighting and struggling to get the old age security Canada pension plan that we know today introduced by a Liberal minority government under Lester Pearson at that time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Stanley Knowles who finally levered the Liberals into acting like Liberals in introducing the Canada pension plan. Then he spent the rest of his career, from 1966 to 1984 when he suffered a stroke, trying to get the pension plan indexed to inflation, another huge victory for Stanley Knowles and the party that I represent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disingenuous, if not revisionist, to say that the Liberal Party was responsible for the introduction of the old age security system, the guaranteed income supplement or the Canada pension plan. It was those two great men who represented the riding that I am honoured to represent now whom we can thank for that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para393095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I travelled across Canada, from St.John's, Newfoundland, to Vancouver, with the Standing Committee on Official Languages. In every province of the country, there was not a place where the francophone minority did not ask why the federal government had abolished the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I put to the President of the Treasury Board at the time was important for people using both official languages of our country, so that they could thrive and have access to services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in Canada, we can see that francophone minorities were able to get schools in Prince Edward Island and in Nova Scotia. People were able to get services in both languages in New Brunswick. We were able to put a challenge to increase bilingualism in the RCMP in New Brunswick, or to fight for food inspectors in Shippagan, who were going to be transferred to Moncton. There is also the riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78825,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78825&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Acadie—Bathurst</A> which was to be split and be linked to Miramichi. It is thanks to the court challenges program that we were able to debate the issue and go to court. Here in Ottawa, the battle to keep the Montfort Hospital was also waged through the court challenges program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere we went, even in Toronto, in Sudbury, in British Columbia, in Saskatchewan, in Manitoba and in Regina, we found that it had given people the opportunity to test the Official Languages Act in court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By cutting funding for the court challenges program, the government is preventing these organizations from going to court. Across Canada, people are protesting this cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the President of the Treasury Board why the government cut the program, but he did not answer. He just said that his government would obey the law. But what if it does not? How can these people, these organizations, go to court to represent citizens?</div>
    </p><a name="Para393101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives us the impression that the Conservative Party thinks this is a simple issue and that they can do things like the American government does. The party leaves it up to the people to get organized. It does not believe in community; it thinks it can leave groups to their own devices. The Conservative government also said in this House that it did not see why it should give money to groups to take the government to court. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who is the government? It exists to represent the people. If a law must be challenged, we must ensure that people have the opportunity to challenge it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I asked the President of the Treasury Board that question, but he did not give me an answer. He merely said that his government would obey the law. But that is not happening. This is a big country. Sometimes, mistakes happen and people have to go to court with the support of the court challenges program. The government, this Conservative government, took away the tools that let them do that. </div>

At this point we do not know his condition. We do not know where he is. We do not even know whether he is alive. This is a Canadian citizen who, unfortunately, has not been afforded under international law his basic human rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations with China, according to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, are “in a shambles”. We need to restore our relationship with China so that we can carry on a dialogue, whether it be for trade, for cultural exchange or for other diplomatic affairs such as this one for Mr. Celil. </div>
    </p><a name="Para393113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has constantly said that things are in good shape with China but we know very well that it continues to send people over there as recently as during the break to mend fences. It has even contradicted itself by its own representations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key here is that when Mr. Celil was picked up in Uzbekistan, the request by China to extradite him to China was preceded by a statement by the Uzbeks that they would have preferred to have Mr. Celil released to Canada but that Canada had not expressed sufficient interest in Mr. Celil. That is from the Uzbek officials. He was therefore extradited.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we do not know where he is. We do not know whether he has been tortured. We do not even know whether he is alive. The ministry has written to people to say that it has worked tirelessly on the file. An official of the prison in which Mr. Celil was held in Uzbekistan told his family members that there were assurances that Mr. Celil would not be executed if he were extradited to China. That was not a representation from China. It was not a representation from the government of Uzbekistan. It was from a prison official. This is second or third-hand information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time there has been no new information on the situation with Mr. Celil and yet the government continues to say that it is working tirelessly. It has been working tirelessly since last March and there is no new information even though the Conservatives continue to write letters that they have done things. They have done nothing and that is why I am raising this again. It is important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's press reports state that China has alleged that there are people from China who have come here who have allegedly broken the law in China and China is asking for them to be extradited back to China. In my view this is the kind of situation that calls out for a sit down behind closed doors with Chinese officials to work out the problems and the relationship with China so we can carry on a dialogue on matters of mutual interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to respect the Vienna Convention. We need to respect our bilateral diplomatic affairs agreement with China. They do not recognize Canadian citizenship if the person has dual citizenship with China. As a consequence, China has said that they have no rights as far as Canadian law goes. This is precisely what we should talk about in a clear, open and transparent fashion with the officials and translators. That has never happened and it is time the government took the opportunity that we have today to sit down to repair the shambles it has created in the relationship with China so that we can deal with Mr.--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Canadian citizens find themselves imprisoned in foreign lands, it is our responsibility to ensure that they are treated fairly and afforded due process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Celil's case has indeed been in the forefront of our minds and it is being continuously raised in discussions with our Chinese counterparts.

At every given opportunity, whether it be an elected official or a Government of Canada employee, this issue is raised with the Chinese. We will continue to seek other means that we deem appropriate to acquire information about and access to Mr. Celil.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment that we were advised of the possibility that Mr. Celil would be extradited from Uzbekistan to China, we advised the Chinese government of our interest in Mr. Celil's well-being as he is a Canadian citizen. They continue to insist that Mr. Celil is a Chinese citizen and subject to Chinese laws. China refuses to acknowledge his Canadian citizenship and maintains that Canada has no consular rights. They also refuse to advise us of the location of his incarceration or provide any information about his well-being.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Chinese foreign minister has reassured the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78752,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78752&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Foreign Affairs</A> that they will abide by their commitments to the Uzbeki government made at the time of Mr. Celil's extradition. Those commitments were to abide by the international convention against torture and not to seek the death penalty for crimes allegedly committed in the territory of China. Chinese officials have advised us that their investigation continues, that no trial has taken place and that no sentence has been pronounced against Mr. Celil.</div>
    </p><a name="Para393126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada will continue to engage the Chinese authorities to ensure that Mr. Celil's rights are upheld and respected. I can assure the hon. member that repeated representations have been made and will continue to be made to the Chinese authorities. In fact, in the first weeks of January of this year, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> visited China and raised Mr. Celil's case.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a Canadian citizen. His rights have not been protected. The government does not know where he is. The government does not know whether he has been tortured. The government does not even know whether he is alive. Those are the issues. </div>
