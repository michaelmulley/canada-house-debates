<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. If I understand the motion correctly, it is to not debate the 
issue of the international laws that pertain to the recognition of 
Quebec's right to self-determination. As it is obvious from the 
statements from the Bloc that we will be debating this in the future, 
we in the Reform Party believe it is important that Parliament, 
which is representative of all of Canada, have a chance to debate 
this issue. Therefore we will not agree to dropping this off the 
Order Paper.

	Almost everyone knows that small and medium size businesses 
in Canada are important to job creation and are important to the

adding to the quality of life.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that has 
been circulating all across Canada. This portion of the petition has 
been signed by a number of Canadians from Stratford, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession, which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

have a petition from citizens of the city and county of 
Peterborough. The petitioners state that whereas the name of Our 
Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord's Prayer have been included in the 
historic parliamentary prayer of the House of Commons since 
1867; and whereas Canada was founded and built upon the 
principles of Christianity and a large majority of Canadians profess 
the Christian faith; therefore they call on the House of Commons to 
close the parliamentary prayer with the words ``through Jesus 
Christ our Lord, Amen'' and reinstate the Lord's Prayer at the 
conclusion of the opening prayer.

have another petition from numerous citizens in eastern Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that acts of discrimination against 
lesbian, gay and bisexual Canadians are an everyday reality in all 
regions of Canada and that this kind of discrimination is 
unacceptable in a country known for its commitment to human 
rights, equality and dignity for all citizens.
<P>
	Therefore these petitioners call upon Parliament to act quickly to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation and to adapt all necessary 
measures to recognize the full equality of same sex relationships in 
federal law.

Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, it is my pleasure 
today to present a petition signed by 111 residents of Labelle 
County in my riding.
<P>
	The petition is about an issue that concerns many Canadians. It 
asks Parliament to amend the Divorce Act by including a provision 
identical to section 611 of the Quebec Civil Code, which provides 
that parents cannot, without serious grounds, interfere with a 
child's personal relationship with its grandparents and that if no 
agreement can be reached by the parties, the terms of this

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGREEMENTONINTERNALTRADEIMPLEMENTATIONACT">AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 1, 1995, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-88, an Act to implement the Agreement on 
Internal Trade, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When the House last 
considered Bill C-88, the hon. member for Joliette had 11 minutes 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, when I had 
to break off my speech yesterday to let the House proceed with the 
Orders of the Day, I was discussing the actual impact of Bill C-88 
and, more particularly, clause 9 of the bill.
<P>
	The wording of clause 9 allows for a very broad interpretation. 
For instance, the federal government would be able to intervene 
and impose retaliatory measures even when it is not a party to the 
dispute.
<P>
	Although the Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of free 
trade and, in fact, we cannot do otherwise but support this concept, 
when a clause like this one gives the federal government sweeping 
powers, we must object to adopting the bill as tabled, or at least to 
the wording of clause 9. In fact, this clause could lend itself to two 
very different interpretations.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	One interpretation could result in the federal government's 
giving itself powers, because of its obligation under the agreement 
to have the option to impose retaliatory measures, in the event and 
only in the event it becomes an aggrieved party. We believe clause 
9 does not provide this. In fact, the first part of clause 9 reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory measures 
of equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the 
Agreement, the Governor in Council may, by order,-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So the federal government may intervene and impose a variety 
of measures, which I will not read in their entirety, but will simply 
summarize: suspend rights or privileges, modify the application of 
any federal law; extend the application of any federal law to a 
province or take any other measure it considers necessary.
<P>
	As it stands, we could interpret the meaning. In the case where a 
party is found to be in the wrong, under the terms of article 1710 of 
the agreement, the federal government, whether it is a party to the 
dispute or not, will be entitled to impose retaliatory measures 
against the party in question. As we saw yesterday, the parties may  
be a province, the federal government or any third party with close 
ties to either the province or the federal government.
<P>
	We also pointed out yesterday that, because of its spending 
power, the federal government was already meddling in many areas 
or activities that are strictly provincial in jurisdiction and already 
had considerable latitude because of the way the parties were 
defined. Because of the considerable latitude it already enjoys 
under the definition of ``federal government'', it would be 
superfluous to add more here and permit the federal government to 
intervene even when it is not an aggrieved party. We believe this 
interpretation is contrary to the intent of the agreement.
<P>
	The agreement does not, in fact, provide that the federal 
government may impose retaliatory measures against an injuring 
party. It could do so only if it was recognized as an injured party in 
this dispute.
<P>
	The second possible interpretation of this provision, and the one 
with which we might agree, is that if the federal government 
wanted to retaliate against a party at fault pursuant to article 1710 
of the agreement, it could do so only as the injured party in the 
dispute.
<P>
	If this is what this provision means, we might agree. However, 
since the wording may be ambiguous and leave room for 
interpretation, we would like to clarify this paragraph by amending 
it so that if the federal government is recognized as a party injured 
by a measure imposed by another party in violation of the 
agreement, the governor in council may, by order and pursuant to 
article 1710 of the agreement, take the measures as listed in clause 
9. This is our first comment regarding clause 9.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Another point I wish to raise is that the range of retaliatory 
measures of which the federal government may avail itself 
pursuant to clause 9 of the bill is much too broad.
<P>
	By giving itself the power to modify or suspend the application 
of any federal law with respect to the province, to extend the 
application of any federal law to the province, or to take any other 
measure deemed necessary, the federal government is granting 
itself inordinate retaliatory powers that may affect the entire 
population of a province. The problem is that the federal 
government's legislative power affects all Canadians and that it 
already imposes laws on the provinces. These powers are denied to 
the provinces and we think in this case that, once again, this article 
could allow the federal government to impose its will on the 
provinces.
<P>
	The federal government's retaliatory powers should be strictly 
limited to the trade areas already defined in the agreement. So, if 
we agreed on these restrictions, the federal government could no 
longer retaliate in social areas and go after the Canada social 
transfer, for example.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16111"> 16111 </A></B>
<P>
	For the Bloc Quebecois, this is another way of looking at this 
article, which we regard as very important.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to point out another controversial aspect of 
this bill. Clause 14 of this bill deals with the powers of 
appointment.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The governor in council may, by order, appoint any person to fill any position 
that may be necessary or advisable, in the opinion of the governor in council, for 
carrying out the purposes of the agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, as in many other areas, the Bloc Quebecois thinks that 
these appointments should be ratified by the House of Commons 
instead of simply requiring an order of the governor in council. As 
in the case of appointments to several important boards, which are 
ratified by the House of Commons, we feel that-in this case 
involving billions of dollars in interprovincial trade subject to this 
act, this agreement-it is very important that all appointments be 
made public and subject to some scrutiny by the House. In fact, we 
ask that these appointments be made or suggested by the governor, 
but that they be systematically ratified by the House of Commons.
<P>
	Those are the three points I wanted to raise with respect to clause 
9.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to speak about the so-called agreement in Bill 
C-88 on internal trade barriers.
<P>
	This bill is a total sham and should never have been introduced 
in the House. It has nothing to add to internal trade that is not 
already in place in the BNA act. It does not even maintain the same 
standard. Let me quote from section 121 of the BNA act. This is 
what we had before: ``All articles of growth, produce or 
manufacture of any one of the provinces shall be admitted free into 
each of the other provinces''.
<P>
	What do we have now under article 101 of this provincial trade 
agreement? It states that the objective of the agreement is to reduce 
and eliminate, to the extent possible, barriers to the free movement 
of goods and services.
<P>
	Is that not somewhat less than section 121 of the BNA act which 
says shall be admitted free? Obviously it is. I am concerned that the 
bill is like a Hollywood movie set. It looks good on the outside but 
there is nothing behind it. There are no teeth in this agreement and I 
have good reason to say that.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	I tested the bill. A company in my riding has a contract with CN 
Rail to move its workers from Grand Prairie, Alberta into the 
Dawson Creek area of B.C., some 60 miles away. What did the 
company find? It cannot get a  permit to go into B.C. It is being 
restricted even though it has a contract to move its cabs into that 
area.
<P>
	We decided to test the new internal trade agreement. We asked 
the Department of Industry and the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade to get involved to see what they could do to 
help this company resolve the problem. They can do absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	This so-called trade agreement is nothing. It is just a loose 
agreement of empty words. It certainly will not do anything to 
address the problem of internal trade barriers which cost Canada 
between $8 billion and $10 billion a year. We simply cannot afford 
these kinds of costs. We are in a very competitive global trading 
environment and we have to give our companies the ability to build 
some economies of scale here at home before they launch into 
international business.
<P>
	Let us talk about international business for a moment. Canada 
has signed some very good trade agreements internationally. We 
have signed the new GATT agreement, the Uruguay round. We 
have signed the NAFTA and previous to that the Canada-U.S. free 
trade agreement. We have better international agreements for trade 
than we have agreements for trade between the provinces. It is 
absolutely ludicrous. To pretend that this bill addresses the problem 
is just misleading the Canadian public.
<P>
	The European Economic Community is now 15 member 
countries. There are fewer barriers to trade between those 15 
countries in the European Union than we have between the 
provinces. Some decentralized federation. We need a workable 
agreement between the provinces and the federal government has 
to show leadership. That is what it involves. It must show 
leadership and broker the kind of agreement that is necessary. 
Obviously Bill C-88 does not do that.
<P>
	Whole segments of the economy are not addressed in this bill. It 
does not include agriculture. It does not include certain government 
procurements or regional development. Those are all very 
significant barriers to trade.
<P>
	A good example of how silly the trade gets within this country 
and the barriers we meet can be told in one simple example. A 
trucking company in Alberta had a gravel contract nine miles from 
the British Columbia border. It was working well within the 
province of Alberta, but at the end of the day the drivers wanted to 
drive their trucks into the nearest town to stay overnight in a hotel 
and eat in the restaurants. They were not allowed to do so. Why 
not? Because their trucks did not meet the requirements for the 
regulations in British Columbia. They had to have different axle 
spacings, an empty truck, certain permits they could not get 
without considerable expense. They had to bring in a special 
vehicle to take the workers into British Columbia to the hotel. That 
is how ludicrous this gets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16112"> 16112 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest this is the type of situation there was in Russia some 
10 years ago under communism. Surely we have to move beyond 
that if we are going to be effective in the world economy.
<P>
	Nothing has been resolved in the area of natural resources and 
energy, all key areas of trade in Canada. The cost is estimated to be 
$8 billion per year. We cannot afford those costs. We must have a 
government that shows leadership and we certainly did not get it 
here.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that this was a modest proposal. Modest 
indeed. Most Canadians would see it as a complete waste of time 
and money. I am appalled that the Minister of Industry would bring 
this forward in the guise of a bill that is going to address the 
problems of trade restrictions.
<P>
	I would ask him to go back to the drawing board. Bring the 
provincial premiers together. Bring the industry players together 
and show them what is the cost to our society. Show them what is 
the cost to their own industry. We can do much better. I challenge 
this minister to do so.

provincial part of Shefford as well as in the Iberville part. In the 
riding of Iberville, 56 per cent of voters said yes.
<P>
	From the outset, you should know that I intend to continue 
sitting in this House for the duration of my mandate as a member of 
Parliament for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	This morning, I rise to speak on Bill C-88, an act to implement 
the Agreement on Internal Trade. As you know, Quebec-and 
Quebec members elected to this place in 1988-is responsible for 
the passage of the Free Trade Agreement. Had it not been for 
Quebec and its voters, Canada would have had a much harder time 
entering into this agreement between Canada and the United States 
that has greatly benefited both countries.
<P>
	Quebec is a state which is open to the world. At present, and this 
is very sad, it is easier for Quebec to trade with the U.S. than with 
the rest of Canada because there was no legislation like this, and 
that made interprovincial trade extremely difficult. As the Minister 
of Commerce indicated, the difficulty came from the fact that 
Canadian laws dated back to the 1940s and that there was an 
unwillingness to evolve.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, Quebec trades mainly abroad, with the 
United States of America becoming our main  trading partner. We 
also trade with the rest of Canada, although less and less as time 
goes by, and our trade relations with the rest of Canada or our 
provincial partners are also important.
<P>
	Bill C-88 will normalize a situation that did not exist before. 
Take clause 9 of the bill for instance, which we have a problem 
with. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory measures of 
equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement,</BLOCKQUOTE>
made between the provinces
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the Governor in Council may, by order, do any one or more of the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The fault we find with this bill is that, once again, the federal 
government is taking pride of place. In the context of 
federal-provincial relations, Canada has always taken pride of 
place and retained the right of disallowance. In this case, penalties 
could even be imposed instead of deferring to an arbitral tribunal, 
as would normally be the case between states or provinces.
<P>
	We totally disagree with Ottawa giving itself the kind of power 
this legislation would afford it. As I said earlier, Quebec has always 
been in favour of interprovincial trade in Canada.
<P>
	What I cannot understand is why Canada manages its internal 
trade the way GATT managed international trade in the late 1940s. 
Mr. Manley himself, the current trade and commerce minister of 
Canada, said so.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The important thing to remember is that, in clause 9 of this bill, 
the government gives itself a power to disallow and punish. We 
also object to clause 14, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>14. (1) The Governor in Council may, by order, appoint any person to fill any 
position that may be necessary or advisable, in the opinion of the Governor in 
Council, for carrying out the purposes of the Agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This provision means that, once again, Parliament will not have 
a say regarding these appointments. The Liberals always talk about 
reforms. They always say that they want to change the system. Yet, 
when they introduce bills, we realize that this is impossible, that 
the system cannot be changed and that there will not be any reform.
<P>
	Once again, the governor in council has the privilege of making 
appointments, without asking for Parliament's approval. 
Sometimes, we wonder what we, elected representatives of the 
people and regions of Canada, are doing here. We meet in this 
House as representatives of the people and that, as you know, is a 
costly process. However, when the time comes for the government 
to place its confidence in our assembly and seek its approval, that 
government bypasses the whole parliamentary process and makes 
appointments through orders in council or departmental orders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16113"> 16113 </A></B>
<P>
	If Canada is considering reforms, it must correct that situation 
and give much more power to this Parliament. Canadians and 
Quebecers are not stupid, you know. They are increasingly aware 
of the fact that we do not make many decisions here; we just talk. 
Everything is already decided, and this is what I strongly object 
to. Reform members also denounce that situation, and this is to 
their credit, even though we may disagree on what needs to be 
done. We happen to think that we are a different country. We feel 
that the chaotic situation in Canada could be corrected by making 
some constitutional changes.
<P>
	The ball is now in the court of the people opposite. What will 
they do? Probably nothing. We will wait and see. We expect that 
futile discussions will go on for the next 30 years, but I have to say 
that we do not intend to stick around very long.
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill provides once again the federal 
government with the power to act alone and not consult the 
provinces, something which is unacceptable. It is unacceptable 
because, in a partnership-as trade relations should be-one side 
cannot give itself the power to control everything.
<P>
	Federalism will once again create difficult situations. This bill 
will probably be passed without amendments, like several other 
ones, thanks to the Liberal majority. By staying within the 
Canadian federation, Quebec will have to suffer the consequences 
of that legislation, which will increase the power of the federal 
government, at the expense of the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, here it is at least a year after the legislation was 
introduced. It wends its way through the labyrinth of our political 
process and finally finds itself back on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I thought I would be speaking to the bill yesterday so I thumbed 
through November 1 in history. Of course today is November 2. 
Interestingly Michelangelo completed his work on the Sistine 
Chapel, but it only took him four and a half years. The legislation is 
progressing apace, but no one will compare it with Michelangelo's 
work on the Sistine Chapel.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Actually to many observers it looks like a make work project. 
Anyone who has given the matter even a modicum of thought 
understands and appreciates how ludicrous it is in our country, 
united from sea to sea to sea, that it is more difficult to trade 
internally than it is to trade with any other trading partner we may 
have in the United States or elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	When the legislation was being put together and the debate 
among provincial trade delegations was taking place, more people 
were sitting around the table trying to  break down the barriers of 
interprovincial trade in our country than there were sitting around 
the table when we were trying to break down the trade barriers with 
the United States and to shape the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.
<P>
	We had a situation where we were hopefully to have a North 
American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United 
States and Mexico and there were less people sitting at the table 
than when we were trying to break down internal trade barriers 
within Canada.
<P>
	How did we end up in that situation? How is that our country 
ends up in a situation like that? Just a moment ago my hon. 
colleague from the Bloc spoke. I have had the pleasure of spending 
many hours in committee with the member listening to him defend 
the unilateral interests of Quebec. I have never once, in the two 
years that we have been here, heard him mutter one word about the 
rights, the interests or the values of Canada as a nation. Every word 
that has come out of the hon. member's mouth and the mouths of 
all members of the Bloc has been directly related to Quebec, how 
they can better the interests of Quebec.
<P>
	The precise reason we have a problem in interprovincial trade in 
our country is that we have a kind of parochialism about our 
institutions. It is one of the primary reasons there is so much 
discontent from coast to coast to coast. For years citizens of 
Canada resident in the regions of Canada on the east coast, the west 
coast, the prairies and the north were merely markets for the 
manufacturing centres of central Canada in Montreal and southern 
Ontario.
<P>
	We now have an opportunity to break down trade barriers within 
Canada, which would greatly strengthen the economic prospects of 
all regions of the country, including the manufacturing heartland of 
Ontario and Quebec. And what happens? We get around a table to 
debate the opportunity to make our country better.
<P>
	Canadians spent $1.5 million or so to have Professor Michael 
Porter of the Harvard Business School do a study on Canada's 
competitive situation in the world. Interested viewers may know 
the same study or a study very similar to it could have been 
obtained for $2,000 U.S. from the Harvard Business School video 
series. It is exactly the same; it is on competitive strategies.
<P>
	In any event this $1.5 million study has a recommendation at 
page 98: ``Extend efforts to increase rivalry''. It is a well known 
fact that to get a better product at a lower price we need 
competitive situations; we need rivalry. Professor Porter in his 
study asked how we were to be competitive internationally if we 
were not first competitive at home. How are we to be competitive 
at home if we have trade barriers that restrict competitiveness? It 
just makes sense.
<P>
	This reminds me of the situation we found ourselves in when we 
entered into the free trade agreement with the  United States which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16114"> 16114 </A></B>
<P>
members opposite, I would remind them, fought so vigorously. By 
and large members on this side and I were very much in favour of 
it.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are born again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> My colleague says that the Liberals are born 
again. They are learning. Here they are in government embracing 
the free trade agreement for the good of all. We are glad to see they 
have learned the error of their ways.
<P>
	How is it that we entered into a free trade agreement with the 
United States, the most aggressive, strongest trading nation in the 
world, and had not first broken down the internal trade barriers in 
Canada? It is like getting into a fight with the biggest person in the 
school yard and saying: ``I am going to fight fair. I am going to tie 
one hand behind my back just to make it fair for you because you 
are so big. Oh, by the way, just in case you think I might whip you, 
even though I have one hand tied behind my back, we will have the 
highest interest rates we have ever had, a high dollar, and we will 
fight with you in a free trade environment''.
<P>
	It was kind of like a Monty Python skit with the knight that had a 
head and a torso but no arms or legs. He had the knife in his teeth 
and was saying: ``Fight fair, fight fair. I can beat you''. That is what 
we did. We prostrated ourselves by having high interest rates and 
by having a high dollar, but most of all we had not broken down 
trade barriers within Canada so that we would be more efficient 
before getting into the free trade arena, the global trade arena in the 
world we find ourselves in. It is absolutely essential the trade 
barriers be broken down.
<P>
	This speaks to the nub of the reason we are not supporting the 
legislation. People would ask: ``How on earth can the member 
speak so positively about the necessity, the absolute need to break 
down trade barriers, and yet they will vote against the bill?'' The 
reason is that the government has the responsibility to provide 
leadership and to make sure we actually break down trade barriers.
<P>
	We get together with the provinces and have months and months 
of gumming this thing. Nothing happens. The disparity between the 
provinces in the way they approach the issue is enormous. The fault 
honestly should not be laid totally at the feet of the government 
because the provincial governments are involved as well. When the 
Alberta government came to the table to negotiate the free trade 
agreement it had one page with one line on it, that there should be 
no barriers to free trade in Canada. Our neighbouring provinces, 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia, came to the same meeting 
with a large stack to protect this, that and the other thing. Ontario, 
as I am told, made significant concessions. Quebec had to protect 
everything including the dairy industry and everything else it had.
<P>
	This is where leadership comes into play, but the federal Liberal 
government did not lead. Its mandate is to keep people at the table 
to ensure laws are made to best accommodate the necessities of our 
country in the future.
<P>
	In conclusion I will point out what leadership is all about. The 
Liberals will look at this era in history and hope that the writers and 
history will look kindly at them. They will look kindly at them if 
they seize the opportunity to make history, not to be carried along 
by events and overtaken by them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity this morning to speak to Bill C-88, an act to 
implement the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	The piece of legislation is historic. With it we will be 
implementing within the federal jurisdiction the obligations of the 
federal government under the first comprehensive domestic trade 
agreement in Canada since the British North America Act, 1867.
<P>
	In the 128 years since 1867 the Canadian economy has grown 
and evolved in ways never imagined by the Fathers of 
Confederation. The federal government still has under section 
91(a) of the Constitution responsibility for trade and commerce and 
specifically interprovincial trade.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Since 1867 the world has changed significantly. The provinces 
have assumed prominent roles as influencers of economic growth 
and the regulation of trade and commerce within their respective 
territories. As a result, trading arrangements and regulations have 
developed in an ad hoc way often in response to a particular 
regional need.
<P>
	Many of those measures have, often unwittingly, created barriers 
to trade as the impact on the free flow of goods, services, people 
and capital within Canada. Such barriers can lead to the inefficient 
use of resources and limit the ability of industry to take advantage 
of the economies of scale and to maintain competitive market 
positions. The result has often been to reduce the competitiveness 
of Canadian business and to adversely affect the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	There have been many examples of such impediments: different 
professional and occupational standards in different jurisdictions 
which limit labour and mobility between provinces; selective 
listing policies by some provincial liquor boards that discriminate 
against products from outside their provinces; different 
transportation regulations, safety codes, inspection arrangements 
and vehicle standards in each province which make it difficult for 
truckers to cross provincial boundaries; government procurement 
polices that give preference to local companies; provincial 
incentive programs for industry development; and construction 
procedures that differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  These are 
some of the more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16115"> 16115 </A></B>
<P>
common examples of barriers and impediments to interprovincial 
trade and commerce as exist in Canada.
<P>
	A recognition that the patchwork of regulations, standards and 
other barriers to interprovincial trade which have grown around us 
was an unacceptable feature of the domestic market in Canada. It 
led governments to agree to negotiate the agreement on internal 
trade. Growing concern and evidence that these barriers to trade 
seriously affected our ability to remain competitive in the 
international trading environment fuelled the urgency of 
establishing a new trade regime in Canada: one based on more 
interprovincial trade; one that would not impede the movement of 
people and investment within the country; and one that would 
allow for co-operative approaches to the resolution of domestic 
trade disputes.
<P>
	Bill C-88 represents the federal government playing its part in 
doing just that. This bill establishes the framework that will allow 
us to continue to work to create a trading regime that will remove 
barriers to interprovincial trade in goods and services; that will 
reduce impediments to the movement of workers and investment 
capital between provinces; and that will provide a forum for the 
resolution of individual trade disputes without resorting to the 
courts.
<P>
	The process leading up to this bill has been a long one. It has 
involved many people and considered many issues and 
perspectives. In addition to the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments at both the ministerial and official levels, 
representatives of the private sector have been actively involved in 
the process.
<P>
	Representatives of the private sector and of business interests in 
particular, have kept the pressure on us at all levels of government 
to deal with the problems of interprovincial trade barriers and the 
consequential economic costs to Canada. The Canadian 
Manufacturers Association has estimated that barriers to trade in 
our domestic market cost the Canadian economy over $7 billion 
annually in job and income loss.
<P>
	There has been a long and thorough process under way to 
identify problem areas and to develop practical, workable 
solutions. A key characteristic of the process has been the spirit of 
co-operation which all the parties involved have demonstrated. In 
fact, the agreement on internal free trade is an outstanding example 
of what can be accomplished within a co-operative framework in 
Canada.
<P>
	It is also important to note that political parties of all stripes and 
all regional perspectives have been part of the process.
<P>
	One fundamental point agreed on by all the parties in the 
negotiation process is a recognition that a more open trading 
environment will be good for Canada.
<P>
	While the process was of long duration, it was characterized by 
co-operation and a sense of shared mission. The agreement 
represents a major step toward our shared objective of improving 
the domestic trading environment and to eliminating barriers to 
trade, investment and labour mobility in Canada.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade provides for the following: a 
rules based system for trade within Canada; a dispute settlement 
mechanism to resolve issues on internal trade matters; a standstill 
on new barriers; commitments to future negotiations to broaden 
and deepen the agreement; a code of conduct to prevent destructive 
competition from investment; increased labour mobility; and a 
commitment to reconcile standards related measures. These are 
significant achievements.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	A key part of this agreement, indeed a key part of any trade 
agreement, is in how it resolves disputes. This agreement 
represents a unique solution to our unique Canadian circumstances. 
It has a made in Canada solution and it provides the basis for 
promoting compliance through consultation and co-operation 
rather than by resorting to more formal court based procedures. It is 
built on rules that draw on established concepts in the international 
trading environment, but has been refined for use in a Canadian 
context.
<P>
	In the international trading environment there are several 
examples of accords and agreements which set out rules for trading 
between nations. There are many, many different models for 
settling disputes and achieving compliance. Well known examples 
include the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, commonly 
known as GATT, and now the new World Trade Organization, the 
WTO, the European Union and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.
<P>
	There have been suggestions that we in Canada should just use 
one or another of these models in the Canadian situation. These 
suggestions overlook the important issue of the sovereignty of the 
parties to an agreement, as well as the degree of political control 
that the parties themselves are willing to give up to a compliance 
mechanism.
<P>
	In the case of the European Union for example, the central 
authority is supreme over that of the individual member countries. 
The European Union accord is a comprehensive agreement which 
gives the central governing authority the overriding power to 
propose and enact legislation that applies to all parties. That system 
is based on a legislative and judicial framework, so that a business 
firm or an individual who feels aggrieved by an action under the 
law of a particular nation can bring the case to the European Union 
council as the supreme authority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16116"> 16116 </A></B>
<P>
	Thus the parties to the European Union agreement have 
relinquished their sovereign authority in particular areas of trade 
law, competition policy and government support for industry and 
have agreed to accept a formal dispute settlement mechanism with 
the power to enforce decisions. If we applied this model to 
Canada, it would mean that the federal government would exercise 
authority over all the other jurisdictions. I wonder if those who 
recommend the European model are aware of that.
<P>
	The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, offers a 
different model. Under GATT, member nations do not relinquish 
sovereign authority and disputes are brought forward by a 
sovereign government representing its national interest. Disputes 
are referred to an ad hoc panel that can recommend that a trade 
policy or course of action be changed, but the recommendation 
cannot be enforced in law. Thus parties to GATT retain their 
sovereign right to enact and enforce laws within their own country, 
but do not have recourse to an enforcement mechanism to change 
non-compliant behaviour outside their own boundaries.
<P>
	The North American Free Trade Agreement is closer to the 
GATT model in that sovereignty remains within the national 
government of each state and disputes are brought forward by 
governments to the NAFTA commission, which is made up of the 
responsible ministers of each country who will set up a panel to 
consider specific disputes.
<P>
	Whereas parties to the NAFTA retain sovereign authority with 
respect to enacting and enforcing national legislation, they have 
agreed to accept the authority of the NAFTA commission to 
administer retaliatory measures on behalf of aggrieved parties as 
enforceable sanctions. Thus, under NAFTA, parties remain 
sovereign states but have effectively ceded some of their 
sovereignty.
<P>
	While all of these models have useful elements, none was 
applicable to the Canadian situation.
<P>
	The internal trade agreement created a committee on internal 
trade to oversee its implementation and continuing operation. All 
governments who are party to the agreement, that is the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments, are members of the 
committee.
<P>
	The committee will be supported by a secretariat which is to 
provide administrative and operational services. Part of the 
mandate of the committee is to assist in the resolution of disputes 
arising out of interpretations and applications of the agreement.
<P>
	The working philosophy of the committee and of the agreement 
is to use consultation and conciliation in dispute resolution. 
Disputing parties will be encouraged to make every attempt 
through co-operation, consultations and other forms of dispute 
resolution to arrive at a solution.
<P>
	I would suggest that Bill C-88 should be supported by all 
members of this House. It is a progressive measure, a progressive 
law. It will be good for the country. It will be good for the 
constituents of Erie riding which I represent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
speaking today on Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement on 
internal trade.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	As we are aware, the federal government must implement that 
agreement through Parliament. There are a number of points 
covered in this bill: the process for appointment of a federal 
representative to the Committee on Internal Trade; payment of the 
federal government's share of expenditures associated with 
operating the secretariat; the power of the governor in council to 
suspend, in special cases, the benefits granted under the agreement. 
Also, no private course of action may be taken based on the text or 
its implementing orders, nor the dispositions of the agreement, 
other than specific exceptions, without the consent of the Attorney 
General of Canada. Here are a few more: retaliatory powers where 
the federal government is an injured party; changes in certain 
federal legislative texts to bring them in line with the agreement, 
such as the Financial Administration Act, the Crown Liability and 
Proceedings Act, the Interest Act and the Motor Vehicle Transport 
Act.
<P>
	The role of the Committee on Internal Trade is to supervise 
implementation of the agreement and to facilitate dispute 
settlement. This bill ensures equal treatment of individuals, goods 
and businesses, regardless of their origin within Canada. It 
harmonizes standards and regulations in order to eliminate certain 
practices which might present an obstacle to interprovincial trade. 
It calls for the free movement of individuals, goods and capital.
<P>
	The eleven sectors covered by the agreement are public 
contracts, investments, labour mobility, consumer measures and 
standards, agrifood products, alcoholic beverages, natural resource 
processing, communications, transportation, energy, and 
environmental protection. These various sectors are affected to 
varying degrees.
<P>
	Retaliatory measures may be taken by the injured party against 
the party does not comply with the agreement. A party may be a 
province, a territory or the federal government.
<P>
	The main purpose of Bill C-88 is to implement the Agreement on 
Internal Trade. As other members of my party have already said, 
the Bloc Quebecois has always supported free trade, both internally 
and internationally. Consequently, we support the principle of this 
bill, and I must say I never understood why trade barriers existed 
between the various provinces in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16117"> 16117 </A></B>
<P>
	I may point out that I object to the wording of clause 9 which 
provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory measures of 
equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, 
the Governor in Council may, by order, do any one or more of the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It could be interpreted to mean that the federal government may 
intervene and impose retaliatory measures even when it is not a 
party to the dispute. Through this bill, Ottawa acquires a 
mechanism for imposing sanctions on the provinces. In fact, the 
federal government could impose all kinds of sanctions, including 
a reduction in transfer payments for provinces that do not abide by 
the agreement. This new intrusion by the federal government is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I said the Bloc Quebecois supports free trade both internally and 
internationally. I would like to comment briefly on NAFTA and 
continental free trade in the Americas.
<P>
	At the summit meeting attended by presidents and government 
leaders in Miami, in December 1993, there was some discussion of 
this topic, and it was decided to expand NAFTA to include all 
countries in the three Americas in the largest free trade zone ever, 
from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The first country to sign this free trade agreement after the 
United States, Canada and Mexico will be Chile, and I fully and 
strongly support the decision of Chile, my country of birth, to 
become a member of NAFTA. The Bloc Quebecois has done so as 
well. Everything was in place for Chile to become a member of 
NAFTA on January 1, 1996, but unfortunately, the fast-track 
legislation was not passed by the U.S. Congress, and there will be 
no quick negotiations as planned. It will take several months more 
before Chile can sign this agreement.
<P>
	I would also like to say that, although I am in favour of free trade 
zones, including NAFTA, I am very critical of the agreement, 
especially its lack of a social dimension, although a parallel 
agreement on labour was adopted and a secretariat is starting to 
operate in Texas with officials from all three countries. Last March, 
I attended a conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to discuss the 
social aspects of NAFTA with participants from Mexico, Puerto 
Rico, the United States, Canada and Quebec. We noticed, as I do 
now, that unfortunately there has been very little debate in this 
Parliament and in Canada as a whole on the impact of NAFTA on 
workers. I found that unions do not play a role at all in the 
operation and administration of NAFTA.
<P>
	Having lived in Europe for a number of years, I am familiar with 
the European integration process. I found that Europeans had more 
social concerns. Their treaty, for example, contains provision for 
the creation of a  special fund to assist workers affected by the 
European common market; a social charter, containing principles 
and provisions protecting workers, and an economic and social 
council where employers and workers may meet to discuss 
European integration.
<P>
	Unfortunately, NAFTA contains no provision for minimum 
working standards, except in three areas: minimum standards must 
be met in health and safety on the job, child labour is prohibited, 
and each country in NAFTA must comply with its minimum salary 
legislation. No standards are set, however, for the three countries. 
There is no standardization in either social or labour terms. 
Provision could have been made for the inclusion of international 
labour standards in NAFTA, such as the convention on the right to 
unionize, unrestricted collective bargaining and the right of 
association. NAFTA contains no provision on the free movement of 
labour and nothing to protect immigrant workers. International free 
trade agreements must contain a social element, just as this social 
element must be included in free trade or common market 
agreements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the agreement on 
international trade came into effect on July 1. Bill C-88 is intended 
to make it possible for the federal government to comply fully with 
its obligations under the agreement. I therefore believe that it is 
important for the House to proceed expeditiously in its 
consideration of Bill C-88.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	For years, business and private sector groups have complained to 
both the federal and provincial governments about domestic trade 
barriers and impediments to a free and open internal market. 
Numerous studies going back as far as the 1940 Rowell-Sirois 
commission have recognized the issue and documented the broad 
scope of the problem.
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers' Association in 1991 estimated the 
cost associated with barriers and economic inefficiencies to be 
approximately $6.5 billion annually. The most recent Statistics 
Canada figures indicate that interprovincial exports of goods and 
services in 1990 were worth $141 billion annually and responsible 
directly or indirectly for 1.7 million jobs.
<P>
	A recent study by the chamber of commerce underlined the fact 
that the Canadian internal market is the most interdependent of any 
area in the world. In agreeing to negotiate the agreement, Canadian 
governments recognized that how well our domestic economy 
works is key to how we will prosper as a nation and how we will 
compete in the international economy. An open domestic market 
and economy will allow Canadians and Canadian companies to 
strengthen their international competitiveness and develop new  
opportunities to grow and prosper. The alternative offers only an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16118"> 16118 </A></B>
<P>
ultimately self-destructive protectionism that benefits only a few 
special interests at the cost of the country as a whole.
<P>
	When they agreed to negotiate the agreement on internal trade, 
the federal, provincial, and territorial governments all recognized 
and accepted the importance of working together in the national 
interest. In concluding the agreement, Canadian governments have 
demonstrated that they are prepared to work together, both now and 
in the future.
<P>
	As the Minister of Industry has said in the House, the agreement 
is a consensual agreement. Some members opposite have criticized 
the agreement as inadequate and insufficient. The agreement may 
not be perfect, but it represents an improvement from where we 
were before. It reflects a consensus on the principle of an open and 
efficient national economy. It establishes a detailed rules 
framework for internal trade and it provides a consistent and 
defined process for preventing and resolving disputes that may 
arise over specific issues or measures.
<P>
	All the parties have accepted to a greater or lesser degree 
disciplines that in the sectors covered will improve how the 
national economy functions in the future. It will be possible, indeed 
it is the government's intention, to work to improve the agreement 
in the future and to expand its scope and coverage. For the moment 
it is a start, a point from which to start to work. We can and we 
should build on that.
<P>
	Some members have also criticized the government for not 
exercising its constitutional authority over interprovincial trade to 
open an internal market more forcibly. The national economy has 
become considerably more complex than it was when the 
constitutional powers of the different levels of governments were 
first agreed to in 1867. In the context of today's economy and 
modern Canadian federalism, the views of these critics are, frankly 
speaking, simplistic.
<P>
	If anything is clear it is that a country operates most successfully 
when all levels of government work co-operatively in the national 
interest, not unilaterally and certainly not by fiat. Governments 
were not negotiating constitutional change in the agreement on 
internal trade. Rather, they were developing the basis of working 
together with their respective powers and responsibilities to make 
the national economy work more effectively and efficiently.
<P>
	Unilateral action may be theoretically possible as a method to 
achieve the same ends. Some may consider it to be a desirable way 
of proceeding. However, it is simply not an effective or acceptable 
way to make Canadian federalism work.
<P>
	Some members opposite have suggested that the government has 
a hidden agenda on Bill C-88, that it conceals a power grab and is 
intended to provide a means  to force provinces to the will of the 
federal government. That is purely and simply wrong. The Minister 
of Industry has responded at length and in detail to those 
allegations. I will not dignify them with further comment. Those 
should preclude even the most obtuse interpretation of the bill's 
language.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-88 does not deal with the responsibilities of the provinces 
or provincial measures, only federal responsibilities and measures. 
It is intended only to make it possible for the federal government to 
comply fully with its obligations under the agreement and to play 
its part in making the agreement work.
<P>
	Bill C-88 gives the government specific authority or makes 
changes to certain pieces of legislation to enable it to act in 
accordance with its obligations. It also changes some existing 
legislation to make it easier for provinces to comply with some of 
their specific obligations under the agreement.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has indicated in a response to his 
provincial counterparts and to Senator Roberge that he intends to 
propose one or two amendments to Bill C-88 when it is considered 
in committee. I expect those will remove the grounds for 
misinterpretation or misrepresentation that some have made of the 
government's intentions.
<P>
	We should be clear in our understanding that Bill C-88 does not 
by itself legislate or give life to the agreement on internal trade. 
The agreement has already been signed by the parties-the federal, 
provincial, and territorial governments. When it came into effect 
July 1 all those governments became bound by the obligations they 
accepted when they signed the agreement.
<P>
	Each government is responsible itself for complying with its 
obligations and for living up to its responsibilities under the 
agreement. At the annual premiers conference this summer the 
provincial premiers and territorial leaders renewed their 
commitment to the agreement and to removing barriers. Two 
provinces, Alberta and Newfoundland, have already passed their 
implementing legislation.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I believe it is important that we on the federal 
side proceed expeditiously in our consideration of this legislation. 
The federal government has played a leading role in getting all 
governments to work together in the interests of all Canadians on 
international trade issues.
<P>
	Bill C-88 does what is necessary to ensure the federal level of 
government will be able to continue to play its role in the 
co-operative intergovernmental process. We should not delay it 
further.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to speak for a few minutes 
on Bill C-88 and look at some of the  allegations that have been 
made in previous debates by some members about Bill C-88 and 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16119"> 16119 </A></B>
<P>
unwarranted concerns those allegations may have engendered in 
other quarters.
<P>
	The opposition's allegations about Bill C-88 stem from an 
inability or an obstinate unwillingness to understand the plain 
meaning of the text of the bill. The Minister of Industry responded 
in detail to those allegations in this House in May and in June. I 
will refer to some of the points that need repeating.
<P>
	Only in rare cases would the federal government be a 
complainant in a dispute under the agreement on internal trade. If a 
dispute were resolved in favour of the federal government and if 
the province involved refused to comply with the impartial panel's 
findings, the federal government could withdraw benefits of 
equivalent effect.
<P>
	Such retaliation would have to be in the same sector as the 
original violation or in another sector covered by the agreement. 
Retaliation could not involve-and I think this is 
important-transfer payments or social programs because those 
things are not covered by the agreement.
<P>
	Bill C-88 does not make the federal government the policeman 
of the agreement on internal trade, as the opposition mistakenly 
insists. Any careful reading of the headnotes to clause 9 of Bill 
C-88 and article 1710 of the agreement on internal trade, combined 
with a minimum of logical reasoning, immediately gainsays the 
wild allegations that have been made.
<P>
	It is important to stress that Bill C-88 deals only with what the 
federal government must do to live up to its obligations under the 
internal trade agreement and nothing else. Notwithstanding the fact 
that the concerns expressed were totally unwarranted and clearly 
tactically motivated, the Minister of Industry has spent some time 
in committee and in other places speaking to the amendments in 
Bill C-88.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I will reaffirm the fact that to date, Alberta and Newfoundland 
have passed legislation to implement the agreement and to comply 
with their respective obligations under it. Since tabling Bill C-88 in 
the House on May 1, in the cold light of day the actual substance of 
the bill has proven to be uncontroversial and designed only to 
enable the federal government to comply with its obligations under 
the agreement on internal trade and to meet the negotiated 
commitments, both legal and moral, to the other parties to the 
agreement, that is, the provinces and the territories.
<P>
	There is so much one can say in support of this bill. I want to 
stress the fact that this straightforward consideration of the bill has 
been more or less reaffirmed in the discussions and debates which 
have taken place. It is important to note the urgency of what we are 
asking now. The passing of Bill C-88 is important to underscore  
the federal part in ensuring the agreement is implemented.
<P>
	This is a historic piece of legislation. It will allow the federal 
government to continue to play a lead role in concert with the 
governments of the other parties to the agreement. It is also 
intended to implement the first comprehensive domestic trade 
agreement in Canada since the British North America Act in 1867.
<P>
	In the 128 years since 1867 the Canadian economy has grown 
and evolved in ways never imagined by the fathers of 
Confederation. The federal government still has constitutional 
responsibility for interprovincial trade and commerce, but 
successive governments as a matter of policy have chosen to work 
co-operatively with the provinces to address internal trade 
problems.
<P>
	Barriers and impediments to internal trade lead to the inefficient 
use of resources. They limit the ability of industry to take 
advantages of economies of scale and to maintain competitive 
market positions. The result is to reduce the competitiveness of 
Canadian business and to adversely affect the Canadian economy.
<P>
	It is incumbent on all Canadian governments to work together to 
make the national economy work as effectively and efficiently as 
possible so that all Canadians can enjoy the benefits of strong 
economic development, growth and prosperity. I call on all 
members to look at this straightforward legislation which will 
provide the needed facility as we work together to provide the kind 
of environment needed by our businesses.
<P>
	We have sought to work co-operatively. The whole process 
which produced the agreement is testament to that. Our approach 
has been one which speaks to the fact that we are a truly 
responsible Canadian government. As a truly responsible Canadian 
government we can take those working arrangements between 
provinces into the future. I call on hon. members to give their 
support.

	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-103, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and the Income 
Tax Act be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am delighted to introduce for third 
reading Bill C-103, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and the 
Income Tax Act, a measure in support of Canada's magazine 
industry.
<P>
	Canadian periodicals are a vital element of our cultural 
expression. They provide news and information, critical analysis, 
informed discourse and lively dialogue, all of which contribute to 
our sense of identity as Canadians.
<P>
	In cultural terms, the Canadian magazine industry is a 
flourishing sector with over 1,300 titles available from over 1,000 
publishers. The editorial pages of Canadian magazines contain 
ideas and information that are the page equivalent of 2,500 books 
per year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Magazines reach specialized audiences not accessible to the 
other media, such as newspapers and television. They target new 
audiences and give them an opportunity to speak, thus creating a 
bond between readers who share similar ideas. Clearly, they offer 
very significant cultural advantages to a society as scattered and 
disparate as our own.
<P>
	Canadian magazines also provide writers and artists with a 
means of expression. About 92 per cent of the editorial content of 
Canadian periodicals is produced by Canadian writers employed by 
these periodicals or working for them on a freelance basis. 
Canadians are also responsible for over 92 per cent of illustrations 
and photographs.
<P>
	Canadians have access to a wide array of Canadian periodicals, 
from current affairs magazines like <I>L'Actualité</I> and <I>Maclean's</I>, to 
special interest publications in areas such as the arts, science and 
leisure, to general interest magazines aimed at a wide audience.
<P>
	Some of these publications are academic in nature while others 
are low circulation magazines whose openness to experimentation 
in the arts and literature leads to cultural renewal.
<P>
	The first Canadian periodicals were created in Nova Scotia at the 
end of the 18th century by immigrants from New England. The 
history of periodicals in Canada follows that of many writers, 
artists and merchants. It has led to the conception of innovative 
ideas, to the creation of original visual images, and to the 
emergence of new forms of cultural expression.
<P>
	More importantly, the history of periodicals in Canada is also a 
political saga in which individual interests have survived in an 
environment dominated by foreign interests.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	For the government, the challenge has always been to strike a 
balance between preserving Canada's cultural autonomy and 
allowing the free flow of ideas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The factors that define the environment in which Canadian 
publishers compete for Canadian readers include: the impact of 
foreign magazines on the market; the relatively small size of the 
Canadian population; the difficulties and cost of distribution over 
our huge territory; the openness of Canadians to foreign cultural 
products; the effects of the cover prices of imported magazines on 
the Canadian price structure; news stand competition from foreign 
magazines; and the impact of overflow advertising on the potential 
advertising market in Canada.
<P>
	In addition, today's tough financial and fiscal environment takes 
its toll. In 1992 for example, more than half of Canadian magazines 
had no operating profits. The average operating profit for the 
industry as a whole was only 2.36 per cent. The success of the 
Canadian magazine industry can be better described as cultural 
rather than financial. Canadian publishing ventures of all types 
have been sustained by the creativity of writers and publishers and 
the interest of readers.
<P>
	Magazines must build and maintain their readership over the 
long term. Also essential to their survival are advertisers. Canadian 
magazines depend on advertising for 65 per cent of their revenue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government's policy concerning the Canadian magazine 
industry is to encourage Canadian businesses to advertise in 
Canadian periodicals and in periodicals whose content is original 
rather than recycled, and to help publishers reach their market.
<P>
	Since 1965, two measures have helped inject advertising 
revenues into the Canadian magazine industry. These two measures 
are customs tariff 9958, which prohibits the importing of split run 
periodicals,  and section 19 of the Income Tax Act, which permits 
the deduction of the costs of advertising directed at the Canadian 
market, provided this advertising is placed in Canadian editions of 
Canadian owned or controlled periodicals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16121"> 16121 </A></B>
<P>
	In April 1993, the arrival of <I>Sports Illustrated Canada</I> in our 
newsstands marked the beginning of a new way of dealing with the 
Canadian market for the American magazine industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada was able to sidestep tariff code 9958 
by electronically transmitting the main editorial content from the 
United States to a printer in Canada instead of physically importing 
the split run edition into Canada. Domestic ads were substituted for 
foreign ads and some original content was added to the existing 
editorial content. Thus, Sports Illustrated Canada demonstrated 
that the tariff code was no longer completely effective in dealing 
with split runs.
<P>
	This new development underscored the need to update the 
legislative measures in place to support this vital sector of our 
cultural industry. It has been asserted that Investment Canada Act 
guidelines announced in July 1993 effectively foreclosed the 
possibility of any further split runs in the Canadian market. These 
guidelines however, can only apply to businesses in Canada. As we 
have seen with <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada, the publisher does not 
need a place of business in Canada in order to publish split runs in 
our country. Hence, Bill C-103.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	First, an amendment to the Excise Tax Act will impose an excise 
tax on split run editions of periodicals attributed in Canada.
<P>
	Second, an amendment to section 19 of the Income Tax Act will 
add an anti-avoidance rule relating to the deductibility of 
advertising. This will ensure that newspapers and periodicals that 
purport to be Canadian are in fact Canadian owned and controlled.
<P>
	These are measures that will level the playing field for the 
Canadian magazine industry. That is fair. It is our responsibility to 
ensure that the Canadian magazine industry can compete for ad 
dollars.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The task force on the Canadian magazine industry was set up 
because the <I>Sports Illustrated Canada</I> case had demonstrated that 
the existing legislation could be circumvented. And I would like to 
clarify an important point here.
<P>
	The problem does not rest with the general idea of publishing a 
sports magazine in Canada. It has to do with advertising revenues. 
The fact that a split run edition of <I>Sports Illustrated Canada</I> was 
sold in our newsstands shows that split run editions can enter the 
Canadian advertising market in spite of the existing legislation.
<P>
	The task force set about its task in April 1993. Its mandate was to 
find sound and practical ways to ensure that the federal policy of 
assistance to the Canadian magazine industry would remain 
effective.
<P>
	Task force members had an extensive knowledge of and 
experience in the Canadian magazine industry. There were 
members from every region of the country, including advisors 
working for the advertising industry or the Consumers' Association 
of Canada, representatives of the Canadian magazine industry and 
international trade experts.
<P>
	This group of highly competent individuals carried out their task 
superbly. Not only did they provide us with an in-depth and 
up-to-date analysis of the Canadian magazine industry, but they 
also demonstrated the need to update existing legislative 
instruments governing the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have relied on the advice of the task force because it 
examined closely all possible options. For example, the task force 
concluded that split runs could lead to a possible loss of 40 per cent 
of the industry's advertising revenue. That is $200 million 
annually.
<P>
	Fiscal concerns ruled out establishing an industrial support 
program of such magnitude. The proposed tax is the most 
reasonable and practical structural measure. At 80 per cent, the tax 
can effectively achieve its objective of encouraging original 
content.
<P>
	The task force concluded that the adoption of an excise tax 
measure that encourages ad revenues to flow to periodicals 
containing original editorial content in magazines would be the 
best way to assist Canada's magazine industry in a manner 
consistent with our trade obligations. By promoting original 
content, the tax will also ensure that all publishers are competing 
on a more even footing for Canadian advertising revenue.
<P>
	A number of questions and concerns have been raised during the 
debate on Bill C-103. I would like to take this opportunity to 
address some of them.
<P>
	It has been suggested that Canadian magazine publishers should 
take advantage of the opportunities provided by the free trade 
agreement and sell into the United States. American popular 
culture is part of the every day life of Canadians and so the editorial 
content of American magazines is generally of interest to 
Canadians. The reverse is not true. Canadian popular culture and 
Canadian issues are not part of the every day life of Americans.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	To succeed in the United States, Canadian magazines would 
have to change their editorial content to such an extent they would 
no longer be Canadian magazines.
<P>
	The question has been raised whether the proposed excise tax is 
a valid use of the federal taxation power. Let  me assure the House 
that Bill C-103 is a valid exercise of the federal taxation power. The 
measure is of general application, since it will apply to any split run 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16122"> 16122 </A></B>
<P>
edition distributed in Canada. Tax measures are not always solely 
for the purpose of raising revenue. Tax measures may also be used 
for other economic and social objectives.
<P>
	Examples are the tax treatments of RRSP contributions and the 
child tax benefits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, to those who criticize such a tax because of its 
discriminatory nature, I say that this tax measure would apply to 
any split run edition, whether produced by a Canadian publisher or 
a foreign one.
<P>
	With Bill C-103, the government's objective is not to limit 
access to foreign magazines, but to preserve a market in which 
Canadian publications can do well in our country and continue to 
be sold alongside foreign magazines.
<P>
	The federal policy of supporting the Canadian magazine industry 
has been in place for a long time and remains unchanged. In fact, 
Bill C-103 reinforces that policy by adapting it to the new reality. 
This legislation will enable the industry to meet the challenges 
created by technological changes, such as those which have 
resulted in the split run edition phenomenon in Canada.
<P>
	An open and stable structure for transborder exchanges is one of 
the greatest assets for our country. In a huge and diversified world 
market, with globalization increasingly prevalent, our culture 
allows us to be different from the other countries. As a government, 
the challenge is, as always, to maintain efficient policies and policy 
instruments that will promote cultural development. We must also 
seek to achieve a balance between the sometimes competing 
interests of our foreign trade, on the one hand, and the preservation 
of our cultural identity, on the other.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-103 meets those important objectives. Canadians value 
who they are as a people and as a country. They want and deserve 
access to cultural products that mirror the Canadian experience and 
outlook, to give Canadians what they want and deserve, means 
ensuring that our cultural industries remain healthy.
<P>
	It is not enough to say, for example, that the circulation of the top 
Canadian magazines has increased while the circulation of the top 
U.S. magazines in Canada has decreased. The reality is that 
Canada's top magazines are up against the combined force of the 
much larger number of American magazines in circulation.
<P>
	In conclusion, the 1970s and the 1980s saw an unprecedented 
explosion of cultural activity which produced a broad range of 
Canadian artistic products. During this time Canadians continued 
to define themselves and their values in a uniquely Canadian way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government has taken several measures to increase 
the share of the internal market held by Canadian cultural products, 
and to improve the ability of Canadian artists and cultural 
industries to create and market their products in our country. In the 
nineties, the Canadian cultural policy expanded, so as to include 
many new components. This complexity is the result of market 
globalization, as well as the extraordinary development of our 
artistic and cultural activities.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The main objective of our cultural policy still is to make sure 
that Canadians have access to Canadian products in order for them 
to share common values and symbols and continue to develop a 
cultural identity fitting their image.
<P>
	Bill C-103 is an extension of our cultural policy. Even if the 
challenges are many, our track record shows that we can not only 
meet them but do an excellent job of it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will conclude with a quote from the report of the task force on 
the Canadian magazine industry. ``Magazines help foster in 
Canadians a sense of ourselves. They enable us to see ourselves as 
no others see us. They also enable us to view the rest of the world 
from a Canadian standpoint. They are the thread which binds 
together the fibres of our nation''.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to support Bill C-103 at third reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating, at third reading, Bill C-103, an act 
to amend the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act. On behalf of 
the Bloc Quebecois, I rise today to reiterate our support of this bill, 
which is basically aimed at putting an end to the distribution of 
split run editions in Canada and at strengthening the provision 
granting tax deductions to Canadian companies advertising in 
Canadian newspapers and magazines.
<P>
	For the benefit of our listeners, I should add that a split run 
edition is an edition in which more than 20 per cent of the editorial 
content is of foreign origin.
<P>
	It is important to note that this bill was made necessary by the 
government's lack of action to take the required steps to ban split 
run editions in Canada.
<P>
	In 1993, Time Warner advised the Canadian government that it 
intended to distribute a split run edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> in 
Canada. As I said in my September 25 speech, instead of acting, the 
government chose to appoint a task force to study the issue. <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> went ahead with its plan unhindered and with the full 
knowledge of the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16123"> 16123 </A></B>
<P>
	Time Warner simply decided to electronically send the editorial 
content of its American magazine to Canada. It then sold 
advertisement to Canadian companies, and printed and distributed 
its magazine in Canada. Therefore, dumping advertising was 
possible for <I>Sports Illustrated</I> because its domestic market already 
covered its production costs. It could sell ads much cheaper and 
undermine the magazine industry in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	However, and I want to be clear on this point, that measure is not 
aimed only at <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. In fact, it became necessary 
because <I>Sports Illustrated</I> was the first magazine to circumvent the 
intent of the Canadian law. I know, and it was said repeatedly at the 
finance committee, that other businesses are only waiting for a 
slight bending on the part of the Canadian legislators to do exactly 
what <I>Sports Illustrated</I> did, that is transfer some editorial content 
to Canada and practice advertisement dumping.
<P>
	I would also like to remind you that this bill was requested by 
representatives of the magazine industry in Quebec and Canada 
mainly for two reasons: first, because the industry could not have 
grown without the proper protection measures and second, because 
there is no financial security in that sector of the cultural industry.
<P>
	For example, at the finance committee, Mr. Jean Paré, editor of 
<I>L'actualité</I> and representative of the Association québécoise des 
éditeurs de magazines, when speaking about the impact of the 
measures implemented by Canada to protect the Canadian 
magazine industry, told the committee that most of these 
magazines would not exist without the measures that successive 
federal governments have implemented over the last 30 years to 
level the playing field for Canadian businesses in the international 
market and ensure fair competition.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	``The proof of our argument is that, before this legislation was 
adopted, our industry was nonexistent. The magazine I represent 
will be just 20 years old in a few months. When it was started up, 
only three of the 57 periodicals I represent today were in existence. 
The combined annual circulation of those in existence at that time 
was a mere six million copies. Today, our 57 members have a total 
of 80 million annual circulation; with the nonmembers added in, 
the figure is 138 million. The legislation adopted 25 years ago 
triggered investment in these businesses. The magazine industry in 
English Canada has followed almost the same path.''
<P>
	In his presentation to the Finance Committee, Mr. Paré indicated 
that, at first sight, one might think that these figures indicate that 
the magazine sector is a healthy one, but this is not the case. In fact, 
his statement to the Committee confirmed the conclusions of the 
task force on the Canadian periodical industry. Mr. Paré said:
<P>
	``One might think that this is a robust and flourishing sector of 
the communications industry. Not in the least. Nine out of ten of 
these magazines are not cost-effective and are in existence solely 
because the publisher has a few profitable titles. This minority of 
profitable magazines, moreover, has to settle for profits that, on the 
average, barely exceed 10 per cent, far from what is considered a 
minimum in the US. Between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of these 
magazines' revenues come from advertising and a 10 per cent cut 
in advertising would probably wipe out the entire Canadian 
magazine industry''.
<P>
	<I>Sports Illustrated</I> also testified before the Finance Committee. 
During its presentation, the company stated that Bill C-103 was 
unfair because it specifically targeted <I>Sports Illustrated</I>.
<P>
	In fact, it is true that the bill calls for imposition of an 80 per cent 
excise tax on the advertising revenues of split run magazines, and 
that this measure must be applied to <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. The bill 
states that this measure does not apply to those split run periodicals 
which were already published and distributed in Canada as at 
March 26, 1993, and <I>Sports Illustrated</I> began its Canadian 
distribution on April 1, 1993.
<P>
	Unlike what Time Warner, the publishers of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, 
would have us believe, this measure is not solely aimed at its 
magazine. In his presentation to the finance committee, Mr. Paré 
described as follows the competition Quebec magazines might face 
if Bill C-103 were not passed by this House, and I quote:
<P>
	``The publishing giants are not all American. They do not 
publish in English alone. The competition comes from German, 
French and British companies as well. These gigantic concerns, 
which may own hundreds of different magazines, the smallest with 
a circulation that sometimes exceeds that of the biggest Canadian 
magazines, are increasingly publishing in all languages in compact 
editions with adapted content, in order to skim off advertising 
revenue in as many markets as possible. These international 
publishers are now discovering Canada''.
<P>
	So Bill C-103 is not exclusively aimed at <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, as 
Time Warner would have us believe, but also at all the other 
magazine publishers who are waiting to see what will happen to 
this attempt by an American magazine to enter the Canadian 
market.
<P>
	In its presentation to the finance committee, <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
insisted that it participated in Canadian life, first by printing stories 
on Canadian teams and athletes like the Toronto Blue Jays and 
Elvis Stojko, and second, by creating jobs in Canada. In this respect 
the magazine's representatives stated, and I quote:
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16124"> 16124 </A></B>
<P>
	``-the company saw this as an opportunity to create jobs for 
Canadians in printing and distribution, and assignment 
opportunities for Canadian journalists and sports photographers''.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	According to our information, however, Canadian content in 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> is minimal. Furthermore, it seems that the stories 
in <I>Sports Illustrated</I> that feature Canadian athletes would have 
been included in any event in the U.S. version of the magazine. 
Elvis Stojko may be a Canadian, but he also won the gold for figure 
skating, which makes him an international star, so it is not 
surprising he would be featured in <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. In fact, it 
would be surprising if <I>Sports Illustrated</I> did not have a story on 
Elvis Stojko.
<P>
	As for job creation, I am told that the contribution of Sports 
Illustrated in this area is rather meagre. With both versions of 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> being produced entirely in the New York, 
Canada's editorial contribution was to all intents and purposes nil. 
As to the job of printing, one printer estimates it takes a maximum 
of nine hours press time to print an issue of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. We 
really have to ask ourselves just how much <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
contributes to Canadian culture and employment.
<P>
	On the other hand, <I>Sports Illustrated</I> clearly creams off the 
advertising market by selling its advertising space at cut prices. In 
its brief to the Standing Committee on Finance, the magazine 
announced its intention to change from a monthly format to a 
weekly one, an announcement that will hardly be reassuring for the 
Canadian industry, if the government does not act diligently.
<P>
	This legislative measure is important for the magazine industry. 
I would, however, like to take this opportunity today to remind the 
government that it must also implement the other measures put 
forward by the task force on the magazine industry.
<P>
	They are: first, freeze the funds set aside for the postal subsidy 
program at their 1995 level and second, remove the GST from all 
reading materials. The Liberal Party of Canada made clear and 
formal commitments in this regard. It passed a resolution to the 
effect that a Liberal government would reaffirm the historical 
principle of not taxing the publishing industry and would remove 
the goods and services tax, the GST, from all reading materials. We 
are still waiting for these promises to take effect.
<P>
	Third, the Government of Canada should be obliged and the 
provincial governments encouraged to place advertising messages 
to the people of Canada in Canadian magazines only. Fourth, the 
Investment Canada Act should be amended to ensure that the 
Department of Canadian Heritage vets all measures approved by 
Investment Canada concerning periodicals and magazines.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address Bill C-103.
<P>
	The real question governments have to ask themselves when 
they are creating legislation that deals with issues like cultural 
trade policy is who is the real guardian of cultural trade or culture 
in Canada. We have to ask ourselves who is the real protector of 
consumers. Is it the government or is it Canadians themselves? 
Those are the critical issues.
<P>
	I will not talk today about the technical aspects of this piece of 
legislation. We have done that in committee and over the last 
several days in other speeches. I will not get into that, but I want to 
talk a lot about the principle that surrounds who determines what 
culture is, which culture is worth protecting and why culture should 
be protected at all. That is the critical issue underlying the debate 
today. We are having a technical debate about this piece of 
legislation but it goes deeper than that. It goes right down to who is 
the guardian of culture in Canada. We can even extend that and say 
that it applies to the debate we have had on what is going on in 
Quebec, the referendum campaign, and who makes determinations 
about who knows best what is culture and that kind of thing.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I will talk about that matter over the course of my speech from a 
couple of different perspectives. I will to talk about it from the 
cultural perspective and from the economic perspective. Again the 
question is: Who knows better what is best for the ordinary 
consumer of cultural and the protection of culture and who knows 
best for the ordinary consumer, the ordinary person who pays 
taxes? I would argue in both cases that ideally it is individuals 
themselves and failing that it is lower levels of government.
<P>
	First I will talk about the economic issues. The minister spoke at 
great length about how it was important to protect the magazine 
industry in Canada and that we needed the legislation to do it. What 
about all the other people affected by the legislation? It is not just 
the magazine industry that has a stake in it. Certainly advertisers 
use magazines as a vehicle to get their message out to the 
consumers. What effect will the legislation have on them?
<P>
	I will give an example of how the legislation harms the ordinary 
advertiser and why that is a problem. A business somewhere in 
Ontario is selling computers and using <I>Sports Illustrated</I> to get its 
message out because it had the perfect demographic and the right 
audience. All of a sudden it will be denied that vehicle. However its 
competitor, IBM out of the U.S., will not be denied that vehicle. It 
will be able to use SI's North American circulation to deliver that 
message against me. In doing that it will have an unfair competitive 
advantage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16125"> 16125 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not the fault of the business in Ontario that is trying to 
sell computers. It is the fault of the government that is denying 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> the chance to come into Canada and sell 
advertising to businesses like that. These products have a value 
to the people who use them. That is why they spend money on 
them.
<P>
	We are denying that business a chance to use that vehicle to 
capture its own market. We may have a situation where IBM is 
coming in and is dominant in Canada because it has access to very 
cheap advertising that the business from somewhere in Ontario 
does not have. We are discriminating against the advertisers, the 
businesses that are employers of people and pay taxes to the 
Government of Canada. We denying them that chance. That is one 
reason the legislation is wrong.
<P>
	The hon. minister talked about the fact that there are many 
Canadian magazines and people have access to them. What about 
the magazines we do not have access to because of the legislation? 
We do not know which ones they are. One of the theories of 
economics is that we never see the sometimes unintended, invisible 
results of economic policies.
<P>
	What about those who cannot afford the subscription rates? 
What about those magazines? What about the ones that use the 
advertising revenue to get a wider distribution so they can charge 
more for their advertising? We will never hear about those 
magazines. They will never come here because they cannot support 
their subscription rates with more advertising rates. We are denied 
access to those. We will never know what we are missing because 
we will never see those magazines.
<P>
	The same argument goes to the price that we pay for the ones that 
get here.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	It is well known that prices are much higher in Canada for 
American or foreign magazines than they would be in their country 
of origin. I would argue that the reason for that is because the 
subscription price cannot be underwitten by the advertising 
revenues. So we again have a situation in which the consumers are 
taking it in the ear so that we can protect a certain privileged class, 
a group of people who publish magazines in this country and are 
lucky enough to enjoy the protection of the Canadian government.
<P>
	In all these ways, consumers and advertisers are paying a high 
price for this government's policy. I point out again that in doing 
that we are denying people the chance to take their disposable 
income and spend it in other areas and cause the economy to grow 
and create jobs, the multiplier effect, et cetera. That is precisely 
how it works when there is free trade.
<P>
	Before I talk about free trade in general I want to talk for a 
moment about the idea of an 80 per cent tax and about the 
principles the Canadian magazine industry has fought this issue on. 
To find out where those principles  come from I think we have to go 
back to an earlier debate, to the debate about the GST.
<P>
	There was an enlightening article in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> on 
Monday, October 30, which I would like to quote. I think it puts the 
argument of the Canadian magazine industry into perspective and 
helps us to understand where they are coming from. This is from an 
article by William Watson, economic affairs editor of the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Those who support the law, i.e., the Canadian magazine industry, argue the 
Americans have an unfair advantage. Their U.S. stories have already been 
written and therefore cost the split run virtually nothing. By contrast, editorial 
content in all Canadian magazines is all new for the Canadian market, so the 
playing field is uneven.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, the playing field for bananas and oranges is uneven too: tropical 
countries produce them much more cheaply than we do, but we do not insist 
Canadian fruit lovers buy Canadian-made oranges and bananas. If Canadian 
readers prefer cheaper U.S. editorial content to more expensive Canadian 
editorial content, why should Ottawa interfere with their choice?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the GST was first being debated, the Canadian publishing industry ran 
an ad campaign, the gist of which was that other countries used to burn books, 
we just tax them. But now the very same industry is pushing an 80 per cent tax 
on one form of reading material.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Burning books is OK, I guess, so long as the books are American.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think a very good argument is made in this article against the 
argument the Canadian magazine industry was using. They also 
make a very cogent argument for individual Canadians to be the 
protectors of culture. They are saying that individual Canadians 
should be the guardians of culture in this country.
<P>
	It is the old cliché that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. While 
the Government of Canada may think something is not very good 
editorial comment or content and it may somehow be un-Canadian, 
other people may appreciate it. It enriches their lives, as reading 
always does. They find it fulfilling. That is why they read it.
<P>
	By denying some of these magazines a chance to earn revenue by 
picking up advertisers in this country, we are in some cases denying 
them the chance to actually send their magazines into this country. 
I think this article absolutely explodes the argument of the 
Canadian magazine publishing industry, going back to the GST 
debate, about the GST being a form of book burning then, but when 
there is an 80 per cent tax on <I>Sports Illustrated</I> it is somehow 
different.
<P>
	I really do think this argument is all about who should be the real 
guardians of culture in this country. I could go on about that in 
more detail, but I want to get on to the whole idea of free trade and 
something I talked about yesterday. It makes the point and so I will 
raise it again.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16126"> 16126 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I remember from the free trade debate in 1988 all the articles and 
various newspaper, video, and TV clips that we saw about the effect 
free trade was going to have on the wine industry in Canada. I bet a 
lot of people remember that. I remember how people said it was 
going to devastate grape growers and the wine industry in Canada. 
There were all kinds of protests. We saw them in the Okanagan and 
also in southern Ontario.
<P>
	At the end of the day, completely the opposite was the case. Not 
only did the wine industry thrive, it is now acknowledged around 
the world as one of the finest wine industries in the world. We have 
won all kinds of rewards as a result of the competition free trade 
brought in, which forced wine growers to become efficient and 
among the best in the world.
<P>
	The same happens in every sector when we allow it to happen. It 
gets back to this whole argument about who decides what is right 
for the country. Should it be the government or vested interests? 
Should it be particular interests, which of course will never turn 
down protection from the government? They will in fact invite it. 
However, at the end of the day, what is best for consumers? 
Consumers end up with a cheaper product. They end up with more 
selection. They end up with the highest quality. Should that not be 
the standard we strive for? I think that is exactly what we get when 
we have free trade, even in the cultural industries.
<P>
	Again I say that Canadians themselves should be the guardians 
and protectors of their own culture. They are more than capable of 
doing that. They are very sophisticated people. They can make 
those decisions for themselves. I want to point to some examples 
where I think the cultural industry is doing extremely well, where it 
does compete in the world extremely well.
<P>
	Before I do that I want to touch on an issue the minister raised. 
He talked about general interest magazines being of interest to 
Canadians when they come from the United States but not 
necessarily the other way around. In other words, Americans may 
not be very interested in general interest magazines that come from 
Canada. I do not really disagree with that; I think that is probably 
true. We could make some arguments that if there are retired 
Canadian people down in the States there may be some interest in 
these general interest magazines. That is probably true, but that is 
really not the point.
<P>
	I take the minister's point. However, what about all the specialty 
magazines? What about, for instance, a golf magazine? Why does a 
golf magazine have to come from the United States? Why cannot 
golf magazines come from Canada and be exported into the United 
States? For crying out loud, there is no difference in the game from 
one country to the other. In fact we have Canadian golfers on the 
professional golf tour. Why can it not work that way?
<P>
	We had a witness before us who I guess was representing the 
interests of the Canadian magazine industry, but that person 
acknowledged that their magazine has about 30 per cent of their 
circulation into the United States. Obviously that is not something 
they would want to lose. It helps them to make a profit and 
strengthens their industry.
<P>
	I would argue that if we want to strengthen the industries then we 
cannot rely on the tiny population, relatively speaking, that Canada 
has compared to the United States or the rest of the world. To 
further make the point, when we had a member of the Quebec 
magazine publishing industry before us he talked about the threat 
Quebec magazines faced if split run publishing was allowed in 
Canada. He talked about the possibility of all these magazines from 
other countries in the world coming in. He was not so worried 
about the U.S., of course, because it did not publish that often in 
French, but the big competitor was France. He talked specifically 
about France and actually Germany. He also talked about the 
Swedes, the Swiss, the Belgians being a threat. That struck me as 
very odd, because here are tiny countries, smaller in some cases 
than Canada, and they are a threat to Canada with their publishing 
industry. That struck me as extremely odd.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	If you think about it, what they have realized and what they are 
doing is saying they cannot survive, probably the French 
juggernaut as well, by remaining insular, by looking inward. They 
have to take their product and market it to the rest of the world. 
They were trying to do that in Quebec and no doubt in other places 
around the world. That is how they were not only surviving but 
thriving.
<P>
	To me that makes eminent sense. If you have a small market, the 
best way to turn the tables on the guys who are using the economy 
of scale on you is to turn around and use it back on them, to use 
your editorial comment and mass produce it to get into other 
countries around the world. In specialty magazines that can be 
done. We are seeing it to some degree through Canadian magazines 
already in the United States, but there is certainly a tremendous 
market to keep doing it or there is a tremendous market there and 
tremendous potential to keep expanding.
<P>
	If we put impediments in place that prevent us from doing that, 
like the clause in the split run bill, Bill C-103, which does not allow 
Canadian magazines-this is unbelievable-that have a circulation 
in the United States that is less than it is in Canada to send back the 
editorial content via split run to Canada, then we are putting up an 
impediment that prevents our magazine industry from becoming 
bigger and from going out into these other countries and really 
making it more viable over the long run. I do not understand why in 
the world we are doing that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16127"> 16127 </A></B>
<P>
	We had people before the committee and one of the magazines 
doing that is <I>Harrowsmith</I>, a Canadian magazine that has a 
circulation in the United States. It is publishing out of New York 
and sending stuff back by split run to Canada and using the same 
content, but it is a Canadian magazine. Those people voluntarily 
said that if this is to be an argument used against this legislation, 
they will quit doing split run because at the end of the day it is 
in their best interest. That is not an argument, in my judgment. 
It is fine for them to say that; they are established down there now. 
But what about the guys who want to go down there and get 
established by having, for instance, a specialty magazine that 
appeals to Canadians and to Americans and to anybody who 
speaks the English language? Why are we standing in the way of 
that? That is the way to make our industry viable.
<P>
	From what I have seen in the book publishing industry, we have 
some of the best writers in the world. We can produce editorial 
content that is better than anybody else's in the world. We have 
proven that before. You look at the book publishing industry and at 
how widely read Canadian books are around the world and you 
know we are producers of great writers. We can do that. The same 
argument applies when we are talking about French writers. We 
could produce some of the best editorial content in the world, but 
we are being denied the right to do that, partially through this split 
run clause in the legislation.
<P>
	It is more than that. It is the attitude. We are saying do not let the 
Americans in and we will not go in there. It is kind of a saw-off. It 
is crazy when we have so much to share with the rest of the world, 
the best artists and writers and creators of all kinds in this country. 
It is absolutely crazy that we are doing that.
<P>
	Yesterday I mentioned this, but I will bring up again the 
Canadian Association of Broadcasters convention I attended on the 
weekend. The minister was there as well and spoke to the 
convention. What I want to talk about is how Canadian 
broadcasters have really gone out and made a success of 
themselves around the world because they have not been afraid to 
use the economies of scale, taking Canadian product and using it 
across the world.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	One of the best examples of this is CanWest Global of Winnipeg 
which is huge in New Zealand and in Australia. Another very good 
example is Power Corp. which is now very big in Europe. I 
understand it is the biggest broadcaster in Europe and is doing 
extremely well. Another example is Electrohome Ltd. and there are 
others.
<P>
	These companies take the programming they produce here and to 
take full advantage of the economies of scale they have marketed 
around the world. They have done extremely well. It means jobs for 
Canadian film makers, jobs for Canadian actors, jobs for Canadian 
screenwriters. Already we have the beginnings of a cultural 
industry  which is doing extremely well in so far as it is allowed to 
compete freely in the world.
<P>
	We should not be looking inward. I go back to what I started 
with, the real guardians of Canadian culture cannot be the 
government. It cannot make those determinations. There are too 
many different opinions out there. The real guardians of Canadian 
culture have to be individual people. People are very intelligent. 
They can make these determinations. They do not need the 
government dragging them around by the nose telling them that 
this is worthy of protection. That is crazy. We are too grown up for 
that.
<P>
	Another issue needs to be raised and that is the whole issue of 
what may happen if we become too protectionist of our markets. It 
was not very long ago-the minister was involved in this-that we 
ran into precisely that type of problem when we decided to kick 
CMT out of Canada. CMT was Country Music Television, a video 
network, which had been in Canada for several years. Then a 
Canadian service came on and CMT was thrown out. It caused a rift 
between us and the Americans.
<P>
	We are an exporting country. I hate to see that market close down 
for Canadian producers of culture because we make so much 
money from it. It enables those people to survive. What we saw in 
the CMT incident was the possibility that we were going to have 
the market closed off to us for our cultural exports. That is 
extremely dangerous. A good example of its importance is to look 
at how fast the private sector cultural industries have grown in the 
last few years.
<P>
	As the subsidies from government diminish-the minister will 
certainly acknowledge they have diminished over the years-the 
private sector cultural industries have boomed. First, they need 
neither cultural protection nor subsidization. Second, they have 
been successful and are continuing to be successful at exporting 
their products to the United States and other countries around the 
world which has certainly meant substantial growth in that sector. 
Returns were around $16 billion in 1993 and were up to $22 billion 
in 1994, about 3.7 per cent of the GDP. This sector is actually 
growing very quickly which I believe bodes well. I will discuss this 
in more detail shortly.
<P>
	Protectionism is a very dangerous route to go if we depend on 
other markets to make our cultural industries profitable. If they are 
closed down we are in big trouble.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about what I see as the way to make 
cultural industries prosper and really do well in this country. I 
touched on the fact that private sector cultural industries are 
growing like crazy due to a couple of reasons. One of the reasons is 
that as the population ages people are spending more of their 
money on cultural products like movies, going to the theatre, 
books, magazines and so on. In a speech in the House not too long 
ago, the minister pointed out that as disposable income has 
increased over the years we have  seen the Canadian magazine 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16128"> 16128 </A></B>
<P>
industry do extremely well. Having more disposable income is the 
real key.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	That brings us back to the whole debate about the deficit, the 
debt and taxes. I hate to mention it again. I mention it every time I 
speak but it is a huge cloud that hangs over our heads. The debt in 
this country is $560 billion. Yesterday we found out that 34 cents, 
or one-third, of every tax dollar goes toward interest on the debt. 
That is an unbelievable amount of money.
<P>
	Can members imagine if we did not have to pay that, if we could 
keep it in our pockets, how much more people could purchase? 
Cultural industries would absolutely boom. We would not even be 
having this discussion about protecting the nation's cultural 
industries. They would absolutely explode.
<P>
	In my judgment, we should not be wasting all this bureaucracy 
and people's valuable time to come up with more regulation and 
more protection. What we should be doing is beating down the 
debt, beating down the deficit, getting to a point where we can keep 
more money in our pockets. Canadians will go out and support 
magazines, not because they are Canadian but because they speak 
to us about things we are interested in.
<P>
	As I said in committee, as long as politicians are wasting money 
in Ottawa and as long as there is crime in the streets, people are 
going to want to know what is going on in Ottawa, in their 
government and in their country.
<P>
	The best way to do that is to find out from the people who 
publish Canadian magazines. Canadian magazines already have a 
huge head start. They already have the history, and the people 
running them who understand the country. That is a huge advantage 
over anything that comes in from outside the country.
<P>
	If they have disposable income, Canadians will make those 
decisions themselves. Those people are the true protectors of 
Canadian culture. They will make those decisions for themselves.
<P>
	Canadians over the years have demonstrated time and time 
again, better than government, that they can make decisions about 
important issues far better than politicians in Ottawa can, far better 
than the bureaucrats can, far better even than the provincial 
governments and even municipal governments can. I argue that 
those two levels of government make better decisions than the 
federal government. Ultimately people have displayed that they are 
more than mature enough to make excellent decisions on behalf of 
themselves, their communities and their families.
<P>
	What this whole debate has been about, if one just sort of looks 
past all the technical issues and the details, is who should decide 
what is best for me. Should it be the government or should it be 
me? My colleagues and I  would argue and a whole bunch of 
Canadians would argue that they should make the decision for 
themselves. Let us get away from the idea that the government 
knows best because people do not buy into that any more. Let us 
get away from the idea that one man or a cabinet can decide for 30 
million people and all the different groups that make up those 30 
million what is culture, what is art.
<P>
	It is impossible. It is crazy. We have a chance to roll that tide 
back by voting against this legislation. I encourage all members to 
take a close look at the principles behind this legislation and to ask 
themselves who the guardians should be of Canadian culture. 
Should it be the Government of Canada, bureaucracies or should it 
be people themselves?
<P>
	At the end of the day in their heart of hearts, they will admit that 
the people are more than capable of making those decisions.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring coherence to 
this debate and to speak to Bill C-103. Bill C-103 will play a major 
role in maintaining a vibrant and flourishing Canadian magazine 
industry. I want to use my time to present a broader perspective of 
the government's ongoing commitment to this industry.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	This bill should be understood in the context of a 
long-established tradition of government support to the Canadian 
magazine industry as well as the industry's contribution to 
Canada's economy. More important, in a country where natural 
geography makes communication difficult, magazines play a key 
unifying role.
<P>
	Canadian periodicals are an essential medium of cultural 
expression for Canadians. They serve as channels for conveying 
Canadian ideas, information and values. They are an integral part 
of the process whereby Canadians define themselves as a nation.
<P>
	Beyond the direct social and cultural impact of the Canadian 
magazine industry, there are sizeable indirect effects which 
contribute to the smooth functioning of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Unfortunately Canadian magazines are confronted with a series 
of unique challenges: massive penetration of the Canadian market 
by imported magazines; the relatively small size of the Canadian 
population and its dispersion over vast territory; the openness of 
Canadians to foreign cultural products; the effect of the cover 
prices of imported magazines on the Canadian price structure; and 
the impact of overflow advertising on the potential advertising 
market in Canada.
<P>
	Even if the magazine industry has flourished culturally with over 
1,300 titles, its financial position is fragile with overall pre-tax 
profits of less than 6 per cent of revenues of $795 million in 
1993-94.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16129"> 16129 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has supported the domestic magazine 
industry and will continue to do so for many reasons. The principal 
reason is the importance that Canadians place on having a means 
of expressing their unique identity and the difficult and 
challenging environment the Canadian magazine industry faces.
<P>
	The need for structural measures of support for the Canadian 
magazine industry has long been recognized by successive 
Canadian governments. Over the years a number of policy and 
program instruments have been designed and put into place to help 
ensure the development of the Canadian magazine industry while 
not restricting the sale of imported periodicals in Canada.
<P>
	My friends across the way who speak to this issue are somehow 
misguided. We are doing much collectively to provide a dynamic 
and original culture which nurtures our national identity. Questions 
such as, what is culture, or do we have a single overarching cultural 
policy, may be good subjects for discussion. The truth is that 
cultural challenges in Canada have always been addressed by 
specific cultural policies put together by governments.
<P>
	If we look at cultural policy goals pursued by consecutive or 
successive Canadian governments over more than half a century, 
their consistency is remarkable. Specific policy objectives 
developed by a succession of governments clearly reflected the 
reality of an original Canadian culture. Uppermost among these 
objectives is Canadian ownership and control of cultural 
enterprises, a made in Canada broadcasting system, the protection 
of sovereignty in the arts, cultural expression, the creation of an 
environment enabling cultural industries to sustain themselves and 
the recognition on the world stage of Canada's artistic and cultural 
accomplishments. Our global cultural policy was designed to 
promote the development of a diverse yet distinctive Canadian 
culture fostering mutual understanding, identity and quality of life.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Successive governments have recognized that Canada with its 
two official languages benefits from easy access to two of the 
greatest cultures in the world. The presence of our First Nations 
peoples and the diverse origins of our population have been 
justifiably looked upon as a fertile source of inspiration.
<P>
	Canadian governments have also understood the influence of the 
United States on Canada's culture and identity. On one hand the 
fabric of our society can be enriched by our direct access to 
American cultural products and means of expression. On the other 
hand, this same access can weaken our ability to create and express 
ourselves in a distinctly Canadian fashion in our own country.
<P>
	Canadian governments could see the evidence that Canadians do 
want Canadian cultural products and that Canadians are prepared to 
pay a price for them.  Canadians also accept that government has a 
role in striking the right balance between supports to Canadian 
cultural development and access to other cultures. In short, 
Canadian governments are involved in cultural policy because the 
public interest is at stake.
<P>
	Perhaps more than anything else, Canadian culture is vulnerable. 
We said in the red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Culture is the very essence of national identity, the bedrock of national 
sovereignty and national pride-. At a time when globalization and the 
information and communications revolution are erasing national borders, 
Canada needs more than ever to commit itself to cultural development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadian culture is also the substance and the reflection of who 
we are and what we form as a people. Our landscape is part of it; 
our tastes, our languages, our pastimes, the way we view the world, 
these all enter in. Our culture and our life as a nation are 
intertwined. As the reflection of who we are, our cultural 
expression becomes the aggregate of our voices and creative 
energies. For those reasons alone, Canada's cultural development 
and the quality of its cultural expression are worthy of 
government's attention.
<P>
	My Reform friend said governments should stay out. But we 
know that Canadians are enthusiastic about the state of the arts in 
Canada and the involvement of all governments in that state of the 
arts. The quality and abundance of creative work and performance 
have never been higher. I think my friend noted that. Strength and 
certainty are now evident in the work of our writers, our artists, our 
performers. We celebrate their achievements as well as their 
commitment, a commitment after all to ourselves.
<P>
	As a society we wish to reward our artists. They need not only 
our interest and attention, but also material conditions within 
which they can engage in their work and their art. In so doing, they 
can offer all of us a better chance to reach our own potential as a 
people and as individuals. I have many friends in the arts world and 
I know of individuals who are struggling to keep body and soul 
together and bread on the table.
<P>
	Culture is a complex whole. It includes the knowledge, beliefs, 
art, morals, laws, customs and all other capabilities and habits 
acquired by the members of a particular society. Like other 
fundamental concepts, culture can only be understood by a 
familiarity with the realities it summarizes. It may be difficult to 
define American, French or Canadian culture, but the artistic 
products of those cultures, their books, magazines and films for 
example, can readily reflect and inform the cultures of which they 
are products.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are avid consumers of cultural products. After the 
Dutch, we are the second highest per capita purchasers of records 
and tapes in the world. We are also among the world's great film 
and movie goers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16130"> 16130 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian culture flourishes in our major cities. It thrives in 
every hamlet and draws strength from every region. It comes from 
passion, talent, commitment and hard work. The wonder of 
Canadian culture in all its diversity is its ability to expand our 
horizons as individuals and to bring us together as human beings 
and as a society. Our culture, our Canadian, diverse, original 
culture, is part of our identity and greatness. We must stand on 
guard for it. It is the soul of our country.
<P>
	Our bookstores, our news stands, our record shops, cinemas and 
television screens testify to Canada's position as one of the greatest 
importers of cultural products in the world. We enjoy our access to 
other cultures. However, we repeatedly ask ourselves whether there 
should not be a more normal balance between Canadian 
perspectives and those from elsewhere. This is the crux of the bill.
<P>
	Together, our arts and cultural industries contribute over $24 
billion to the gross domestic product or 4 per cent of the GDP of the 
entire economy, and important for us, 660,000 jobs. This did not 
happen by accident. This did not happen, as our friend across the 
way would say, by letting the individuals do it. It was the result of a 
combination of the desire and determination of successive 
governments and the great talent which exists in our country.
<P>
	The challenges facing the Canadian market for cultural content 
are growing increasingly complex every day. There can be little 
doubt that today's reality of fiscal restraint will continue to affect 
our future activities. Policy priorities change to take account of 
new challenges, world trends and windows of opportunity. The 
goals to be met by those priorities however should not change. The 
scene changes, the values do not.
<P>
	This is important work, work which government has been doing 
successfully for years through such policy tools as public cultural 
institutions, support measures, and legislation and regulation. In 
fact, the development of legislative and regulatory measures has 
been particularly effective in promoting Canadian cultural 
sovereignty. Few measures have been more efficient than those 
dealing with Canadian content.
<P>
	Canada has not been the only country to implement such 
legislative and regulatory measures. For example, specific 
restrictions are common for publishing, film and videos in 
countries like Argentina, Brazil, France, Mexico and Australia. 
Need I go on?
<P>
	Venezuela has specific policies and requirements for newspapers 
and periodical publishing. In film and video, France, India, 
Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain and 
Switzerland maintain varying degrees of restrictions on inward 
investment. Mexico maintains limitations in film and video, 
broadcasting and periodical publishing. Brazil has grouped 
television, radio and the print media as one of the strategic 
industries to which it applies the same foreign investment 
restrictions.
<P>
	We cannot go by a rule which says the one with the deepest 
pockets wins. As a market, Canada is one-tenth the size of the 
United States. The cost of producing a film or television program is
<P>
the same in Canada as it is in the U.S. Our ability to recover those 
costs is one-tenth.
<P>
	I must emphasize that it is never an issue of keeping other 
products out. That is not the intent of this bill. Canada is the most 
open country when it comes to enjoying the cultural products of 
other countries. The issue is ensuring the development and 
distribution of Canadian content and ensuring that Canadians know 
it is there and they have access to it.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has been consistent. Its magazine 
policy has not changed. I will say this for the information of the 
Reform members who spoke against this, with these amendments 
to the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act, the federal 
government is modernizing its policy instruments. In this way, the 
entire range of government policy and program instruments can 
better achieve the overall objective of a vital and flourishing 
Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	Those in the industry are depending on those of us in this House 
to ensure that Bill C-103 gets swift passage.

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-95, an act to establish the Department of Health and to 
amend and repeal certain acts, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pleasure to speak in 
support of Bill C-95, a bill to create Canada's Department of 
Health.
<P>
	I want to say a word about the referendum this week. Like many 
members of this House, I am pleased with the result, but I do not 
want to downplay the challenges that lie ahead of us. This 
government came into power with an agenda for change that it will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16131"> 16131 </A></B>
<P>
implement appropriately  to improve efficiencies and to create 
better bottom up management that recognizes the regional 
differences and specific needs of this vast country of ours. We 
remain committed to change, for Quebec and for all of Canada.
<P>
	Since taking office, we have embarked on reforms to make the 
country work better, to eliminate duplication and top heavy 
administration and to ensure that services are delivered by the level 
of government that is most appropriate and best able to do the job. 
Let me talk about some of these changes.
<P>
	We have signed agreements with nine provinces to reduce 
federal-provincial duplications. We have signed agreements with 
all provinces to end internal trade barriers in Canada and to 
promote efficient movement of goods and services across the 
country.
<P>
	In keeping with our commitment to forge partnerships with all 
levels of government and the private sector, an unprecedented team 
Canada trade mission with nine premiers and many municipal 
leaders went to China. The team brought home more than $8 billion 
in deals for Canadian businesses that benefited every province.
<P>
	We have eliminated unnecessary boards and committees making 
government leaner. We have eliminated subsidies to businesses and 
other groups in order to make government relevant and less 
intrusive. We have turned over the management of many programs 
to local authorities, streamlining and removing duplication and 
inefficiencies. It is in keeping with this move toward efficiency and 
relevance that we introduced the legislation before us.
<P>
	Bill C-95 is a milestone in the evolution of a health system that is 
the envy of countries around the world. Over more than two 
generations, Canadians from across this great country under the 
leadership of Liberal prime ministers and ministers of health have 
built Canada's health system with great care and courage, foresight 
and compassion. We are proud and honoured to carry the torch of 
their vision forward, unaltered, while at the same time responding 
to the need and the challenge for finding new ways to implement 
the goals.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The bill will change the name of the federal department to give it 
a more focused mandate. It will confirm and strengthen the raison 
d'être of the Department of Health, which is to promote and 
preserve the health of Canadians. It will reaffirm its mission of 
helping the people of Canada maintain and improve their health 
status. It will continue to fulfil these objectives through medicare 
and public health initiatives, through research and investigation, 
through education and awareness, and through the monitoring and 
investigation of food, drugs, devices and products that would 
compromise the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	However the social assistance and income support programs of 
the government once contained within the  Department of National 
Health and Welfare have been turned over to the Department of 
Human Resources Development, and for good reason. As we move 
into the 21st century issues such as poverty, unemployment and 
social welfare have become inextricably linked with the notion of 
empowerment through creation of opportunity via skills, training 
and education, all aimed at developing the human resource 
potential.
<P>
	Bill C-95 addresses the need for a clear and proactive focus on 
Canada's primary resource, its people, and on ensuring that their 
quality of life and health status are balanced, enhanced and 
improved. It allows us to concentrate on the broader spectrum of 
issues that affect the health of Canadians today, the challenge and 
enticements to come to terms with and to explore the complex new 
discoveries, drugs and technologies that spring up with such 
dizzying rapidity in the world of biomedical science.
<P>
	These innovations have on the one hand presented us with 
exciting new opportunities for prevention, diagnosis and treatment 
of disease and alleviation of suffering and on the other hand raised 
conflicting issues of safety, cost effectiveness, ethics and 
evaluation of social values.
<P>
	The act will allow our department to create a vision for the future 
and at the same time to renew and strengthen our commitment to 
co-operation, co-ordination and partnership with all Canadian 
jurisdictions, provinces, territories, organizations and 
communities. In keeping with this evolution, the bill brings about 
the change that is the promised mandate of the government.
<P>
	There is more to renaming the Department of Health than a mere 
change of name. There is a clarification of focus and an opportunity 
to formulate a new vision of the future that will improve greatly the 
health status of Canadians and make innovations that will enhance 
and strengthen what is already one of the best national health care 
systems in the world.
<P>
	This is no more clearly spelled out than in the portion of the act 
that declares the health aspects of social well-being are the 
responsibility of the Department of Health. We all know that social 
well-being is multifactoral in its linkages and that it concerns in an 
interlocking manner the policy makers of every government 
department and every minister. Social well-being is interrelated 
with the economy, with justice, with employment, with poverty or 
wealth, with cultural and spiritual issues, with gender and ethnicity, 
and with the environment. The new health definition is more than 
just the absence of disease. It has to do with the quality of the 
individual's life and ability to cope with disability.
<P>
	In the case of Health Canada this responsibility, which has 
always been implicit in its mandate, is now being explicitly 
acknowledged. The context of the words in the bill make it clear 
that the department's scope to exercise this broad definition of 
health is confined to matters over which the health minister has 
jurisdiction. It obviously  does not give the Minister of Health the 
mandate to infringe on other ministers' responsibilities. By using 
the specific words in the bill, Canada has declared its commitment 
to the definition of health used by the World Health Organization 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16132"> 16132 </A></B>
<P>
which says that there is more to health than health care. It says that 
health means much more than the absence of disease.
<P>
	Health is the complete state of physical, mental, spiritual and 
social well-being. This is what the new department aspires to for 
every Canadian. Its renewed commitment to a long and glorious 
tradition has inspired Liberal governments, politicians of every 
party and Canadian people over many years, indeed over many 
decades.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Many eminent Canadians have been intimately associated with 
the growth of Canada's health system: the hon. Judy LaMarsh, the 
hon. Paul Martin, Senior, Mr. Justice Emmett Hall, the hon. Marc 
Lalonde, the hon. Monique Bégin and the late hon. Tommy 
Douglas. I mention only a few. We can see how the vision of health 
has known no political boundaries in the past. Though members of 
the third party as we well know have tried to challenge it in the 
present, we can trace the evolution of the commitment to social 
well-being through the contributions of each of these people.
<P>
	In particular it was foreshadowed just over 10 years ago when 
Parliament debated and unanimously passed the Canada Health Act 
under the direction of the hon. Monique Bégin, the federal Liberal 
Minister of Health at the time. This major milestone, the Canada 
Health Act, contained a preamble that called for an assault on the 
social, environmental and occupational causes of disease. The idea 
that shaped that statement was a growing awareness of the 
importance of nutrition, stress management, physical fitness, 
safety in the workplace and the environment generally. These 
concepts deal with health, not sickness. These are concepts the hon. 
Marc Lalonde, another federal Liberal Minister of Health, created 
and championed. This definition has since been taken up by many 
other countries of the world and is now considered indisputable 
fact.
<P>
	These concepts of health deal with prevention and promotion, 
not only cure, as the strategy for achieving health. It is a strategy 
that speaks of long term planning, not only reactivity. It represents 
the real health care revolution in the country.
<P>
	Inherent in Bill C-59 most emphatically the concentrated focus 
on health statement does not mean that our vision of the future of 
health is intrusive or limiting. Clause 12 of the bill like the act it 
replaces makes it clear that nothing in the act gives the Minister of 
Health or any Health Canada official authority to exercise any 
jurisdiction or control over any provincial health authority. As I 
have just related in detail, it certainly defines health in its newest 
and broadest terms.
<P>
	The bill confirms and strengthens the national interest of the 
federal government in health and answers those who would 
Balkanize health care. We know that health care is primarily local 
in nature. People who become sick are generally treated close to 
home by their own medical practitioners. If necessary, they are 
taken to hospitals in or near their town or city. It is well accepted 
colloquially and constitutionally that the managerial and 
administrative aspects of Canada's health system fall under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	But Canada's intrinsic values, beliefs and ideals are not local in 
nature. They define who we are as a people and what we stand for. 
These values and beliefs are reflected in the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	While the federal government's financial contributions to the 
provinces and territories subsidize a substantial share of the cost of 
health care, the role and contribution of the Government of Canada 
in the area of health extend well beyond its funding 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The work of the Department of Health touches the life of every 
Canadian every day. It monitors the safety of the foods we eat, the 
medication we take, the consumer products we buy for our 
families. In effect it is the watchdog of consumer safety. Health 
Canada identifies the health risks we should avoid and undertakes 
the research programs that improve the health of children, women, 
seniors and all other segments of society. It is a machine of 
proactive care.
<P>
	The protection aspects of health care begin long before health 
interventions for the sick. It extends more broadly than mere 
treatment of illness. It is in the national interest that systemic 
examination of disease trends and health risks be in a single 
accessible place where public health intelligence from within 
Canada and around the world can be assembled and evaluated and 
that there be a centre where population health strategies can 
develop and where national health status benchmarks can be set.
<P>
	To this end the laboratory centre for disease control located in 
the department is dedicated to programs preventing, controlling 
and reducing the impact of chronic and communicable diseases in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	There is a national interest in working with other countries to 
combat and control health threats that know no borders. The 
Government of Canada supports international collaboration against 
the common threat of disease. It is in the national interest that 
research into the causes and treatments of disease be carried out.
<P>
	The federal government spends many hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year on health research. The results of research are 
available to all provinces, all hospitals and all doctors throughout 
Canada. The outcome of research benefits all Canadians. It saves 
the lives of all Canadians. Health Canada's role as co-ordinator, 
database gatherer and clearinghouse is clearly invaluable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16133"> 16133 </A></B>
<P>
	It is in the national interest that drugs and medical devices be 
evaluated to ensure that regardless of where they are purchased 
and used they are safe for public use and they do what the 
manufacturers claim they do. The Department of Health analyses 
pharmaceuticals that are submitted by manufacturers and certifies 
their effectiveness and safety. The Department of Health works 
to assure Canadians that their food supply is safe, nutritious and 
of high quality. It is in the national interest that the Department 
of Health does these things. It is also in the national interest that 
standards are set and enforced so Canadians can be ensured of 
comparable health care services no matter what province they 
reside in or visit.
<P>
	It has been well documented by many surveys that Canadians 
want a national vision for health and social well-being. Poll after 
poll has found that the health care system is in first place as one of 
the things that binds Canadians together. They see it as a defining 
aspect of Canadian values.
<P>
	The latest Canada Health monitor findings show that 89 per cent 
of Canadians support the principles of the Canada Health Act. The 
third party across the way that seeks to trample on those principles 
should get in touch with the people of Canada.
<P>
	Health Canada has a clear role to play in public awareness and 
education on health issues as well as a responsibility to protect 
those who are disadvantaged. The government is proud of the 
measures it has taken on behalf of groups with special needs whose 
health status is more compromised such as First Nations persons, 
children, seniors and other disadvantaged groups. At the same 
time, because the health status of First Nations people requires 
concentrated ongoing efforts we have expanded and enhanced 
health programs for First Nations and Inuit people.
<P>
	For instance, last year the Minister of Health announced the 
building healthy communities strategy. In consultation with First 
Nations and Inuit leaders we will implement the strategy to 
strengthen efforts in three critical areas: solvent abuse, mental 
health and home care nursing.
<P>
	We are well aware that health programs designed and delivered 
within First Nations communities are often more successful than 
those delivered by outside agencies. I have proof of this not only 
from my own experience as a physician working with aboriginal 
communities to improve their health but more recently as I 
travelled with the Standing Committee on Health across Canada 
visiting native communities and seeing firsthand what worked and 
what did not work.
<P>
	We are working with the First Nations to increase their control 
over their own resources. We have helped many bands to move 
through the transition that will eventually culminate in full control 
of management and administrative powers that will enable 
self-government.
<P>
	It would take too much time to tell the House of all the initiatives 
now under way to empower Canadians who are least able to help 
themselves, those disadvantaged by need or by neglect. However 
with the indulgence of the House I will mention only a few. An 
example is our seniors. We currently support research into 
alternatives for care that promote independence and allow the 
elderly to stay in their homes, close to friends, family and familiar 
surrounding. We do this by funding groups that provide community 
programs for seniors. This is what we mean by health status 
encompassing quality of life objectives.
<P>
	For our children Health Canada is a key player in a network of 
government programs designed to improve the life chances for 
children at risk. The clear understanding is that the future of 
children depends on critical inputs during the first years of life. The 
federal government administers a number of programs for 
Canadian children and their families to help improve access to the 
best opportunities for health and development. The department 
directly supports a wide range of strategic programs targeted at 
children at risk of abuse or injury, social or physical disease.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	What about women? For too long, women have taken second 
place on the health agenda. Our government has taken dramatic 
steps to correct this grave inequity. We have given strong support to 
the Canadian breast cancer research initiative. We have introduced 
gender specific elements into health promotion programs such as 
Canada's drug strategy and the tobacco reduction demand strategy, 
working with community groups to ensure that women get help at 
the local level.
<P>
	Statistics Canada showed that the prenatal death rate in this 
country climbed in 1993. As a physician, I know that good nutrition 
in pregnancy is a key factor in decreasing the rate of low birth 
weight babies, who are at highest risk for chronic disease and 
disability. Health Canada's prenatal nutrition program for low 
income and other at risk mothers was a red book response to this 
tragic occurrence. I am proud to say that this simple and effective 
program would benefit many at risk babies in the future.
<P>
	The hon. members of the third party with tunnel vision may rest 
assured that spending on these health programs does not fly in the 
face of the debt reduction priority of this government. Each dollar 
that goes to prevent ill health saves tens and hundreds of dollars in 
health care and treatment costs.
<P>
	I turn now to the specifics of the bill before the House. As I have 
said, essentially it renames the department to conform to its new 
singular focus on health. Hon. members will find that most of what 
is in the bill carries over from the previous legislation. There are a 
few new items included in order to clarify the mandate of the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16134"> 16134 </A></B>
<P>
department and to extend its abilities to discharge its mandate. I 
will deal with some of these very briefly.
<P>
	The bill defines the minister's powers in clause 4 as the 
promotion and preservation of the physical, mental, and social 
well-being of the people of Canada. Hon. members will understand 
the meaning of social well-being in light of my earlier comments in 
the context of this bill. We are concerned solely with the health 
aspect of social well-being, because health is more than just health 
care. It involves the total environment in which the organism lives 
and develops, in which human babies are born, youth develops, and 
seniors find quality of life. Health is based in the social order of the 
community.
<P>
	We speak then of the social well-being of Canadians in the same 
breath as we speak of their physical, mental, and spiritual 
well-being. Not only does this wording reflect the reality of human 
existence, it echoes the wording and usage of the World Health 
Organization of the United Nations.
<P>
	A subclause of this section confirms the department's 
responsibility for the safety of consumer products and workplace 
equipment, which is a transfer from the former Department of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs.
<P>
	By virtue of clause 5, Health Canada officials will gain the same 
powers to inspect possible disease carrying agents entering the 
country as they now have to enforce the Food and Drug Act.
<P>
	Clause 6 authorizes the minister, under the supervision of 
Treasury Board, to recover the cost of services provided to 
business. I hasten to explain to the third party that for medically 
necessary care this does not apply to user fees and they should 
never confuse it. Members know that we remain unalterably 
opposed in this government to any user fees.
<P>
	What we really refer to under cost recovery is the cost recovery 
of charges to businesses for the cost of government services that 
have commercial value, such as evaluation of drugs, devices, 
pesticides, et cetera, which we all agree taxpayers should not 
subsidize.
<P>
	I would like to reassure hon. members and the Canadian public 
of one overriding truth, the clear mandate and mission of Health 
Canada. Our mission will continue to be to help the people of 
Canada maintain and improve their health. We will continue to 
enforce the Canada Health Act so that all Canadians will have 
universal access to a comprehensive range of medically necessary 
quality health services. Our objective as a Liberal government has 
historically been to ensure that the health care system remains 
accessible to Canadians when they need it.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	In this vein, hon. members are aware that the Minister of Health 
has given the provinces until October 15 to disallow user charges 
for medically necessary services in  private clinics or experience 
reductions in transfer payments. The message is clear and simple: 
we will do what is required to stop user charges in their tracks, to 
push them back wherever they have crept forward, and to prevent 
the development of a two tiered system of health care, a system 
which contradicts every one of the five principles of medicare, to 
which Canadians have stated full commitment.
<P>
	We do not oppose the use of private clinics. They can be a 
creative, cost effective way to deliver services, and they can do so 
without contravening the Canada Health Act if they are set with 
clear, well defined criteria.
<P>
	We are committed to consulting openly and thoroughly with our 
provincial colleagues. We have shown our commitment to working 
with them to resolve outstanding issues and renew their health care 
system-indeed as they must-in a way that preserves and respects 
the underlying principles and values of the Canada Health Act. 
However, the bottom line remains fixed: no Canadian will suffer 
financial hardship because of illness in this country. This principle 
has not changed since Emmett Hall's report and since Liberal 
Prime Minister Lester Pearson enacted medicare. It will not change 
in the future as long as there is a Liberal government in Canada.
<P>
	We will continue our wide range of activities aimed at 
preventing disease and promoting health. We know this is the best 
investment in the health status of Canadians that we can possibly 
make.
<P>
	We know that 60 per cent of disease is preventable. We know 
that early screening, public information and awareness, research, 
and healthy public policy can make a remarkable difference to the 
lives of Canadians, even in diseases where there is no known cure. 
So we have instituted a breast cancer information exchange. We 
have implemented strategies to reduce tobacco use, to counter 
family violence, and we have introduced a prenatal nutrition 
program to improve prospects for newborns at identifiable risk. We 
have announced an aboriginal health head start program to address 
the needs of aboriginal children living in urban centres and large 
northern communities. We have embraced the axiom that good 
health is the result of proper exercise and diet. My department 
provides guidelines on nutrition and financial support for physical 
fitness and active living.
<P>
	Nobody wants to spend more money than is necessary on health. 
We want to get the maximum value from every dollar. The road to 
this objective passes through the prevention of illness and the 
promotion of health through the development and support of 
healthy communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16135"> 16135 </A></B>
<P>
	Dr. Brock Chisholm, former deputy minister in Canada and first 
director general of the World Health Organization, once recast the 
age-old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of 
cure. Dr.  Chisholm said ``You can only cure retail, but you can 
prevent wholesale''. We subscribe to that.
<P>
	The new Department of Health will continue all the essential 
work that has helped Canada reach and maintain its place on top of 
the world rankings in health. However, as I said at the outset, we 
intend to do far more than maintain hallowed traditions. We intend 
to be a dynamic player in a world filled with new challenges and 
innovative and creative opportunities for health and health care.
<P>
	We will be open to exciting visions of the future that take full 
account of the discontinuities and uncertainties of fast changing 
times. We look to the national forum on health to help develop this 
new vision for Canada's health system in the 21st century. We 
believe the forum is an appropriate vehicle, one that respects the 
rights of Canadians to be consulted on this matter of primary 
importance. It brings expert opinion from many areas to bear. It 
promotes dialogue with all segments of the public. It respects the 
established and effective conference of federal-provincial health 
ministers. The personal involvement of the Prime Minister as its 
chair reflects the importance this government assigns to its 
deliberations.
<P>
	The national forum on health, which will maintain a dialogue 
with Canadians, is a unique and important milestone in the 
evolution of Canada's health care system. It also makes good on a 
promise the Liberal Party made when it sought and received the 
support of Canadians in the last election, a promise to strengthen 
partnerships, to open doors to public input. The forum would bring 
in for the first time in a meaningful and practical way the third 
player on the health care team, the consumer.
<P>
	I point out to hon. members that significant progress has been 
made on the health commitments of the red book. Consider the 
forum, aboriginal head start, prenatal nutrition, centres of 
excellence for women's health, and on and on. Health is 
everybody's business. It is an investment in the Canadian economy. 
Health is an economic resource. Healthy people work, play, and are 
active consumers.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Studies done by many economic think tanks have shown the loss 
to the economy through illness. So it is important to understand 
that Canada's financial commitment to health care provides 
considerable value for every dollar spent.
<P>
	In 1972, when our health insurance system was completed, 
Canada and the United States were spending approximately the 
same level of gross domestic product on health, at 8.4 per cent of 
gross domestic product. Since then we have done a far better job of 
controlling spending. Last year Americans spent more than 14 per 
cent of GDP on health, with 35 million citizens still  uninsured, 
while we spent about 9.7 per cent of gross domestic product on a 
universal, comprehensive system where every Canadian has full 
access, regardless of income level. This translates to $30 billion a 
year in savings on health compared with the U.S. spending levels.
<P>
	What about outcomes? OECD and WHO statistics show that 
Canada ranks in the top three and sometimes is second in health 
outcomes, while the United States still ranks between 15 and 17. I 
say to the third party that more money does not mean better care.
<P>
	Who gains from these savings? Canadian employers. Who has 
high overhead costs to insure their employees against basic health 
risks? Not Canadian businesses. We are among the big winners. In 
fact major American companies have admitted that this is one 
important reason to invest in Canada. Moreover, Canada's labour 
market is more flexible and more mobile because problems with 
health insurance do not deter workers from changing jobs.
<P>
	This Canadian health dividend is not simply in the delivery of 
health care services. It is sometimes unfairly alleged that medicare 
is bureaucratic and eats up funds in administration and red tape. 
The truth is quite the opposite. Health care administration costs 
about $272 per person in Canada. In the United States it is about 
250 per cent higher, at $615 U.S. per person.
<P>
	Public administration, as one of the five principles of health 
care, works. We only spend about 5 per cent of our health care 
dollars on administration. The United States spends 25 per cent. It 
was once decided by the United States Department of General 
Accounting that if that 25 per cent spent on administration in the 
United States were put into health care services, the 35 million 
Americans who are not insured would be insured.
<P>
	We are committed to managing effectively and prudently in 
difficult financial times. There are many management strategies in 
health care that are innovative, save dollars, and still ensure 
quality, such as evidence based care, appropriate acute care, 
community care, and assessment of technologies. But this all 
means working in close co-operation with provinces and territories. 
This government has taken great care to avoid duplication of 
programs and services. If the provinces can administer a program 
better, and in many cases they can, we let them do it. Our aim is to 
co-operate and be flexible with the provinces in ways that ensure 
there is no wasteful overlap. We consult widely within the field and 
among all Canadians before we act.
<P>
	I have spoken about the record of the health department that has 
been its history and portends well for its future. It has been the 
instrument for promoting high quality health care and improved 
health status for Canadians at reasonable cost. It has earned and 
maintained an international reputation for its efforts on health 
promotion and disease prevention.
<P>

<P>
	I am therefore proud to sponsor this bill to create Canada's new 
Department of Health. I urge all hon. members of the House to 
afford it swift passage through Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today to speak for 40 minutes to Bill C-95, an act to 
establish the Department of Health and to amend and repeal certain 
acts.
<P>
	In fact, the purpose of this bill is to shorten the name of the 
Department of Health and Welfare to Department of Health. Yet, in 
reading Bill C-95, we realize that some sections have been 
amended, repealed or added so that the government can, under the 
pretence of providing good government, give the Minister of 
Health the legitimate power to interfere once again in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. We are faced, once again, with 
this overwhelming desire to centralize everything.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Since I like setting the record straight, I will give you a short 
history lesson.
<P>
	As the type of political system that would prevail in the future 
Canadian union was being defined in 1867, it was easy to see the 
emergence of two opposite views of federal-provincial relations. 
On one side, John Macdonald wanted a strong central government 
that could devolve certain powers to the provinces as it saw fit. On 
the other side, Cartier definitely favoured a highly decentralized 
confederation. In French dictionaries, confederation is defined as 
the union of several sovereign states.
<P>
	We know only too well what this led to. Powers were indeed 
distributed between the two levels of government, so that each 
would have exclusive jurisdiction over their own areas of 
responsibility.
<P>
	But things are never as clear cut as they seem with the federal 
government. The government kept in its hand what it considered as 
a trump card, which proved to be harmful to federal-provincial 
relations: the power to spend and to make laws for the peace, order 
and good government of Canada.
<P>
	This way, the federal government could still do as it pleased in 
any provincial area of responsibility, without paying attention to 
the distribution of powers guaranteed by the constitution. And this 
was definitely planned and hoped for. This is confirmed by 
Alexander Galt, one of the fathers of confederation, who stated that 
the distribution of powers, as described in the British North 
American Act of 1867, did not provide the provinces with enough 
funding to properly look after the areas falling under their 
jurisdiction. This means that the very document that gave rise to a 
new Canadian union provided that the provinces would not have 
sufficient  funding and that the federal government should step in 
to compensate the members of this union.
<P>
	Unable to have a highly centralized federal system from day one, 
John Macdonald made sure that its power to encroach would enable 
it to intervene in any jurisdiction it pleased and to impose its views 
on the provinces, even with respect to exclusive provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	It may be difficult for some to recognize that this is what those 
who drafted the British North America Act had in mind. It may be 
difficult for them to believe that what they like to refer to, wrongly 
I must say, as the most decentralized system in the world, already 
provided, in its embryonic state, an increasing centralization of 
power in favour of Ottawa.
<P>
	Yet, the comments made by Alexander Galt, whom I quoted 
earlier, leave no doubt as to those initial intentions, and nor do the 
remarks made by another architect of the Act of 1867, who said 
that, in the long run, the provinces would become nothing more 
than large municipalities under the control of the federal 
government, on which they would greatly depend. We were not 
there at the time to see what was going on, but these people were, 
and they even wrote about it.
<P>
	This is how the structure in which we still live, unfortunately, 
was developed and set up. I made reference to our history at the 
very beginning of my speech to show that, to this day, and contrary 
to what many would like us to believe, nothing has changed. This 
centralizing vision which gives greater power to the federal 
government is not mentioned in the speeches of today's key players 
on the federal scene, but it is obvious in their actions. The best 
example is certainly the health sector in general, where the federal 
has been interfering constantly and increasingly for decades. Bill 
C-95, which is now before us, is evidence of that.
<P>
	Section 92.16 of the Constitution Act gives provinces 
jurisdiction over health related issues on their territory, by 
generally providing for all matters of a purely local or private 
nature within a province. Moreover, sections 92.7, 92.13 and 92.16 
of the same act also give the provinces jurisdiction over hospitals, 
the medical profession and practice, as well as health related laws 
in general, on their territory.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	We can say that this is an area of provincial jurisdiction since it 
involves ownership and civil rights.
<P>
	In the light of what I just said, it is obvious that health care is an 
area which should come under provincial rather than federal 
jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been interfering 
in this area, in various ways, for several years now.
<P>
	The Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act, the 
Medical Care Act and, more recently, the famous  Canada Health 
Act, which combines both previous acts and crystallizes so-called 
national standards, show how the federal government deals with 
areas of shared jurisdiction. Its initiatives aimed at increasing the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16137"> 16137 </A></B>
<P>
federal presence in these areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
are being justified by its spending power, which creates problems 
not only in the health care area, but I will not have enough time to 
list the many disputes it has caused, others will do it for me, I am 
sure.
<P>
	For my part, I will paint a picture showing what happens when a 
government is unwilling to admit that it cannot afford to do and 
decide everything on behalf of the provinces. This picture has as a 
backdrop the acute crisis the health care system is going through in 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government's temptation or desire to interfere in the 
health care area is not new. In fact, right after the second world war 
the federal government took over all major fields of taxation to 
make sure it would receive almost all the taxes normally levied by 
the provinces.
<P>
	At the end of the war, the government got a bright idea: instead 
of giving the taxing powers back to the provinces, it would 
redistribute the money through grants conditional on standards set 
by the federal government. That was an ingenious way to encroach 
even further upon areas not within the federal jurisdiction, at a time 
when the London Privy Council, the equivalent in those days of our 
Supreme Court, wanted to restrain the federal government's 
tendency to centralize. In the health area, the Established Programs 
Financing Act is a good example of what I said earlier: this 
government refuses to accept that it cannot do everything and be 
everywhere.
<P>
	Created in 1977, the EPF program has kept the same structure 
ever since. However, the growth rate has not been as expected over 
the last ten years. That is what brought about the shortfall, as we 
call it, for the provinces and Quebec in the health area. In 1986, the 
federal government reduced the growth rate of transfers by 2 per 
cent. It was the beginning of a long series of payment cuts. In 1989, 
the indexing factor was again reduced by 1 per cent. In 1990, Bill 
C-69 froze transfers to the 1989-90 level for two years supposedly. 
In 1991, the government announced that the freeze would be 
maintained for three more years. During most of that blighted 
period for the health care system, the opposition cried its outrage. It 
said loud and clear that this process could only push the system to 
its own ruin.
<P>
	But the same party, now in government, is weakening the system 
even further. Between 1977 and 1994, the federal contribution to 
health went from 45.9 per cent to 33.7 per cent, a drop of 10.6 per 
cent which Quebec and the provinces have had to absorb as best 
they could. Unfortunately, the mismanagement condemned not so 
long ago by the Minister of Labour and the Deputy Prime Minister 
seems to still be with us.
<P>
	My predictions for 1997-98 are that the federal contribution will 
slide as low as 28.5 per cent of funding. Over the years, as Ottawa 
disengaged itself from health funding, Quebec alone was left $8 
billion short. Eight billion dollars which the Government of
<P>
Quebec had to scramble to find elsewhere. To that figure can be 
added the projected cuts in the Canada social transfer of $308 
million in 1995-96 and more than $587 million in 1997-98.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The leeway that was to be afforded by the Canada social transfer 
is in reality merely the opportunity for Quebec and the provinces to 
make their own choices as to where they would make the cuts to 
absorb this unilateral disengagement. This is how the present 
Liberal government sees decentralization. This is what it means by 
flexible federalism. No thanks, we are not interested.
<P>
	As I have already said, articles 92.7 and 16 of the British North 
America Act allocate health and social services exclusively to the 
provinces. There is, however, also a federal health department.
<P>
	Next year, the federal Department of Health will cost the 
taxpayers in excess of one billion dollars, a billion dollars wasted 
doing what the governments of Quebec and the provinces could 
very well do themselves.
<P>
	Moreover, this superfluous department allocates sizeable 
amounts for programs and projects already in existence in Quebec. 
Let me give you some examples of these, Mr. Speaker: the strategy 
for the integration of persons with disabilities, the campaign 
against family violence, the new horizons program, the seniors 
secretariat, the tobacco strategy, the drug strategy, the AIDS 
strategy, the program on pregnancy and child development, the 
children's bureau-I could go on and on.
<P>
	The federal cuts should have been in these areas of duplication, 
but it insists on having a finger in every pie, and the disastrous 
effect on public finances does not seem to be enough to convince it 
to accept reality.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I must interrupt you, dear colleague. You will 
have the floor again after question period. It being two o'clock, the 
House will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
surely this government finally gets the message that millions of 
Canadians want change.
<P>
	Today, Canada's borders may be intact but the unity of the 
Canadian people is not. Canadians are divided into at least three 
groups. One group, unhappy with today's way of life, wants to 
leave. Another group wants to stay but leave our way of life as is, 
the status quo. The third group wants to stay and make the 
necessary changes to improve the Canadian way of life.
<P>
	The group advocating the status quo by that very fact created the 
existence of the other two groups. The status quo is not effective 
and must now go into our history books. The group advocating 
separation has been denied.
<P>
	To avoid this reoccurring, this government must show leadership 
and make the necessary changes. I invite the government to make 
use of the new Confederation plan put forward by Reform. Copies 
are available upon request, in plain brown envelopes if desired.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-101 is about much more than the restructuring of 
the rail system in western Canada. In reality and especially in 
response to the loss of the Crow benefit, the legislation shifts the 
balance of power unfairly to the ultimate benefit of the railways.
<P>
	I ask the House not to forget that there are captive shippers out 
there whose entire economy will be affected by the outcome of this 
bill. More than 60,000 farmers in  Saskatchewan have a direct 
interest in the outcome of this bill. These farmers now pay the 
entire cost of the shipping themselves. They are at the bottom of 
the chain so to speak and cannot pass increased shipping costs on to 
anyone else.
<P>
	It is important to these producers to have quality railways and 
quality, affordable rail services. It is also important to Canada to 
have a successful farm sector because without these producers and 
shippers the western economy will not grow.
<P>
	Once again it seems that the Liberals are more concerned about 
corporate profits than they are about the livelihoods of thousands of 
prairie farmers.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the founding of the United Nations the plight of 
unwanted displaced peoples has occupied a central role in the 
affairs of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
<P>
	Since its creation in 1950 this organization has provided 
temporary protection to millions of people displaced from their 
homes by war, famine or political persecution. Canada has worked 
with, supported and financed United Nations efforts to ensure that 
people displaced and who are living in fear of persecution are 
protected and resettled.
<P>
	Refugees are a fundamental fact of the world in which we live. 
Our challenge is not just to provide protection but to work with the 
United Nations in peace building and creating the conditions for 
safe repatriation of refugees to their countries of origin. Canadians 
can rest assured that the government will continue to nurture the 
excellent working relationship that it has with the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
behaviour of New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna, who is 
courting Quebec businesses to bring them to his province, is utterly 
disgraceful. While begging Quebecers to vote no in the referendum 
and asking them, once again, to believe in Canadian federalism, 
Mr. McKenna was secretly working to take away their jobs.
<P>
	What a great demonstration of love for the people of Quebec 
from the Premier of New Brunswick. This is the man who, when 
Quebec was in a weak position and making minimal demands, was 
the first one to stab it in the back by repudiating the Meech Lake 
accord.
<P>
	The next time Quebecers have to make a decision on their future, 
they will not be fooled by the real intentions and hypocritical 
attitudes of people such as Mr. McKenna.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Alberta 
government recently announced its own referendum on the future 
of Albertans.
<P>
	The vote is about freedom for Albertans. The vote is about the 
devolution of power from the federal government to the province 
and the people. The vote is about the very right of Albertans to 
conduct business the way they choose in the future.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	In a country where people would respect the results of a 
referendum which would allow one province to leave 
Confederation, surely the government and the minister of 
agriculture will respect the results of a plebiscite to give farmers a 
choice on how to market their grain.
<P>
	Between November 14 and 24, Alberta's 50,000 wheat and 
barley farmers will have their say. The choice is between a 
continued wheat board monopoly on buying wheat and barley or 
the right to sell through the board or directly to any customer.
<P>
	For Alberta farmers now is their chance. They should let their 
voice be heard, get out and vote.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
recent Quebec referendum was like the proverbial Chinese 
two-sided coin. It created on the one side a feeling of deep anxiety 
and on the other it awakened a sense of national pride in all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Even though the margin of victory was narrow, in the end we 
were all winners. It is better to work for change together within a 
united country than to negotiate bitterly as separate nations.
<P>
	Quebecers showed faith in Canada by voting no. British 
Columbians rekindled their national pride and francophones in 
B.C. feel secure again in their heritage. It is time for the healing to 
begin.
<P>
	The strength of our country, which is its respect for differences, 
must lead us forward together in a spirit of understanding and 
compromise.
<P>
	Canada has set out to prove that a diverse and multicultural 
people with linguistic duality and varied heritage can live together 
in peace and tolerance.

of Canada for anything. Never again will we negotiate on unequal

and accept the outcome of Monday's referendum.
<P>
	Quebecers have rejected the option of Quebec separation. As a

<P>
	The people of his own riding sent the message to the Prime

<P>
	While the Reform Party leader advanced a vision of Canada with 
Quebec, it was the Prime Minister who proved to be the most

<P>
	Last night the Prime Minister compared the slim no vote victory 
to a hockey game where one team wins by a goal. The coach should 
be fired. This team went into the third period with a nine-point lead 
and almost blew it.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

again showed his true colours. The architect of the unilateral 
patriation of the constitution in 1982 has once again decided to put 
Quebec in its place. Indeed, after stating that he would not abide by 
Quebecers' decision if they voted yes, the Prime Minister is now 
saying that he will muzzle them by keeping them from holding 
another referendum.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that he would not hesitate to use every 
power available to keep Quebecers from exercising that legitimate 
right again. Nothing has changed. The uncompromising and 
centralizing federalism of Pierre Elliot Trudeau is still very much 
alive in the Prime Minister's mind.
<P>
	As far as he is concerned, Quebec is a province like any other, 
and it must stay that way. Just forty-eight hours after Monday's

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a speech he made last night in Toronto, the Prime 
Minister made a new contribution to Canadian democracy. First, he 
confided it was frustrating to see Quebecers vote in a referendum 
on their sovereignty and thus undermine Canada's political 
stability. In concluding his speech, he made it clear that he would 
intervene to prevent any more votes of this kind.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Would she 
oblige by telling us what the federal government intends to do to 
prevent democracy in Quebec from voting in accordance with its 
own laws?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the difference between the 
Prime Minister and the Premier of the next party the Leader of the 
Opposition will soon be leading is that the Prime Minister of 
Canada says he recognizes the fact that all Quebecers have the 
same right to vote.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Except that he wants to take that right away from them, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16142"> 16142 </A></B>
<P>
	The same rights, meaning that no one will be able to vote.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, living in a democracy is clearly getting to the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Are we to understand that from now on, instead of rejecting the 
results of the referendum, as he was about to do if the yes side had 
won, the leader of the federal government will prevent any future 
referendums? By even considering such extreme positions, is this 
gentleman not demonstrating the depth of his despair and his utter 
inability to overcome his inertia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the difference between the 
Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister of Canada is that 
the Prime Minister accepted the results of the referendum.
<P>
	We heard the Leader of the Opposition say on the night of the 
referendum that he accepted the people's decision. I hope that when 
he arrives in Quebec City very shortly, he will listen to his own 
ministers, including Serge Ménard who said Wednesday, and I 
quote: ``It seems sensible to have only one referendum. This effort 
to reach a consensus, which is the whole point of a referendum, 
means we must consult before imposing. We will have to wait until 
the next election when we will tell them what our plans are. We 
must deal with the problems of Quebecers, get our public finances 
back into shape and govern''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we also heard comments from the Minister of 
Justice in Mr. Bouchard's new government, who said, and I quote: 
``You do not have a referendum because you lost the first one and 
you think you will have a better result three weeks later''. That 
shows respect for the democratic system.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again, my dear colleagues, I would ask you to 
refer to each other by the names of your ridings.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all sovereignist Quebecers who voted Yes, 49.4 per cent, 
are still paying taxes to Ottawa and observing federal laws because 
they acknowledge the fact that democracy in Quebec has spoken. I 
said it before and I say it again: We are democrats first and 
foremost, and the first duty of democrats and citizens is to respect a 
democratic vote like the one held Monday in Quebec.
<P>
	That being said, we should also realize that the people are 
masters of their right to vote and that if some day the people of 
Quebec decide to have another referendum, they can do that. We 
just had a reference to what was said by the Minister of Justice, 
who was merely referring to the Quebec law that provides that, in 
order to have another referendum, there must first be an election. 
And eventually we will have an election in Quebec, since we are a 
democracy and elections are part of being a democracy.
<P>
	People will always be able to vote in Quebec. That does not seem 
to be the case in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister admit that the federal 
government is now resorting to such undemocratic measures as 
banning a vote, simply because it is afraid that a future referendum 
will make Quebec a sovereign country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the difference, and I say this 
again because it is very important that it be remembered, is that on 
the evening of the referendum, Mr. Parizeau himself said that they 
lost because of the ethnic vote and people with money.
<P>
	Three weeks before, the leader opposite made an appeal to the 
white race and never apologized. The difference between the Prime 
Minister and the Leader of the Opposition is that the Prime 
Minister respects the word and the vote of all Quebecers. All 
Quebecers voted in the referendum, and the majority voted no. We 
respect the outcome. And we assumed he would do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Deputy 
Prime Minister cannot get off like that. When we are talking to her 
about respect for democracy-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What respect?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> -quoting words from all over the place. This is 
not the question at issue.
<P>
	This is not the issue, Mr. Speaker. The issue is respecting 
democracy. In his speech in Toronto, the Prime Minister said 
yesterday that the rest of Canada had been-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> They should listen, Mr. Speaker, this would show 
them what their Prime Minister thinks. It is not always nice.
<P>
	In his speech in Toronto, the Prime Minister said that the rest of 
Canada had been extremely generous in letting Quebec hold not 
one, but two, referendums.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Such generosity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> What generosity, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Thank you very much.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Are we to understand, Mr. Speaker, that the 
Prime Minister of Canada is now questioning the right of 
Quebecers to decide their political future? That is the question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite is 
hauling out words from all over the place. The words I quoted 
earlier-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> -are not words from all over the place, these are 
the words of the Quebec justice minister, who, I wager, will be in 
the Leader of the Opposition's caucus soon. He said that Quebecers 
do not hold a referendum because they lost the first one and think 
they could score better three weeks later. These are the words of the 
Quebec justice minister.
<P>
	What is important is that we remember the words of the Leader 
of the Opposition the evening he talked about the results. He said 
that the referendum debate had demonstrated Quebecers' 
discipline, political maturity and their profound attachment to 
democratic values, and that the wishes and democratic vote of 
Quebecers deserved respect.
<P>
	We cannot chose a white race, like the Leader of the Opposition 
did. We must respect the vote of all Quebecers. Let us hope he will 
do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
limits. The Prime Minister of Canada has just said we are lucky he 
allowed us to hold a referendum. We question the Deputy Prime 
Minister on it, on the right of Quebecers to decide their future 
themselves, and she answers any old thing. This is scandalous.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Indeed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Are we to understand that the Prime Minister of 
Canada has just taken upon himself to decide the limits of 
democracy in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister in his 
speech last night defended the right of all Quebecers. He took a 
page from the book of the Leader of the Opposition who said last 
Canada Day that we live in the most democratic country in the 
world. The people of Quebec spoke.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true anymore.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> It was true on Monday night. Between Monday 
night and Wednesday somehow it is not true anymore but the 
reality is-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> You have changed it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No way. You can't take the heat.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Vote yes and it is democratic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the subject of democracy, the most 
unfortunate part is that the Leader of the Opposition never took 
back the words spoken by Mr. Parizeau the other night. The Leader 
of the Opposition's remarks about the white race three weeks ago 
were never taken back. This reveals that it is not the Prime Minister 
who fails to respect Quebecers' right to vote, it is Lucien Bouchard 
and the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
speech last night, the Prime Minister indicated that he is not 
prepared to tolerate any more referendums on Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. We 
are wondering exactly how it is that the government intends to 
achieve this. For example, is it considering a federal law to outlaw 
provincial referendums? Exactly what is it proposing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again there is an 
opportunity for the Reform Party to join the ranks of Canadians 
who frankly want all of the country to get on to governance. 
Instead, he is salivating for another referendum because he did not 
like the results of the first one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
Canadians want from this government are answers to some simple 
questions. They do not want to see the government defending the 
same kind of demagoguery we have here sometimes.
<P>
	If the separatists cannot have another referendum on Quebec 
sovereignty, which I suspect they would be ill advised to pursue in 
the near future, they may try simply to seek a mandate through an 
election, something which would be much easier to achieve.
<P>
	Does the government really think that this would be a better 
alternative for Canada than a referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the best way to avoid another referendum is clearly to 
effect changes in the distinct society clause or in the right of veto, 
but especially changes that affect the respective powers of the 
federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	We have already started to make these changes. They have been 
indicated. The federal government is now redefining its role and 
responsibilities. We are doing it at a lower cost to Canadians 
because we will be reducing the size of the federal government by 
20 per cent.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
terms of the government's nascent constitutional agenda, it would 
be advised to pursue unity by pursuing those issues on which 
Canadians agree and not those issues on which they are divided.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister said he would propose a 
constitutional veto not for the Government of Quebec but for the 
people of Quebec. I would presume that is by referendum. Now he 
says he does not want more referendums in Quebec.
<P>
	Does he foresee further consultations of the people in Quebec 
and outside Quebec on their constitutional future or not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy </B><B>Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that considerable changes are needed in 
the Canadian federation. I think we all agree on this.
<P>
	The federal government has to play a leadership role. It has to 
redefine its roles and responsibilities. It has to clean up its act. It 
has started to do that. The various means that will be used in the 
future either to clarify the constitutional position or to redefine the 
jurisdictions of all levels of government will be taken whenever 
necessary by whatever means necessary.
<P>
	But we must not forget that Canada is not just an addition of 10 
provinces. It is all Canadians voting together in a federal set-up in 
order to elect a government and representatives that look at 
national interests, not only provincial interests.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
night the Prime Minister told Canadians that he understood full 
well their frustration at having to sit on the sidelines during the 
referendum and said that he would not let it happen again.
<P>
	However, in question period yesterday the Prime Minister flatly 
rejected the idea of consulting Canadians directly through 
constituent assemblies.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. If not through 
referendum, if not through constituent assemblies, then how does 
she plan to consult Canadians on the future of their country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few days before the final 
vote a call went out to Canadians from coast to coast to coast to 
come to Quebec to show their solidarity with Canada.
<P>
	Members of Parliament from every political party responded to 
that call. Unfortunately of 52 Reform members of Parliament, 51 
of them were too busy doing other things to respond to the call to 
Canada.
<P>
	We have a responsibility as members of Parliament with our 
constituents to continue to work for a better democracy. Hopefully 
the next time the Reform Party will be working with us and not 
against us.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
remind the Deputy Prime Minister that Reformers from across the 
country were at the Montreal rally, the people, not the politicians 
speaking out.
<P>
	It was evident from the results of the Charlottetown accord that 
Canadians do not want to see distinct society  status or 
constitution-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16145"> 16145 </A></B>
<P>
al vetoes brought in. They want to see the federal government 
decentralizing power, in fact loosening the grip and the 
stranglehold it has on powers. The west wants it, Ontario wants it, 
and Quebec Liberal leader Daniel Johnson wants it.
<P>
	When will the Deputy Prime Minister start living up to this 
promise of changing the way the federation operates and begin the 
actual transfer of powers to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1929 the Senate 
recognized that women politicians were persons. I hope that when 
we were in Montreal, we the people were there but we the 
politicians were also there.
<P>
	Unfortunately it was a calculated decision of Reform Party 
members to sit on the sidelines. It was a reflection of the decision 
they made throughout the campaign because frankly they did not 
support the option of Quebecers staying in Canada.
<P>
	Speaking of sharing of power, I was in Whitehorse only 10 days 
ago when we had unanimous-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Giving, not sharing.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> ``Giving it'', she says, ``not sharing it''.
<P>
	In Whitehorse only 10 days ago we had unanimous agreement of 
all ministers of the environment, including the minister of the 
environment for Alberta, of harmonization where we share 
responsibility, not just a giveaway.

would ask the Deputy Prime Minister through you if she will have 
the decency to apologize in this House, asking the pardon of the 
Leader of the Opposition for having put words in his mouth that he 
never said and for which he apologized publicly. I would ask her to 
have the decency to withdraw her words.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it must be kept in mind that 
the present leader of the Parti Quebecois was not the first to bring 
up race. In fact, in a speech before the referendum, it was the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean who played the race card, who asked 
those in the French speaking white race to have babies.
<P>
	I asked for an apology the next day. I have never, never heard any 
apology from the member across the floor, and I am still waiting 
for one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ): </B>Mr.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has been promising us that big administrative 
changes are in the works. Under the Constitution, natural resources 
are the exclusive domain of the provinces, yet the federal 
government continues to meddle in this area of provincial 
responsibility. Reform's new confederation proposals would 
reduce the federal government's role in natural resources to a bare 
minimum.
<P>
	What specific changes does the Prime Minister propose to 
reduce the federal role in natural resources?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16146"> 16146 </A></B>
<P>
	I can take this opportunity to explain that we are not meddling 
in the area of provincial jurisdiction. In fact, during program 
review last year leading up to the February 1995 budget, my 
department took the opportunity to consult with all the provinces. 
We have worked co-operatively and collaboratively with the 
provinces so that we do not have overlapping duplication any 
longer in the resource sectors.
<P>
	We have defined our role and the provinces have defined theirs. 
As far as I know, they are reasonably happy with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
provincial ministers of energy and mines have been urging their 
federal counterpart to harmonize regulations. Over the past two 
months their letters to the minister have gone unanswered as they 
have tried to organize a meeting with her, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the provincial ministers of energy 
and mines and resources. In fact in a letter the ministers expressed 
``major concern about the lack of recent progress and the loss of 
momentum on harmonization efforts''.
<P>
	Will the minister arrange today a meeting with her, the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs and their provincial counterparts to 
discuss the harmonization issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ministers of intergovernmental affairs, both provincial 
and federal, are always discussing these possible changes. In fact 
just today I was in contact with one of them in order to try to see 
whether we could increase the harmonization in terms of questions 
of natural resources, decentralization, and the efficiency of the 
federation initiative.
<P>
	We are working all the time, trying to reach new ways of 
governing the federation that are less costly to people and that 
permit the federal and provincial governments to govern where 
they are most efficient.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The minister will probably be interested to read in today's 
newspapers that during the first four months of the current fiscal 
year, from April to July, Quebec was $322 million over budget on 
welfare payments. This sad state of affairs is due to the fact that 
more families in Quebec are on welfare than was expected.
<P>
	Will the minister finally admit that repeated cuts in 
unemployment insurance are to blame for this sharp increase in 
welfare costs in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been over this ground 
several times.
<P>
	It is important to point out to the hon. member and to members 
of the House that in fact the rate of increase for social assistance 
caseloads in the province of Quebec has declined over the past 
year, from an average rise of about 8 per cent down to 1.5 per cent, 
which simply does not jibe with the facts she is putting out. Over 
the last four months, since the month of August, there has been a 
net decline of about 7,000 in the caseloads. The reason for that, as 
we know, is that we have been very successful in creating over 
125,000 jobs in Quebec over the last two years.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	Under the UI changes we brought in last year, we provided a 
special benefit for those on low income so that those who have 
dependants or children would be able to receive an additional 
$1,000 over and above their regular benefits, which meant that over 
130,000 Quebecers alone were able to get those additional benefits.
<P>
	This summer I was able to sign an important agreement with the 
Government of Quebec to provide $81 million directly to social 
assistance recipients so they would receive an income supplement 
that would enable them to go back to work and receive enough 
income.
<P>
	Rather than spending her time trying to argue about small 
minutia of details and figures, what we should be talking about is 
how do we come together as two levels of government to help the 
real people who have real needs. That is the real issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister refers to 20,000 more people on welfare as small minutiae, 
details and figures, in a so-called period of prosperity, at a time the 
government is about to cut welfare subsidies in the Canada social 
transfer, what will it be like in the next recession? This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Will the minister finally admit that further draconian cuts he is 
about to make in unemployment insurance will put even more 
families on welfare and make the budgetary problems of the 
Quebec government even worse?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the  hon. 
member and other members of the Bloc and the Parti Quebecois 
have been trying to say to the people of Quebec in a really quite 
deliberate effort to give out misinformation, I will tell the hon. 
member that one of the most important elements we are putting 
together as part of the new

talked about in his speech last night. He said that we will provide 
basic protection for families on low income with children. It is 
something we have been talking about in this country for a long 
time, and we intend to do it.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that rather than arguing old 
arguments she should be putting her attention now to helping 
govern this country better so we can really help poor people, rather 
than simply trying to break up this country. That is the best way of 
providing security and civility.

is for the secretary of state for foreign affairs.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about the Sri Lankan government's 
current major military offensive on the people of the Jaffna 
Peninsula. The civil war and massive attack is resulting in a serious 
threat to the civilian Tamil population and the further displacement 
of large numbers of people.
<P>
	Can the secretary tell the House what role Canada is playing to 
stop this bloodshed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific),

to our ambassador to China, who passed away Tuesday. 
Ambassador John Paynter served Canada well, both in India and in 
China. We offer our condolences to his wife Inga and his three 
children.
<P>
	To answer the hon. member's question, indeed we are very 
concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka. This summer I 
personally travelled to that country on a fact finding mission. 
During that trip I told the President of Sri Lanka that we were 
disappointed at the unilateral resumption of hostility in Sri Lanka 
by the LTTE on April 19 after 14 weeks of peace. However, at the 
same time we also expressed our concern to the government that a 
military solution was not an option in Sri Lanka. We continue to 
urge the government and the LTTE to resume negotiations for a 
peaceful solution.
<P>
	Canada has been saddened at the continuation and escalation of 
the conflicts in Sri Lanka and with the large loss of life. Canada 
totally condemns the slaughter of innocent persons, both Tamil and 
Sinhalese, in Sri Lanka in recent days. This slaughter is not helping 
the situation.

yesterday the Minister for Human Resources Development 
admitted that the Canada pension plan is unsustainable. In 
response, he announced another tax grab. He is raising payroll 
taxes despite the fact that in his budget the Minister of Finance 
stated that payroll taxes are a cancer on job creation.
<P>
	How high is the government planning to raise payroll taxes to 
prop up a system facing collapse?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, 
the whole question of the financing of the Canada pension plan is 
under review.
<P>
	We will be tabling in the House before the end of the year a paper 
that will put forward a series of recommendations. It is an area that 
must be worked out with the provinces. It is a joint sharing of 
responsibility to ensure that the tens of millions of Canadians who 
rely upon the Canada pension plan, which is a pooled sharing fund, 
will be able to sustain it and be able to give absolute certainty and 
surety to not only this generation of pension holders but future 
generations that the Canada pension plan will provide a very stable 
foundation for their security in old age.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
last comment is not even worth responding to. The system is facing 
collapse by the year 2010.
<P>
	Our plans for renewing the Canada pension plan include 
protecting seniors' benefits without raising payroll taxes. These are 
the kinds of positive changes Reform is offering in its new 
confederation.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Human Resources Development prepared to 
roll back this tax increase and forget this obscene attack on jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says she 
does not want to comment on the program that has been in place for 
several decades helping provide protection. In fact the hon. 
member tabled a report from the Reform Party that would totally 
eviscerate any kind of security for disabled people, for survivors 
with children, for seniors, and which would eliminate all kinds of 
payments for low income Canadians.
<P>

undermine the public pension plan of Canada.

	Is the minister of agriculture prepared to say today that he will 
not let Canada run the risk of being shut out of the U.S. market by 
telling Canadians that he is prepared to ensure the enforcement of

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the law of Canada with respect to 
the powers and authorities of the Canadian Wheat Board is very 
clear. That law has been on the books of this country for a long 
time, and by and large that law has been respected. It ought to be 
respected.
<P>
	Those who hold contrary views and wish to see some changes in 
the legal system that presently exists can bring their views forward 
and let those views be debated and discussed. We have established 
a procedure for that to occur.
<P>
	I would advise those who deliberately violate the law that they 
are in no way advancing their own case. They are in fact in the 
process of undermining democracy. Beyond the point of the illegal 
nature of their actions, they are also raising the spectre of a very 
serious trade problem with the United States, which could 
undermine the incomes and the livelihoods of all Canadian 
farmers.

law that they ought to respect the law, because illegal activity does 
not accomplish anything. Second, they are running the risk of very 
serious trade repercussions.

scrum here in the lobby of the House of Commons, I publicly and 
clearly dissociated myself from his comments. I also pointed out 
that those who voted in the referendum on Monday were all

refused to withdraw her accusation.

<P>
	I was listening very closely to the debate. Although many 
statements today were offensive to one side or the other, in my 
view as far as the decorum of this House and the conducting of the 
question period are concerned, they were within the area of 
acceptability.
<P>
	With regard to that particular point of privilege, I would rule it 
was not a point of privilege.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise, not 
on a point of order, but to ask the Thursday question. I would like 
our colleague to tell us what is on the legislative agenda.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. solicitor general.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am speaking today as government House leader.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You will forgive me, you look the same. The hon. 
government House leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want the record of the House to show I 
am speaking in a calm, measured tone of voice with no intention of 
sarcasm or innuendo.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is our intention to continue with the list of items 
already being considered by the House today. I am referring to 
second reading of Bill C-95, the reorganization of the Department 
of Health; third reading of Bill C-94 relating to fuel additives; 
second reading of Bill C-96, the human resources development 
department reorganization, and report stage and third reading of 
Bill C-52, the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services reorganization.
<P>
	Tomorrow we would like to deal with Bill C-108, the National 
Housing Act amendments. We would then resume the list I have 
just read out.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16150"> 16150 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, we will be in ongoing consultations with the opposition 
parties about the scheduling of other business, including 
opposition days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I put a 
question to the government House leader? My colleagues and I are 
deeply concerned about the government's fall agenda.
<P>
	The facts, as I look at them, in the last 46 or 47 days are as 
follows. Just four new bills have been introduced in this House, no 
aging paper has been presented, no UI legislation has been tabled. 
There has been a refusal to call bills which the separatists object to. 
Twelve of nineteen bills were such-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would take it this has to do with House business. 
With all respect, I would ask the House leader of the Reform Party 
to please put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will do that.
<P>
	I plead with the government House leader to commit this House 
to a serious legislative agenda before the end of this fall session and 
I would like to know what it is.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	At this point in time we have had no indication of any kind of 
serious legislation; not even the voice of intent, never mind 
something in concrete form.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, when we resumed the session I said we 
had some 30 measures waiting on the Order Paper from the end of 
the session in June for debate. I said that we would be proceeding in 
an orderly fashion with those measures as a priority.
<P>
	I do not know why our colleagues think we should have scrapped 
all those measures. I thought they wanted a measure to tighten up 
the parole and correction system, Bill C-45. Now they are on record 
as opposing that. I thought they wanted a measure to have a better 
witness protection system, Bill C-58. Now they are on record as 
opposing that.
<P>
	Now that we have dealt with a bill to create an environmental 
auditor general, they are in effect saying that was not worth while. 
Now that we are dealing with measures on dangerous fuel 
additives, they are saying they did not want those measures to be 
debated. Now that we have debated a measure to update our 
transportation regulations, the Reform Party is saying that was not 
worth while.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks without your saying anything,Mr. Speaker. I can see your face; a tone of voice is not necessary. 
On each and every one of the measures they participated in the 
debate. They put down amendments. They called for votes. By 
their actions they are saying the House leader for the Reform Party 
simply does not know what he is talking about.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHEALTHACT">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could 
you tell me how much time I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You have 27 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to begin to debate a bill 
and be interrupted by question period, but I will nevertheless 
summarize a bit what I said and then to on.
<P>
	We are debating an act to establish the Department of Health and 
to amend and repeal certain Acts. I had said that, in fact, the bill 
was aimed at replacing the name of the Department of Health and 
Welfare by the shortened title of Department of Health.
<P>
	Generally, not a lot of sections have changed, but in reading this 
bill, we realize that certain sections have been changed, repealed or 
added, only some. In some cases we see that the government, as a 
good government, is once again legitimizing its authority and is 
giving the Minister of Health authority to intervene yet again in 
areas that are under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I gave a brief history and I am going to summarize what I said to 
conclude with the clauses I mentioned earlier, which provide the 
powers of the minister, who may intervene in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Under section 92(7.16) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and 
according to the courts, the sectors of health and social services are 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the other 
provinces. Since as far back as 1919, Ottawa has been getting 
increasingly involved in these sectors, forcing Quebec even here to 
comply with so called national standards and objectives.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, federal initiatives in the area of 
health and welfare, except for those dealing specifically with 
certain groups of people-members of the Canadian Forces, 
sailors, Indians, immigrants and prisoners-have no clear 
constitutional basis. They depend entirely on the federal 
government's spending power, which allows it to take many more 
major initiatives.
<P>
	In 1919, the Department of Health was created and the first 
subsidies granted. In 1948, the national health subsidy program 
was introduced. In 1957, the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic 
Services Act was passed by Parliament. The Medical Care Act was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16151"> 16151 </A></B>
<P>
passed in 1966, and the Canada Health Act, known as Bill C-6, in 
1984. The Canada Health Act replacing the 1957 and 1966 laws set 
national standards and imposed requirements  limiting the 
autonomy of Quebec and the provinces. Bill C-6 set out provincial 
obligations: universality, accessibility, interprovincial portability, 
public administration, and comprehensiveness. Failure to meet 
these criteria may lead the federal government to withhold transfer 
payments to the provinces for health care.
<P>
	As early as 1926, Quebec denounced the federal government's 
interference in the area of health, and the reservations then 
expressed by the Taschereau government were reiterated by every 
succeeding administration. Health Canada has become so big that 
its 1995-96 estimates set aside $1.5 billion for operating 
expenditures-$347 million for personnel costs and $703 million 
for goods and services-and $6.9 billion for transfer payments. 
However, this contribution to the provinces, which is, as I was 
saying, subject to compliance with national standards, does not 
prevent the federal government from going ahead with its own 
health and welfare initiatives, as shown by the list I just gave you 
on the subject of duplication.
<P>
	The 1991 national strategy for the integration of persons with 
disabilities, with a budget of $46 million over five years; the 1991 
federal initiative against violence, with a budget of $136 million 
over four years; the new horizons program; the seniors secretariat; 
the national strategy to reduce tobacco use; the national drug 
strategy; the national AIDS strategy; the pregnancy and child 
development program; the children's bureau, the national forum on 
health. All these initiatives directly encroach on existing programs. 
Such cases of overlap and duplication cost a lot of money.
<P>
	I would now like to make a few comments on the government's 
red book commitment with respect to the national forum on health. 
With respect to health, the federal government does not intend to 
cut any slack to the provinces, as promised in the fall 1993 election 
campaign, when its intention to hold a national forum on health, if 
it was elected, was made public.
<P>
	The federal health minister made no secret of Ottawa's 
centralizing designs. During its election campaign, the Liberal 
Party of Canada released a document entitled ``Creating 
Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada'', better known as the 
red book. Reference is made in this book to being committed to 
holding a national forum on health, and the way this commitment is 
worded hardly conceals the federal government's desire to take 
control over health care in Canada. Let me read you what it says. 
``The role of the federal government should include the 
mobilization of effort to bring together Canada's wealth of talent 
and knowledge in the health care field.'' If that is not the 
expression of a will to centralize, I do not know what is. ``This is a 
societal issue in which every Canadian has an interest. The federal 
government must provide the means to ensure that Canadians are 
involved  and informed, and can understand the issues and the 
options.''
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	On june 29, 1994, despite the objections of the provinces, the 
federal health minister announced the creation of this forum. To 
date, four work sessions have been held, and not one province is 
represented at this forum. The forum's mandate is to develop a 
vision of what the Canadian health care system will be in the 21st 
century; foster dialogue with Canadians concerning their health 
care system to ensure that, while respecting the general principles 
of the system and preserving its benefits, the renewal process under 
way will make the system better and lead to greater public health; 
establish priorities for the future and bring about a wider consensus 
on the changes that are required.
<P>
	Following the invitation sent by the federal health minister,Mr. Rochon, Quebec's minister of health and social services, gave 
the following reasons, in a letter dated October 14, 1994, to explain 
why the Quebec government would not participate.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The mandate of this forum is an encroachment by the federal government in a 
field which essentially falls under provincial jurisdiction, and that is unacceptable. 
The clearly stated objective of your government, which is to give the forum a 
mandate to define future priorities, in the context of health care reform, and to define 
the means to that end, is a direct intrusion in provincial governments' affairs. This is 
something that cannot be hidden behind the consultative nature you ascribe to the 
recommendations that would come out of this forum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was the Quebec health minister's response to his federal 
counterpart.
<P>
	Quebec's health minister also pointed out that Quebec had not 
waited for the presumed leadership of the federal government to 
undertake a reform, adding that important concrete measures had 
been taken, that an extensive public hearing process had enabled 
Quebecers to state their views and their needs, thus fostering a joint 
effort to define priorities and means of action, and that, in recent 
years, the federal government had made major cuts in its transfers 
to the provinces.
<P>
	What we have here is yet another measure which demonstrates 
the federal government's intention to get involved in the health 
sector. Indeed, Bill C-95 includes provisions which clearly give the 
health minister a legitimate power to interfere, yet again, in fields 
of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	If we look at these clauses, far from acting in good faith by 
withdrawing from this area that does not come under its 
jurisdiction, the federal government has every opportunity to 
gradually take over areas of provincial jurisdiction when it is in its 
interest. I am not saying that this is a major bill; it has been 
portrayed as harmless and inconsequential, but the reality is far 
different.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16152"> 16152 </A></B>
<P>
	Subclause 4(1) of Bill C-95 sets out the powers, duties and 
functions of the Minister of Health. It proposes that the minister's 
powers extend to ``all matters over which Parliament has 
jurisdiction relating to the promotion and preservation of the 
health of the people of Canada''.
<P>
	The Department of National Health and Welfare Act contained a 
similar provision. Parliament's jurisdiction over public health 
could cause confusion. This provision should be more specific.
<P>
	The following clauses are more subtle. Subclause 4(2) lists the 
health minister's powers, duties and functions, including ``the 
promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the people of Canada''.
<P>
	This provision would give the federal government the authority 
and legitimacy to interfere in an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Subclause 4(2) then mentions ``the protection of the people of 
Canada against risks to health and the spreading of diseases''. This 
does not appear in the original act that Bill C-95 would replace.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	This would allow the federal government to move to protect the 
health and safety of the people in the name of national interest and 
of the power to ensure peace, order and good government. 
Paragraph 4(1)(c) places investigation and research into public 
health, including the monitoring of diseases, under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	This provision creates a problem, since clause 12 provides that 
``nothing in this act or the regulations authorizes the minister or 
any officer or employee of the department to exercise any 
jurisdiction or control over any health authority operating under the 
laws of any province''. There is obvious confusion here.
<P>
	How does Health Canada plan to ensure this continuous disease 
control monitoring without having access to the necessary 
information? According to the Act respecting health services and 
social services, health care institutions are health agencies 
governed by provincial legislation.
<P>
	Is that really a problem? Does clause 12 effectively limit federal 
intervention in health matters or is it a mere front put up to reassure 
the provinces, a line that the federal government will have no 
qualms crossing if and when it pleases, as it has done in recent 
years?
<P>
	Clause 4 may therefore be interpreted rather freely and broadly. 
There certainly is cause for concern about the real scope of this 
clause, which can be interpreted many different ways and ascribed 
many intentions. This is how, as usual, the federal government tries 
to expand into provincial areas of jurisdiction through a seemingly 
simplistic and innocuous project.
<P>
	But no one is fool enough not to guess what it is up to. Bill C-95 
is another fine example of the federal way of  doing things: silently, 
without making any waves, because it knows full well that no one 
agrees with its handling of health care.
<P>
	Needless to say that, for all those reasons and many more-that 
my colleagues will have the opportunity to raise later on-, we 
cannot support in any way Bill C-95. Mr. Speaker, before closing, I 
would like to table the following amendment to Bill C-95.
<P>
	I move, seconded by the hon. member for Joliette:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following: ``this House declines to give second reading to 
Bill C-95, An Act to establish the Department of Health and to amend and repeal 
certain Acts, because the principle of the Bill does not provide for including in 
the Minister's powers, duties and functions, the power to award full and entire 
financial compensation to any province wishing to exercise fully its jurisdiction 
over health''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-95 is 
really not much more than a bill to change the name of the 
Department of Health. On that basis it is surprising that we will 
spend so much time debating it. If I asked a high school class how 
long they thought it would take to change the name of a 
department, they would tell me it would probably take a minute.
<P>
	I see this debate being used by my colleagues as an opportunity 
to talk about health care in a broader sense and I will seize that 
opportunity too. This bill is what my House leader said it was a few 
moments ago when he said it was a pretty thin soup on the 
legislative agenda we have seen lately.
<P>
	Let me start my comments about health care in general by 
making a statement I would like to have emblazoned across the 
forehead of my colleagues across the way as coming from the 
health critic of the Reform Party. I will say it over and over again 
until they finally do recognize and plainly hear what I am saying: 
Medicare is our best social program. Medicare is the program I 
think we should protect with all our resources.
<P>
	Let me follow that by saying U.S. style medicare, U.S. style 
medicine is absolutely unacceptable to Canadians and to 
Reformers. There is no desire anywhere in Canada to move toward 
a system like the U.S. has. How many times can I say that? How 
many times can I express it? How many times can I emblazon it on 
the foreheads of my colleagues?
<P>
	Our public system which is tax supported, which is universal, 
which is comprehensive, which is accessible to all and which is 
publicly administered, is truly unparalleled. Medicare is our best 
social program. This social program however has some cracks in it. 
The cracks must be talked about and addressed. If we simply stand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16153"> 16153 </A></B>
<P>
idly by and let the best social program we have break  down, we 
have not done what we should be doing as legislators.
<P>
	I beg my colleagues across the way to stop the rhetoric. I beg 
them to stop this nonsense about a U.S. style two tier system. I beg 
them instead to listen carefully to the actual proposals I make. I beg 
them to actually debate with me those proposals line by line instead 
of with buzzwords, instead of with rhetoric, instead of with 
platitudes. Please debate the concerns.
<P>
	Why does our medicare system have cracks? What are the cracks 
I see? I see an aging population in Canada. Each one of us knows 
that as we age, medical expenses go up. In the last three years of 
life, 70 per cent of our health care expenditures are spent.
<P>
	I see new innovative technology coming along that was never 
envisaged when medicare came on the scene. I see organ 
transplants, joint replacements, things we never dreamed about 
when health care was set up. Some of those things are profoundly 
expensive. Some are very difficult to fit into the framework we 
have.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Finally what are probably driving the cracks, and I wish they 
were not, are the funding shortfalls. We are in a position now where 
the federal government is spending over $1,200 per person to 
service the debt, that is servicing the interest on our debt annually 
while we spend $268 per person on medicare.
<P>
	If nothing else, those three things which are happening in 
medicare have produced profound cracks. Ignore them, pay no 
attention to them and our most valuable social program will not 
just have cracks, it will implode. It will not survive.
<P>
	If anyone takes from that that I say medicare is finished or done, 
I will say it again: Medicare is our most valuable social program. It 
needs support. It needs protection. It does not need U.S. style two 
tier changes. How many times must I say it?
<P>
	There are two routes to travel in health care changes. Surely we 
know that health care changes must come but there are two routes 
to travel as I see it.
<P>
	One route is to ration the procedures we do. That is avenue 
number one which we are on today, the rationing of services. We 
can ration by waiting in line. We can wait so long that we scream, 
or sadly in some cases, we can wait so long that we die. Rationing 
by waiting.
<P>
	We can cap budgets and say that this is all we can afford. 
Anything beyond that point will not be done. We can have 30 
operating room days instead of 100 operating room days. We can 
close beds. We can actually remove them from the system. It is 
being done. We can fire nurses and say to them: ``You cannot do 
your nursing any longer. Step outside the system. Maybe you 
would be just fine as an accountant''. That is one route  and the one 
I am afraid we are on today, the rationing of services. I decry that 
and say it will not suffice.
<P>
	The other route we can travel is if our medicare system does not 
meet the needs of an individual, they should have the choice to step 
beyond the public system and access something else. That is where 
I think we should go. Please remember that does not mean tossing 
our good public system away. It means our tax supported system 
will maintain itself, but if medicare does not meet the needs of an 
individual patient, they should be able to step outside. I can only 
explain this best by giving some examples.
<P>
	A little girl by the name of Stephanie, a tiny patient, has adenoid 
problems and fluid in her ears. She is in pain. This is not a life 
threatening problem but she cannot hear as well as she would like. 
She is constantly concerned. She goes in to get her antibiotic and 
the specialist tells her parents that Stephanie really needs to have 
her adenoids removed and the fluid drained from her ears. Her 
parents ask the doctor how soon this can be done. It is an 
eight-month wait in Nepean for that procedure today.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Stephanie is not in the worst difficulty, but what happens for the 
eight months she has to wait? She is on antibiotic every three 
weeks, and the antibiotic cost is about $40. There is actually some 
extra discomfort for her, so she misses play school. When she 
misses play school mom has to stay home from work or have a 
babysitter come in. Those things are economic, and I would set 
them aside and say that they are okay. But for Stephanie herself, the 
pain and disruption is there. Her parents ask what choice they have. 
The public medicare system is going to provide her service in eight 
months. Is there nothing that can be done? Yes, there is something a 
Nepean couple could do today. They could go to Rochester. They 
considered very carefully going to Rochester for their sweetheart to 
get her adenoids out.
<P>
	There is another choice. I am sad to say that it does not exist in 
Ontario now. The choice is a little clinic in Alberta. This clinic is 
run by an ear, nose, and throat surgeon exactly of the same 
capability as hers. He got ticked off with the fact that the waiting 
list in Alberta was eight months. He said there had to be another 
way. There were not enough bed opening times for him to bring 
kids into the hospital. This is not a hard procedure. The facilities 
will cost him about $30,000, and he can get the operating room 
microscope, which is not that difficult to sterilize. He could do it in 
his office with an anaesthetist and the equipment for that. He 
wondered if there was a demand for this.
<P>
	Today in Alberta he is doing that. The cost is $125 out of the 
patient's pocket. The waiting time is two weeks. Little Stephanie in 
pain is given the choice. This is what I want. I want Stephanie's 
parents to have the choice. If the public system and the eight-month 
wait is okay for  Stephanie and okay for them, so be it. If they say 
that it is not acceptable to them, I want them desperately to be able 
to access that facility. And it should not be in Rochester; it should 
be in Ottawa.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16154"> 16154 </A></B>
<P>
	If there is anyone in the Chamber who would deny that sweet 
little girl that choice, I want them to stand now. I cannot imagine a 
Canadian who would do that.
<P>
	Thin edge of the wedge? Our public system cratering because of 
the potential of choice? Find me the country in this world that has a 
public system like Canada's and a complementary private clinic 
that has caused the public system to crater and I will sit down. 
There is no such country.
<P>
	Let me take the other side of the coin now. My mother, who is 
living in Alberta, recently had a cataract operation. She had a 
choice. There is a clinic in Alberta that would do her cataract 
operation for $1,250 out of pocket, with a very short waiting time 
of two weeks. The waiting time in the public system for her was 
four months. ``Twelve hundred and fifty bucks, boy, that's a lot of 
loot'', says my mom. ``How bad are my eyes? Not so bad at all. I 
can still watch TV. I can still read the newspaper. I think I will wait. 
I think I can easily wait for four months.'' And she did. Her surgery 
was performed trouble free. This was a public system providing for 
her needs in the way it should.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	If there is no demand in Canada for options outside medicare, 
there will be no such clinics springing up. Interestingly enough, in 
a country I am familiar with, some of the private clinics, these 
choice clinics that have sprung up, have now gone bankrupt 
because the public system has become so efficient, provided all the 
services, and pushed them aside.
<P>
	Why do Canadians not have more confidence in this most 
valuable social program to say that it will crater if some choice 
springs up? How is it that this most valuable social program would 
not survive if there were choice and if the only choice were to go to 
Europe? It makes no sense to me whatever.
<P>
	I talked about how funding goes down because of debt. What 
happens if funding from the government drops so low that there is 
not enough in a community?
<P>
	Tomorrow I am going to my twin riding of Saskatoon to speak to 
the law faculty. I have already had the opportunity of being there. I 
found out that in Saskatoon the provincial and federal funds have 
given them no capital expenditures for the last three years-none. 
They said they had some things the people in Saskatoon want, and 
they raised through foundations $2 million-from corporations, 
individuals, and people who are involved in the health care field 
doing projects. They put those funds into capital improvements: 
equipment and new technology.
<P>
	The public will not stand for an inferior product in health. Health 
is more important to Canadians than any other thing we have or we 
can give them.
<P>
	I say again that the individuals in this country who will not 
debate this issue straight up with Reformers who are willing to talk 
openly about the cracks-not the explosions, not the breakdown, 
not a crisis, but cracks in our most valuable social program-are 
ideologically driven and not driven by care, not driven by health 
needs, and not driven by common sense.
<P>
	I am going to end my discourse today by saying that medicare is 
our most valuable social program. The biggest threat to medicare in 
Canada is politicians who wrap themselves in some kind of a flag 
and will not truly address the issues.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, I want to congratulate the minister sponsoring that 
bill. She has strongly and successfully defended the principles 
championed for half a century by the Liberal Party, while 
developing Canada's health care system. Over the years, medicare 
was threatened many times, sometimes from one quarter, 
sometimes from another.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	True to the tradition upheld by her illustrious predecessors, the 
minister has just repelled the most recent attacks on medicare, and 
all Canadians are grateful for that.
<P>
	This Liberal government is proud, and deservedly so, of all the 
pioneers who saw to the proper development of medicare. 
Successive Liberal governments improved the system, so as to 
preserve its soundness and effectiveness. This is why Canada now 
enjoys a health care program that is second to none, both from a 
technical and a social standpoint. The quality of our health care 
remains unsurpassed. Equal access for all is also guaranteed to the 
fullest extent possible.
<P>
	Social development is contingent upon health. A healthy nation 
is a productive nation. It can enjoy those things that make life 
worth living, it stands a better chance of being happy, and its 
people can build a strong nation.
<P>
	One of the ever present challenges faced by the health 
department is to find which policies and programs can best 
contribute to the health and well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	Without taking anything away from Canadian health 
professionals, I want to congratulate the Minister of Health and 
Health Canada for giving priority to essential  programs such as 
disease prevention and health promotion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16155"> 16155 </A></B>
<P>
	In the past, preventive medicine meant things like vaccination, 
which practically eliminated afflictions like smallpox, diphtheria 
and poliomyelitis for previous generations. Today, sophisticated 
tests and equipment warn us about dangers and allow Canadians of 
all regions to add many years of good health to their lives.
<P>
	Twenty years ago, a Liberal minister of Health, the hon. Marc 
Lalonde, published a working paper entitled <I>A New Perspective on 
the Health of Canadians</I> which was to have an impact on health 
systems across the world. It was a visionary document for the time. 
It is comforting to see that so many aspects of Mr. Lalonde's vision 
have been realized thanks to the department whose name we are 
discussing today.
<P>
	Many fundamental elements of the health system we know today 
came out of the Lalonde paper. The preamble to the Canada Health 
Act which mentions the social, environmental and industrial causes 
of diseases was also inspired by that document. The causal factor 
model which the National Forum on Health is now studying also 
comes from the Lalonde working paper.
<P>
	According to <I>A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians</I>, 
and I quote: ``When the full impact of environment and lifestyle 
has been assessed, -there can be no doubt that the traditional view 
of equating the level of health in Canada with the availability of 
physicians and hospitals is inadequate''. The document predicts 
appropriately that, to improve the health of Canadians in the future, 
we will have to clean up the environment, reduce risks we expose 
ourselves to, and improve our knowledge of human biology.
<P>
	This is the source of the reasoning in favour of social well-being, 
which is at the heart of this new bill, as members will note. This is 
the source of the arguments against tobacco and excessive alcohol 
consumption, which underlie Health Canada's tobacco demand 
reduction strategy, and the activities of the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse.
<P>
	This is the source of the arguments in favour of health research, 
which are guiding Health Canada in its laboratory work, and the 
Medical Research Council in its operation; the latter does not 
report to the department but to Parliament through the health 
minister. This is the source of the argument that everyone is 
responsible for his or her own health and must keep sufficiently fit 
to ensure his or her own well-being. As the members are aware, 
responsibility for the promotion of physical fitness was given back 
to Health Canada.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	From now on, it is incumbent upon the health department to 
encourage Canadians to stay physically active throughout their 
lives because physical activity is essential to good health. Health 
Canada helps many  organizations make physical activity more 
accessible and readily available to all Canadians in general and to 
the disabled in particular, because the latter are probably the ones 
who need it most and have to overcome the most obstacles in that 
regard.
<P>
	With the reorganization of the health department-the main 
reason for introducing Bill C-95-another determining factor 
relating to the health of Canadians is being added to departmental 
operations. Product safety in now being transferred from the 
former Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to the 
Department of Health. Product safety does indeed come under the 
broader field of health protection. Accidents in the home and on the 
job are major causes of death and injury for people between 5 and 
35 years of age. Because of such accidents, we have people who 
can no longer live a full life, economic losses and an increase in 
medical and hospital bills.
<P>
	A lot of these accidents involve consumer and household 
products. Health Canada is responsible for the enforcement of the 
Hazardous Products Act. This act deals with the sale, the 
advertisement and the importation of certain hazardous products 
and ensures that consumers are well informed about the risks 
associated with the misuse of other products.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I want to raise a point we seem to forget when 
we talk about what contributes to improve the health and welfare of 
Canadians. The provinces are of course responsible for providing 
health services to the public, but some health problems know no 
provincial boundaries. Their causes are deep-rooted in the social 
fabric of our nation.
<P>
	For Canadians to enjoy good health, their basic needs must be 
met. They must have a job and a reasonable income and be able to 
care for their families. This is where the federal government plays 
an important part. It must help to maintain a viable economic 
structure so that these goals can be reached.
<P>
	The Jobs and Growth government agenda will greatly contribute 
to improve the health of Canadians. We can expect positive 
economic results from the deficit reduction, which will help to 
improve the health of Canadians. We all stand behind Health 
Canada in this cause. These are the reasons why I wholeheartedly 
support Bill C-95.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to 
comment on some of the things the hon. member for Macleod had 
to say in his speech. I notice the hon. member is not here.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wish to remind the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that it is not within the norms of the rules 
of the House to make reference to the absence of any member, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16156"> 16156 </A></B>
<P>
particularly when we are all  aware of the constraints put on our 
time at different periods.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I would like to comment on 
the statements of the hon. member for Macleod. With all due 
respect to William Shakespeare, methinks the hon. member doth 
protest too much in his speech when he continued to repeat over 
and over that the Reform Party did not mean to have a U.S. medical 
system, that the third party supported medicare.
<P>
	The hon. member repeated this and repeated this to make a point. 
However, with respect, I would submit that rhetoric and repetition 
of words mean nothing when the actions following the words are 
supporting a two tier medicare system that would definitely 
dismantle Canadian medicare as we know it.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about waiting lists.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I seek some clarification 
from the hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	I recognize that the member for Macleod spoke prior to the last 
speaker who was a member of the government side and to whom 
the question and comment period is designated. I appreciate 
comment can be made about a previous speaker and then, in terms 
of relevancy, the member goes back to the intervention of the last 
spokesperson, the member for Pierrefonds-Dollard. I ask her to 
get to the comments of her colleague, the last speaker on the floor 
of the House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on medicare and 
on the way the system is to be restructured. It would deal, as my 
hon. colleague said just, with some of the structural changes that 
are necessary to move the system into the 21st century.
<P>
	The cost of medicare and the changing of some of the ways that 
the system works, as I said in my speech and as the hon. member 
just reiterated, have to do with the fact that there are national 
concerns and a national interest in a new national Department of 
Health.
<P>
	Research covers a broad spectrum. There are local areas of 
research and local areas of health promotion and prevention that 
must come from the provinces because they deal specifically with 
issues concerning regional problems, regional environmental 
issues, and regional and local differences that need to be addressed.
<P>
	Across the spectrum there are broader issues concerning the 
whole spectrum of health facing all Canadians. It is efficient and 
effective for the federal government and for national health to take 
these issues into consideration. It is effective in that the data 
collection in one place creates a cost efficiency and a base where 
everyone can co-ordinate and use the information as they need it, 
rather than have duplication of service and duplication of 
information gathering in 12 different areas such as would come 
about if we allowed each  province and each territory to repeat, to 
duplicate and to reinvent the wheel. They would deal with the 
broader issues of health care, promotion and prevention that cut 
across provincial boundary lines and have nothing to do with 
specific regional and local interests.
<P>
	There is a specific role for the Government of Canada in 
research, promotion and programs pertaining to low risk babies. It 
is common to all Canadians; it is not specific to any one province.
<P>
	If we are talking about efficiencies and appropriateness of care 
and appropriateness of effort, we need to focus on them, and it is 
appropriate for the federal government to do so. It is more 
appropriate for the federal government to do it than for provinces, 
as I said before, to deal with it individually. When the ministers of 
health met in the past they all agreed that it was a very real role.
<P>
	In terms of safety it is much easier as drugs, devices and foods 
come into the country for one agency to assess and to deem 
whether or not they are safe. Goods and services travel across the 
provinces and therefore go to every person as far away as Prince 
Edward Island and Vancouver Island. Therefore safety should be 
carried across Canada so that there is one level of safety and it is 
not spottily done in different areas of the country.
<P>
	The national interest of health and the need for a national 
Department of Health are not intrusive. It is an appropriate way for 
the federal government to look after safety, health promotion and 
prevention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would only like to know if 
the hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard has any comment to add 
to those that were made on his speech.
<P>
	The hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary to 
the minister of Health. I submit that today's motion is very 
important because it is a positive move for health. Prevention will 
get a renewed importance and the department of Health will 
assume responsibility for certain regulations, like the one on 
hazardous products and other similar products, and also for fitness.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I personally think that the future of health in Canada is 
prevention. We talked a lot about health care, but before things get 
there, there is prevention. That is the objective of the bill and I am 
proud of it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is a physician. He listened very carefully 
to my colleague in the Reform Party make a very eloquent and, I 
might say, one of the best speeches I have heard in the House. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16157"> 16157 </A></B>
<P>
listened to his recital of  the tragic case of Stephanie. The member 
must have had many patients who endured terrible pain and 
suffering because essential services were not available to them 
since the Canada Health Act rationed essential services.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has often said in the House that we must 
provide Canadians with access, access, access to essential health 
care services and that we in the Reform Party were espousing ideas 
that would somehow limit that access. How is access served better 
when we have increasing costs, an aging population and increasing 
demand? When demand on our limited resources is actually 
increasing, how will we provide individuals with access to 
essential health care services?
<P>
	We want to amend, not destroy, the Canada Health Act to enable 
private clinics to exist and to enable private services to be provided 
to Canadians. Only private moneys would be exchanged in the 
private clinics. Not a single dollar of taxpayers' money would be 
spent in the clinics. We would have a system that provides for 
greater access for all Canadians regardless of the care than what 
they have now.
<P>
	How will our plan somehow destroy health care in the country 
when we will give better access to all Canadians regardless of their 
income?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, what struck me in the speech made by 
the member from the Reform Party, before my colleague made his 
comments, is that he told the House that the Canadian health care 
system is one of the best if not the best in the world and that he did 
not want in any way a health care system based on the American 
model.
<P>
	I think that having private clinics, as suggested by my colleague, 
would be the beginning of the end of our health care system as we 
know it in Canada and the birth of a two tier system, one for the 
rich and one for the poor.
<P>
	I am well aware of cases like the one mentioned by the member 
for Macleod, the case of Stephanie. Such cases exist in every riding 
in this country, but I think that, at the present time, the provision of 
essential services is good. Of course there is room for improvement 
in the area of essential services, and these improvements must be 
made through prevention. I think that, without prevention, we will 
have problems in the future. But prevention is an essential part of 
our government's vision of health care, and that is the direction we 
are going to take as we move toward the next millenium.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-95, an act to establish the 
Department of Health and to amend and repeal certain acts. To 
begin with, I feel I must remind my fellow citizens that health is a 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Pursuant to subsections 92(7) and 92(16) of the Constitutional 
Act, 1867, and according to the way the courts have interpreted 
these provisions, it is clearly established and acknowledged that 
health and social services are exclusively a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Yet, federal interventions in matters of health are numerous and 
have been going on for a long time. As a matter of fact, since the 
beginning of this century, the federal government has passed the 
following acts concerning health: in 1919, the government 
established its own health department and gave its first grants: in 
1948, the government launched a national health grants program; 
in 1957, it enacted the Hospital Insurance Act; in 1966, it enacted 
the Medical Care Act, and in 1984, the Canada Health Act which 
sets out the federal principles of the Canadian health system.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has always condemned the 
interventions of the federal government in matters of health. In 
1926, the Taschereau government was the first to protest against 
federal interference in health issues. Since then, every Quebec 
government did likewise.
<P>
	As the years went by, all this intrusion by the federal government 
became increasingly expensive for the taxpayers of Canada and 
Quebec. Ottawa was able to be generous since it was paying its 
expenses with the provinces' money or with borrowed money. That 
is what put us all in debt.
<P>
	I will remind members that, in World War II, the central 
government in Ottawa used the war effort as an excuse to encroach 
upon personal and corporation income taxes. Up to then, these 
taxes were collected exclusively by provinces. This supposedly 
temporary measure is still in effect today.
<P>
	The federal government clearly gave in to the temptation to 
control more and more, without giving back to the provinces the 
tax powers they had before the war. It decided instead to grant 
subsidies provided programs created by the Canadian government 
were implemented.
<P>
	Such a control of tax revenues allowed the federal government to 
constantly centralize operations thereafter, which caused untold 
duplication and shameful waste of public funds. Worse still, to stay 
in office, several generations of federal politicians distributed gifts 
which created a burden of debt for future generations of Quebecers 
and Canadians.
<P>
	At the present time, and despite the fact that it is clearly 
operating in a provincial area of jurisdiction, Health Canada looms 
large: its operating budget is more than $1 billion in 1995-96, while 
transfer payments to the provinces are $7 billion for the same year.
<P>
	The federal government has never indicated that it intends to 
loosen its grip on the Canadian health system.  Indeed, during the 
1993 election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada said in its red 
book, and I quote: ``The role of the federal government should 
include the mobilization of effort to bring together Canada's wealth 
of talent and knowledge in the health care field. This is a societal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16158"> 16158 </A></B>
<P>
issue in which every Canadian has an interest. The federal 
government must provide the means to ensure that Canadians are 
involved and informed, and can understand the issues and the 
options''.
<P>
	For once, the Liberal Party kept its promise. On June 29, despite 
the opposition of all the Canadian provinces, the Minister of Health 
announced the establishment of the National Forum on Health. The 
mandate of this forum was, first, to develop a vision of what the 
Canadian health system would be in the 21st century; second, to 
promote dialogue among Canadians and Canada about the health 
system; and third, to define the priorities for the future.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Jean Rochon, the Quebec minister of health and social services, 
wrote to the federal health minister on October 14, 1994, to remind 
her of this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The mandate of this forum is an encroachment by the federal government in a 
field which essentially falls under provincial jurisdiction, and that is 
unacceptable. The clearly stated objective of your government, which is to give 
the forum a mandate to define future priorities, in the context of health care 
reform, and to define the means to that end, is a direct intrusion in provincial 
governments' affairs. This is something that cannot be hidden behind the 
consultative nature you ascribe to the recommendations that would come out of 
this forum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Rochon further wrote that Quebec had not waited for federal 
leadership to adapt its health care system to today's needs and that 
he had already held major consultations with Quebec population.
<P>
	The Quebec minister of health and social services reminded the 
federal minister that the cuts made in transfer payments to 
provinces with regard to health were not the best action a 
government could take to preserve and promote a health care 
system in Canada.
<P>
	Those major cuts are a threat to the very principles advocated in 
the federal health act.
<P>
	At the same time as the federal government was seeking to 
encroach on a provincial area of jurisdiction, it was unilaterally and 
drastically reducing its funding for health programs in the 
provinces of Canada.
<P>
	In the spring of 1995, the National Council of Welfare, an 
organization whose role is to advise the health minister, warned her 
against such action and said: ``It would be extremely hypocritical 
to reduce contributions to the provinces while raising the standards 
required of them''.
<P>
	But that is exactly what the government is doing right now. We 
should recall that when the finance department created the 
so-called EPF program providing transfers to  provinces for 
welfare, health and post-secondary education, it was agreed that 
transfer payments would be indexed to the rate of growth of the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	Since 1986, however, the federal government has been cutting 
back constantly on those payments to reduce its deficit. It has been 
doing so unilaterally, without taking into consideration the 
provinces' capacity to pay. Between 1982 and 1995, it saved $8 
billion on medicare alone, at the expense of Quebecers. Because of 
this shortfall, Quebec had to raise taxes to offset the federal 
withdrawal from funding.
<P>
	A study by the C.D. Howe Institute has shown that, while 
spending for established programs financing remained stable 
between 1988 and 1992, other federal program spending rose by 
25.5 per cent. In other words, the federal government told the 
provinces they should tighten their belts while it went on spending 
freely and increasing its deficit.
<P>
	The lack of stability in the federal contribution to medicare is a 
serious problem. Payments are frozen, reduced, or deindexed at the 
whim of the finance minister and his financing requirements. There 
is no longer an agreed upon financing formula. The amounts are set 
unilaterally and arbitrarily by the federal government, irrespective 
of the real costs of the provincial programs.
<P>
	This constant variation in funding, always downward, has 
become a nightmare for everyone involved in the health field.
<P>
	What is more serious is that the Minister of Finance appears 
oblivious to the fact that he is playing not only with columns of 
figures but with the health of the men and women of Quebec and of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Last February, in his last budget, the Minister of Finance chose 
to once again reduce transfers to the provinces for health. As a 
result, Quebec will have to absorb a shortfall of $650 million for 
health and social services alone, in 1996-97, and 1.9 billion in 
1997-98. One of the benefits of federalism, no doubt.
<P>
	In the spring of 1995, the National Council of Welfare made the 
following comment on the planned cuts to funding Canada's health 
programs: ``The projects announced in this budget-would have 
the probable consequence of bringing about the dismantling of a 
national system-of social services it took us a generation to build 
up''.
<P>
	The Minister of Health for British Columbia had the following to 
say about these cuts:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Last February's budget which cut transfers to provinces for 
health-has forced provinces to look at unpalatable cuts that 
threaten medicare''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16159"> 16159 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If the Canadian health system were really so dear to the heart of 
the Minister of Health for Canada, she would have followed the 
lead of her colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and opposed her 
government's last budget, which attacked social programs. She 
would have stood up at the cabinet meetings where these decisions 
were made, and would have held up against the Minister of 
Finance's figures the pressing needs of the Canadian people for 
quality health care. The Minister of Health could have suggested 
that the government seek its resources from the rich, with their 
numerous tax shelters, starting with the list of the generous 
bankrollers of the Liberal Party, and not forgetting the Minister of 
Finance's companies.
<P>
	But that is not what she is doing. Today, she introduced a bill that 
perpetuates the federal government's control of health care, an area 
over which the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction. Paragraph 
2(a) and paragraph 2(<I>b</I>) of clause 4 could easily be used by the 
federal government to interfere even more with the administration 
of health care in Canada.
<P>
	The bill before the House today is hypocritical to the point that 
in clause 12 we read, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing in this Act or the regulations authorizes the Minister or any officer or 
employee of the Department to exercise any jurisdiction or control over any 
health authority operating under the laws of any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When as a result of its budget cuts, the federal government 
drastically reduces funding for health care in the provinces, it 
affects the way authorities operating under the laws of a province 
function by reducing their capacity to maintain a level of services 
commensurate with the needs of the citizens of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois condemns this bill because it sanctions 
federal encroachment on provincial jurisdictions. Quebec has its 
priorities in the health care sector and should have the right to 
manage those priorities, in accordance with the present 
Constitution. This bill does not mention providing adequate and 
stable funding for health care. The minister has abdicated her 
responsibility in this respect and bowed to the imperatives of the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This bill constitutes an attack on the provinces while failing to 
deal with any of the pressing problems of the health care sector, so 
much so that even the most ardent federalists have decided to fight 
the initiatives of the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The Ontario Health Minister, Conservative Jim Wilson, stated on 
September 19 that it was necessary to fight the federal 
government's insistence on dictating to the provinces its 
interpretation of the principles that should be the foundation of the 
health care system, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The federal government should be fought on principle for 
dictating its interpretation of medicare to the provinces''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That same day, Ralph Klein, the Conservative Premier of 
Alberta, also condemned the federal government's lack of 
flexibility, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Marleau-does not send a good signal to Quebec. It says there 
is no flexibility within the Confederation''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In a joint press release after a meeting of Health ministers, the 
provinces declared that the federal government's insistence on 
making unilateral decisions on health care funding, on interpreting 
standards or setting arbitrary deadlines for consultations was not 
helpful at all.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Since the federal government is unable to provide adequate 
safeguards for the health of Quebecers and Canadians, since 
continuing cuts are the main threat to the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians, the federal government should withdraw from the 
health care sector and transfer to the provinces the fiscal resources 
that would enable them to do the federal government's job far more 
successfully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did enjoy the hon. member's comments. I wish I could 
speak fluently enough in the beautiful French language, but I must 
speak in English. I am not good enough yet to carry on detailed 
conversations in French.
<P>
	In health care, the needs of the people of Quebec are the same as 
those of the people in my province of Nova Scotia. All of the 
provinces have serious deficit situations and we have had to begin 
dealing with deficit reduction. I remind the hon. member that the 
province of Quebec has not attempted to reduce its deficit as the 
other provinces have done. This is a major concern in dealing with 
health care.
<P>
	Another variant which occurs in the health care system is that 
some provinces give credence to many health care needs. For 
example, some of the provinces consider cosmetic surgery part of 
the health care program. Through the years in Nova Scotia we have 
had more than basic coverage in programs such as dental care for 
children, an excellent program covering dental care up to the age of 
16.
<P>
	What has happened under the broad umbrella of health care is 
the provinces have added on things  encompassing more than basic 
health care. They cannot afford them. We have heard recently that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16160"> 16160 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec must close some 25 hospitals. This is not due to the federal 
government's cutbacks. This is due to the overspending and the 
additional encompassing programs which have come under health 
care.
<P>
	What the federal government wants, and I ask the hon. member 
if this is not her desire too, is to preserve the health care programs 
for all Canadians as to basic needs, so that this is a very unifying 
factor for this country. Without the strong federalist approach to the 
health care needs, we will miss out.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remind my colleague of a few things. First of all, I 
thank her for her question and comments. I wish to remind her that, 
between 1988 and 1992, established programs financing remained 
stagnant. Meanwhile, the federal government wasted money on 
other programs, resulting in a 25.5 per cent cost increase.
<P>
	So when they tell me that we must cut because of the deficit, I 
say we must start by cutting waste in defence spending, among 
other things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Ah, yes. The same old tune.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Funding for health 
care programs remained stagnant from 1988 to 1992.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> You must calm down.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Let me speak, you, 
the hon. member across the way.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I simply wish to 
remind my colleagues from both sides of the House that they must 
always address their comments to the Chair. I think that members 
would even then be able to express themselves as forcefully as they 
need to. They must, however, always remember to address their 
comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, fair 
enough, thank you for reminding me. Before saying what she said 
about Quebec, my colleague should get her facts straight. Quebec 
has made major changes to its health program.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Quebec may even have lost the referendum. One of the reasons 
why we lost the referendum may be the Rochon reform. So we 
made major changes in the area of health. Of course, Quebec 
provides health services that are not available in other provinces. 
For example, women can have access to abortion if they want to; 
other provinces do not offer this service. We have moved toward 
ambulatory care and reduced hospitalization time considerably. We 
have closed hospitals. We have modified the functions performed 
and services provided  by some hospitals; some day hospitals now 
provide long term care and inpatient services.
<P>
	So before looking at what is happening in the neighbour's 
backyard, I would invite the hon. member to look at her own 
province where, on the eve of the referendum, the Minister of 
Finance said he would no longer be able to control his finances if 
Quebec separated from Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want first to make a few comments 
on the hon. member's speech and then ask her a question.
<P>
	The hon. member gave us a wonderful history of what has 
happened since 1919. At the end of that history, the hon. member 
mentioned it culminated in what we now know as Canadian 
medicare, which I hasten to say was enacted by a Liberal prime 
minister.
<P>
	That medicare we know benefits all Canadians, including 
Quebecers. It is also the envy of the world. Every single survey and 
study that has been done has shown that 89 per cent of Canadians in 
every province, including the province of Quebec, believe it is 
something they would like to keep. It is important to them as 
Canadians. It is the most important thing we can possess as a 
country. In fact medicare and this history lesson led to something 
which is very positive and which Canadians still hold very dearly.
<P>
	I also want to speak about the member's comment on the 
encroachment of the national health forum on provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The forum is made up of members from every province, 
including the province of Quebec. The forum is made up of 
members of the public. It is not made up of people from 
government.
<P>
	Perhaps the member could tell me whether she believes that the 
Canadian government does not have the right to speak to Canadian 
people in every province, which is what the forum is doing. The 
forum is not changing anything; the forum is having a dialogue 
with ordinary Canadians. Can the Canadian government not speak 
with ordinary Canadians? Something we promised in our red book 
was the ability to speak and to get input from Canadians, from real 
people and not just from government.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of cuts and interference in provincial 
jurisdictions. Health Canada's authority with regard to the Canada 
Health Act and with regard to medicare is a contractual one. The 
Canadian government signs a contract with provinces to receive 
money from the federal government. In turn, those provinces agree 
to the conditions based on getting that money.
<P>
	The provinces do not have to accept any conditions, but then 
they cannot also accept the money because on a  contract both sides 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16161"> 16161 </A></B>
<P>
have an agreement. One side agrees to give money and the other 
side agrees to abide by certain terms. That is clearly what provinces 
do when they sign the contract.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member spoke of how cuts are affecting the 
provincial government's ability to provide services in Quebec. The 
Quebec government has a budget of $13.4 billion for health for 
1995-96. That government made a cut of $565 million to its health 
care budget well before the federal government presented its cuts 
for 1996-97 within the Canada health transfers.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member, why did her province's government make 
those cuts if it really needed money in the system? Why were there 
$565 million in cuts when the hon. member says that Quebec's 
health care system needs more money?
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Still, Mr. Speaker, 
it is a sad day when you hear the kind of things we are hearing in 
this House. Attempts were made to convince the people of Quebec 
that there are no benefits to belonging to the Canadian 
confederation and, every day since we reconvened, evidence of a 
total lack of understanding of what is going on in this country has 
been building up. People are blind. Politicians are blind.
<P>
	We are criticized, on the one hand, for not making cuts, and on 
the other hand, for making cuts too soon. I think that our 
government acted responsibly. An overhaul was required in the 
health care system, because funding cuts are expected. Shortfalls of 
$650 million one year and $1.9 billion the next year add up to 
nearly $2.5 billion over two years. It seems to me that the thing to 
do for a responsible government is to plan ahead. But where I find 
fault with this government across the way is when it decides to stop 
paying but wants to keep controlling everything anyway.
<P>
	When I was young and lived at home, I lived by the rules my 
father had set because he was providing me with room and board. 
But when I moved into my own apartment and had my own money, 
I lived by my own rules.
<P>
	When you stop paying, you lose the right to tell others what to do 
with their money. You have no right stealing a jurisdiction away 
from others and telling them: ``Its is yours, but we can do what we 
want with it.'' So little sensitivity and understanding and so much 
arrogance, contempt and affront coming from you, Sir, is 
unacceptable, under the present circumstances. We have had it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding with the 
debate on Bill C-95 I would simply ask colleagues in the House on 
both sides that we continue  this debate in a respectful fashion. We 
had all hoped and set out to do that with great commitment when 
we first came to this House following the last federal election 
which brought us here together to this House of Commons in this 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am going to support Bill C-95. The Department of 
Health is very important. It is the department of drug certification, 
the department of product safety and the department of health act 
enforcement. It is the department of defence against disease, that 
common enemy of all Canadians.
<P>
	From time to time hon. opposition members have criticized the 
Department of Health. They say it spends too much money. I say it 
is money wisely spent and not at all more than its responsibilities 
require. Consider the array of vital activity the Department of 
Health supports under its mission to help the people of Canada 
maintain and improve their health.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	Health Canada plays a major role in protecting the health of 
Canadians. This House has been preoccupied with paring back for 
some time, but hon. members know very well that certain demands 
on the system will not go away simply because budgets are cut.
<P>
	Health threats allow no fiscal restraint. It is a challenge of the 
Department of Health to maintain an infrastructure that guarantees 
quality health care to Canadians in good times as well as in bad.
<P>
	More than 2,000 people work in the department to protect the 
health of Canadians by regulating goods and services mostly under 
the Food and Drugs Act, but also under the air and water 
legislation.
<P>
	Health Canada has an environmental responsibility to manage 
chemical and radiological hazards. Each year a way must be found 
and the resources must be provided to review 1,000 new medical 
devices before they reach the market.
<P>
	Health Canada prevents or regulates the sale and advertising of 
dangerous products and warns consumers about those in 
circulation. With everything else on their minds, people do not 
want to be worried about those details in their daily lives. The 
department helps take that worry away.
<P>
	Product safety is part of the larger picture in maintaining health. 
Accidents in the home and at work are a major cause of death and 
disability between the ages of 5 and 35, causing not only the loss of 
enjoyment of life but economic loss and heavy medical and 
hospital expenses.
<P>
	Each year thousands of field inspections, almost 3,000 last year, 
are carried out among food and drug establishments. Each 
inspection leads to an average of five analyses of food, drug and 
medical devices, some  14,000 last year. The department is 
responsible for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16162"> 16162 </A></B>
<P>
the nutritional quality of food, for making sure that additives, 
agricultural chemicals and processing methods are safe.
<P>
	In 1994 more than 77,000 tests of suspected illicit drugs were 
carried out. Health Canada administers the Narcotic Control Act. It 
also works to ensure that drug products which may be effective 
when used one way do not pose unacceptable risks in another way. 
All pharmaceuticals in use in Canada must be certified by the 
department. A revised drug certification renewal process is 
designed to improve protection of consumers and to increase their 
access to important new drugs.
<P>
	Over the past year, investigations were conducted into 20 
outbreaks of disease including TB, cholera, hepatitis B, hanta virus 
and the hamburger disease. We do not know enough yet about some 
emerging infections to be able to prevent or control them. Radio, 
television and the press report to Canadians every day on the gaps 
in our ability to track threats such as drug resistant bacteria and 
those surfacing viruses. The public is more knowledgeable than 
ever in history.
<P>
	Health intelligence is shorthand for pooling awareness, 
information and understanding of health problems and approaches 
among various jurisdictions and health sector partners.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The Department of Health's laboratory centre for disease control 
is now strengthening Canada's health intelligence network. This 
initiative, which will include participation in a new global network 
designed to detect emerging diseases, is endorsed by the provincial 
governments. The provinces know that national leadership in this 
area is essential if we are to make the most cost effective choices 
among all available health technologies and options.
<P>
	The path to the government's objective of getting more value for 
every dollar spent on health is paved by preventing illness before it 
starts and by promoting healthy living. Each dollar that goes to 
prevent ill health saves tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
treatment costs.
<P>
	Health intelligence is one of the tools used within the department 
to address perplexing and persistent issues, such as mental health, 
cancer, AIDS, family violence, heart and lung disease, and prenatal 
deprivation. The department supports research to determine what 
will enhance health. It then promotes these activities by education 
and awareness campaigns and by developing infrastructure and 
programs.
<P>
	For instance, the department is at the penetrating point of a 
network of government programs for children. The clear 
understanding is that the future of children depends on critical 
input during the first year of life.
<P>
	The government as a whole directs more than $15 billion 
annually to Canadian children and their families to support health 
and development. Health Canada provides a wide range of 
programs for children at risk of abuse or injury, social or physical 
diseases. This year its child development initiative includes a 
ground breaking childhood cancer information system and 
strategies to address children's mental health.
<P>
	Hon. members have heard of the department's prenatal nutrition 
program to reduce the tragedy of infant disability due to poorly 
nourished mothers. This is a comprehensive effort that includes 
diet supplements as well as counselling in nutrition and lifestyle 
issues such as smoking, substance abuse, stress and family 
violence.
<P>
	As we come to pass from one century to the next, we might 
reflect that when our great grandparents witnessed the last such 
passage, their average lifespan and that of their friends was many 
years less than ours. As recently as the 1930s the average lifespan 
of a Canadian male at birth was only 60 years. A baby boy born 
today can expect to live at least 25 per cent longer, the equivalent of 
an extra week per month, or 13 weeks annually, or 15 years of extra 
life. A female baby's longevity has been extended by 18 years.
<P>
	Better nutrition, better housing, better working conditions, and 
better sanitation have been major contributing factors to our better 
health and longer lives. But also there are marvels of human 
ingenuity applied to the field of health. The cholera and typhus that 
assailed our ancestors was controlled. Our children were defended 
against smallpox, diptheria and polio by simple vaccination. We 
learned to deal pre-emptively with the ravages of syphilis and 
tuberculosis. In each we triumphed. We spared thousands of lives 
and prevented a huge loss to the productive capability of this 
nation. Billions of dollars have been saved in the cost of care.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The federal government spends many millions of dollars each 
year on health research and makes it available to all provinces, all 
hospitals and all doctors throughout Canada. The outcome of this 
research saves the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	The unfortunate reality is that illness still exists. Diseases afflict 
us unpredictably and haphazardly. Most illnesses, especially the 
major ones, are blind accidents. We are only able to deal with them 
after they have made an appearance. We must use the methods of 
medical care for this.
<P>
	In Canada fortunately, disease is not made twice tragic by having 
a sick person bear the cost of the treatment. Expenses are paid in 
full by Canada's comprehensive and universal medical insurance 
programs which pay family physician and specialist fees as well as 
the charges for tests, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16163"> 16163 </A></B>
<P>
hospitalization, any or all that are required. This system is a source 
of deep national pride.
<P>
	Patients in some provinces were asked to pay the difference 
between what health care providers were charging and what their 
provincial health plan would pay. This practice became known as 
user charges. As well, some doctors were billing patients over and 
above the provincially approved rates. Extra billing and user fees 
were a serious threat to our national medicare system.
<P>
	To stop this erosion the Liberal government of the day instituted 
the Canada Health Act in 1984. This established in law the five 
principles on which the system remains supported. Everyone is 
covered for all medical necessities. Access to care is on an equal 
basis. Coverage is portable among provinces. Administration and 
payments are handled by the public sector. It is this act that still 
governs the health care system that has evolved in Canada and 
which is the best health care system in the world.
<P>
	It is the Department of Health that administers and enforces this 
act, this cornerstone of Canadian cohesion. It is this bill, Bill C-95, 
that positions the department even more surely to discharge its 
responsibilities so essential to our national interest. It is therefore 
my intention to vote for its passage which I trust will be swift.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member's speech. At one point in his 
speech he made the comment that sickness in Canada is not made 
tragic because the system pays for everything. I would like to tell a 
short story and ask a question of the member about that very aspect.
<P>
	In 1989 a man I know noticed some blood in his stool so he went 
along to the doctor. The doctor said it looked pretty serious and that 
he would have to book the man in to see a specialist. It was going to 
take six weeks to see the specialist in Vancouver. That is not 
uncommon. Anybody who has been to a doctor and has had to go to 
a specialist knows that sort of waiting list is common in Canada. 
The man said to the doctor: ``I am not prepared to wait six weeks 
for something that could be life or death. Give me the name of 
someone I can see in the United States because when it comes to 
life and death, I am prepared to pay''.
<P>
	The doctor said he would see what strings he could pull. The 
doctor pulled some strings and voilà, in two days the man suddenly 
received attention. It was not because it was fair that he jumped to 
the front of the line but because he made a lot of noise about it. He 
visits the specialist and the specialist says: ``You really need an 
MRI to determine exactly the extent of the problem. It is going to 
take 10 weeks to get you an MRI at St. Paul's Hospital in 
Vancouver because there is not enough money to run it. It can only 
do five scans a day and only one of those is for anything other than 
cranial scans''. If you have a cat that is sick you can take it to the 
MRI  after hours and it can be scanned. You can pay for your cat to 
be scanned but you cannot pay.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	This person said: ``I'm not prepared to wait 10 weeks for an 
MRI. Give me the name of a place in the United States''. The 
doctor said: ``Okay, if you go down to Bellingham, St. Joseph's 
Hospital can do it for you. Let me call and make the 
arrangements''. He called up and the man was offered an 
appointment the very next day, not 10 weeks, the very next day.
<P>
	The man decided it was a little inconvenient the next day so went 
two days later. He was treated like a client, not a number. He was 
shown into the hospital. He was not even asked whether he could 
pay or not.
<P>
	I know this is the truth because it was me. The man was not even 
asked if he could pay. He was invited into the hospital. He had his 
test. He had the MRI. The doctor said to him: ``If you will have 
lunch and a cup of coffee, in two hours come back and we will have 
the report written up and all the pictures for you''.
<P>
	I had my entire tests done and was back in Vancouver in four 
hours with the results that would have taken 10 weeks.
<P>
	The worse thing about that whole exercise was when everything 
had been done, and I had been given the package, they said: ``How 
are you going to pay for this?'' I had to pay $1,000 U.S. to St. 
Joseph's Hospital in Bellingham when I would rather have paid it 
to St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver.
<P>
	What sort of a stupid system is this? This is not rich and poor. It 
is life and death.
<P>
	When the member says that the Canadian system does not make 
sickness tragic he should think a bit more about real cases. It is 
real. Luckily I had the choice to go across the border and pay 
$1,000 U.S. to save my life. The sick, despicable system that the 
government continues to support would have resulted in my death 
because of the waiting lists and no choice.
<P>
	All that the Reform Party wants in the health care system is 
choice. That is all it is. It is not to deprive anybody of anything. If I 
had been able to spend that $1,000 at St. Paul's Hospital in 
Vancouver I would have subsidized an MRI for somebody else who 
could not afford to pay. That is the principle.
<P>
	That is why the eye clinics in Alberta work so well. That is why 
the waiting lists are down. The people who have a little extra 
money and are prepared to go some other place reduce the waiting 
lists.
<P>
	I would like to hear the member's comments about that and why 
he would support a system that would have resulted in my death.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16164"> 16164 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to attempt to reply 
to the hon. member's statement and possibly a question.
<P>
	He called the greatest health care system in the world, that is 
admired by citizens in every country throughout the world, a stupid 
system. Yet it is based on not how many dollars you have got in 
your pocket, but on need.
<P>
	The hon. member did not go on. I see him moving out now-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to 
remind colleagues that we are not to refer, reflect or certainly not 
mention the absence of any member in the Chamber at any time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for reminding me of that. 
It is a usual courtesy that when one asks a question to wait around 
and hear the answer.
<P>
	I am amazed that the hon. member would prefer the system of 
our good friends in the United States where there are literally 
millions of people who have no health care. We have all heard the 
horror stories of their losing a lifetime of savings, losing their 
homes as a result of a health problem some time during their lives. 
I am sure the hon. member was not suggesting that we should look 
at that type of system for Canada.
<P>
	The principles that were put in place were put there to protect the 
health care of all Canadians so that all Canadians would be treated 
equal.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that if his particular 
situation, to which he referred, was an emergency situation, most 
hospitals that I have been involved with over the years-and I 
served on a hospital board for some 15 years-always set aside 
time both in their outpatients, in their emergency rooms and in their 
OR for emergency situations. They also schedule those selective 
procedures that have to be done. Some may be in day surgery, some 
may be a little more serious and take more time.
<P>
	The world is not perfect in each and every hospital, but in the 
particular situation the hon. member describes that certainly his 
doctor-and I am not being critical of his doctor-should have 
interceded on his behalf if indeed it were an emergency situation 
and obtained the OR time or the day surgery time and made sure 
that it was scheduled. I think there was some responsibility there.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	We have the greatest health care system in the world. We see this 
on a daily basis. However, there is always room for improvement, 
which is exactly what we are doing. We are trying to work with the 
provinces to avoid those areas of duplication and to assist in putting 
together a better program.
<P>
	The provincial health care ministers are trying to develop a 
better program that will continue to evolve and  improve in order to 
make it even better than it is today. I suggest that it takes all of the 
health care practitioners working to improve the program and 
maintain those principles that have made the health care program 
in Canada envied throughout the world.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have approximately two 
minutes left in the question and comment period. I would ask the 
hon. member for his co-operation that I might also give the 
member for Carleton-Charlotte equal time to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will give him 
time to respond. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to say 
that no, I do not support a United States style health care system. 
Neither does anyone else in the Reform Party.
<P>
	Reform members have made it very clear that we support 
medicare plus which is a lot different. Sweden uses a similar 
system. I can also give an example from New Zealand of my 
82-year old mother who needed a cataract operation. The waiting 
list in the public system was years. If you are 82 and you have to 
wait six years, then what? Since there is a choice down there she 
paid a couple of thousand dollars to have one of her eyes done. So 
many seniors did the same thing that the waiting list came down. 
When she went for her second operation she had it done within the 
public system and it only took two weeks. The waiting list vanished 
within a very short period of time.
<P>
	We do not support a U.S. system. We support choice in addition 
to the present medicare, common sense.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member for 
his co-operation. I would ask the same from the hon. member for 
Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed I will respect your wishes. I 
am pleased to hear that the hon. member and his colleagues support 
the health care system we have in Canada. I cannot speak at great 
length about the system that might be in place in New Zealand to 
which I believe he referred. I do not have any expertise in that area 
so I will not refer to that part.
<P>
	However, I do know, and I have seen it personally over many 
years, of the benefits of the medicare system in our country. Yes, 
we can improve it. Yes, we should continue to work toward 
improving it and making it even better. It is a system that has been 
admired throughout the world and we should continue to promote 
and protect it for years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I begin I would like to commend my hon. colleague 
from North Vancouver because he laid bare in the House a personal 
health care matter. I say to the people across the way who have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16165"> 16165 </A></B>
<P>
been heckling him that if he had not gone down to the United States 
he  would be dead today. It is a very real example of how our health 
care system failed him as it fails other Canadians from coast to 
coast. The reason why he was able to have a life saving operation in 
the United States was because he had the money. That is what the 
government is preserving today. It is preserving a system that 
enables the rich to get better health care than the poor.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Today we are dealing with Bill C-95, an act to establish the 
Department of Health. It is a housekeeping bill, a bill of 
wordsmithing, a bill that changes words, a bill that does not have 
anything to do with devolution of powers, nothing to do with 
personnel changes, nothing to do with any vision to save health 
care in this country; health care I might add that is in critical 
condition and needs emergency help.
<P>
	It is profoundly tragic that we have this bill in front of us. In the 
last two years the Minister of Health has yet to put a single piece of 
legislation on the table to amend and improve health care for 
Canadians, Bill C-7 notwithstanding, which did not come from her 
department but came from another source.
<P>
	The minister keeps on saying that we do not have a problem, that 
we are moving toward reorganization. She claims that Reform 
members are in favour of a system that prevents access for the 
poor. The problem is access. Canadians are not getting access to 
essential health care services from coast to coast. That is the 
problem. The government is defending a health care system that is 
crumbling from within.
<P>
	I will give a little background. When the Canada Health Act was 
written in 1984, the people who wrote it with very noble intentions 
simply could not envision the increasing costs, the increasing 
demands and the changing demographics of an aging population. 
That was not envisioned. Today we are using a health act organized 
over a decade ago to deal with problems that did not exist then. 
Therefore we see the failure that the Canada Health Act has in 
trying to address the problems that we have today.
<P>
	If we continue to pursue the course we are on now we will not 
have a health care system in this country. We will only see people 
suffering to varying degrees. Those who will suffer the most are 
those who are the poorest. I will give an example.
<P>
	Operating rooms are closing across the country. They are closing 
because hospitals have to save costs. However, waiting lists are 
increasing. In the hospital in British Columbia where I worked 
patients decided to have their own blood transfused and banked for 
operations in case they needed it. It cost the patient $125. The 
Minister of Health in British Columbia, Mr. Ramsey said: ``No, 
you can't do that because it contravenes the Canada Health Act''. 
One month later we had an acute blood shortage in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	I had patients with fractured hips, bleeding to death, with low 
haemoglobins and no blood was available. If the province had 
allowed the autologous blood transfusions we would not have had 
that problem. Is that access? I hardly think so.
<P>
	In Victoria the wait for radiation therapy for prostate cancer is 16 
months. What happens? Patients are sent down to Washington state 
where an entire industry has grown to serve Canadians. Is that 
Canadian access?
<P>
	People with carpal disorder in the wrists have to wait six months 
before they have surgery. They are off work six months. This 
surgery could be done in a private clinic within two weeks. Is that 
access?
<P>
	Imagine one of your grandparents needs a hip transplant,Mr. Speaker, and is in severe pain. If they live in British Columbia, 
40 per cent will wait over 13 months to get that hip replaced and all 
of that time they are in pain. Is that access? Not at all.
<P>
	The health care system is falling apart. To get around this, those 
who are rich go down to the United States for their health care 
needs. The politicians in this government say that the Canada 
Health Act is sacrosanct. They say: ``We the government are 
defenders of the health care for all Canadians because we want to 
ensure that they have access, because we don't want those terrible 
Reformers amending the Canada Health Act and having an 
American style system that enables only the rich to have access 
while the poor suffer''. That is the complete opposite to what we 
have.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	My colleagues and I never got involved in this matter to destroy 
health care. We saw the suffering occurring in emergency rooms in 
hospitals across the country. We got involved to save health care. 
We recognize there is a problem. We do not want to destroy health 
care. We got involved to amend the Canada Health Act to ensure 
that all Canadians, regardless of income, have their health care 
services performed in a timely fashion. My colleagues and I have 
given examples to indicate that is simply not occurring.
<P>
	We have proposed a system that would amend the Canada Health 
Act to allow for private clinics. Basically people could pay money 
to a private clinic for health care services. Not a single penny of the 
taxpayers' money would go into the system. Is it an unequal 
system? Yes, it is. However, is it not better to have an unequal 
system with better access for all people than the relatively similar 
access we have today that provides for declining access for all 
Canadians. In the present system the rich can go to the United 
States for their health care services while those in Canada suffer 
and die.
<P>
	In Toronto, where I trained, the waiting list for coronary artery 
bypass grafting is seven months. People are dying waiting for 
bypass surgery. I know a similar example happened in 1986 when I 
was finishing my  training in British Columbia where men and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16166"> 16166 </A></B>
<P>
women in their fifties were dying waiting for bypass surgery in 
Vancouver. That is not access.
<P>
	We have declining funds and increasing demands, but caught in 
the middle is the most important element of all, the patients who 
are sick, scared and worried. Their families are worried and scared. 
At a time of their greatest need our health care system may fail 
them. That is not what we want. That is not what Canadians want. 
That is not what the government wants. That is certainly not what 
the Reform Party wants.
<P>
	I implore the Minister of Health and the government to stop the 
political rhetoric. Let us move away from political postering. Let 
us work together to build a new Canada Health Act that enables all 
Canadians from coast to coast to obtain their health care services in 
a timely fashion. We want to protect medicare, not destroy it.
<P>
	We cannot sacrifice, as my hon. colleague from Macleod said, 
the most important social program we have today, the health care 
system. We simply cannot let that program, which is a defining 
characteristic of Canada, disappear. We must preserve it because it 
is the most valuable thing each and every one of us have as 
individuals.
<P>
	As an aside I ask the hon. minister to look at some interesting 
work being done by one of the greatest minds in the country, Dr. 
Fraser Mustard. In Toronto he looked at the determinants of health 
care. He has a new vision with respect to health care. The 
determinants of health care are somewhat different from what we 
have seen in the past. A investment in the early development of 
children will pay Canadian society in many aspects in the long run.
<P>
	I implore the minister to look at the work this man has done 
because it is ground breaking and something we can incorporate 
federally and provincially into the health care programs that exist 
today.
<P>
	The government also needs a fiscal plan. As we unfortunately 
saw about six weeks ago, the IMF downgraded us by 50 per cent, 
saying very clearly to the Minister of Finance that if we do not get a 
plan to decrease the debt Canada would be in very serious and dire 
straits. We can read into it that our social programs will be in dire 
straits. Nobody in the House wants to see that. We want to preserve 
them in a financially sustainable fashion. Health care will suffer the 
same blows as all other social programs. Unfortunately sick people 
are the ones who will suffer.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I implore the hon. Minister of Health to speak to the Minister of 
Finance and other cabinet ministers to look at our zero in three plan 
and utilize aspects of it to put our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	One of my colleagues said today that rather than amending the 
Canada Health Act we need to look to preventive measures. That is 
all well and true. However, will prevention lower taxes on tobacco? 
Is prevention cutting the tobacco reduction strategy by 50 per cent? 
Is prevention putting legislation programs and plans in place that 
are actually increasing tobacco consumption, especially among the 
youth, by 10 per cent or 15 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Liberal prevention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> That is right. The 
government is talking prevention out of one side of its mouth. On 
the other hand it is causing hundreds of thousands of youths to take 
up tobacco smoking and will cause between 40,000 and 200,000 
premature deaths over the next 20 or 30 years. That is not 
prevention.
<P>
	If the government had enacted sensible solutions with respect to 
tobacco, we could accept it and work with it. I cannot accept 
talking about prevention on the one hand as a solution to health 
care problems, while on the other hand lowering tobacco taxes and 
decreasing the tobacco reduction strategy. That simply does not 
make sense.
<P>
	I implore the government to work with us to amend the Canada 
Health Act so that medicare can provide essential services to 
Canadians from coast to coast. It must also realize that we have a 
problem. Pedantic statements about preventive health care, saying 
that somehow we will build greater efficiencies into the system and 
quoting laparoscopic surgery as the panacea for health care cost 
control will not work. It will take more radical, thoughtful, 
sensitive changes for all Canadians to have their health care needs 
met.
<P>
	It disturbs me greatly that members of the House across the way 
accuse us of wanting an American style health care system. They 
accuse us of saying that what is in our pockets when we need health 
care services is what matters. We deplore that. It is anathema to us 
and we will fight against those types of attitudes every way we can. 
In my estimation as a physician we are the only party in the House 
putting forward a plan to save not only health care but all our social 
programs.
<P>
	If we can put aside the political rhetoric and work together to 
build strong and sustainable health care and social programs, we 
can build a better country for all Canadians. We are building the 
country for Canadians from coast to coast. We are particularly 
preserving health care programs for those most in need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been waiting here all day; there is nothing closer to my heart than 
work and health care.
<P>
	I was fortunate at 12.30 today to listen to the great American 
fighter, Ralph Nader, talk about health care to the nurses 
association. He said that in the United States of America some 
80,000 people died in hospital due to malpractice. That is more 
people 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16167"> 16167 </A></B>
<P>
than those killed by  accidents and those killed by homicides. His 
contention was that it was malpractice and that some doctors in 
their system were actually operating on Americans who had no 
disease at all.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	We hear a lot about systems in the world. Mr. Nader said, and I 
think the parliamentary secretary from Vancouver Centre said it as 
well, that our system rates between one and three in the world. 
There is no question about that. Mr. Nader also mentioned that 
some 38 million Americans do not have any health care. He said 
the longest waiting line in the world is for those with no health care 
at all.
<P>
	Our friends opposite talk about having a two tier system. I want 
to cover that point. We have a $72 billion pot of money. What 
happens if we start to shift the money over? Profit will motivate 
many people such as insurance companies. Most doctors are very 
good. I would not say anything against them because many of my 
friends are doctors. They follow the Hippocratic oath. They are 
well versed, Christian and want to help people. However, there is 
the occasional doctor who looks at the balance sheet.
<P>
	I got a pile of books from a friend in Los Angeles on their 
medicare system. They talk about waiting lines as if there is a 
panacea in the United States. There are many scam artists in the 
United States. They go for capitation. If five doctors each have 
1,500 patients and each patient pays about $200 a month, it 
amounts to a pile of money. A patient can select one of the five 
doctors. However if the doctor sends too many people for CAT 
scans and various other expensive procedures he is called before a 
procedure committee and the patients are stacked up.
<P>
	There are no easy answers. Our system is good. It needs to be 
fixed. We cannot legislate against stupidity or when people do not 
do things right. If there is a waiting line for hip fractures I am sure 
the hospital board will allocate enough resources to shorten the 
line.
<P>
	How does my friend from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca envisage 
this two tier system? When people are sick and cannot pay for 
services we end up with a two tier system. The doctor says he will 
see the patient in the clinic across the street at night because there 
is not enough money in the system. That is what happens in a two 
tier system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad the hon. member raised a couple of points. He illustrated the 
salient misunderstanding of health care on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	He spoke about taking part of the $72 billion and putting it into a 
private clinic system. That is what we are opposed to. Not a single 
penny of public moneys, not a single penny of taxpayers' dollars, 
will go into a private system.
<P>
	When people are in the private system they have actually left the 
public system and are spending their own money. They are still 
contributing through their taxes to the public system and therefore 
the pot of money in the public system will be preserved.
<P>
	Because the numbers of people on waiting lists in the public 
system will decrease there will be a greater amount of money on a 
per capita basis in the public system, which will provide for greater 
access and better equipment.
<P>
	Another point the member raised was that if hospitals saw an 
urgent need for something they would find the resources or the 
money. The problem is that they do not have the resources. They 
are rationing all manner of services and are not getting access 
together. We have an opportunity not to duplicate any other system 
in the world but to enable an excellent system to continue to be 
excellent. We can do that by making the changes necessary to 
preserve publicly funded medicare in this country through 
amendments to the Canada Health Act. If we do not do that, we will 
not have a health act in this country. We will not have publicly 
funded health care access to people in this country in a timely 
fashion. That is going to be the tragedy if we continue on our 
present course.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it being 5.30 p.m., the House will 
now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government, on this 60th anniversary 
of the ``On to Ottawa'' Trek, should offer an unequivocal and official apology 
for the government of the day having perpetuated the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) having caused, through the use of violence as administered by the 
combined police forces of the Regina City Police and the RCMP the termination 
of the trek in Regina, Saskatchewan on July 1, 1935, with attendant loss of life, 
injury and imprisonment;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) having contributed to, rather than detracted from the plight of the 
unemployed by:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) forcing many unemployed young men into work camps,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) having prevented all the trekkers from coming to Ottawa to express their 
democratic right for better conditions in the work camps,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) abrogating its responsibility of providing the necessary leadership in a time 
of high unemployment which would have created decent and rewarding full 
time employment;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16168"> 16168 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) displaying a total lack of policy initiatives which would have provided 
meaningful work and wages for the unemployed, and for the violent attack on the 
participants of the ``On to Ottawa'' trek.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I have this 
opportunity to present the motion in the House today. This year 
marks the 60th anniversary of the ``On to Ottawa'' trek. This 
motion calls for an apology, which is 60 years overdue.
<P>
	In Regina we have an historic marker set in front of the Regina 
city police station. On it appears the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At 8.17 p.m. July 1, 1935, rioting erupted here in Market Square when RCMP 
and city police arrested the ``On to Ottawa'' trek leaders as they addressed 
trekkers and city residents. Rioting then spread to the 11th Avenue and Scarth 
Street area. Ending near midnight, it left extensive property damage, numerous 
injuries, and a city policeman, Detective C. Millar, dead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The trekkers were single men en route to Ottawa from B.C. to demand better 
conditions in relief work camps set up for the unemployed. They were stopped 
in Regina on June 14 by the federal authorities, who feared a revolution if the 
trek reached Ottawa. At a meeting between trek leaders and the federal cabinet, 
mistrust grew, and trekkers were prohibited from advancing or going home. To 
break the deadlock, Ottawa ordered the leaders' arrest. In the furor of the 
resulting riot, the frustration of the trek's failure and years of unemployment 
were released.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The next day the provincial government arranged for the trekkers to return to 
their homes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Signed by the Government of Saskatchewan in 1979, the text on 
this marker refers to the tragic events known as the Regina riot. The 
text is short and temperate and barely explains why the provincial 
government signed an epitaph commemorating a riot. I will 
attempt to do that.
<P>
	Facts will show that the riot was planned and provoked not by 
the trekkers but by the police on direct orders of the federal 
government, which in so doing illegally usurped the authority of 
the provincial government, which was in the process of negotiating 
a settlement with the trekkers.
<P>
	The riot was the climax of a strike of the relief camp workers 
begun on April 4, 1935, in British Columbia. With a set of demands 
adopted at a meeting of the relief camp workers' union in 
Kamloops on March 10, 1935, the strikers stayed for two months in 
Vancouver and then started east to Ottawa to put their grievances 
before the government of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett.
<P>
	Before arriving in Regina, the trek's ranks were augmented with 
new recruits. By the time the trekkers reached Regina the numbers 
had swelled to 2,000. Unbeknownst to the trekkers and the 
Saskatchewan government, Regina was their ultimate destination, 
not Ottawa.
<P>
	Having stopped them in Regina, Prime Minister Bennett 
arranged to meet with a few representatives. He obviously did not 
want the entire trek to arrive in Ottawa, with however many more 
who would have joined along the way.
<P>
	Unfortunately the meeting with the Prime Minister was 
unproductive. Bennett offered a temporary camp near Lumsden, 
Saskatchewan, where the trekkers would go until arrangements 
were made to return them to the permanent camps and the same 
inhumane conditions they had left. All along the only option the 
federal government was prepared to give the trekkers was no 
option. The status quo is the operative word.
<P>
	When the trekkers' representatives returned to Regina from 
Ottawa, they attempted to undo the deadlock the Prime Minister's 
offer had presented by developing a revised proposal. They worked 
diligently to set up meetings with all the authorities. The trek 
leaders also decided to hold a public meeting to inform the citizens 
of the result of their meeting with the Prime Minister. Posters went 
up, and it was known that only a few trekkers would attend the 
rally.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Early in the morning on July 1, the trek leaders initiated 
negotiations with both the federal and the provincial governments 
in the hope of obtaining an agreement for an early withdrawal. One 
of the trek leaders, Arthur Evans, requested a meeting of federal, 
provincial, and trek representatives. The chief federal 
representative in Regina refused to meet with provincial officials 
but agreed to meet with the trek representatives at 10.30 a.m.
<P>
	At this stage federal officials in Ottawa refused an excellent 
opportunity to reach a peaceful compromise. They refused any 
compromise whatsoever. But the trek leaders did not give up. They 
went to Liberal Saskatchewan Premier Jimmy Gardiner, who 
promised them a reply the following morning. The premier had 
arranged for a cabinet meeting that evening.
<P>
	The fact is, when the trekkers were conferring with Gardiner the 
federal government was preparing warrants and strategy for the 
arrests of Evans and six other leaders of the trek. At the public rally 
that evening a crowd of 2,200 had gathered to hear a report of the 
trekkers' delegation to Ottawa. In this crowd there were no more 
than 300 trekkers, as most had already been informed and were 
slated to attend a ball game elsewhere. In other words, it was a 
known fact that the meeting was for citizens rather than trekkers.
<P>
	Why the choice was made to arrest the leaders in front of a mass 
meeting of their supporters raises serious questions. Why they did 
not wait until after the meeting, after the crowd had left, to make 
the arrests has never been fully explained. However, it does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16169"> 16169 </A></B>
<P>
take a rocket scientist to understand that it was the nature of the  
arrangements and the means by which the police carried them out 
that provoked the Regina riot. A more discreet and less provocative 
arrangement could have been devised and the arrests could still 
have been carried out successfully.
<P>
	The riot that resulted from this action left plainclothes detective 
Charles Millar of Regina city police dead, scores of trekkers, 
citizens and policemen injured, and several trekkers and Regina 
citizens hospitalized with gunshot wounds. Downtown Regina was 
left in a shambles.
<P>
	The riot began as the Premier of Saskatchewan and the 
provincial authorities were considering the trekkers' proposals. 
The provincial government had not been informed of police 
intentions. Premier Gardiner wired the Prime Minister late that 
night, both protesting the police action and offering to disband the 
trek under provincial auspices. It is not difficult to understand how 
this marked the beginning of a dispute between the federal and 
provincial authorities. Gardiner was fearful that the intransigent 
federal attitude would lead to a resumption of hostilities and he 
demanded the federal authorities take a more reasonable position.
<P>
	The federal government had taken over provincial jurisdictions, 
starting with control of the RCMP, which had moved to organize 
the Regina city and railway police forces. Preparing for a 
showdown, the federal government also moved into other 
provincial areas, namely transportation, blocking the trekkers from 
access to roads and allowing them to leave only if they agreed to go 
to the camp near Lumsden.
<P>
	The federal authorities had obviously taken it upon themselves 
to instruct the RCMP in Saskatchewan in the enforcement of the 
ordinary criminal law and not merely in matters under the Railway 
Act. This represented another violation of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Based on the exchange between the Bennett and the Gardiner 
governments, it is more than fair to say that the Premier of 
Saskatchewan placed the responsibility for the tragic end to the trek 
in Regina squarely on the shoulders of the federal government of 
the day. The premier was not by any means alone in believing that.
<P>
	Ten years ago, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the 
``On to Ottawa'' trek, I presented a similar motion in the House. At 
that time I had the benevolent support of one of our colleagues who 
now sits on the other side of the House. She said: ``We should say 
that we are sorry. While it may not mean much in terms of 
individual compensation for the agony suffered by those people 
who lived through the Depression, it would certainly be a first step 
on the road to clearing the record''. This is quoted from the 
Commons debate of October 7, 1985, when the present Deputy 
Prime Minister supported an official apology to the trekkers and 
the citizens of Regina.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	She also stated: ``And we, both as members and as the 
government, should apologize to the unemployed workers who 
were forced to take to the streets to seek their own rights, which 
they should have been given by the Prime Minister at the time, who 
abdicated his responsibilities in this respect''.
<P>
	Like our colleague in 1985, I now challenge the government to 
listen and redress this pivotal event in our Canadian heritage. I 
want to believe this government is different from the previous one. 
History need not repeat itself once again.
<P>
	Ten years ago the Deputy Prime Minister and member for 
Hamilton East accused the Mulroney government of taking the 
same attitude as the Bennett government of taking a hands off 
approach to solving the unemployment crisis. She said: ``It does 
not want to be involved in the creation of jobs because somehow 
Conservative governments see something distasteful in direct 
government job creation. In fact, the Bennett solution at that time 
was to send the workers off to work camps, where they lived in 
intolerable circumstances and in fact were not ever able to have the 
dignity of a democratic election in those particular camps''.
<P>
	The tables have turned. The hon. member now sits in power, 
where she can actually do something to ensure there is not only 
democracy but also employment, social justice, and a future for our 
young people.
<P>
	This government started its term with job creation and the 
infrastructure program, but something terribly wrong has 
happened. This government has been hijacked by some group with 
another agenda.
<P>
	The motion I have placed before the House might merely be 
regarded as a footnote in history were it not for the fact that history 
has a tendency to repeat itself. Since this year's budget, instead of 
jobs we got cutbacks and massive decreases in provincial transfers. 
Jobs, we are told, are not for the governments to create; they will 
appear out of market forces-as if Prime Minister Bennett has been 
resurrected one more time.
<P>
	By leaving the provinces in the lurch, some of the provincial 
leaders are quickly turning the country's clock back to the 1930s. 
The present government still has an opportunity to make good on 
its election promises and the hope they offered. The federal 
government does not need to starve the provinces by abandoning its 
responsibility to the people. The deficit reduction plan does not 
need to be inhuman.
<P>
	I agree with the endorsement from the member for Hamilton 
East of my 1985 motion, when in reference to the apology she 
suggested that ``that act of good faith and goodwill on the part of 
the government would begin to restore the credibility this 
government has lost in insisting upon measures that are 
anti-worker, anti-family, anti-labour, and anti-union. Work must be 
done or the  government's word cannot be believed. Now is the 
chance for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16170"> 16170 </A></B>
<P>
government to win back some of the credibility it has frittered 
away since''-to which I add, the end of October 1993.
<P>
	Let this government show us that it is not just another job 
eliminator party. The Liberal government has its chance to stand up 
and finally set the record straight by making to these people, the 
strikers, a general, all-encompassing public apology.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister further stated 10 years ago: ``If 
it''-meaning the Mulroney government-``is truly sincere about 
beginning to gain back the confidence of young working people, 
young unemployed people, older working people, and older 
unemployed people to realize that the time has come for it to 
endorse an all-party resolution which calls for an apology to 
redress an event which occurred 50 years ago and which is 
indicative of the type of Conservative mentality which has led all 
Canadians to realize that Tory times are tough times''.
<P>
	The sad fact of the matter is that history, as I have just outlined, 
is in many ways and places across the country repeating itself. 
Many of the problems for which the trekkers sought solutions in 
the 1930s have returned in spades in the 1980s and continue in the 
1990s. Once again we have massive unemployment. Once again we 
are faced with widespread business failures, farm foreclosures, 
personal bankruptcies, food banks, user fees, head taxes, and 
policies that are reminiscent of an era we had hoped to have 
surpassed.
<P>
	The political repercussions and the legacy of the trek have a lot 
of parallels with today's environment. The National Council of 
Welfare's 1995 report on the last government budget states: ``The 
policies of the 1990s will take us back to the 1950s''. Recent 
statements and actions from at least two provincial governments 
would confirm that. In a 1987 article in the Canadian Review of 
Social Policy by Duncan Rogers, a former deputy minister of the 
Alberta Social Services described the 1950s period as ``the 
remnants of the old relief days of the 1930s''. He goes on: ``It was 
not uncommon for children, particularly from larger families, to be 
apprehended as neglected and become wards of the crown simply 
because there was insufficient money available to the family''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government is often accused of continuing the Tory 
legacy, while at the same time promising initiatives which will 
create jobs and opportunities for all Canadians. With nearly 10 per 
cent of our population unemployed, unemployment has become a 
chronic condition. Youth under employed is still worse, at 18 per 
cent. The rate for Canadians aged 15 to 24 years is nearly double 
the national average and costs the economy at least $4.5 billion per 
year.
<P>
	However, that is not the dearest price we are paying. Canada now 
has the third highest rate of teen suicide in the world, which has 
increased fourfold since 1960. The social and economic conditions 
under which kids are living are creating a social phenomena 
described as existential despair. Is that the best country the world?
<P>
	Will more jails and longer sentences deter the problems? They 
will do nothing if there is no hope for a future that brings rewards 
and fulfilment.
<P>
	I acknowledge the tremendous financial debt this country and 
the public sector faces due to the gross mismanagement of previous 
governments. I acknowledge the challenge that lies ahead for all of 
us to begin to solve our financial problems. Surely we must find 
ways of dealing with our problems other than on the backs of the 
old and the poor.
<P>
	As a Stats Canada study has shown, it is not increases in 
government expenditure that has created the debt. In fact, only 6 
per cent of the debt is due to increases in public expenditure. The 
rest is due to loss of revenue and increases in interest rate 
payments. Of that 6 per cent increase in government expenditures, 
only 2 per cent is due to increases in social programs.
<P>
	It is not the social programs which have created our debt. Yet it is 
our social programs that are paying for it. It is the cutbacks in 
health services, in unemployment insurance, programs to help train 
and create jobs for young people. That is where the burden is being 
placed to rectify the terrible, physical mistakes that past 
Conservative and Liberal governments have made.
<P>
	We are in a period of declining standards of living. Recently, 
Stats Canada issued a report that in 1993 the average family 
income in Canada declined by some 3 per cent, inflation factored 
in. The decline for single parent families in that one year was 8.3 
per cent. We are in a downward spiral.
<P>
	New challenging solutions are needed. But the solutions of R.B. 
Bennett did not work then and will not work now. I challenge the 
government to come forward with new imaginative proposals to 
give hope to our young people, to give employment to our young 
people and to give young people a future.
<P>
	I urge the House to adopt the motion to extend an apology for 
how those strikers were treated in 1935 in Regina some 60 years 
ago. They wanted to come to Ottawa to express their hope for a new 
future, to express their desire to work. They did not want welfare. 
They did not want the dole, they wanted jobs. Today the mass of 
unemployed young people are looking for work. They do not want 
handouts, they want a future.
<P>
	I urge the House to adopt the motion as a symbolic gesture to our 
young people that we are concerned about their future.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
to the motion of the hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle 
concerning the 1935 ``On to Ottawa'' trek and the Regina riot.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion recalls a time and place far removed 
from the Canada of today. It was the time of the Great Depression, 
a time of staggering unemployment, prolonged and terrible drought 
and the near collapse of national economies. There were shrinking 
markets and falling prices, all of which contributed to human 
misery and hardship on a scale seldom seen before in North 
America.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	This was a time when a woman working in a textile factory in 
Quebec could work a 60-hour week and earn only $5. The millions 
of acres of prairie wheat fields were turned into dust bowls and 
farmers walked away from family farms they had worked all their 
lives.
<P>
	In 1929 when the depression began there were 107,000 
unemployed in Canada. By 1933, the worst year of the depression, 
there were 646,000 unemployed, approximately one-quarter of the 
Canadian work force at that time.
<P>
	The response of the Bennett government to the depression for 
younger men was to organize work camps. These work camps were 
organized under the Department of National Defence. The workers 
within them were paid 20 cents a day. This was an early and very 
harsh form of workfare.
<P>
	Conditions in the camps were well described by the member for 
Qu'Appelle. They were camps in which work was done for the sake 
of doing work. ``We are playing at highway building'', reported the 
striker in his diary. ``What a joke we are. We make a ditch one day 
and then change the plans and find that it is in the wrong place''. A 
public servant for the Conservative government: ``Not one cent of 
public money has been spent on reading material and recreational 
equipment''.
<P>
	The member has performed a service in drawing to our attention 
the consequences of this kind of attitude toward the unemployed 
and the consequences of using work camps, workfare or whatever 
to deal with the unemployed.
<P>
	One of the workers wrote at the time: ``It is really the fact that we 
are getting nowhere in the plan of life that moves us forward to 
march to Ottawa. We are truly a lost legion of youth rotting away 
for want of being offered a sane outlet for our energies''.
<P>
	The work camps were organized in B.C., it must be said, largely 
by communist workers. The workers organized for the trek to 
Ottawa and by the time they got to Regina in June of 1935 there 
were 12,000 workers.  The Liberal premier of the province, 
Premier Gardiner, protested that the government of the day had 
decided to stop the workers there. Prime Minister Bennett met with 
the workers. The reply he gave them was very harsh and indeed he 
would not even let them talk.
<P>
	On July 1 unfolded the tragedy that has been described by the 
member opposite. One policeman died and we mourn his memory. 
Dozens of policemen and others, workers obviously, were injured. 
It is a black mark in the history of the depression. It is a black mark 
in the history of the city of Regina as well.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion suggests that the Conservative 
government of the day bears much of the responsibility for what 
took place in Regina and the judgment of history. The judgment of 
history in this case does largely bear out the hon. member's claim. I 
might add that during the depression solutions were not easy. Many 
kinds of solutions were made in various countries. The new deal in 
the United States was a very successful response to the depression 
but one that was thought to be authoritarian by many others.
<P>
	There were responses. In Italy Mussolini responded by making 
the trains run on time but also causing wars in places as far away as 
Abyssinia and responses in Germany where public works projects 
did create jobs.
<P>
	The party that the hon. member represents, the CCF, was formed 
during the 1930s and it sought solutions too. I quote from the 
Regina manifesto which called for complete social ownership and 
public management of the Canadian economy. It stated: ``All 
financial machinery, transportation, communications, electric 
power and all other industry and services essential to social 
planning should be nationalized and operated by the state; 
furthermore there be no compensation for bankrupt private 
concerns for the benefit of promoters and for stock and bond 
holders''.
<P>
	That is not the stand of his party today obviously. I mention this 
only because we have to give credit to people's views and their 
times and not to support R.B. Bennett's decision on that day in this 
particular case. However we can recognize that for us to judge 
today what they thought then reflects the judgment of a later day. 
We cannot, except in exceptional circumstances, apologize for 
history. The only people who can apologize for what took place in 
Regina, July 1, 1935 are the people who made the fateful decisions 
that precipitated the riot and they are dead.
<P>
	To apologize for the actions of a government in 1935 would be a 
well meant but futile gesture. If we cannot change history we can 
learn from it and we can look at the past wrongs through actions 
today.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	If you look at the demands of the strikers in 1935, you can see 
that the men who marched on Ottawa have in many ways had their 
wishes come true.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16172"> 16172 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian people tossed the Bennett government out of 
office in Ottawa in October 1935 and the Liberal government, 
which took office under Mackenzie King, righted many of the 
wrongs against which the strikers protested. For example, section 
98 of the Criminal Code, which had been used for arbitrary arrest 
of strikers and others, was abolished.
<P>
	By 1940 we had unemployment insurance in this country. After 
1940, we built a social system that offered a kind of minimum that 
the strikers and the people in the depression did not have.
<P>
	The best monument to the memory to the strikers of 1935 is the 
Canada we live in today. It is in our health care system which was 
created about 25 years afterward. It is in our system of 
unemployment insurance. It is in our comprehensive social 
services and it is in our fair hiring practices which was central to 
the protest made by the workers in Regina in 1935.
<P>
	Look around and ask, could the ``On to Ottawa'' trek and the 
Regina riot happen in Canada today? I think the answer is an 
unequivocal no. The hon. member has done a service to the people 
by placing the motion before the House, but while I cannot agree 
with this call for an official apology, I can applaud the sentiment 
that inspired this motion expressing profound regret that this 
government, indeed, all Canadians feel for what happened to 
Canadians during the Great Depression.
<P>
	It would be more fitting to honour the memory by taking the 
opportunity presented by this motion to re-dedicate ourselves to the 
principles of social justice that were lacking in Canada in 1935.
<P>
	Let us then work together to build a country where there is social 
equality and equal opportunity for all. It seems wrong to look at our 
own times and compare them to the 1930s and suggest that the 
conditions today, in any way, resemble those of the 1930s. The pay 
for the young men in the work camps was 20 cents a day. There was 
no unemployment insurance. There was no health insurance. There 
was no social system. There were no easy answers as well.
<P>
	Today, for whatever problems our economy faces, we have an 
unemployment rate that is probably one-third of what it was in the 
depression. We have protection for people who have lost their jobs. 
We have a government that is committed to creating jobs and work 
for Canadians and to maintaining a social system that protects the 
interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	I hope members will agree, including the member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle, that what we have accomplished since 1935 
is itself the best memorial to the strikers in Regina in July 1935.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion tabled  by the hon. 
member for Regina-Qu'Appelle, regarding the ``On to Ottawa'' 
trek which started in Vancouver and ended in Regina, on July 1, 
1935.
<P>
	I think it is important to tell our viewers how this episode came 
about, and to see if there are lessons to be drawn from it. It must be 
remembered that 1935 was one of the worst years of the Great 
Depression, which was probably the worst economic disaster of our 
century.
<P>
	It must also be remembered that this disaster occurred at a time 
when governments were saying: ``The less we get involved, the 
better it is. The less we try to control, the more we will promote 
wealth and its distribution''. Reality, however, turned out to be 
quite different. There was an enormous lack of confidence in the 
economy. Unemployment suddenly soared to astronomical levels, 
which had nothing to do with reality, but which meant that people 
could not get enough income to ensure their survival.
<P>
	We must not forget that, in those days, there were no social 
programs such as welfare and unemployment insurance. The safety 
net was not yet in place; consequently, those who lost their jobs had 
nothing to fall back on except begging.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Faced with this situation, the government of the day decided to 
set up work camps. Unfortunately, conditions in these camps were 
absolutely appalling, and this eventually led to the strike.
<P>
	There is a lesson to be drawn from certain important aspects of 
this strike. We are about to launch a reform of the old age pension 
and unemployment insurance programs, and crucial decisions will 
also be made regarding things such as social assistance funding. It 
is easy, when you overlook certain factors, to make quick 
assumptions on the actual impact of such measures.
<P>
	Finally, measures were established to ensure a distribution of 
wealth, a distribution of income and an opportunity to balance 
consumption. When essentially everything is in the hands of the 
rich, what remains, once the rich have taken what they require to 
satisfy their basic needs, becomes luxury. This situation moves the 
economy a lot less than if everybody had enough to live on and to 
feed their families.
<P>
	This sort of strike, which was stopped by violence, happened 
because the government of the day lacked sufficient means to 
distribute wealth.
<P>
	In order to avoid the excesses of the past and to permit 
redistribution of wealth, we must absolutely avoid behaviour such 
as that of the Government of Ontario, which drew up a list to show 
people they could live and feed themselves on $90 a month, 
forgetting milk for cereal and really crazy things. This sort of thing 
could lead to behaviour similar to this strike. We forget about 
respect for basic human dignity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16173"> 16173 </A></B>
<P>
	The other point we should remember is that mandatory work 
in unacceptable conditions is one thing that should be rejected as 
an option, because this too represents a failure to respect people's 
dignity. It leads to behaviour, which may not be justifiable, but 
which can be understood on closer examination.
<P>
	There is also another component, which got less attention this 
afternoon, and that is police intervention. There have been a 
number of police interventions in Canada's history which have 
been more or less justifiable in the past. In this case, we are talking 
about an intervention that affected workers in western Canada in 
1935.
<P>
	In Quebec, there was another one that affected us in a very 
particular way. It happened during the October crisis in 1970, 
where a lack of control over police action resulted in unacceptable 
behaviour and unwarranted arrests, as was described earlier in 
connection with events in Regina. The same thing happened in 
Montreal and Quebec City during the October crisis in 1970.
<P>
	As a state, as a country claiming to be one of the most 
democratic in the world, with highly interesting democratic 
practices we can boast of to others, we still have a number of 
lessons to learn from these examples, which must drive us to 
ensure that our police forces have very clear mandates and proper 
training to deal with the situations that arise. They must obtain 
mandates from a judge in special situations, so that such excesses 
never occur.
<P>
	I think we can say, with hindsight, that these young men-for it 
was mainly young men in these work camps-represented in some 
way the future of Canada at the time the strike took place. The way 
that they were crushed is something that must never happen again.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	One of the participants in the march, Joe McEwen, summed up 
the situation in a way by stating in the conclusion to his description 
of what happened ``We were the salt of the earth''. Young people, 
aged 20, aged 30, wanting to work, wanting acceptable conditions, 
not finding them, and taking steps to let the government know how 
dissatisfied they were. Their expression of the need for change fell 
on totally deaf ears which led to aggressiveness and unacceptable 
behaviour, probably on both sides, but this must serve as a lesson to 
us today to make sure that we are not demolishing everything that 
has been built and to avoid such situations.
<P>
	If the next unemployment insurance reform requires, as we fear 
it will, 26 weeks of work rather than 20 weeks in the first year of 
eligibility for unemployment insurance, we will see an increase and 
a perpetuation of the current statistics which show more and more 
people on welfare because they are not eligible for unemployment 
insurance. This type of reform leads directly to violent behaviour, 
because when people  cannot feed their families and provide them 
with the basic necessities it is somewhat normal for them to seek 
some way out, to show their dissatisfaction, sometimes in an 
aggressive manner.
<P>
	The other reform from which similar lessons must be learned is 
the reform of old age pensions. Over the past 15 to 20 years, we in 
Canada have developed a program which has enabled our seniors to 
enjoy greater security than before, at least from the economic point 
of view. In the upcoming reform, we must make sure that this 
economic security is not threatened, so our seniors may continue to 
have a decent income, one that enables them to meet their basic 
needs and to make a proper contribution to society.
<P>
	Often when these things are being discussed, there is talk of 
fearmongering and a desire to frighten people. I think we have to 
learn from the past and see that history often repeats itself. We 
must always be sure that rights are protected, and this is the main 
lesson I have learned from the motion, which asks the federal 
government to make an official and unequivocal apology for the 
reprehensible acts committed by the government of the day.
<P>
	The main lesson I can draw today, in 1995, is that we must 
ensure that the government opposite, as Parliament, does not repeat 
the same mistakes and that it provides a system of social programs 
that meets the needs of the 21st century. Globalization of trade does 
not mean standardization of social programs and this seems to me 
to be the challenge of the 21st century for Quebec and for Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a Saskatchewanian 
born and bred, I cut my teeth on stories of the Dominion Day riots 
and the much worse events that actually took place at about the 
same time at the coal mine strike in Estevan.
<P>
	I do not think there is anyone of proper mind who would deny 
that the work camps are a blot on Canadian history. I do not think 
anyone of my acquaintance would deny that the decision of the 
government of the day to arrest the trek leaders was stupid and 
unjustified.
<P>
	Unfortunately, history is a chronicle of violence and injustice. 
Historical revisionism notwithstanding, there is nothing you can do 
to change history. As the bard said, ``what is done is done and 
cannot be undone''.
<P>
	I am very uncomfortable with the principle of apologizing to 
people who suffered in the past because of my ancestors, if you 
will. We are faced with a stream of people who want to be 
apologized to for things their ancestors have suffered. At the 
moment there are Canadians of Ukrainian descent asking for 
apologies for the internment of their grandfathers and great-grand-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16174"> 16174 </A></B>
<P>
fathers during the first world war. There are  Canadians of Chinese 
descent asking us to apologize as a society for the head tax.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Where do we draw the line? Are we going to continue 
apologizing forever? I had ancestors who were dispossessed of 
their lands in Scotland in order to make room for sheep. Am I 
supposed to go out and ask for apologies from people who had 
nothing whatsoever to do with that? I do not believe so.
<P>
	More important, besides the question of where to draw the line, 
what is the point? Nothing we say or do here can undo the evil that 
was done 60 years ago. To be meaningful, an apology requires a 
certain degree of contrition. Frankly, I do not feel any guilt for 
actions that took place in my province when I was just a little boy. I 
did not break any heads, and I am not acquainted personally with 
anybody who did.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle wants to assuage 
his personal conscience or wants to go on a guilt trip, I am not 
going to accompany him. I would respectfully suggest that if he 
really wants to do something he should take a few thousand dollars 
out of his bank account, track down each surviving protagonist and 
buy each one a bottle of the best. That would be a commendable 
and meaningful gesture, which I would applaud wildly.
<P>
	What is being proposed here in the House today is meaningless; 
it is window dressing. We are not going to resurrect the dead. We 
are not going to heal the wounds of people who had their skulls 
cracked 60 years ago. Let us get on with our lives. We have more 
important things to worry about in the House.
<P>
	I will not be supporting the motion made by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one interesting thing 
about being a parliamentary secretary is that you get to stay up late. 
So here we are. I thank the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle for 
keeping me up this late and bringing the motion before the House.
<P>
	The motion before us calls on the federal government, on the 
60th anniversary of the ``On to Ottawa'' trek, to apologize for its 
actions at the time. According to the motion, the government's 
reaction to the march displayed a total lack of concern for the 
unemployed and the government was responsible for violence, loss 
of life, injuries, and the questionable jailing of several participants.
<P>
	In proposing the motion the member has given us a chance to 
consider the progress we have made in the last 60 years. I would 
like to reflect on where we were then and where we are now as 
relates to the labour movement. That is basically all we can do, 
because we cannot turn back the clock.
<P>
	On June 3, 1935, over 1,000 unemployed men began the ``On to 
Ottawa'' trek. They were frustrated and angry about their plight 
and determined to tell their political leaders and the nation that they 
deserved better. The trekkers made stops in Calgary, Medicine Hat, 
Swift Current, and Moose Jaw before arriving in Regina.
<P>
	At Regina a delegation of eight men was chosen and sent to 
Ottawa to meet with the Prime Minister. These talks failed. After 
attempts were made to arrest the leaders of the trek the situation 
deteriorated rapidly, leading to the Regina riot. By the end of it one 
policeman was dead, several dozen protesters, constables, and 
bystanders were injured, and 130 protesters were arrested. The 
events of July 1, 1935 were incredibly traumatic and they stand out 
in the pages of our history. What then did the trek accomplish? 
What lessons can we continue to draw from it today?
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I think we can draw a number of lessons. First, it is vital that we 
do not put ideology ahead of people's needs. Governments should 
never let adherence to a particular ideology or fear of a particular 
ideology blind it to the real needs of the people. Some parties in the 
House should take that message to heart.
<P>
	Another lesson of the trek is that if we as a society aspire to 
economic prosperity and social peace, we have to encourage the 
involvement of citizens. People have to take advantage of the 
opportunity to act through anti-poverty groups, social 
organizations and trade unions.
<P>
	We hear a lot of union bashing by right wingers these days, but it 
is a simple matter of fact that free societies and free trade unions go 
hand in hand. Societies that do not have a vigorous union 
movement challenging them to examine and re-examine their 
policies and attitudes are sorely lacking. The sweeping economic 
and social policy changes that we saw in Canada after World War II 
came about because the people demanded change to the status quo. 
These demands were translated into effective policies.
<P>
	Without people who agitate-and that is probably how I would 
classify my colleague across the way-criticize governments, 
challenge policies and organize their fellow citizens we would 
stagnate. We would not have made the progress we have in Canada.
<P>
	It is because of the challenges issued by the trekkers and others 
that we have built up social policies that go hand in hand with 
economic growth and prosperity. For example, there is free 
universal health care. Not only is it socially enlightened but it gives 
Canadian businesses a competitive advantage. Medicare has 
reduced the cost of health care to the economy and has left more 
money in the pockets of individuals and businesses.
<P>
	Similarly, good and balanced labour legislation that 
acknowledges the rights and needs of trade unions  promotes 
stability in the workplace, improves productivity, maintains 
purchasing power and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16175"> 16175 </A></B>
<P>
results in the creation of pension funds that are then accessed for 
both public and private investment.
<P>
	I could give other examples but I think I have made my point. 
Our collective experience with hard economic times, an experience 
that includes the ``On to Ottawa'' trek, has given us a certain 
perspective on social policy, a particular view of the meaning and 
purpose of social programs. In the short term the ``On to Ottawa'' 
trek probably did not accomplish much. In the bigger picture, 
though, it represents a shift in attitude. The work of the trekkers 
and other activists of the era contributed significantly to the rise of 
the Canadian labour movement.
<P>
	The trek did not create a formal organization but it created 
stirrings among the unemployed and among workers. It created the 
conditions in which the labour movement could grow. Before a 
strong labour movement could take root, working people had to 
become conscious of their power, their value and their dignity. The 
``On to Ottawa'' trek led to this awareness. Since then unions have 
become a major force in Canadian society. Unlike the United States 
where only 10 per cent of the workforce is organized, unions here 
are relatively healthy and represent about 30 per cent of workers in 
Canada.
<P>
	Canadian society has developed in large part because of the work 
and prodding of trade unions. I value and appreciate the role they 
play in Canada. I have a significant bias as that is what I used to do 
for a living before I came to this place. The labour movement of 
today owes a lot to the ``On to Ottawa'' trekkers and to all other 
men and women who struggled to make the Canadian society more 
just, compassionate and democratic. With the rise of the labour 
movement came new labour legislation. A milestone was PC order 
1003 in 1944 which put into law the right of workers to join unions 
and to engage in collective bargaining. That was not all that long 
ago.
<P>
	Since then governments have adopted a number of laws 
involving work standards, workplace health and safety, and worker 
protection. I am proud our laws are much more progressive and 
responsive to working people than the laws in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	In order that our laws continue to reflect and meet the needs of 
today's workforce we are in the process of a comprehensive review 
of the Canada Labour Code. In the spring we anticipate presenting 
legislation to the House for all members to consider. Our goal is to 
ensure a balanced system that benefits all of us.
<P>
	Again I thank the member for introducing the motion. It reflects 
on how difficult times were for millions of Canadians 60 years ago. 
The changes the trekkers were  trying to achieve was time well 
spent. It gives us an appreciation of how far we have come in 
working together to create conditions for social peace. This is a 
heritage we have to protect so that working Canadians can continue 
to build the country and continue to create opportunities for all.
<P>
	I agree with members opposite who have spoken before me that 
we cannot go back in time to try to understand why people did what 
they did. However we can learn from our mistakes and we can 
advance as we have in the country. As I have mentioned, let us hope 
the lessons we have learned from the trekkers will be put into 
legislation. They will always have a place in our hearts and our 
history simply because they helped to start the labour movement in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was not my intention to speak but since there 
is some time remaining I will say a few words on the motion of the 
hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle, which I was pleased to 
second.
<P>
	My reason for seconding the motion was to allow us to debate an 
event in Canada's history that serves as a reminder to us all of some 
difficult periods in our history that have in a sense given birth to 
many of the progressive pieces of social legislation and programs 
we now enjoy in Canada.
<P>
	It serves us well to remember events such as the march to 
Ottawa, the ``On to Ottawa'' trek of 60 years ago, and the struggles 
our forebears undertook to pave the way for some of the social 
programs we regard with such pride today.
<P>
	On the question of offering an unequivocal and official apology, 
I am not sure I would support that part of the motion for the same 
reasons that have already been expressed by my colleagues on both 
sides of the House. In this day and age we cannot judge the actions 
of our ancestors. We can only learn from them. I express that 
caveat in my endorsement of the debate the hon. member initiated.
<P>
	I was a little uncomfortable with the member's attempt to 
compare current circumstances with the depression that led to the 
``On to Ottawa'' trek and the unfortunate occurrences that took 
place in Regina on July 1, 1935. Canada has moved a long way 
from those unfortunate days. The struggles and the sacrifices of the 
workers who paid that price were part of what brought the country 
to where it is today.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	Even though we presently have our own economic difficulties in 
Canada, in no way do they compare to the difficulties those 
workers experienced in the dirty thirties which have been 
eloquently described by the hon. member and others in this House. 
Those difficulties are part of the past which Canada must learn 
from.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16176"> 16176 </A></B>
<P>
	With those caveats, I want to commend the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle on having introduced his motion and on 
having brought our attention to this chapter in Canada's history. 
It has allowed members on both sides of the House to draw some 
lessons from that period in Canada's past.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, we only have a 
few minutes left in this private members' hour. Would it be the 
disposition of the House for the member under whose name the 
motion stands to close the debate on this motion by taking no more 
than two minutes under right of reply and then we would adjourn?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to thank the members of the House for giving me 
this opportunity of closing the debate.
<P>
	I do wish to thank the member for Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso for being a seconder, in that way allowing the 
motion to be introduced today and allowing the debate. Since there 
was no member of my party here, his gracious action in allowing 
his name to be used to second the motion is greatly appreciated. I 
recognize as well that when he did that, he did not necessarily 
endorse everything in the motion, nor all the comments I would 
make.
<P>
	Despite what some hon. members say, we cannot rectify the past. 
We cannot mend broken bones nor can we raise up the dead, but I 
think it is important that in some instances we say that what was 
done back then was wrong. We should do it in an official way by 
extending an apology.
<P>
	To me it then becomes a signpost in the evolution of our 
civilization. A formal act of this Parliament, for example 
apologizing and stating that what occurred in the Regina riot was 
wrong, becomes a signpost in our evolution.
<P>
	I hope as well that what some of the hon. members particularly 
from the government side have stated is true, that there is a great 
difference between conditions then and now. Indeed, there are 
many differences. but the fear of many of us is that we are sliding 
into situations quite similar to the last depression.
<P>
	That was one of the reasons I also wished to bring this item up. 
While there are differences, unfortunately there are also growing 
similarities, particularly the sense of hopelessness many of our 
young people feel, the lack of jobs, the lack of a future, the lack of 
opportunity. Surely those young men in those camps must also 
have felt a sense of hopelessness for the future which motivated 
them to start the trek to Ottawa to bring to the attention of 
Parliament the conditions which existed.
<P>
	I hope those conditions will never return again. The reality is 
however that many of our young Canadian citizens face the future 
not with hope and aspirations, but with dejection and 
unemployment.
<P>
	I hope the government and this Parliament will remember what 
the Bennett government did back then and will reject it as a 
solution to the problems we face. I hope that we will work together 
toward a new solution to the problem.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
<P>
