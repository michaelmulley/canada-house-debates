	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 34(1), I have the honour to present, 
in both official languages, the report of the Canadian delegation 
to the 35th annual meeting of the Canada-United States 
Interparliamentary Group which was held in Santa Fe on May 19 
to 23, 1994.
<P>
	The agenda at these meetings is always extensive and wide 
ranging. The meetings in this case were no exception and we 
dealt with the economic issues as they relate to both countries, 
the international concerns we both feel and transborder matters. 
Other sessions dealt with a comparison between Canada's health 
care system and what the Americans are trying to implement, as 
well as the political situation in both countries.
<P>
	The range and depth of the discussions that took place went a 
long way in allowing the United States and Canadian 
parliamentarians to better understand the issues that come 
between both our countries. Whether the issue was softwood 
lumber or durum wheat, which is so prevalent today, the 
opportunity to put forward the Canadian position was afforded 
to us. I was very proud of the delegation being able to put our 
position forward in the strongest terms.
<P>
	As a point of fact, one of the main issues discussed-the 
minister of fisheries reported on it yesterday-was the lamprey 
infestation in the Great Lakes. We all know that the lamprey 
situation is reaching epidemic proportions. It is as a direct result 
of these meetings held in the month of May that the increased 
funding for lamprey control in the United States and Canada has 
been increased. We should be able to bring this parasitic animal 
under some control and guarantee the fisheries in both 
countries.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Canadian and American delegations agreed 
to follow up on the durum wheat issue, cross-border matters and 
other issues as they relate to Canada and I have the pleasure of 
presenting this report to the House of Commons.

	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have the honour to present, in both official languages, the 
second report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
on forestry practices in Canada entitled ``Canada: A Model 
Forest Nation in the Making''.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members 
of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for all their 
hard work in the last three months in putting together a very 
comprehensive report on the state of our forests.
<P>
	Some 17 recommendations are made on how we can continue 
to be a model forest nation and what we as a nation must do to 
have sustainable forest practices in order to continue to lead the 
world as a forestry nation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I also have the honour to present, in both official 
languages, the third report of the Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources on Bill C-25, an act to amend the Canada 
Petroleum Resources Act, without amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
my capacity as the Opposition critic for natural resources, I 
attended the standing committee meetings along with my 
colleagues from the ridings of Abitibi and 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies. After hearing from a number of 
witnesses, we quickly realized that the problem raised in 
committee was caused primarily by the bad publicity in Europe 
about forestry products from British Columbia.
<P>
	We were sensitive to the forestry sector's significant 
contribution to Canada and to Quebec, to the problem of 
marketing forestry products on the international scene, and to 
the impor-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5618"> 5618 </A></B>
<P>
tance of sustainable development as a touchstone to guide 
action by all parties in the forestry sector.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has tabled a dissenting opinion for the 
following reasons. First, because the federal government 
intends to adopt a centralist approach in order to mediate a 
problem concentrated in one province. Second, since the 
Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes the provinces' jurisdiction 
over the development, conservation and management of forestry 
resources, any action by the federal government would require a 
prior mandate from the provinces.
<P>
	Bloc Quebecois MPs nevertheless consider that it is their 
responsibility to promote the interests of Quebec and the 
provinces in certain areas, particularly federal-provincial 
agreements, the rights of aboriginal peoples, the national 
certification process, and Canada's international forest strategy.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICACCOUNTS">PUBLIC ACCOUNTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present the fifth report of the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts. The committee held two meetings to examine 
chapter 5 of the 1993 Annual Report of the Auditor General with 
regard to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, specifically 
the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program.
<P>
	The committee is concerned that all government programs 
include proper financial controls. It is also of the belief that full 
scrutiny and approval, by Parliament, of the programs for which 
it allocates funds, is a vital component of financial management 
and control. In the case of the Northern Cod Adjustment and 
Recovery Program, these needs were not met fully.
<P>
	Now that the program has ended, the committee strongly 
believes that some valuable lessons have been learned from it. 
These lessons have considerable relevance for the development 
and implementation of future programs, and ultimately for the 
way in which Parliament conducts its affairs.
<P>
	It is out of concern that the kinds of problems experienced by 
NCARP be either averted or diminished in the future that the 
committee makes its report and recommendations. Pursuant to 
Standing Order 109, the committee asks that the government 
table a comprehensive response to this report.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present, in both official languages, the first 
report of the Standing Committee on Health entitled ``Towards 
Zero Consumption, Generic Packaging of Tobacco Products''.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109 the committee requests that 
the government table a comprehensive response within 150 
days.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to inform the House that the Bloc Quebecois, the Official 
Opposition, has tabled a dissenting minority report that the 
Standing Committee on Health has agreed to attach to the 
majority report tabled by my colleague from Burin-St. 
George's.
<P>
	It is important to recall that the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois are in favour of implementing true measures 
designed to protect public health and improve the health of 
Quebecers and Canadians. We feel that the Standing Committee 
on Health, despite its best efforts, does not have the tools 
required to argue conclusively for plain packaging of tobacco 
products.
<P>
	While the federal health department's own study is ongoing 
and will not be completed before the end of the year, introducing 
plain tobacco packaging is not justified by any testimony that 
was given before the Standing Committee on Health. What is 
more, serious concerns were raised about violations of Canada's 
international trade obligations under the free trade agreement 
and NAFTA, about substantial losses of direct and indirect jobs 
and finally about counterfeiting, smuggling and marketing.
<P>
	The report presented by the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
sets out our concerns over plain packaging of tobacco products 
and the issues involved in a true public health policy. We are 
favourable to any measure that is effective, efficient, 
sustainable and consistent with the government's obligations 
with respect to the industry, workers and domestic and 
international trade. Neutral packaging simply does not meet 
these requirements, as far as we can tell.

disputes affecting the export of grain by arbitration and to 
amend the Public Service Staff Relations Act in consequence 
thereof.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
introduce this bill which affects grain transportation labour 
disputes. As all of us in this assembly know, these disputes have 
cost farmers in western Canada millions of dollars and it is time 
to do something about it.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to provide for the settlement of 
labour disputes affecting the export of grain. It will do this by 
providing a process for final offer selection arbitration to 
prevent grain transportation strikes on the coast.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial 
Administration Act and other acts in consequence thereof 
(exempted crown corporations).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in an effort to further the good 
management of all government departments, agencies and 
corporations, the bill I am proposing at this time seeks to 
improve accountability by moving certain crown corporations 
currently exempted from the provisions of the Financial 
Administration Act into the accountability framework 
suggested by the Auditor General.
<P>
	Auditors General have on several occasions in their annual 
reports made recommendations to introduce this change. Their 
concern focuses on the fact that these exempt corporations do 
not face as rigorous an examination as do all other government 
departments, agencies and corporations.
<P>
	In a country with the grave debt problems which we have, all 
government bodies must have the greatest dedication to 
accountability. We in this House must ensure that every dollar of 
taxpayers' money is used carefully and judiciously and in the 
manner of which all citizens of this country can approve.
<P>
	This bill will remove concerns in this area by ensuring the 
highest level of responsibility and embracing the principles of 
good management. It will enhance the credibility of government 
and the public image of these corporations.

the English version only the words ``thy sons'' to the words ``our

national anthem and to change the word ``hearts'' to the word 
``pride''.
<P>
	In introducing this bill I would like to pay tribute to a group of 
students at Westridge school in my constituency, in particular 
Tim Wood and Aly-Khan Virani and their teacher Emily 
Sutherland, who have worked very hard to document and help 
change the unequal representation of females in the media and 
elsewhere in Canadian society.
<P>
	I congratulate these young students and their teacher on their 
leadership in promoting equality for all Canadians including 
girls and women in Canadian society.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to ensure that equality is reflected in 
the wording of our national anthem as well.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-265, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code and the Young Offenders Act (capital punishment).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member 
for Skeena for co-sponsoring the bill.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend the Criminal Code to 
impose capital punishment for everyone found guilty of 
committing first degree murder. Canadians have made it clear 
that they would like to see some fundamental changes to our 
criminal justice system and many people are calling for the 
reinstatement of the death penalty.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not know whether capital punishment is a deterrent but I 
do know that you cannot rehabilitate a violent murderer who has 
no remorse.
<P>
	Canadians do not want criminals who are guilty of first degree 
murder back on their streets to kill again.
<P>
	There is also a growing perception that our justice system is 
not dealing adequately with youth crime and many Canadians 
have called for stiffer penalties for young offenders. Currently 
young offenders convicted of first degree murder are subject to a 
maximum sentence of five years. The proposed changes to the 
Young Offenders Act under Bill C-37 increase the maximum 
sentence to ten years but still do not include a minimum 
sentence.
<P>
	This bill would amend the Young Offenders Act to impose a 
minimum sentence of ten years on young offenders convicted of 
first degree murder.
<P>
	I believe that the introduction of this bill is one way this 
fundamental issue of justice, of punishment that fits the crime, 
will be debated in this House. Yesterday the Minister of Justice 
made it clear that this government does not want to let the 
Canadian people vote on capital punishment in a binding 
national referendum at the next election.
<P>
	I recommend that the government allow a free vote on this bill 
and encourage all members to actively seek the views of their 
constituents. This critical decision cannot be made merely along 
party policy lines or by consulting their own conscience without 
input from the people they purport to represent.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GOVERNMENT ORDERS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-32, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise 
Act and the Income Tax Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32 contains the legislative 
provisions to implement a number of excise and income tax 
changes announced over the past four months. Most of these 
proposals relate to the tobacco tax changes that were announced 
by the Prime Minister on February 8, 1994, as part of the 
national action plan on smuggling.
<P>
	Other proposals concern the air transportation tax and the 
goods and services tax and were announced in the federal budget 
of February 22, 1994.
<P>
	Hon. members are no doubt aware of the dramatic growth in 
tobacco smuggling over the past few years and the profound 
impact the trade in contraband tobacco products has had on 
Canadian society. As contraband tobacco products began to 
assume a rapidly increasingly share of the domestic tobacco 
market, the government suffered a sharp decline in tobacco tax 
revenues affecting its ability to deliver much needed programs.
<P>
	Legitimate wholesalers and retailers also suffered a 
substantial decline in their ongoing business interests as sales of 
legal tax and duty paid tobacco products underwent a 
precipitous decline.
<P>
	Equally troubling and of great concern to all Canadians was 
the climate of increased lawlessness as the organized criminal 
network dominated the contraband tobacco trade and funnelled 
its illegal profits into further criminal activity.
<P>
	Finally, the availability of cheap contraband tobacco products 
was undermining the government's health policy objectives of 
reducing tobacco consumption, particularly among young 
people.
<P>
	Without strong balanced action from the government the level 
of smuggling would have continued to increase and with the 
resulting costs accruing to government business and citizens 
alike. This concern was the basis for the national action plan on 
smuggling announced by the Prime Minister on February 8, 
1994.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	At the forefront of this plan, the government allocated 
significant additional resources to both the RCMP and Canada 
Customs to increase their enforcement efforts aimed at 
disrupting the contraband trade in tobacco and other products.
<P>
	To facilitate this increased enforcement and reduce the 
demand for contraband tobacco products, the government also 
undertook reductions in the rate of excise tax applicable to 
tobacco products.
<P>
	Some hon. members have questioned why the government 
chose to proceed further to reduce tobacco taxes rather than rely 
solely on increased enforcement measures. It should be 
remembered that significant new and enhanced enforcement 
measures were introduced in 1992 when the government of the 
day announced tighter controls on the distribution and sale of 
tax free tobacco products in Canada, significantly higher 
penalties for persons caught smuggling, new proceeds of crime 
provisions and the allocation of additional resources to RCMP 
and Canada Customs to strengthen their enforcement efforts.
<P>
	While these measures assisted the government in its fight 
against tobacco smuggling, they were not sufficient to bring the 
problem under control. The price differential between Canadian 
tax paid tobacco products and contraband tobacco products was 
such that the profits from smuggling far outweighed the 
associated risks. As a result, smuggling continued to grow in 
1992 and 1993, increasing its share of the Canadian tobacco 
market from about 15 per cent in 1991 to an astounding 40 per 
cent at the beginning of this year.
<P>
	Given this climate of persistent and increased smuggling, the 
government considered it essential to introduce a 
comprehensive national action plan including not only new 
enforcement initiatives but also a reduction in tobacco taxes. To 
weaken demand for contraband tobacco products in all parts of 
the country, the government undertook a national $5 reduction 
in the rates of excise tax on tobacco products.
<P>
	To allow greater tax reductions in areas where smuggling was 
more deeply rooted, the government also offered to match 
provincial tax reductions in excess of the $5 up to a maximum 
total federal tax reduction of $10.
<P>
	At the same time, the government was also concerned that 
tobacco corporations not derive any benefit from the reduction 
in tobacco taxes thus a new health promotion surtax was 
imposed on corporate profits from tobacco manufacturing and 
processing with the funds generated  by the surtax being used to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5625"> 5625 </A></B>
<P>
support the largest anti-smoking campaign in the history of 
Canada.
<P>
	Finally, to address the role played by export shipments in the 
contraband tobacco trade, the government reimposed an excise 
tax on exported tobacco products. The excise tax is designed to 
ensure that exports of tobacco products will be subject to closer 
control while also providing manufacturers with certain limited 
exemptions in respect of legitimate export shipments intended 
for bona fide consumption outside Canada.
<P>
	Taken together, these measures form a comprehensive plan to 
attack tobacco smuggling on all levels. Enforcement alone 
could never solve the problem. The profits to be made from 
smuggling and the savings to consumers purchasing contraband 
products would remain.
<P>
	By attacking the problem on all fronts, the government has 
taken strong action toward eliminating tobacco smuggling as a 
significant national problem. In addition to these changes, the 
legislation also contains a number of related measures to ensure 
the effectiveness of a national action plan on smuggling.
<P>
	Full inventory rebates will be provided to all wholesalers and 
retailers in respect of the national $5 tax reduction providing 
complete reimbursement for tax paid inventories of cigarettes, 
tobacco sticks and fine cut tobacco held as of midnight February 
8, 1994.
<P>
	The bill also authorizes the payment of partial inventory 
rebates where federal excise taxes are further reduced to match 
provincial tobacco tax reductions. Wholesalers and retailers can 
apply for the additional rebate in respect of their inventories of 
cigarettes in excess of a certain threshold amount held as of the 
effective date of matching a federal excise tax reduction.
<P>
	Some hon. members have asked why the government is not 
providing wholesalers and retailers with complete coverage for 
their inventories of tobacco products. I would point out that the 
inventory rebate program represents a significant expenditure 
on the part of the government and is just one component of the 
total fiscal cost that will be borne by the government in 
confronting the smuggling problem and restoring the legal tax 
paid market for tobacco products.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	The inventory rebate program is designed to provide 
wholesalers and retailers with a significant measure of financial 
compensation. It ensures that the tobacco tax reductions do not 
have too large an impact on any one person.
<P>
	Wholesalers and retailers have been major beneficiaries of 
the government's national action plan on smuggling. They will 
continue to benefit from the restoration of the legal tax paid 
market. Before any amounts can be paid under the rebate system 
however this legislation must receive royal assent. This is one of  
the reasons we are attaching such a high priority to Bill C-32.
<P>
	Finally, to assist federal enforcement agencies and provinces 
to control the potential for interprovincial diversion of tobacco 
products, Bill C-32 contains new liability and offence 
provisions. An additional federal excise tax will be imposed on a 
wholesaler or a retailer in respect of any sale of marked tobacco 
products to a person in another province.
<P>
	The legislation also makes it an offence subject to a fine for 
any person who sells or offers for sale tobacco products marked 
for consumption in one province to a consumer located in 
another province. The basic design of these provisions is to 
ensure that tobacco products marked for sale in a particular 
province are restricted to personal consumption in that province 
and are not diverted to another province.
<P>
	While the collection of the additional federal excise tax can 
be enforced immediately, the offences provision cannot come 
into force until such time as this bill receives royal assent.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance of the 
provisions contained in Bill C-32. The proposed excise and 
income tax changes are an integral part of the government's 
action plan to combat smuggling. Together with increased 
enforcement these measures will make a very significant 
contribution to halting the contraband tobacco trade.
<P>
	I urge all my colleagues to give speedy passage to this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-32 has now reached third reading. As my colleagues have 
already mentioned, we are not in any hurry to see this bill 
passed. At first glance, this bill seems to have been prepared in 
order to allow the federal government to fight tobacco 
smuggling and do what Quebec did a long time ago: reimburse 
merchants with inventories of over 5,000 cartons of cigarettes 
when the reduction of taxes was passed by the federal 
government and certain provincial governments.
<P>
	While we agree with this reimbursement and want merchants 
to receive it as promptly as possible, there is no way we agree 
that the government should take that opportunity to insert into 
this bill two other measures that could be harmful to consumers. 
These measures, which are usually in fine print so that people 
pay no attention to them, are nonetheless of vital importance. 
The second measure in this bill has to do with reducing the input 
tax credit on the meals of executives and workers, who could 
claim it on business meal expenses and business entertainment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5626"> 5626 </A></B>
<P>
expenses. The credit was 80 per cent, and will now be reduced to 
50 per cent.
<P>
	What we have been calling for ever since we arrived in the 
House is justice for all categories of employers and workers. 
You will understand that, before making any pronouncements on 
these measures, we would like to have received a report from the 
finance committee that might have explained to us the detailed 
repercussions of this one. Perhaps it is a good idea; perhaps we 
should make some amendments to it; perhaps we would be 
surprised at certain tax evasions that some large companies will 
still be able to pull off by switching these expenses to other 
budget items.
<P>
	Why does the present Liberal government always seem to be 
in a hurry to table bills without having the appropriate 
committee reports? Even at that, there are not many bills, while 
the number of problems to be solved is ever greater. Could there 
be a lack of synchronization in this government, which always 
seems to be governing by the seat of its pants?
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	So I cannot come down on the side of this measure today. I 
shall have to vote against it if the government refuses to give us 
a detailed report from the Finance Committee on its 
repercussions on all categories of employees and employers 
who will be affected by it.
<P>
	Lastly, as Official Opposition critic for transportation, I was 
astounded to see a bill supposedly to reimburse taxes on 
cigarettes end up by amending air transportation taxes. Now 
then, for this particular measure, let me assure you that I do have 
all the information necessary to know that I am against this 
measure and I shall vote accordingly.
<P>
	Firstly, I would like to point out to you that this is not the first 
air fare increase by the federal government. It started off, under 
the Conservatives, by increasing airport taxes. That $40 tax is 
added to all tickets, which means considerable percentage 
increases in some cases. Today, the federal government is at it 
again, with a tax that runs counter to all the requests and 
proposals made by the Association québécoise des transporteurs 
aériens.
<P>
	That association made extremely serious recommendations to 
the present government, the first of which was to eliminate the 
minimum charge of $10 and set a taxation percentage of between 
0 and 9 per cent. That method would have been much fairer and 
would have made it possible for higher taxes to be paid by 
people who often travel for pleasure, while people in the regions 
who travel because they have to would have paid less.
<P>
	I am not a prophet, but I am going to try to look into the future 
for you. The present government is so sure that the airlines will 
accept this fare hike that in a few months it will also try to make 
them lower their fares. The government thinks that the airlines 
will not react and will absorb the increase. The government is 
wrong. The airlines already have trouble surviving. Most of our 
air carriers are running deficits. So, as a result of all this, the  
price of tickets for travellers in outlying regions will go up once 
again.
<P>
	At first glance, the tax structure does not seem too worrisome. 
At present, the flat rate tax is $10, plus 7 per cent of the price of 
the ticket, to a maximum of $40. It is proposed that the flat rate 
tax be reduced to $6, and the same level of 7 per cent of the price 
of the ticket be maintained, up to a maximum of $50.
<P>
	Government machinery costs the public a lot of money; to 
come up with a proposal like that takes real brainstorming, as we 
say where I come from. That I am sure of, since I have really 
suffered through several months of acute meeting mania, and 
particularly since the Association québécoise des transporteurs 
aériens had made the government a proposal that was much 
better thought-out and fairer to air transportation consumers in 
the regions.
<P>
	Even the government's objectives in changing the tax 
structure have been laid out for us: firstly, to increase recovery 
of the costs of air facilities and services provided by Transport 
Canada and, secondly, to reduce the tax burden on short-haul 
domestic flights to smaller communities.
<P>
	I find the first objective laudable and even desirable. If we 
want to reduce the deficit, we must do what it takes. We are told 
that this measure will increase revenues by $21 million in the 
first year and $14 million in subsequent years. If the government 
had been open, it would have mentioned the first objective and 
the desired results. It would not have tried to have us believe that 
this new tax structure would reduce the burden on short-haul 
domestic flights to smaller communities, because this 
statement, in my opinion, is far from the truth.
<P>
	If this measure had been taken before deregulation, we could 
perhaps have believed in it; but not now.
<P>
	The cost of transportation is now borne by people in outlying 
regions. The price of tickets to these destinations has gone up 
considerably in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	For example: airfare between Montreal and Rimouski is 
currently $552 plus tax; Montreal-Saguenay, $466 plus tax; 
Montreal-Baie Comeau, $562 plus tax. There is not a great deal 
of traffic on these connections, and to turn a profit the airlines 
are forced to raise prices. On the other hand the 
Montreal-Toronto connection is heavily travelled, and the 
airfare is about $400.
<P>
	The new rate structure is based on price and does not take into 
account the volume of traffic or the distances involved. The 
government says there is a perfect relationship between price 
and distance, which is not true. Price is a factor of both distance 
and volume. The government's policy of encouraging low ticket 
prices in the hope of increasing the number of airline passengers 
to remote areas is wrong. It is actually encouraging the 
heavily--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5627"> 5627 </A></B>
<P>
travelled short corridors like Montreal-Toronto,  which are 
heavily used by business people, and chartered flights.
<P>
	Moreover, Mr. Speaker, the government did not think to 
establish a rate structure that would distinguish between the 
domestic network and the external network. A vast majority of 
people on domestic flights are travelling because they have to, 
while those travelling outside the country are often doing so for 
pleasure.
<P>
	Here is a striking example that I am personally very well 
acquainted with. As the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans I travel regularly on Air 
Canada's economy class between Quebec City and Ottawa. The 
distance is approximately 916 ground kilometres return. The 
ticket costs $547. Under the new rate structure the tax is $50 
plus GST, or approximately $88 in taxes, not counting airport 
taxes. I do not make these trips for fun but to carry out my duties 
as a member of this House.
<P>
	Let us now look at a charter flight to Paris during the summer. 
Quebec City-Paris: about 6,000 ground kilometres, the ticket 
costs $499, the tax under the new rate structure is $50 plus GST, 
or approximately $85 in taxes. And I do not have to take that 
flight, Mr. Speaker, it would be a pleasure trip.
<P>
	You can see from this example that an overseas flight of 
almost 6,000 kilometres costs me $2 less in taxes than a duty 
flight between Quebec City and Ottawa, and the government 
will tell us that the purpose of the new rate structure is to reduce 
the tax burden on short hops to the smallest municipalities. It is 
ludicrous! I would also like to point out that I cannot take a 
chartered flight between Quebec City and Ottawa, or between 
Ottawa and the regions. There are none.
<P>
	The rate grid that has been put before us shows that the price 
of all tickets costing more than $500 will automatically go up 
with the new rates. This means that a number of transportation 
services to remote areas will be negatively affected by the new 
policy.
<P>
	As I said at the start, Mr. Speaker, the government's number 
two objective in coming up with this new rate structure has not 
been achieved and is not transparent. On the contrary: the 
government is going to make things worse.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberal Party made great 
promises to the people. It was loud in its accusations that the 
Conservative Party showed an egregious lack of transparency. 
And yet today it is ready to make second-class citizens out of 
the residents of outlying regions. It would have been possible 
for the government to introduce a tax system capable of 
reflecting the special and often difficult situation posed by the 
problem of air transportation in remote regions. The 
government itself says that carriers have expressed concern 
about the excessive burden the air transportation tax imposes on 
short hops. So what does the government do to respond to these 
concerns? As we see: it wants to increase the regions' tax 
burden. There is Liberal logic  for you! It is unacceptable to try 
to get us to endorse the bill as it stands.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	We recognize the urgency of passing the provisions dealing 
with full rebates on cigarette inventories to reflect the national 
$5 reduction in the federal excise tax, partial rebates on 
inventories to reflect the corresponding reduced federal excise 
tax and adjustments in the fines for possessing or selling 
unstamped tobacco products.
<P>
	On the other hand, we need more information about the 
portion of the bill that deals with the Goods and Services Tax, 
and we are entirely opposed to the new air transportation rate 
structure. Could the bill not be divided in three, so that we could 
make intelligent decisions? If the Liberal government rejects 
my suggestion it cannot then turn around and accuse the Bloc 
Quebecois of delaying rebate cheques to merchants who have 
been entitled to them for a long time.
<P>
	The Quebec government found a much fairer way of handling 
this. It reimbursed all merchants, it did not try to make the small 
retailers shoulder the cost. We are ready to go ahead rapidly with 
passage of that portion of the bill, but we cannot give the 
government a blank cheque either on items for which we lack 
information or on a portion of the bill about which we have 
reservations we would like to make clear to our hon. colleagues 
from the other parties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on February 8 the government announced its national action 
campaign to combat smuggling. At that time Bill C-11 was 
introduced to address some of the enforcement measures and tax 
changes which were implemented, using a number of ways and 
means motions until Bill C-32 was introduced on May 27.
<P>
	Members of the House may remember second reading debate 
on Bill C-11 on February 22 of this year. Reformers used that 
opportunity to consider and respond to all aspects of the action 
plan to combat smuggling and to express our opposition to the 
reduction in the tobacco tax. While our knowledge and 
understanding of the government's tax changes have improved, 
our opinion and opposition to the tax reduction on cigarettes and 
tobacco products have not changed.
<P>
	As a little aside here, it has been an eye opener for me as a new 
parliamentarian to see the process the government uses in 
implementing these changes. Behind closed doors it 
implemented the ways and means motions and made these 
changes. Then it was brought to Parliament and we debated it, 
and it became official many months later. It was an interesting 
exercise. It is interesting to see how government operates. When 
it wants to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5628"> 5628 </A></B>
<P>
act it can act very quickly. If it wants to drag its feet it can drag 
them a long time.
<P>
	Our concerns about the government's tax reduction on 
cigarettes were confirmed when the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Health appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Finance on June 7 and advised that the government's goal was 
to reduce the demand for tobacco, the number one cause of 
preventable death in Canada. I will repeat. The government said 
that its aim or its goal was to reduce the demand for tobacco, the 
number one cause of preventable death in Canada.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary went on to say the government 
fully recognized that the action plan to combat smuggling and 
the tax measures associated with it would pose health risks. 
What a contradiction. On the one hand we have one of the 
highest risk factors in the nation being acknowledged. On the 
other hand the government introduces a bill which will be more 
of a threat to the health of Canadians than probably any other 
move it has made so far. How can the government continue to sit 
there and defend this move? I find that unconscionable.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Before we get into the reasons why we are opposed to the 
reduction in the tobacco tax, I would like to outline the measures 
announced by the government in Bill C-32 which Reformers 
support. There are some good things. If the government had 
listened to some of the amendments we proposed and some of 
the changes we would like to have made, we could have accepted 
this. However it was like a stone wall.
<P>
	Reformers support the imposition of the new excise tax on 
exported tobacco products. Senior officials with the department 
informed us that before the tax changes were implemented 
between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the total production of 
tobacco manufacturers in Canada was exported. Between 30 per 
cent and 40 per cent went outside the country, mainly to the 
United States. Tobacco companies agree that only 3 per cent of 
their exports were legally consumed and the rest was smuggled 
back into Canada. If that were the problem why did we not try to 
solve that problem before we took these measures?
<P>
	It seems these figures show the extent of the smuggling 
problem as it existed prior to February 8. It confirms that 
Canadian tobacco manufacturers were benefiting directly from 
the smuggling of tobacco back into Canada. Bill C-32 will 
permit tobacco manufacturers to export 3 per cent of their 
tobacco production tax exempt. Under the bill, 3 per cent will be 
allowed and that is the same level as it was before.
<P>
	The Canadian Cancer Society is concerned that a potential 
loophole exists in the legislation. Section 7(1) states: ``The 
export tax will not apply when the national tax of the country of 
destination is paid''. In this legislation the government included 
a loophole so that these companies would avoid paying the 
Canadian export tax.
<P>
	For example, in the United States the national tax is only 
$2.40 U.S. per carton of 200 cigarettes. That is the tax going into 
the United States. The Canadian Cancer Society says that by 
paying this low federal tax in the U.S. the deterrence of the 
export value is reduced. They do not have to pay the Canadian 
export tax if they pay the American tax, and the American tax is 
much lower than the Canadian tax. It is common sense. Will they 
pay the Canadian tax? Of course not.
<P>
	Reformers agree with the Canadian Cancer Society 
recommendation that this clause should be amended so that the 
export tax is reduced by the amount of foreign paid tax. The 
government fails to acknowledge the fact that needs to be 
amended or that loophole needs to be closed.
<P>
	If the foreign tax paid is greater than $8 per 200 cigarettes 
then there would be no export tax payable. As I just illustrated it 
is only $2.40 in the United States where most of the tobacco is 
exported. If this change were made to Bill C-32 in the United 
States the industry would pay U.S. federal tax plus a partial 
Canadian export tax, the total of which would equal $8 per 
carton of 200 cigarettes. If that were done the loophole would be 
closed.
<P>
	Reformers tried to propose an amendment to close the 
loophole but were told-again this is how government 
works-by the legislative counsel of the House that this 
amounted to a tax increase and that only the minister could move 
such an amendment. We were prevented from moving that 
amendment because it involved a tax increase. Reformers asked 
the minister to make such amendment as soon as possible. We 
ask that this be corrected and that it be done quickly.
<P>
	The Reform Party also supports the health promotion surtax 
which will increase by 40 per cent the taxes paid on profits made 
by tobacco manufacturers. We support this surtax. We feel the 
surtax on profits of the tobacco companies is an excellent 
approach based on the principle that the tobacco companies 
should assume more responsibility for the health problems 
caused by their products. The surtax would do that. It is a surtax 
on their profits.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the tobacco companies have had a windfall of 
profits as a result of the increased sales of tobacco products. It is 
estimated that tobacco manufacturers will have earned enough 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5629"> 5629 </A></B>
<P>
in increased profits in six months to more than pay the full 
three-year health promotion surtax obligation. That is 
interesting.
<P>
	Reformers are confused about the rationale used by the 
government in only having the health promotion surtax apply 
for three years. In six months they will have made enough 
increase in their profits to pay it for three years. That surtax 
comes off in three years. It is built right into the legislation. It 
will only apply for a three-year term, while the tobacco tax 
reduction will be in effect and still cause increased consumption 
and increased health costs long after the surtax is taken off.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the health promotion surtax should be 
in effect until the tobacco taxes return to their pre-February 8, 
1994 levels. That is how long the surtax should remain in effect. 
That is common sense.
<P>
	Reformers tried to propose an amendment to extend the health 
promotion surtax from three to six years. However again we 
have that problem. The legislative council advised us that the 
expansion of a tax could only be made or moved by the minister. 
The Reformers respectfully request the minister to do that as 
soon as possible, to make that change and to close the loopholes.
<P>
	Reformers also support the increase in fines for illegal 
possession or sale of unstamped tobacco products: increase the 
fines and solve the problem where it exists.
<P>
	Reformers believe that increased enforcement combined with 
the effective export tax should have been tried by the 
government before it reduced the taxes on cigarettes and 
tobacco products. If we knew there was a health risk here why 
did we not try some other avenues first?
<P>
	We could have put an export tax on those cigarettes. We could 
have tried enforcement to see how effective it would have been. 
We knew where the problem existed. We knew where the 
smuggling was taking place. Reformers believe that if we had 
tried these things we may not have put the health of Canadians at 
such great risk.
<P>
	The final part of Bill C-32 which the Reform Party supports is 
the immediate payment of tax rebates owing to retailers and 
distributors throughout Canada. Retailers and wholesalers are 
owed an estimated $150 million in rebates of excise tax paid on 
tobacco products held in inventory while the excise tax rates 
were reduced. That is legitimate. We support the government in 
that rebate.
<P>
	The minister cannot issue the rebate cheques until Bill C-32 
is passed. While we oppose the reduction in tobacco taxes 
retailers are likely to get upset if we delay the bill, and rightfully 
so, thereby delaying their rebate cheques even further. We do not 
want to hold them up.
<P>
	Reformers proposed at committee stage to have a separate bill 
introduced dealing with the rebates so that it could be passed 
quickly. This would allow retailers to get their money quickly. It 
would allow Parliament the time necessary to debate the full 
health costs. We would not have to rush the legislation through. 
Implications resulting from the tax reduction on cigarettes and 
tobacco products could be more thoroughly examined. The 
finance committee refused to even consider our request.
<P>
	Let us start to discuss the provisions of Bill C-32 which we 
oppose. We are opposed to the tax reduction on cigarettes and 
tobacco products because it will increase smoking particularly 
among young people, the most vulnerable sector of our society. 
As a result it will increase health costs. Increasing smoking will 
increase health costs. It is a logical conclusion. That is what will 
happen.
<P>
	Reformers find it amazing that the government caved into the 
criminal element of society so quickly. This sent the wrong 
signal to those who chose to break the law. The Liberal 
government said that if you defy the law it will change the law 
rather than enforce it. That is the signal it sent out to the criminal 
element and I cannot accept that.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Reformers find it hard to believe the government did not take 
a more reasonable approach and impose an effective export tax 
and increase enforcement in the areas where the majority of the 
smuggling was occurring. Even the commissioner of the RCMP 
confirmed in February that 70 per cent of the contraband 
tobacco was coming through the three Mohawk reserves 
between Cornwall and Montreal. If that is where the problem 
was, why not have the courage to enforce the laws of Canada?
<P>
	What will we do now when the criminal element redirects its 
smuggling to alcohol, drugs and guns? My understanding is that 
they are already looking at this. They are looking at where else 
they can turn to make some money.
<P>
	When the government caved in and lowered tobacco taxes, all 
MPs received representation from Canadian distillers that we 
should also lower the taxes on alcohol and booze. That is the 
logical thing. If we can reduce taxes in this area, let us reduce it 
over here because the smuggling will now occur in a different 
area. Are we going to treat that in the same way? Are we going to 
reduce the taxes on that? Is that going to be our approach?
<P>
	There are some segments of this society, law-abiding citizens 
who very much wish that their taxes were reduced as quickly as 
this government has chosen to reduce the taxes on tobacco. The 
problem will still exist, but it will only be transferred to other 
areas.
<P>
	The further reduction of the excise tax on cigarettes 
negotiated in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
and Prince Edward Island has now created an  interprovincial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5630"> 5630 </A></B>
<P>
smuggling problem. Now it is an east-west smuggling problem. 
The problem has simply been transferred to a different area.
<P>
	The government responded to this problem by implementing 
excise tax and offence provisions to prevent interprovincial 
smuggling. While Reformers support these provisions, we must 
point out that these provisions would not have been necessary if 
the government had tried to increase enforcement and a new 
export tax on tobacco products in the first place rather than 
reduce the tax on tobacco products. Now we have to deal with 
the interprovincial smuggling.
<P>
	Senior officials at finance say the four western provinces are 
satisfied that their anti-smuggling campaign is working and that 
their revenues are holding. They are not likely to reduce their 
tobacco taxes. Therefore the government's attempt to stop 
smuggling has created another smuggling problem as I have just 
explained.
<P>
	The action on smoking and health group appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Finance. It told members of Parliament 
how a 12-year old called a 1-800 mail order number advertised 
by the fax network which goes right into private homes. The 
12-year old ordered and received four cartons of cigarettes by 
mail, no questions asked. That was across provincial 
boundaries. That is how easy it is to contravene the regulations 
this government has put into effect. A 12-year old can simply 
order cigarettes by phone and get them by giving a credit card 
number.
<P>
	These volunteers asked the finance committee to make 
improvements in the enforcement provisions and increase the 
fines for this activity. The finance committee approved Bill 
C-32 without discussion, without further change.
<P>
	The main point I would like to make today is with regard to 
the government's disregard for the health of Canadians, 
particularly young people. When the government first 
introduced its national action campaign to combat smuggling in 
February, we asked the government to tell us what the increased 
health care costs would be.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	How many people will start smoking as a result of the tax 
reduction? Because cigarettes cost less, how many people will 
begin this habit that they will later find very difficult to break?
<P>
	How many Canadians will become addicted? If this is a 
temporary tax reduction, will we then have an addiction problem 
to deal with later? How many people will get lung cancer, 
emphysema, heart disease and strokes as a result of this plan? 
How many people will suffer or die as a direct result of the 
government's tax reduction? How much will this cost the 
Canadian taxpayer? This tax reduction will end up costing us a 
horrific amount of money.
<P>
	The government has continued to push the implementation of 
this bill despite not having the answers to these very important 
questions. If we do not have the answers to these questions, how 
can we continue with this bill?
<P>
	While the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
has made it clear that the tax reduction would pose increased 
health risks, these risks, the costs, the implications for 
government and the human suffering have not been quantified. 
Reformers find this appalling.
<P>
	The Canadian Cancer Society asked the Standing Committee 
on Finance to complete a thorough evaluation of the health care 
costs and implications of smoking in Canada, because such an 
evaluation had not been done since 1986. The finance committee 
listened politely, but it completely ignored the dozens of 
recommendations and passed the clause by clause reading of 
Bill C-32.
<P>
	Do you know how long it took the committee to pass all of 
those clauses in Bill C-32? It took 15 seconds. After all the 
representation we received and all the concerns that were 
expressed in 15 seconds the committee said: ``Here they are, we 
approve them all''. This clause by clause review of a 62 page bill 
was done in 15 seconds. That is democracy.
<P>
	Is it any wonder that Reformers are advocating and pushing 
for a triple-E senate where legislation like this could be 
reviewed seriously and thoughtfully and amended reasonably. 
Amendments could be proposed and debated intelligently. Some 
sober second thought could be given to some of the things the 
government is doing. A triple-E senate would prevent some of 
the serious mistakes we are making in pushing legislation 
through so quickly.
<P>
	I ask again: What will the increased health costs be? The 
Canadian Cancer Society provided the Standing Committee on 
Finance with some estimates prepared by Professor Robert 
Allen from the department of economics at Harvard University.
<P>
	Using Professor Allen's most conservative estimates, he 
predicted that the national cigarette consumption would rise by 
14 per cent among adults and it would rise by 35 per cent among 
young people. Those are the most conservative estimates.
<P>
	Thus the tax reductions implemented by the Liberals will 
increase the total number of tobacco users in Canada by 840,000 
and of these 175,000 will be teenagers. At this rate Professor 
Allen predicted health costs would rise in the long term by $1.33 
billion-one thousand, three hundred and thirty millions of 
dollars-a horrific increase in costs. Those are conservative 
estimates; it could be higher.
<P>
	This government will not be in power any more when the 
detrimental costs of the legislation it is implementing will have 
to be paid by the people of Canada. The government will not 
even be around to harvest its returns. As Professor Allen has said 
these are the most  conservative estimates. It could be much 
higher. It could result in 1.89 million new smokers and if it was 
that high 245,000 of those would be young people.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5631"> 5631 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	If that happens it would result in increased health spending of 
an additional $3 billion every year. Still the government fails to 
tell Canadians what the impact will be. It has hidden that. It 
refuses to conduct its own evaluation of health costs and 
implications. It does not even look at it. That is ignoring the 
health of Canadians.
<P>
	This is an example of a bill that has such serious health 
implications and risks it should have been debated jointly by the 
Standing Committee on Health and the Standing Committee on 
Finance. Both committees should have been involved. Only in 
this way could Canadians' concerns about the health risks be 
properly debated during committee stage.
<P>
	Had this been done I believe many of the amendments 
proposed by the Canadian Cancer Society and action on smoking 
and health would have been made by the government rather than 
Reformers just talking about them today in the House of 
Commons. They would have had a chance to make the 
amendments.
<P>
	For a government that claims to be listening to the people it 
does very little of it. Precious little listening is being done to the 
concerns of Canadians through the Canadian Cancer Society and 
action on smoking and health.
<P>
	Another one of our major concerns is that the government has 
not provided Canadians with a timetable showing when the 
tobacco taxes will start going up again. Already the cost of 
cigarettes in three border states is higher than in Canada. Across 
the line you have to pay more for cigarettes than in Canada 
because of the action this government has taken.
<P>
	The government acknowledges the dramatic effect high taxes 
have on tobacco consumption. It acknowledges that the health 
promotion surtax will end in three years, but it has not told 
Canadians what it plans to do at the end of three years. We 
proposed an amendment but as I said, it is out of order because 
the minister has to propose the amendment if it is a tax increase.
<P>
	Will the government make a commitment to raise prices to 
what they were prior to February 8, 1994 when the health 
promotion surtax is removed at the end of three years? Will the 
government make that commitment? Reformers proposed it but 
legislative counsel advised us that only the minister can do that. 
Reformers respectfully request the minister to introduce a new 
bill to bring such an amendment into effect.
<P>
	For the sake of the health of all Canadians, for the sake of all 
of those young people who will take up smoking as a direct 
result of the government's action, for those people, will the 
government tell Canadians today that this is not a permanent tax 
reduction? Will it come in with a plan to increase this again? 
Will this  government tell Canadians that their health is of more 
concern than the interests of a few smugglers and a few tobacco 
manufacturers? It is very important that the government send a 
signal to Canadians that yes, it is concerned.
<P>
	In closing, I have a list of recommendations for the 
government in regard to the whole subject of cigarettes and 
tobacco products.
<P>
	First, we need an immediate evaluation of the health care 
costs and implications, particularly for young people. This 
government should begin to find out what is going to happen as a 
result of its action.
<P>
	Second, we need to extend the health promotion surtax 
beyond three years. It should be in effect as long as tobacco 
taxes remain as low as they are. That is common sense. There 
should not be an end to one measure and a continuation of 
another.
<P>
	Third, we need to make tobacco companies fully accountable 
for the increased health care costs. Accountability and 
responsibility must be laid at the feet of those that are profiting 
from the sale of this product.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, we need a clear timetable to increase taxes on 
cigarettes and tobacco products. That should be done. It should 
begin now. There should be an amendment put in place to make 
sure that these tobacco taxes are again increased. Co-operate 
with the Americans. Consult and discuss with them how we can 
jointly combat this problem.
<P>
	Fifth, we need to close the loopholes in the export taxes. I 
have illustrated already, and I will not belabour the point, but let 
us close those loopholes. If the loophole is there, people will be 
going through it and profiting from it.
<P>
	Sixth, we need a better enforcement strategy to stop the 
east-west smuggling problem. Mail order advertising has not 
been stopped. I gave the example of a 12-year old who was able 
to order cartons of cigarettes through the mail.
<P>
	Seventh, the level of fines also needs to be increased to deter 
people.
<P>
	Eighth, we need to ban small packages of smokeless tobacco 
products. I addressed this previously. I will not refer to it again 
other than to say that it is on the record.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite acknowledged that the amendment 
I proposed should be implemented, but it was not done because 
of a technicality. Snuff and chewing tobacco designed for sale to 
young people should be discouraged.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5632"> 5632 </A></B>
<P>
	Ninth, health warnings on cigarette packages are being 
obscured by manufacturers and government should put an 
immediate end to this practice. An example of that was given in 
committee, but the government has not addressed the problem.
<P>
	Tenth, there is a need for a complete and total ban on tobacco 
advertising.
<P>
	From what my constituents are telling me and from what I 
have been hearing from Canadians, it is clear that the 
government has once again passed a law that clearly the 
majority of Canadians do not support. The government 
continues to push things through, to railroad them through the 
House, when they are unacceptable to the majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the health of Canadians should be the 
government's first priority. The government has sacrificed the 
health of Canadians by lowering taxes on cigarettes and 
Canadians will have the opportunity some day to decide if it was 
the wisest thing for the government to do. But it may be too late.
<P>
	Nothing much has changed since we began debating this. The 
government seems to have an agenda and no amount of common 
sense will cause it to ever amend the bill. I find that very 
regrettable. I hope government members are listening like they 
claim they are.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems 
odd to be discussing a bill proposing a reduction in tobacco 
taxes and to find in it a completely unrelated measure on air 
transportation. The latter is certainly the measure we oppose the 
most in this bill. I am going to the bill in perspective a bit and 
speak about what led up to it, and then about what we support 
and what we do not.
<P>
	First of all, we have to remember that there was a serious 
problem with cigarette smuggling, especially in Quebec but also 
very serious in Ontario and getting worse in the other provinces. 
It was a problem that was spreading from east to west. Of course 
smuggling was not bad yet in the western provinces, or at any 
rate had not assumed the same proportions.
<P>
	To alleviate the problem, given that the situation had dragged 
on for several years, it was almost impossible to come up with a 
solution that did not involve reducing taxes, that is, using 
price-related incentives to bring buyers back to the legal 
market.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The price of cigarettes had gone up considerably over the last 
six or seven years and tobacco users were getting increasingly 
annoyed by the increasing tax burden, especially in conjunction 
with higher taxes of all kinds. Their annoyance pushed them 
toward the black market, the underground economy, where they 
bought with a clear conscience. It became a very common 
practice.
<P>
	Various measures were tried to correct the situation, but 
nothing worked, for as we know there was very little real control 
in the field, even with all the resources of the RCMP, the Sûreté 
du Québec and everybody else. It would have been very difficult 
to solve the problem, because it was so wide-spread. It took so 
long to react that a contraband network had time to spring up, 
take over the market and provide excellent service, up to and 
including home deliveries.
<P>
	That is why at the start of this session we strongly urged the 
government to take action, to move rapidly after all the pressure 
and especially after the ``MATRAC'' movement in Quebec, 
where merchants themselves decided to defy the law. The 
problem had clearly got out of hand and at that point the 
government decided to act. So as far as reducing the tax as such 
is concerned, there is no major problem.
<P>
	There are plenty of people who would say we should be 
cautious. We all know the negative effects of tobacco use, and it 
is certainly not our intention to encourage consumption. 
However, bringing people back to the legal market is one of our 
concerns, as is encouraging people to respect the law and the 
system that our society has set up.
<P>
	Except that at the same time as these measures were 
introduced, the government said it would be bringing in a battle 
plan, a plan to encourage people not to consume tobacco 
products. There is supposed to be a vast education campaign on 
the harmful effects of tobacco use, focussing especially on 
young people.
<P>
	So one of the measures in the bill, a surtax on tobacco 
manufacturing profits, is going to make the tobacco 
manufacturers finance the plan themselves. But here a first 
reservation must be voiced. The anti-smoking campaign is 
supposed to last three years, while the surtax apparently will last 
longer than that or be permanent.
<P>
	So at the end of the three years, the revenue that is supposed to 
go toward discouraging tobacco use will be clearly reduced 
because the surtax will no longer be used for the campaign. It 
should have been stipulated that the money be used for this 
purpose. Besides, the surtax revenues are higher than the 
amount required for the plan announced by the Minister of 
Health, which involves spending $185 million over the next 
three years, while it is projected that the surtax revenues will be 
at least $210 million. So there is one thing to query, the fact that 
this money will not be allocated directly when that was what we 
were told would happen when the anti-smuggling campaign was 
announced.
<P>
	There are measures, there is the surtax, which is also designed 
to penalize to a certain extent people who really collaborated 
with the smugglers-to punish the producers, in fact, when we 
know that they can easily get it back by raising the price to the 
consumer. So this may simply raise prices again somewhat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5633"> 5633 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously there are people who think that lower prices will 
stimulate consumption, except that you have to bear in mind that 
the black-market price was extremely low, even ridiculously 
low. So the data that should be considered, the prices that should 
be compared, are the new price now with the black-market 
price, and not the price now with the old price, since in any event 
it may have been as little as one-third of the sales that were 
made on the legal market, mainly in Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, these are measures that do not strike us as so bad 
overall, but the government has done something really crazy 
with respect to inventories. All the little vendors who suffered 
the harmful effects of smuggling over the past three or four 
years, who already have had to shoulder significant losses in 
most cases, will only get a partial rebate on the stocks they had 
at the time the announcement was made or the tax reduced.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Since those merchants paid the full amount of the tax, the 
government should logically reimburse them in full.
<P>
	The government has said it will refund only $5 a carton, while 
in Quebec, for example, the reduced federal tax is equivalent to 
$10 a carton; so this is only a 50 per cent rebate.
<P>
	Why only $5? Why make those merchants, who have already 
absorbed costs over the past few years, pay for a portion of the 
anti-smuggling campaign? And these are small vendors, 
convenience store owners, small shopkeepers, who are affected. 
Some would be spared; the ones with at least 5,000 cartons in 
stock would get a full rebate. Where is the logic in setting a limit 
of 5,000 cartons?
<P>
	I will give you an example. In my riding there is a wholesaler 
with an inventory of 3,000 cartons. He paid $10 in tax on each of 
them, but he will get back only $5. This is an instant $15,000 
loss. People like hin do not make astronomical profits. And it is 
a serious matter for him, $15,000. It may ultimately mean laying 
someone off. It might be argued that the market is recovering 
and this will enable them to get their money back, but that 
certainly will not be true in the short term.
<P>
	When departmental officials appeared before the committee, 
they said that when the opposite occurred, when taxes were 
increased, retailers then had an advantage, because they had 
paid the old tax. So when they sold their products, they profited, 
if you will, from the difference. It is true, but never had tax 
increases been so drastic, and now the tax has been reduced.
<P>
	We are strongly opposed to this. And for the same reasons as 
those mentioned by the hon. member from the Reform Party who 
spoke just before me-only the minister can table an 
amendment involving a tax increase. We tried to make many 
people aware of this point. Representatives of small businesses 
tried to bring pressure to bear on the minister, but without 
success.
<P>
	This is very discouraging, and it is one reason why we cannot 
support this entire component, because this measure alone will 
be very harmful to small business.
<P>
	I would now like to address another feature of the bill. One 
might ask why a measure concerning air transportation was 
included in a bill to reduce cigarette taxes.
<P>
	When we take a closer look at this measure, the whys and 
wherefores become a little clearer. They wanted to hide it, so 
that no one would notice that it was going through. They knew 
there was good support for reducing cigarette taxes, so they put 
in a controversial measure involving air transportation that 
affects primarily the regions and the remote areas. A good way 
to avoid a more heated and more public debate on this particular 
point was to bury it in a bill whose primary objective has nothing 
to do with transportation.
<P>
	The repercussions of this measure will be very serious in most 
outlying regions, which are already hard hit by the deregulation 
of air transportation. In the past few years, the price of tickets 
has gone up considerably. It costs more to travel from some 
regions in Quebec to Montreal than it does to travel from 
Montreal to Paris. That situation runs counter to all logic. We 
should help regions develop and take charge of their future. 
While, on the one hand, we are trying to do that, on the other 
hand, measures that will affect those regions are being imposed. 
I live in one of those regions; I represent the riding of 
Témiscamingue, which has Rouyn-Noranda as its major airport. 
We are very much affected.
<P>
	What is really going to happen with the structure? The former 
tax structure had a flat rate tax, and then a graduated rate and a 
$40 maximum. That means that when we bought a $500 air 
ticket, we paid the maximum $40 tax.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Now we are told that the flat rate is going to be a little lower 
and is going to go up gradually, but that the maximum tax will 
now be $50 on all regional flights. And those are not necessarily 
long-haul flights. They are flights to the major urban centres. 
The amount of the tax will increase, because it is not often that a 
ticket costs less than $500, not often at all for a return ticket.
<P>
	When you get into prices a little over $600, you reach the new 
$60 maximum. All air tickets costing $450 or more will be 
negatively affected; and that is true for all regions. I am not 
talking about Quebec, or the Maritimes, or the west, as a region 
in itself; I am talking about regions within Quebec, what we call 
regions here. The same thing will be true in northern Ontario. 
The ridings adjoining mine will be affected in the same way, and 
I am sure that when some Liberal MPs hear from the people in 
their ridings, they will see that this is certainly not a popular 
measure. But, since it is going pretty well unnoticed, people will 
not know exactly who to blame. Did the provincial government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5634"> 5634 </A></B>
<P>
or the federal government  increase this tax? It will be hard to 
tell. People must be told.
<P>
	The overall consequence of this restructuring of the tax on air 
transportation will bring in extra revenues of $24 million this 
year and $44 million next year. Mind you, the tax on short-haul 
flights, from Ottawa to Toronto or from Montreal to Toronto, for 
example, will go down. The tax on air tickets costing less than 
$450 will go down.
<P>
	The regional flights will bear the brunt of that $24 million or 
$44 million and even more, since the tax on short-haul flights 
will generate less revenue. What we are talking about here is the 
80 per cent of flights that are short-haul flights which will 
benefit, and the 20 per cent of flights that are regional flights 
which will be penalized. It is the 20 per cent of flights to 
outlying regions that will have to bear the brunt of the $24 
million this year and $44 million next year. That is not 
acceptable, not at all.
<P>
	A one dollar increase in the price of an air ticket in a region 
where the price is already exorbitant is completely 
unacceptable. A $10 tax increase is even less acceptable; it 
contradicts the logic of all those promises of more air 
transportation tax relief for the regions, and it contradicts other 
policies to support regional development and help the regions 
take charge of their future.
<P>
	What we have to understand here is that many of those flights 
are used by people from federal or provincial government 
departments, travelling to the major urban centres and thus 
simply passing on higher expenses to the other level of 
government or within their own government, while penalizing 
consumers.
<P>
	It would have been possible to look at international flights, as 
was recommended to the Finance Committee by the 
Baie-Comeau chamber of commerce, for example-which, by 
the way, has worked closely with the chambers of commerce in 
several regions of Quebec, including those in Val-d'Or and 
Rouyn-Noranda in my region. Would it not be possible, without 
necessarily losing any revenue, to look at taxation on those 
flights?
<P>
	Through the transport committee and the finance committee, 
the government is being asked to look at why efforts at 
deregulation and competition are not bringing prices down. The 
frequency of flights has gone up in certain regions, but the cost 
of tickets has gone up, while it was anticipated that it would go 
down. Perhaps it would be appropriate to take a good hard look 
at the situation and see what could be done to support regional 
development.
<P>
	Because of the fact that small merchants who had stocks of 
cartons of cigarettes will not be reimbursed and because, in a 
rather underhanded way, a tax is being introduced that will 
penalize the regions, we cannot support this bill, even though we 
find some aspects, such as reducing taxes to fight cigarette 
smuggling, quite positive.
<P>
	Overall, the fact that some measures, especially the measure 
concerning transportation, are quite negative-although the 
measure concerning small businesses is very negative as well-, 
means that we shall vote against this bill.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I hope however that some of our colleagues from the Liberal 
Party-particularly those from northern Ontario-will wake up 
and pressure their government into eventually restructuring air 
transportation, allowing for regional development and giving 
regional authorities a better opportunity to plan their economic 
development than the present contradictory initiatives taken by 
different departments. These initiatives have left the regions 
extremely skeptical as to the federal government's capacity to 
manage economic development in more remote areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in favour of Bill C-32. Some of my colleagues today will 
be expressing many of the negative aspects surrounding this bill 
and a lot will be speaking against it.
<P>
	This bill covers three areas, changes for meal allowance and 
also the air transportation tax and the tobacco tax. This bill is the 
last stage in the government action plan to combat smuggling. 
The first stage was Bill C-11 which was mainly concerned with 
enforcement. This bill brings into effect the proposed tax 
changes.
<P>
	With respect to the changes to the meal allowance, the eligible 
business meals and entertainment expenses are reduced from 80 
per cent to 50 per cent in accordance with the provisions 
outlined in the budget. We supported these changes when the 
budget came out on the basis that they amounted to business 
subsidy.
<P>
	While I recognize that these expenses are legitimate business 
expenses for some, the reality of the tax break was that it was 
being used to escape tax and subsidize the recreation activity of 
business. In addition, some tax relief is still available, albeit at a 
reduced rate. My colleagues and I are in favour of this aspect of 
this bill.
<P>
	With respect to the air transportation tax, this bill reduces the 
tax burden on short haul, domestic and transporter flights by 
decreasing the flat charge per ticket and increasing the 
maximum fee. The flat fee is decreased to $6 and the maximum 
is increased to $50. The changes will bring additional revenue to 
the government of $24 million projected in 1994 and $41 
million in 1995.
<P>
	I support this change as it makes the air transportation tax 
move toward a full cost recovery basis. I believe the majority of 
my caucus colleagues also favour that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5635"> 5635 </A></B>
<P>
	The most important issue is the tobacco tax. Although the 
majority of our caucus is opposed to the reduction of the excise 
tax on tobacco products, I disagree with it. Our caucus, though, 
has some legitimate reasons for being opposed to the reduction. 
It feels it will encourage more people to smoke, particularly 
young people. Long term health costs for Canadians have not 
been calculated. Aggressive enforcement should have been tried 
first and the new export taxes on tobacco should have been tried 
first.
<P>
	I agree with all of those but nevertheless the government 
failed to approach the problem with that attitude and now we are 
left with this particular bill in its present form.
<P>
	My riding is basically split 50:50 on this issue. Fifty per cent 
are against this bill only because of the impact upon the increase 
in health costs. Therefore I am looking at this issue not only as a 
representative of Calgary Centre. I am looking at it as a 
representative of all of Canada, from the country's point of 
view.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	In order to solve a problem we must first of all identify what 
that problem is, decide on what courses of action are available 
that will help solve that problem, pick the one that will solve the 
problem the best and the fastest, implement the decision and 
examine the results. If it is working, stick with it and if it is not 
go back to some of the other options.
<P>
	The main problem we are addressing today is one of organized 
crime, the underground economy and in particular the problem 
of cigarette smuggling into Canada. I sympathize with the Prime 
Minister and the problem that he had with this issue in trying to 
come up with a solution. It is not an easy one.
<P>
	With his four point plan he looked at all the factors involved 
and made a tough decision. It is one of the few he has made. 
Although we are critical of him it is meant to be constructive and 
in that area where I feel we can support him I would like to do 
that.
<P>
	This issue certainly has cost the government a lot of money 
and has driven a lot of legal people into the illegal underground 
economy. Because this addresses that and solves that problem I 
feel it certainly deserves my support and so I will be talking 
about that.
<P>
	The truth of the matter is some people want to smoke. Some 
people want to drink alcoholic beverages. All people need to eat. 
Our health care costs are directly linked to our diet and our 
exercise or lack thereof and not just to cigarettes and booze. To 
specifically target one item, although undoubtedly a 
killer-there is no question that one in three to one in four 
people dies of cancer because of cigarette smoking-do these 
same people who advocate raising a tax on cigarettes advocate 
raising a tax on all food that is bad for us? No, they do not. They 
allow us to have a choice as it should be with cigarettes and 
booze.
<P>
	No matter how high we drive sin taxes, no matter how much 
we try to discourage the public from doing something through 
legislation, through the Income Tax Act, if people want to do it 
and if it is still legal they will do it.
<P>
	I find it somewhat hypocritical that we say it is legal to smoke 
and it is legal to drink after a certain age, but then we try to price 
it out of the market because it is bad for our health. Either this 
government wants to allow people to do freely what they like to 
do or it does not, instead of trying to mix the two together.
<P>
	With respect to the health issue, there have been many 
concerns expressed by health organizations and individual 
Canadians who believe that by reducing the cost of cigarettes 
more people, especially young people, children, will begin to 
smoke. In my opinion by raising the legal age to smoke, 
eliminating kiddie packs, limiting vending machines to bars, the 
government has taken a step in the right direction toward the 
reduction of smoking in young people.
<P>
	This fact combined with the increased fines for retailers who 
sell to minors will help mitigate the problem. I also have a 
further suggestion in this area and it was well received in the 
finance committee by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Health. Patrol the high schools and when the police 
catch the under age people smoking, they could issue them a 
summons that also gets mailed to the home. The parents then 
would be made aware of the fact that their children are smoking. 
The summons would say basically the next time we catch your 
child you will also get a summons but that one will cost you $50 
and each and every time we catch your child smoking it will cost 
you $50. This perhaps is a way of curtailing young people from 
smoking.
<P>
	That is a separate issue from what this bill is trying to resolve. 
It is trying to resolve the issue of smuggling, not the issue of 
encouraging young people to smoke.
<P>
	The federal government is currently losing a guestimate of 
$60 billion to $80 billion per year to the underground economy. 
This loss of revenue has a direct negative effect on the ability of 
small, law-abiding businesses to compete in the private sector. 
In the end it is the Canadian taxpayers who pay for the loss of 
revenue and the increased costs associated with the lucrative 
practice of smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I ask non-smoking Canadians who do not feel that the 
problem of smuggling affects them to think again. The number 
of people who have been charged by RCMP Customs and Excise 
has increased from 414 in 1990 to 3,389 to date. The number of 
seizures within this same time frame has increased from 303 in 
1990 to 5,044 to date. Increased enforcement and prosecution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5636"> 5636 </A></B>
<P>
combined with the loss of government revenues costs the 
government over a billion dollars a year.
<P>
	In the end it is every Canadian taxpayer, not just those who 
drink and smoke, who ends up paying these costs in the form of 
higher taxes.
<P>
	The only way to truly eliminate the problem is to reduce the 
profitability to smugglers, take the profit out of smuggling. In 
order to do that we have to reduce the cost and the taxes. By 
reducing the cost differential between smuggled and retailed 
cigarettes, ordinary cigarette smokers will have less incentive to 
seek out and purchase illegal cigarettes and, on a larger scale, 
organized crime will be no longer able to profit from it.
<P>
	Only when the profit is removed will smuggling be reduced. 
Law enforcement alone without the removal of profit margin 
will not be enough to solve this major problem.
<P>
	We must not lose sight of the fact that this bill is primarily 
targeted at the multi-billion dollar smuggling market. Federal 
and provincial governments tax cigarettes and liquor not just to 
reduce consumption but to generate extra revenue for other 
programs. These so-called sin taxes combined with health 
awareness campaigns will not eliminate in its entirety the use 
and abuse of these substances.
<P>
	If we go back to before this act, what were the facts? The facts 
were that people were smoking and people were drinking, 
except that the purchase of cigarettes went into an underground 
economy. This is an attempt to bring it to the surface. It is up to 
all Canadians to deal with this problem at home, in schools and 
in their communities. If further measures are needed to be taken 
by the government, then we should vigorously examine all of 
our options. The bill addresses organized crime, the tobacco 
companies and respect for the law.
<P>
	The critics of the bill, including some of my caucus members, 
have focused on health care costs, more young people smoking 
and the loss of revenue at a time when government can least 
afford it.
<P>
	There are other means available to deter smokers without 
relying on taxation only. For instance, we could have variable 
insurance premiums for smokers and non-smokers. The same 
with alcohol and non-alcohol drinkers, like we do with 
automobiles. We do it somewhat with physicals but we could 
even make it more onerous, more specific and more related to 
being able to identify potential costs to health care by a person 
who has certain habits, although they are legal, which may cost 
the taxpayers more money. Therefore their premiums should be 
higher.
<P>
	Furthermore, the advertising and education programs about 
the effects of smoking should be recognized as an influencing 
factor, although not an end in itself. Despite the many lectures of 
parents to their children, despite the many TV commercials, 
despite the many educational programs that are out there for 
children and people of all ages, people still smoke.
<P>
	I personally would cancel the TV commercials because they 
are ineffective. The young people of this society just laugh at 
them. They think it is a joke. The government should 
concentrate on a direct communications piece with each 
taxpayer to create awareness of the dangers of smoking. That 
money spent that way would be much more effective. It is a 
direct message to families and to individuals, done in a 
professional manner and intended to make people aware of the 
problems of drinking and smoking. That message would be 
received by everybody, not just on a hit or miss affair by 
television where only the TV companies benefit with the extra 
revenue for their commercials.
<P>
	There are a few other things I would like to address on this 
bill. There is an organization called action on smoking and 
health. Where my colleagues have talked about the impact and 
effects of this bill on more people smoking and the cost to health 
care, I suggest they are co-mingling. To argue that lower priced 
cigarettes will increase smoking, I do not buy that. As my 
colleague said, 97 per cent of the cigarettes that were 
manufactured and exported to the United States were coming 
back into this country in the underground economy. Whatever 
percentage that was of the manufactured cigarettes, that is 
exactly the percentage of how much smoking will increase by 
any survey that is released today or tomorrow or next year 
because it is now out in the public, it is out on the surface and it 
is out in the open.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	To use that statistic and say that cigarette smoking is 
increasing because of the lower price is not entirely accurate. I 
realize that people are smoking. I realize the lower the price is of 
something then people can afford it and they will buy it but we 
have to solve the underground economy problem. We have to 
lower taxes. We have to encourage the government to recognize 
the benefits of lower taxes.
<P>
	As my colleague asked, if we lower taxes on cigarettes should 
we lower it on alcohol? The answer is yes. Should we lower it on 
jewellery and clothing imported from the United States? The 
answer is yes. Should we lower overall taxes? Should we lower 
the GST? The answer is yes. How do we pay for it all? We 
eliminate the dumb wasteful spending of this government that 
has increased spending by $3 billion this year.
<P>
	It will not look at the programs of each of the ministries and 
reduce spending. It will not go through it line by line. It gave a 
billion dollars to companies that do not want it. It gives grants 
and subsidies to people who abuse it, misuse it, and come out 
with ridiculous reports. That is where we could save a lot. With 
lower taxes and more money in the hands of ordinary Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5637"> 5637 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayers, it would then increase disposable income and the 
economy would start to generate and work.
<P>
	It is economy No. 1. I took it in university in 1968. I have not 
forgotten it. It seems like the members in this House and the 
ministers especially will not even go back to economy No. 1 and 
implement some of the basics of that.
<P>
	I got off on a slight tangent, let me get back on track.
<P>
	This is also to show that the two issues are separate. If you 
want to cure problems in health care then solve the health care 
problems. If you want to cure the smuggling problem then we 
have to support bills and issues and ways and means to do that. I 
believe this does.
<P>
	However, my colleagues are concerned about the health 
aspect of smoking and interprovincial smuggling because now 
that has created a problem. Some westerners are writing letters 
and saying they feel like second class citizens because of what 
Ontario and the eastern provinces have done by accepting the 
lower tax. That is a provincial decision. If the western premiers 
do not wish to do that that is their decision.
<P>
	There is a group called action on smoking and health which 
has made a representation to the finance minister. I would like to 
touch on some of this and get it into the record because I believe 
it is important.
<P>
	Action on smoking and health is western Canada's leading 
tobacco control agency. It is very concerned with the federal tax 
differentials contained within Bill C-32. It fully supports the 
recommendations of western finance ministers to restore a 
uniform federal tax regime on tobacco products. It believes that 
the proposed fines for interprovincial smuggling are inadequate 
and need to be adjusted. I concur.
<P>
	Based on its calculations, a proposed tax penalty of three 
times the excise tax avoided barely accounts for the potential 
profit margin earned by smugglers who ship Quebec and Ontario 
cigarettes to western Canada.
<P>
	While there is a $1,000 additional penalty in Bill C-32 for 
smuggling violations, a Quebec smuggler would only have to 
ship two cases of cigarettes to Alberta to cover this loss based on 
current profit margin. It recommends a more meaningful 
penalty similar to the new Alberta legislation, and once again 
that great province is a leader, which provides for fines up to 
$10,000 and a six month prison sentence for first time 
violations.
<P>
	That is called punishment. That is what our law should be 
designed to do in the criminal justice system, not rehabilitation 
all the time. Maybe the two combined, but punishment first.
<P>
	In its presentation to the finance committee it also pointed out 
that the current federal duty strip obstructs the health warning 
on cigarette packages. If the Minister of Health does not get her 
plain packaging on cigarettes then perhaps the recommendation 
that duty strips be positioned horizontally along the package so 
as not to interfere with the health warning might be a useful 
recommendation.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I found a quotation in a book written by some intelligent 
economists which reads: ``In summation, what we need is an 
immediate tax cut for low and middle income groups in order to 
increase demand and purchasing power''. That is the lesson of 
economics that I wish to pass along to this government, the 
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, the 
Minister of Finance, the Minister of Industry and the Minister of 
National Revenue and taxation. What this country needs is an 
immediate tax cut for low and middle income groups in order to 
increase demand and purchasing power. What we have in this 
country is a spending problem, not a revenue problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we certainly appreciated the hon. member's lesson in economics 
as he calls it.
<P>
	Coming from one of the ridings along the 49th parallel 
between Canada and our good friends to the south, I can give a 
bit of a history lesson on the smuggling of tobacco products, 
what it meant to my constituency and the businesses and more so 
the criminal element that it initiated that crept in.
<P>
	I appreciated the hon. member's comments. I believe that the 
majority if not all members in this House would indeed support 
an action that would reduce or eliminate smoking by our youth 
and indeed by every citizen in this country. I am sure that would 
be the case.
<P>
	Whether it is through reduced taxation to be competitive or 
through smuggling those same tobacco and cigarette products 
which are and have been available over the past number of years, 
this whole scenario has created an opportunity for the criminal 
element to make quick profits at the expense of not only 
Canadian citizens but the revenue of government through 
taxation and certainly certainly our youth.
<P>
	It is not only the criminal element. Because of the wide 
variation and differential between prices due to taxation, we 
also saw tobacco products being brought across the border that 
were very legal.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree that the actions taken by the 
government in this bill to eliminate tobacco smuggling across 
our borders was not only the correct option but the option that 
has in fact worked as we have seen over the last two or three 
months? Since that action was taken the criminal element has 
been reduced at our border crossings and, as he has indicated, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5638"> 5638 </A></B>
<P>
many arrests have been made. This action taken by the 
government has indeed worked. I would like to hear his 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to approach it in two 
ways. When the Prime Minister addressed this problem early on 
in the House when we first arrived here, veterans and rookies 
alike, this started to develop into a bigger and bigger problem.
<P>
	Our frustration was that the smuggling was occurring in two 
major areas. We knew where they were. The problem was that 
they were on reserve lands. The RCMP was reluctant to go on 
those lands and make arrests. That led us to believe that this 
government was shortsighted and lacked the political will to 
enforce the laws of this country. Two sets of laws started to 
appear, one for native Indians and their borders and one for the 
rest of Canada. Therefore, we encouraged the government to 
enforce the law.
<P>
	I believe the Prime Minister heard that message and in 
consultation with the head of the RCMP and the Solicitor 
General he tried to solve the problem.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister heard that message and in consultation 
with the head of the RCMP and the Solicitor General he tried to 
solve the problem. His final conclusion was a four-point plan to 
resolve the issue, to build respect for the law and to prevent the 
smuggling which is costing taxpayers a lot of money, smokers 
and non-smokers alike.
<P>
	I supported his four-point plan. I thought it was well thought 
out. It was a tough decision. He made a political decision. He 
made a reasoned decision in the best interests of solving the 
problem. For that I commend him, for that I respect him and I 
think he did the right thing. In answer to that, I do support what 
he did.
<P>
	As some of my colleagues have mentioned, other steps could 
have been tried first. Having said that about the Prime Minister, 
I feel it has worked.
<P>
	Now that I took so long to answer that part of the question, I 
forget the second part. I cannot answer it, I apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make a few comments about the process taking place 
here today.
<P>
	It makes it a bit awkward when we have an omnibus bill, one 
that contains something about airport taxes, tobacco taxes and 
other measures. It is difficult to support such a bill when it 
contains something to which you are completely opposed. You 
may support two of the three measures but have to vote against 
the bill because of something in it that is unacceptable. I have an 
objection to that kind of thing happening. The issues should be 
separated out so we can discuss them and vote on them 
separately.
<P>
	There is a second thing I would like to comment on. My 
colleague may wish to respond even though he does not have to. 
We have the freedom to speak up in the House. We may not agree 
with even our colleagues within the same party but the 
government should encourage free discussion and debate.
<P>
	Like my colleague said, we should identify the problem. We 
should determine our options. We should decide what would be a 
reasonable course of action to take and it should be debated. The 
legislation that flows from the discussion should reflect the 
feelings of every member in the House.
<P>
	Very seldom do I hear people sitting on the backbenches of the 
government expressing an opinion that is contrary to the 
cabinet. That is a shame. It is unacceptable. In a free and 
democratic society, we should be allowed to express dissent. 
That is what should be happening. Debate should be taking 
place.
<P>
	I wonder why more people do not speak up and express their 
concerns in regard to this. Surely members of the Reform Party 
are not the only ones who are concerned about health. There 
must be Liberals who also have those kinds of concerns.
<P>
	My colleague has brought up some legitimate health concerns 
other than tobacco. They could be debated. It might be a related 
issue but we should be talking about it.
<P>
	We need to have that kind of open discussion here. We have 
begun the process. We have allowed for it. It has happened on 
occasion but I would like to see more of it. If my hon. colleague 
would like to comment on any of that, I would welcome him to 
do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel like I have been put on the spot. 
Our party believes we should be representing our constituencies 
and by so doing, because we come from so many varied ridings, 
both urban and rural, both sides of the mountains, both ends of 
the country, Ontario to B.C., we will have differing opinions. We 
will have different views on the same issue.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	In trying to determine how to vote on a bill, on an issue, I 
think it is important first of all to bounce ideas, the thrust of the 
bill, against your party's principles and platform. The Liberals 
do it with their red book. We had a blue book which we call now 
the blue sheet. If it is consistent with that then there are no 
doubts on which way to go.
<P>
	Then other issues become involved and problems start to 
surface, it becomes bigger, it becomes a multibillion dollar 
problem if you include alcohol, hand guns and everything else 
that gets smuggled into the country. Smuggling is a major 
problem. I do not believe it is in any red book or blue book.
<P>
	I believe it is the responsibility of MPs to look at the issue 
from a Canadian perspective and make a decision in the best 
interests of the country. Bounce the ideas off constituents so 
they can have input. There are a lot of  mechanisms and ways 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5639"> 5639 </A></B>
<P>
and means by which they can communicate with their MP. We 
then have a balanced approach.
<P>
	I am not so sure my colleague intended we should debate an 
issue first and then draft the legislation or that legislation should 
be drafted first and then we react to it. I prefer the latter. 
However if there are amendments such as those we have tried to 
make to this bill, they should be listened to instead of throwing 
them out as this current government likes to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to discuss this bill at third reading. I want to 
comment on a couple of remarks made by my colleagues across 
the way regarding this issue.
<P>
	Comments have been made that this problem somehow 
started in October, some time shortly after we came to 
government. Our response to the problem was bringing in this 
legislation but we did not take into consideration the health 
question.
<P>
	I do not have to remind hon. members where I come from. In 
my riding I represent a large number of tobacco producers but 
also the largest native reserve in the country. I used the term 
reserve in a somewhat limited way because I understand its 
negative connotations.
<P>
	I first came to the House of Commons some six years ago, 
shortly after this problem started. In fact I have discussed it for a 
number of years. The smoke huts on the Six Nations are a long 
way from Akwesasne, a long way from where a lot of the 
so-called smuggling takes place. This started some four or five 
years ago. People started to use the tax system to their benefit.
<P>
	This material did not just appear at one single point. It has 
been coming across the Canadian border for a number of years at 
a number of points in the east and in the west. It was always a 
major problem and it has significantly increased over the last 
two to three years.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you come from an area where a lot of this 
problem is taking place, therefore you can attest to the fact that 
this has been going on in a serious manner for at least two to 
three years.
<P>
	When the government brought in this legislation it wanted to 
also look at what many call the negative health effects of 
smoking. It looked at this issue in a very serious way. It saw that 
on every street corner in Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver and all 
across the country young Canadians had access to cheap 
cigarettes. That access was right on the corner at the school 
yard. Quite frankly over the last couple of years the smuggling 
networks got so sophisticated that it became a very good 
distribution system that was cheap and easy. Young Canadians 
had access to cigarettes and tobacco like they never had in the 
past.
<P>
	This legislation tried to cut off that access to young 
Canadians. As a government, along with the provincial 
governments, we tried to make sure that the penalties imposed 
on the people who were selling tobacco to minors were greatly 
increased so that the risk of them being caught was also greatly 
increased.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	By doing that we addressed the concerns of Canadians toward 
health and the easy access to cigarettes young Canadians were 
getting. By bringing in this legislation we have proven we have 
totally shut down the distribution system. We have made a 
system whereby they do not have access to cigarettes.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member who spoke previously that this 
has become a greater problem than just a tobacco problem, that 
it has moved into other areas. You know, coming from the area, 
Mr. Speaker, it has moved to alcohol, to guns.
<P>
	If the hon. member would admit that a lot of what we have 
done in this legislation, a lot of what we have committed to do in 
other areas of enforcement, will take a big chunk out of the 
underground economy also.
<P>
	What we have tried to do in this legislation is twofold. We 
have looked at the health of young Canadians. We have made 
sure that access to tobacco for young Canadians is cut off. We 
have addressed that health question. We have also made sure 
that the smuggling situation which has ramifications far beyond 
Canadians getting cheap cigarettes but has a lot to do with how 
native Canadians view themselves.
<P>
	As I have said in the House before, I have had a lot more 
complaints from native Canadians, people of the Six Nations in 
my riding, about the smuggling situation than I did from 
non-natives. They recognized that the values being instilled by 
the people running the smoke shops and running the smuggling 
rings were not the values that their fathers and their forefathers 
had tried to instil in them.
<P>
	I want to say that I have had a large number of people within 
the native community come to me and thank me for this bill and 
thank the government for bringing in this legislation.
<P>
	I wanted to address the issue that somehow we had all of a 
sudden just reacted to the fact that we were not going to enforce 
legislation on native reserves. I do not think that is true. To 
suggest that smuggling was only taking place on Akwesasne is 
to ignore the fact that cigarettes were coming through all kinds 
of points across the country, including points in western Canada.
<P>
	We have a very large open border. Unfortunately it is very 
easy to drive truckloads of this stuff across at any given point. 
We just do not have the sophistication or the numbers of people 
to check every single truckload of stuff that comes across the 
border. These smuggled cigarettes were coming in from every-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5640"> 5640 </A></B>
<P>
where. To suggest  that it was just a native problem is 
misleading. It is suggesting something that is not the fact.
<P>
	I will leave it at that. Mr. Speaker, I know that you have 
worked very hard on this issue and I want to thank you for your 
input. It was people who were dealing with it on the front lines, 
like yourself, that helped shape this legislation and helped 
create the solution to the problem that we solved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks that were made by my hon. 
colleague across the floor.
<P>
	I want to clarify something. We do not suggest that this has all 
just begun. This problem has been building up. It would be 
foolish to say it was only here since October 25. That is not what 
we are saying. We are not saying that this plan will not combat 
smuggling. Of course if you reduce the price and there is no 
profit in it, there will not be any more smuggling. That is 
common sense.
<P>
	The hon. member made a statement that I would like him to 
comment on. He said that the access to young Canadians is cut 
off. I doubt whether that is so. I still see young people with 
cigarettes in their mouths. I wonder how this plan is going to 
effectively control the use of tobacco by young people. I do not 
see anything here that is going to in any way guarantee that they 
will not have free access to tobacco products and will not be 
using them. If that access were limited we would not see many of 
the young people at the present time smoking. I would like to 
know what the hon. member sees as being positive in that 
regard. I still do not see the problem of health being directly 
addressed.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	What about the alcohol and guns that are now being 
smuggled? What will the government do to address that 
problem? The smuggling element is still there. They have 
simply turned to another product to smuggle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
questions. I will deal with the health question and with the 
second question as well. I do not think, as is being espoused by 
the Reform Party, that we have to militarize the Canada-U.S. 
border and send tanks into Akwesasne to deal with the situation. 
I do not think that is the solution.
<P>
	I have always supported the idea that when we as a 
government move into certain areas we consult with the local 
communities involved. That is one thing we have done. We are 
committed to consulting Canadians to try to resolve the problem 
that way.
<P>
	In terms of the health question access to illegal cigarettes was 
far easier prior to the bill-before we dropped the taxes and 
before we got rid of the smuggling-than it is today. Kids could 
buy them in every school yard. Right now because of the 
commitment of the government and the legislation the penalties 
for those in corner stores who might consider doing it is a lot 
greater. That is why the health question is addressed.
<P>
	Young Canadians had access at any age. They did not have to 
show an age or majority card to a smuggler to buy cigarettes. 
They had that easy access in the school yard. They had it in every 
city across the country. It was not just in Toronto. It was not just 
in Montreal. It was also in downtown Calgary. Many parents 
came to us from those areas and suggested that something 
needed to be done. There was a problem. We took action on it 
and we did something about it. It may not please everybody but 
we saw a problem and we dealt with it.
<P>
	In terms of dealing with the smuggling problem I agree, but 
the guns and alcohol smuggling problem is not a problem 
directly related to just reserves. It is a problem across the 
country. We made commitments to deal with some of gun 
control problems. The Minister of Justice said that we were 
committed to putting more resources toward stopping the 
smuggling of alcohol and guns. A lot of the problems in the 
country in terms of gun control is the fact that many of these 
guns are being used in crimes in major cities. They are not 
bought legally but are smuggled across the border.
<P>
	We have seen the problem. The government has committed 
more resources, more time and more energy to resolving the 
problem and bringing in solutions. That is the sensible approach 
to dealing with the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened 
to the debate and to the hon. member's comments. I would like 
to make a short statement and ask him to respond to it. If 
reducing or eliminating smuggling is simply the job of passing 
laws and enforcing those laws, why was that not done to stop the 
smuggling of cigarettes?
<P>
	I asked the hon. justice minister during a meeting with him if 
he would introduce stricter laws to prevent the smuggling of 
guns into the country and how he was making out with the 
cocaine and the drug problem. That is illegal in Canada as well. 
Yet we can buy it anywhere in any of the major cities across the 
country.
<P>
	The smuggling problem is be eliminated by reducing taxes. 
The children in the schools will now have the money to buy 
cheaper cigarettes. We are creating an internal smuggling 
problem. There will be people supplying cigarettes to kids in the 
school yard.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I would like him to comment on the principle that underlies 
the whole area of smuggling and people seeking products that 
the law has prohibited.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. It is a 
question that I continually asked the previous government. 
Frankly it did not do a heck of a lot to solve it. However we have 
taken the bull by the horns and are starting to address these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5641"> 5641 </A></B>
<P>
issues. It is not simple. We cannot just bring in legislation and 
all of a sudden think it will solve the problem.
<P>
	As a government we have gone beyond the legislative 
process. First and foremost we must work with Canadians on the 
matter. We must work with local communities that are having 
specific problems in terms of smuggling. We have increased the 
enforcement aspect of it. We have put more police on it. We have 
a large border. We have the largest undefended border in the 
world. We have a particular problem in Canada to deal with. One 
of the ways to deal with it is through enforcement.
<P>
	Another way is to make sure that when laws are brought in and 
criminals are convicted they get the punishment they deserve 
and we do not bargain off their penalties for other things. That is 
the commitment made by the government. We are not only 
bringing in tougher laws. We will make sure the penalties for 
people breaking those laws are in force, that they serve their 
time and the penalties are not bargained off somehow.
<P>
	That is not easy to do. Changes to our criminal justice system 
cannot happen overnight. We are working on it. We will make 
sure the criminals are told they should not be involved in this 
type of activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to address Bill 
C-32.
<P>
	The bill introduces amendments to the Excise Act, the Excise 
Tax Act and the Income Tax Act for the purpose of combating 
cigarette smuggling in Canada. The phrase combating cigarette 
smuggling in Canada is a bit facetious. When we talk about 
combating smuggling, an illegal act that involves breaking the 
law, we would automatically assume we are talking about law 
enforcement.
<P>
	As we have clearly seen in this session of Parliament the 
government opposite is not interested in talking about real law 
enforcement. I would like to talk for 20 minutes on ways to 
enforce the laws of the country, but unfortunately it would fall 
on deaf ears on the other side of the House. Instead of talking 
about law enforcement, which should have been the thrust of 
combating the smuggling, I want to talk reluctantly about the 
health crisis the bill will create.
<P>
	As I look across the floor and hear the truce from this side of 
the House it reminds me of a verse I learned in Sunday school. I 
am not a biblical scholar, but it was something to the effect that 
the devil shall flee from the truth. When I see the benches 
opposite emptying as Reform Party members on this side speak 
the truth about the bill, I am wondering whether my teacher did 
not have some application in mind for today.
<P>
	I am going to talk about the health consequences of the bill. I 
would like to address my remarks to some specific areas of the 
<P>
bill which I believe display the government's sheer callousness 
when it concerns the health of Canadians. Specifically the bill 
reduces federal tax on cigarettes. It makes cigarettes cheaper. 
There is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of right thinking 
Canadians that lower prices on cigarettes creates more  smokers. 
That is undeniable no matter what the government opposite 
says. In particular it encourages smoking.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon. 
member suggested our benches were empty on this side of the 
House. He might look at his side of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I do not believe the 
hon. member has a point of order. Certainly it might be a matter 
of debate for another time and place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to debate the truth 
of how the country should be run with any member or members 
opposite any time they want.
<P>
	I believe the bill will create more smokers because of the 
lower cost of cigarettes. In particular it will target and 
encourage younger smokers, people who have never smoked 
before, to begin to smoke because now the cost is so affordable. 
All this will create a huge demand on the already strained health 
care crisis in our country.
<P>
	The government sought to battle smugglers at the expense of 
the health of its citizens. There is no doubt about that in the bill. 
It should have been looking at stricter ways to enforce the laws 
against smuggling. That is where the answer lies. It is not in 
trying to go into competition with the smugglers by selling 
cheaper cigarettes than they can.
<P>
	With the introduction of the bill the government simply 
acquiesced to smugglers and is now trying to undercut their 
pricing. This is a shameful way to deal with law breakers. The 
government should be ashamed of itself. Without an attempt at 
stricter enforcement the government has now entered into 
competition with the smugglers. What a fine way to uphold the 
criminal justice system in the country: go into competition with 
smugglers.
<P>
	I could give a few examples. If that is the way the government 
is going to treat people who break the law, by going into 
competition with them by offering a cheaper price, it could 
really get carried away. I will not cite some of the instances we 
talked about earlier.
<P>
	No one disputes the fact we had a serious problem with 
respect to contraband cigarettes. It was a big problem. In 1981, 1 
in 176 packs of cigarettes were smuggled into Canada. By 1992 
that number had risen to 1 in 6 packages. We had a problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5642"> 5642 </A></B>
<P>
	It is estimated that smuggling represented a yearly loss to 
Canadian retailers of some $1.2 billion. The government should 
have been looking into tougher laws and increased enforcement 
of those laws rather than going into competition with the 
smugglers. People looking at this action from afar would say 
that the government was dealing with law breakers and would 
expect that it would enforce the laws. However the government 
lowered the price of cigarettes and went into competition with 
them. Those people would have to scratch their heads and ask 
what is going on down there.
<P>
	The government talks about the cost of enforcing the law and 
asks why the Reform Party is going off on tirades about 
spending more money on law enforcement. As a matter of fact 
the Reform Party has always advocated increased spending in 
law enforcement areas. We have always advocated that and we 
always will. The government would like to cut back and take a 
more middle of the road approach or it is society's fault 
approach to it. Canadians are demanding that we get tougher on 
people who break the laws.
<P>
	At present some provinces have chosen not to reduce any 
provincial tax on cigarettes. What has happened? It has resulted 
in the creation of smuggling within Canada. We have taken one 
problem, smuggling between the U.S.A. and Canada, and have 
created another. Now a package of cigarettes can be bought in 
Ontario for about $2. They still cost $6 or $7 in B.C. This is sort 
of free enterprise, but it is against the law and the government 
created it with Bill C-32. The bill does nothing to stop 
interprovincial cigarette smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	It proposes that interprovincial smugglers will be susceptible 
to a tax penalty of three times the excess tax avoided. This is 
only a slap on the wrist. Interprovincial smugglers with this kind 
of penalty are still making a fortune in what they are doing.
<P>
	Such a penalty is of little significance to these people and 
would impact little, if any, on the profit margins of smugglers 
shipping cigarettes from Ontario or Quebec to western Canada. I 
return to my previous point that the lack of resolve of this 
government to enforce the laws of the land has led to a 
government attempting to make its cigarette prices appear more 
attractive than those of the smuggled cigarettes.
<P>
	This strategy founded on the reduction of the tax on tobacco 
will ultimately lead to an increase in the numbers of smokers in 
Canada and a subsequent increase in the number of Canadians 
hospitalized for smoking related illnesses.
<P>
	Of particular concern to me are the number of adolescent 
smokers who are going to be created as a result of the 
implementation of the government strategy in this regard. Even 
before the reduction of cigarette taxes, some studies have shown 
that the number of teens taking up smoking is on the rise for a 
number of reasons, peer pressure probably being one of the 
biggest causes.
<P>
	In 1991 statistics showed that 120,000 children and 
adolescents began to smoke for the first time. With cigarettes 
selling for $2 and some cents a package in the stores and being 
available to adolescents, let us not be fooled about the corner 
store penalties that this government is talking about.
<P>
	If these adolescents want cigarettes, they will get them, 
believe me. At $2 a package it makes it all the more attractive 
for them to buy.
<P>
	In 1994 the number of adolescents smoking for the first time 
is going to rise dramatically. Despite the anti-smoking 
advertising campaigns that the government has talked about, 
this year the Minister of Health admitted in the House that the 
government's anti-smoking advertisements targeted at 
adolescents were not working.
<P>
	Bill C-32 works in direct contradiction to the Tobacco Sales 
to Young Persons Act which serves to protect the health of 
young persons by restricting their access to tobacco in light of 
the risks associated with the use of tobacco. What a contrast in 
thought and deed.
<P>
	On the one hand, the government is saying that it wants to 
protect the health of young persons regarding the use of tobacco 
and yet it lowers the price of cigarettes by taking the tax off and 
making them around $2 a package. It is certainly a contrast.
<P>
	With these new tax measures, young people will now have 
greater access to tobacco products because of the cheaper price. 
There is no doubt about that.
<P>
	As well, in June 1993 the Department of Finance reported that 
with respect to cigarettes teenagers are more sensitive to price 
changes than adults. Further, in 1991 the Department of Health 
began a program known as the national strategy to reduce 
tobacco use.
<P>
	This program started with the premise that tax on tobacco 
products was a crucial element of reducing tobacco use. In other 
words, the higher the price, the lower the use. It was a deterrent.
<P>
	Here again, as we have seen the government's attitude toward 
criminal justice and law enforcement, this government does not 
know the meaning of deterrents. Why would it be likely to 
understand the reasoning of this statement using tobacco tax as a 
deterrent?
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is moving a bill that would see the 
reduction of taxes on cigarettes, a move that will dramatically 
increase the number of teenage smokers in this country. This bill 
promotes more smokers, particularly younger ones, and creates 
substantial increases in health care costs for the future.
<P>
	It is estimated that 38,000 Canadians die as a result of 
smoking related diseases.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5643"> 5643 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	To help offset the criticism of promoting tobacco by lowering 
taxes the government has introduced this health promotion 
surtax on tobacco manufacturers and it will raise about $185 
million a year. It is supposed to go toward advertising to deter 
adolescents from smoking. This is wonderful. It takes a billion 
dollars off the cigarette taxes and encourages young people to 
smoke because they are now more affordable and now it puts 
$185 million back into combating the problem it is creating with 
lowering the price of cigarettes.
<P>
	Someone said in this House a few weeks ago that it is like 
trying to bail out the Titanic with a teacup. This surtax will only 
apply until 1997. What is it going to do then? Is it going to raise 
the cigarette taxes back up and create the smuggling problem?
<P>
	Through Bill C-32 the government promotes the use of highly 
addictive substances and then as an afterthought creates a tiny 
program to remove people's addiction to that substance.
<P>
	It is interesting to note in the red book, the infamous red book, 
in relation to health care the Liberals promised: ``Our approach 
to problems in our country will be based on our values''. I 
shudder to think that the values of the Liberals are demonstrated 
in Bill C-32. If their values and their attitude toward health care 
in this country are demonstrated in Bill C-32, this country is in 
deep trouble. This is a sad commentary considering the 
implication Bill C-32 will have on our already strained health 
care system.
<P>
	Even within my own riding there are examples of people 
waiting months and years for needed operations. The health care 
system has had cutbacks. What is going to happen with the 
increase in tobacco related illnesses? It is going to swell the 
lines of people waiting for health care and it is going to create an 
even bigger backlog to our already strained health care system.
<P>
	This will be the legacy of this government's action in 
reducing tobacco taxes; the legacy of a health care system that is 
going to be far worse than what we are experiencing currently. 
This will be the legacy of Bill C-32 which this government is 
trying to put through this House.
<P>
	The government should have been looking for alternate ways 
to curb the smuggling of cigarettes. We suggested, but obviously 
the tobacco lobbyists got to the government first, why not a 
higher export tax? Why not put on a $22 a carton export tax on 
cigarettes and raise the price south of the border so they could 
not be sold cheaper in Canada. No, the lobbyists for the tobacco 
industry were at work and they got to the people in the 
government who were making that decision.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> At the very time the U.S. is trying to raise 
taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> They could have got the $8 a carton. Big deal, $8 
a carton. They take $20 off the price of a carton in Canada and 
add $8 south of the border-such a deal, that really makes a huge 
impact.
<P>
	The U.S. was willing to co-operate with Canadians on this 
one too but it ignored it. We know why it ignored it. I hope that 
this new lobbying legislation is going to be effective because we 
have just seen an example of what happens when lobbyists are 
not controlled in this country. You can bet that the tobacco 
lobbyists got to this government before it came up with Bill 
C-32.
<P>
	If it had imposed a larger export tax on cigarettes this would 
have thwarted the ability of smugglers to buy the cigarettes at a 
cheaper price south of the border, bring them back to Canada and 
make a tonne of money on them. No, they would not do that. 
They will not enforce the laws and they will not stand up to the 
powerful lobbyists who support this party with their 
influence-I was going to say money, but they would never 
admit that.
<P>
	Back in 1992 the government of the day did establish an 
export tax but it was withdrawn a few months later because of 
pressure brought to the previous government by the tobacco 
lobbyists. I would like to meet some of these guys. They must be 
awful big and walk with clubs because they have a lot of 
influence on these people across here and they had a lot of 
influence on the previous government. The magnitude of the 
smuggling problem today I believe with a little more resolve the 
government could have stood firm on such attacks. I welcome 
the hon. member back to hear the truth.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	If the government had increased the export tax on cigarettes it 
would have allowed us to maintain high taxes on tobacco 
products, discouraging the increase in smoking and reducing the 
possibility that our hospitals would become unworkable as those 
with smoking related diseases clog the system.
<P>
	In league with this strategy the government could also attempt 
to convince the administration of the United States that higher 
taxes are in the interest of Canadian and U.S. citizens when it 
comes to tobacco products. Some of our contraband cigarettes 
are American made. Higher U.S. taxes coupled with our own 
export tax would present a significant deterrent to the smuggling 
problem that confronted this government and which it failed 
miserably on.
<P>
	If this government is serious about its concerns over the 
health care of Canadians it would not in any way be 
implementing Bill C-32. It never would have come up with this. 
That is evident because of the questioning we have had to the 
health minister in the past who simply cannot give us any 
answers about the future health care system. Why should we 
expect that the government would be serious about health care 
concerning Bill C-32?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5644"> 5644 </A></B>
<P>
	Studies have shown that lower prices mean more younger 
smokers, more of the population affected by smoking related 
diseases. It all adds up to increased health care costs which mean 
increased taxes for Canadians in the future. It is the taxpayer of 
this country who is going to have to pay for these increased 
health care costs.
<P>
	To a government that has said it would love to reduce taxes in 
this country, if this is an example of it, again, this country is in a 
lot of trouble and the Canadian taxpayer under this government 
is going to see tax freedom day go from about June to three or 
four weeks later by the time this government is through with its 
term.
<P>
	If this is how the government proposes to combat cigarette 
smuggling, the Reform Party and I must defiantly oppose it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say as respectfully as I can to the Chair that I 
have never heard such nonsense.
<P>
	It is absolutely shameful that a member would chose to make 
statements such as the ones he has just made in opposition to 
things that he knows or that he should know. He has indicated 
today, as he said a few days ago in this House, that he was 
advocating a military operation to patrol the border between 
Canada and the United States and an invasion of Akwesasne, a 
part of my riding.
<P>
	Those were propositions that same member made last week. I 
say to all other members of his party that when all of them 
support the vote this member will take today, that is the 
proposition they are following. That is exactly what they are 
standing for like him.
<P>
	I invite all of them who are reasonable-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Do not shout.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member may think I should shut up, but the 
constituents of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell where a lot of 
this contraband is going on have asked me to be here. They 
elected me.
<P>
	No, I will not shut up, particularly on this issue while my 
constituents are being shot at, while people like those I have just 
heard are pontificating from afar. No, I will not shut up. I will 
not stop defending the constituents of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	I say to the member across, if he is advocating and it is the 
Reform Party position that those who speak on behalf of their 
constituents should shut up, I am glad to hear it on the record. It 
will make for great stuff in the next election if that is the 
position of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I come back to the member's statement, he who is advocating 
higher taxes. It is a radical position for the Reform Party, I must 
say, but if he espouses that position I suppose it indicates that 
there are free votes across the way. There will probably be a few 
more who think otherwise. He said that some contraband 
cigarettes were made in the United States. He also said that 
increasing taxes in the United States at the same time as 
increasing taxes in Canada would solve the problem.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	First, it takes two years to get a tax increase through the 
United States Senate. I am sure the member knows that because 
it was indicated last fall.
<P>
	Second, does the member know that the cigarettes illegally 
manufactured in the United States would not have been taxed to 
start with because they were illegal? There was a 7 per cent and 
growing penetration of counterfeit cigarettes. Those cigarettes 
bore Canadian brand names and were made in warehouses, some 
located in Canada, some in the United States, some in New York 
state, some in southeast Asia and some in eastern Europe. If the 
member paid any attention to what was said last week in this 
House surely he would know that.
<P>
	Does he not know that what he is saying today would not work 
and that my constituents would have continued to be shot at by 
thugs? Does he not care?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, it appears the member opposite 
wants to get into a shouting contest. I am for that if he wants to 
do that. When I was talking about considering the military I was 
talking about enforcing the law.
<P>
	The member talks so piously about protecting his 
constituents. That member's government has turned its back on 
law enforcement. The RCMP clearly defined the areas of 
smuggling to the government. Unfortunately those areas 
happened to be primarily on reserve land on the border between 
the U.S. and Canada, but this government has a hands off policy 
for the reserves. If there is criminal activity anywhere in this 
country it should be addressed to the full extent of the law. 
Apparently this government has special areas where it does not 
want to enforce the law. I wonder what the reason is for that.
<P>
	The government says it does not have enough money to patrol 
the areas of cigarette smuggling. That is the excuse it uses. It 
says: ``You in the Reform Party are talking about spending 
money for law enforcement''. We would be prepared to do that.
<P>
	I suggested to the hon. member last week on the same subject 
that if the government does not have enough money to put more 
police officers in that area, then why not use the military? The 
government is having a problem in defining the role for the 
military. I was not talking about a military invasion. I was 
talking about orderly patrol to stop smugglers from coming 
across the border. There is a whole lot of difference between that 
and sending in the tanks and the bazookas that the hon. member 
is talking about. He tends to continue to blow things out of 
proportion, but we can disseminate the verbiage coming from 
the other side.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5645"> 5645 </A></B>
<P>
	I talked about higher export taxes on cigarettes. I support that. 
I will stand by that proposition. I believe that instead of 
lowering the taxes on cigarettes in Canada to combat smuggling 
the government should have made the price of the product at the 
source more expensive so there would not be such a huge profit 
margin. I know the government could have received the 
co-operation of the United States.
<P>
	It all goes back to whether this government has any backbone 
to enforce the laws that currently exist in Canada. The answer to 
that is no. It has chosen a back door method which is going to 
cause considerably more problems to Canada's health care 
system, instead of standing up and enforcing the laws like it 
should have. This government has no guts when it comes to 
enforcing the law. We will not see it in the next four years no 
matter what the justice minister says. This is evidence of what is 
to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
am somewhat amazed that the Reform Party is supporting high 
taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> And military invasions of Indian reserves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> And military invasions, whatever. However, I 
want to say to the hon. member who talks about enforcement of 
laws, before he came out with his proposal I am wondering 
whether or not he talked to the RCMP to see how feasible it was.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	We did and the RCMP told us that this problem had grown so 
far out of proportion and had become so big that a million people 
could have been put out there to enforce it and the problem still 
would not have been resolved.
<P>
	In fact we had to go beyond that. We took the common sense 
approach and attacked it from both ends. We said we were going 
to have to do more enforcement. We were going to have to make 
sure the penalties were increased. We were going to have to nip 
it in the bud and make sure the incentive to smuggle was not 
there. That is why we dropped the taxes.
<P>
	In terms of lobbyists and the export tax I am surprised the 
Reform Party would support an export tax. All an export tax 
does is export Canadian jobs to the United States. That is very 
clear and that is why the Tories in the last government got rid of 
that export tax. They realized it would just export jobs to the 
United States taken by itself.
<P>
	The lobbyists he talks about who lobbied against it were the 
Canadian farmers. They were the farmers. They were the people 
of the soil who came to government through me and lobbied very 
strongly against that aspect. They were the ones who lobbied 
very strongly for this tax decrease. They won that battle, not 
because they had high paid lobbyists on their behalf but because 
they had members of Parliament who listened to their concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to settle down a little bit 
here. This member has such a nice tone to his voice I cannot see 
any point in arguing with him.
<P>
	I would like to point out that his statement about the cigarette 
smuggling was so far out of proportion it was almost impossible 
to control. I would like to humbly suggest that if this 
government had reacted when cigarette smuggling was in its 
infancy and the problem was much smaller, we would not have 
had a problem that was so far out of proportion.
<P>
	The present government will say it started in the previous 
government. Undoubtedly it did and the previous government 
failed to address it as well. But when this government took over 
in October, the problem was not as large as it was later on in the 
season. The government had the opportunity back then when it 
first took over. It knew about the problem and could have done 
something then. It did not and the problem grew. What does it 
do? It goes into competition with the cigarette smugglers trying 
to put them out of business. That is not the way to run a railroad 
or a country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to add a few words to this very important debate.
<P>
	I am going to be speaking in opposition to the bill specifically 
to that part which deals with the excise tax on cigarettes. This is 
an omnibus bill. It includes quite a number of other issues most 
of which make sense and if they were separated I would support.
<P>
	I do have to acknowledge at the beginning of my dissertation 
that the Liberal government of the day did not start this mess, 
they inherited it. My objection is how they handled the mess 
they inherited. We acknowledge the fact it was the Conservative 
government that did not have the backbone to deal with the 
problem when it was a small one so it became a big problem.
<P>
	This extremely difficult problem was exacerbated by the fact 
that day after day Bloc Quebecois members would stand in this 
House and deride the government for doing nothing about this, 
all the while raising the temperature of the whole debate. This 
put it on the front pages of every newspaper and raised the ante, 
forcing the government hand to react. It had to do something. On 
balance the necessity to do something caused the government to 
come up with half a loaf.
<P>
	The Conservative government when confronted with this 
dilemma said it would put an export tax on a carton of cigarettes, 
thereby taking the profit out of smuggling. It put an export tax 
on of about $8 a carton. Shortly after that the tobacco industry 
told the government that if it did not remove the export tax the 
industry would export itself south of the border. Canadian 
producers would lose their jobs and Canadian manufacturing 
workers would lose their jobs. The net result would be net, net, 
net losses to Canada.

	The Conservative government of the day said to the tobacco 
industry: ``You have been pretty responsible in everything you 
have done to date so we will take you at your word. We will 
reduce the tax. We will take it off and we will expect you to be 
self-policing''. What a brainwave that was. It showed once 
again how brain dead the Conservatives were. The net result was 
that tobacco smuggling took on unprecedented proportions as 
the price of cigarettes went up.
<P>
	There are products which have nothing to do with cigarettes 
that we in Canada pay a particularly high price for. Milk, eggs, 
cheese, butter, and chickens: All of these products are protected 
by marketing boards. As a result, Canadians pay a higher price 
than the Americans for these products. What do you suppose 
would happen if we started selling chickens out of the back of a 
truck in a shopping mall? Within about 30 seconds we would be 
in the hoosegow.
<P>
	What is the difference between selling chickens we are paying 
too much for, or selling eggs we are paying too much for, or 
cheese, or butter, and selling cigarettes? The difference is that 
the cigarettes were coming through a reserve. There had been a 
very tense and difficult time a few years earlier in that same 
area. No one wanted to ruffle any feathers. Therefore the laws of 
Canada were not enforced.
<P>
	The situation is that a noxious product which is highly 
addictive, and most addictive to young people, is made far more 
affordable to the very people most susceptible to the noxious 
aspects of the product.
<P>
	There is a direct correlation between price and consumption. 
It is called price elasticity. It is a fact of life in marketing that is 
well known and well documented the world over: the lower the 
price, the higher the consumption; the higher the price, the 
lower the consumption. That is an irrefutable, indisputable fact. 
What do we accomplish if we lower the price of this noxious 
weed by half? We make it far more affordable, far more usable 
by the very people we do not want to become addicted.
<P>
	I would like to quote some information from the Canadian 
Cancer Society. It has gleaned these statistics from Statistics 
Canada. Speaking to the issue of tobacco taxes and 
consumption: ``The retail price of tobacco increased 
dramatically in the 1980s as federal and provincial governments 
increased tobacco tax rates. This led to an unprecedented 
decline in consumption, even factoring in contraband sales''.
<P>
	As an indication of exactly what happened from about 1980 to 
1992, in 1980 the per capita consumption of cigarettes in Canada 
was 2,900 cigarettes. In 1992, as a direct result of increased cost 
and even factoring in the sale of contraband cigarettes, the 
consumption was down to 1,500 cigarettes per capita, almost 
half. It was a reduction of almost 50 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	What led to this? There were other things which we will get to 
that led to this. The primary reason was because cigarettes were 
pricing themselves out of the market as a direct result of the 
taxes imposed by governments for the specific purpose of 
reducing consumption. The decline was even more dramatic 
among teenagers. Between 1979 and 1991 the percentage of 
Canadians aged 15 to 19 who reported they were smokers 
declined from 46.5 per cent to 22 per cent, more than a 50 per 
cent reduction in the number of teenagers who smoked.
<P>
	The federal government acknowledges the effect taxation can 
have on smoking among youth. Then finance minister Michael 
Wilson stated in his 1991 budget that studies show tobacco taxes 
are particularly important in discouraging younger Canadians 
from smoking. As a result of the tax increases included over 
those years, it is estimated that there will be 100,000 fewer 
teenaged smokers as a result.
<P>
	We do not even know what the cumulative effect is of this 
reduction of cigarette smoking at the teenage years, but just 
imagine what it is later in life. Because it is a statistically proven 
fact that where you have a home where both parents or one 
parent smokes, the incidence of children smoking is 
significantly higher. We have a cumulative effect of the 
reduction of people smoking, particularly adults and teenagers.
<P>
	Clearly tobacco tax increases in and of themselves are not the 
only reason for the reduction in consumption. The ban on 
tobacco advertising, improved health warnings on cigarette 
packages, public education and the increased restriction of 
smoking in workplaces and public places have all contributed to 
the decline. The measures act synergistically, together.
<P>
	If you remove the single most important impediment to 
cigarette smoking, price, what does it do to all the rest of them? 
Then you come in and say: ``My goodness, what are we going to 
do? Let us go to plain packaging on cigarettes''.
<P>
	Plain packaging on cigarettes is not going to hurt, it is going 
to help in preventing cigarette companies being able to market 
and merchandise their product. When you decrease the price that 
much everything else that we do is just whistling in the wind. If 
we as a nation have decided that to reduce smoking, particularly 
among the young, is an important national objective, then we 
must pursue that at all costs. Those tobacco farmers who are 
impacted by that must accept the fact that the industry is 
changing and that we will require fewer tobacco farmers in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5647"> 5647 </A></B>
<P>
future. To my knowledge, the industry was very much aware of 
that and many tobacco farmers were converting to other crops.
<P>
	Just because we have people in Canada manufacturing a 
product which is known to cause almost 40,000 deaths per year 
due to lung cancer, more than the combined deaths of AIDS, 
traffic accidents, suicides and everything else put together, why 
should we put the concerns of those farmers who know the 
writing is on the wall ahead of the health of the country as a 
whole?
<P>
	The government is talking about imposing gun controls on the 
nation, little realizing that every time someone puts a cigarette 
in their mouth they are playing Russian roulette with their lives 
and the lives of everyone around them through secondhand 
noxious smoke. There is a hypocrisy here.
<P>
	This essentially is a law and order issue. If we accept the 
rationale that because we have lawlessness we must therefore 
reduce the impediment for Canadians to obey the law, if it is 
non-enforceable then change the law, then maybe we could 
carry the same logic to removing speed limits. Then we would 
not have anybody breaking the law by speeding.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	If the law is wrong, then it either should not have been written 
in the first place or it needs to be changed so that Canadians do 
not feel a sense of dislocation with the law makers who actually 
promulgate the laws in the first place. If we as law makers 
promulgate laws that will not be adhered to or are afraid to 
enforce laws that are on the books, that brings the very notion of 
law abiding citizens and the responsibility for obeying the law 
into disrepute. One leads to another.
<P>
	We wonder why we have lawlessness in our society. We 
wonder why we have a rash of the perception and the reality of 
lawlessness in our young people. If we as law makers do not set 
the example by saying: ``Look, this is the law. We are all going 
to obey it. It is the same law for everyone, no matter who you are 
and where you live in the country'', why should anyone obey the 
laws except those laws that they agree with?
<P>
	As I bring this to a conclusion, I would like to make a couple 
of suggestions. We in Canada might consider the experience of 
Italy which had a problem similar to ours. If I may I will read 
this: ``The Canadian government might be wise to copycat the 
Italian example to deal with smuggling. In Italy to prevent 
tobacco companies from selling cigarettes to the contraband 
market the government threatened to suspend all legitimate 
sales of the brand particular to that company until the illegal 
tobacco products were no longer being sold to the contraband 
market''.
<P>
	That is coming down hard on those very tobacco producers 
who said that they were going to be self-policing. We could do 
the same thing and give them another nudge. This would 
effectively deal with the contraband problem and would not in 
any way conflict with the charter or with any of our trade 
agreements.
<P>
	The government is in a very difficult position on this bill, 
between a rock and a hard place. It was confronted with the 
problem of the lawlessness that was going on when it took 
office. It was compounded by the antics of the Bloc in raising the 
issue to a fever pitch and by the support of people in government 
to those who are breaking the law by selling contraband 
cigarettes or turning a blind eye.
<P>
	It had to be dealt with before it got totally out of hand. To give 
credit where credit is due, it did deal with it. Now the problem is 
going to be what will this government do to pick up the pieces.
<P>
	Will this government by the end of its mandate return tobacco 
taxes to their original level whether as excise or however it does 
it? Will this government when that time occurs ensure that those 
who would sell contraband tobacco and break the laws of 
Canada no matter where they live would be punished? When this 
occasion arises with this product or with any other illegal 
contraband product, will the government turn a blind eye? Will 
it have an ostrich attitude and pretend the problem does not exist 
until it becomes a problem that cannot be handled by enforcing 
the law and therefore change the law in order to accommodate 
lawlessness, the law breakers and the tobacco companies? That 
is where the shame lies in this law.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
took interest in the hon. member's statements on this issue. I 
thank the hon. member for his statements. They were very 
interesting. I will make sure that my constituents, the farmers in 
my area, hear those statements because I think it is important for 
them to know where the Reform Party stands on this issue.
<P>
	I am somewhat concerned about the fact that the Reform Party 
is saying that this government should not listen to tobacco 
farmers because they are producing a product that the Reform 
Party does not like.
<P>
	I will go back and give a little history on this. I know hon. 
members across will be interested in this. These farmers got into 
this a number of years ago actually because of the support of 
government. The government encouraged them to go into these 
lands and grow tobacco. Many of these farmers have been there 
for generations. It is not easy just picking up and moving to 
another commodity, moving into another group.
<P>
	One may be able to do that in western Canada but their critic 
for agriculture would realize that it takes a big cost just 
changing from one commodity to another. We just cannot turn 
tobacco farmers into another type of farmer. These farms are on 
average about 85 acre farms. Yes, some of them have 
diversified. Some of them have gone into ginseng, horticulture 
crops and some other crops. In fact over the last 10 years we 
have seen half of the farmers go, but a lot of them could not do 
that. They ended up on unemployment lines or welfare because 
there are not a lot of alternatives. One cannot turn an 85  acre 
farm into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5648"> 5648 </A></B>
<P>
just another thriving farm. The alternatives just are not there. 
There are not a lot of other crops frankly that can grow in those 
areas other than tobacco and certain crops. They were 
encouraged to go into other crops. In fact those markets flooded. 
There was not a lot of opportunity to sell the produce that they 
had worked so hard for.
<P>
	These families have been there, as I said, for generations and 
do not know how to farm in a lot of other areas. It is not easy to 
do it. Governments in the past have tried but frankly they have 
failed in a lot of different areas. We have seen a lot of the 
pressures that many families have. We have seen a very dramatic 
increase in suicides in my area because the troubles have been 
very difficult for tobacco farmers. We just cannot say that on 
two points they can all of a sudden move into other areas 
because the opportunities are not there.
<P>
	We cannot say that governments should not listen seriously to 
the concerns of these farmers because first and foremost the 
government encouraged them to get in there and, second, they 
are human beings and Canadians and people and they should be 
listened to.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about Italy. I know that came from 
one of the anti-smoking groups. It put something like that out. It 
is a little different here. The licences under which tobacco 
companies manufacture are not Canadian. They are 
international. They can easily take that Virginia flue cured 
tobacco, grow that same tobacco in the United States and easily 
export those manufactured cigarettes to Canada. There are no 
trade rules in the world that a country could bring in to stop that.
<P>
	It is a very, very easy process for them to take their business 
south, leaving Canada. Who would lose? The thousands and 
thousands of Canadian people who work in that industry and the 
Canadian tobacco producers, the 1,200 families in those 
communities, help support small town and rural southwestern 
Ontario and in other parts of this country. It is not that easy to do 
that. It is just not easy to say: ``Okay, there is a solution in Italy 
and they solved it''. It is a lot more complex than the member 
suggests.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	There was a problem, it existed and I thank the hon. member 
for outlining that but we had to do something about it. There was 
not any easy solution. As the hon. member knows, sometimes 
before you get elected when you run through campaigns you 
have all the answers but when you get in here and you face the 
realities of governing and you face the realities of trying to solve 
some of these complex problems, trying to deal with the 
complexities of this country and the different interests involved, 
and at the same time trying to listen to Canadians and trying to 
make sure that what you are doing represents their views, it is 
not always easy.
<P>
	We saw a problem. We wanted to make sure that smuggling 
problem stopped, that the whole underground economy came 
under control because we felt that was a serious problem and we 
felt that the only way to do it was to bring in legislation like this 
and to take a multi-faceted approach to the problem. There is 
not one solution to this problem, Mr. Speaker, as you know, 
coming from the area that you do. You have dealt with this 
problem over the years. The problem did not start on October 26. 
The problem was there for a number of years. We knew about it. 
We worked on it and I thought we reacted pretty quickly toward 
solving the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
observations from across the aisle.
<P>
	I do acknowledge how difficult it is for a farmer or for anyone 
else for that matter when they see their livelihood changing in 
front of their eyes and they have to retool their lives in order to 
accommodate changing circumstances.
<P>
	This does not happen exclusively in the agricultural industry. 
It happens all across the nation. It has happened in Ontario 
particularly over these last four or five years as all aspects of 
Canadian manufacturing, particularly that in Ontario, have been 
struggling to retool over these last few years. We find that as we 
go down the path of life sometimes the road changes, the path 
changes, and we have to change with it.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned that over 50 per cent of the 
people previously engaged in farming, tobacco farming, are no 
longer doing so because they recognize that this is an industry at 
least in Canada that has a sunset. Smoking is less and less 
socially acceptable and it will eventually be banned virtually 
everywhere except outside because people who are the victims 
of cigarette smoking, the unintended victims through second 
hand smoke, will not tolerate it anymore. You cannot for 
instance smoke in the precincts of Parliament Hill or any federal 
government building.
<P>
	The Alberta government has legislation before it today to ban 
smoking in any public place, including the workplace. If you are 
in California you can hardly even smoke outside which begs the 
question why on earth are we so upset about the noxious fumes 
from car exhaust when we are walking around inhaling them?
<P>
	I recognize my hon. colleague's concern for his constituents 
or any farmer, particularly the tobacco farmers who are living 
with the imminent demise of their industry. Make no mistake, it 
may not happen this year, it may not happen next year, but it will 
happen. These people are going to have to convert their 
livelihood. It is no longer socially acceptable in Canada to 
smoke.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5649"> 5649 </A></B>
<P>
	If I were a banker I would not spend a whole lot of time 
figuring out a loan to allow anybody to get into the tobacco 
business even given this setback to the anti-smoking people in 
Canada.
<P>
	I do recognize how difficult it is for those who are faced with 
the imminent change in their lives driven by this and it is a 
generational thing.
<P>
	To my hon. colleague, I am cognizant of the problems he 
raises and I have sympathy for the people who must make those 
life decisions as farmers. They are decisions they must face and 
they must be prepared to make them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand before you in a very grave fashion to speak on 
Bill C-32, the act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act 
and the Income Tax Act.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	This reduction in taxes to cigarettes is the single most 
disastrous act of sabotage to the health of the Canadian people 
which has ever been enacted by any government in the history of 
this country. This is not an understatement. Smoking kills at 
least 26,000 individuals per year.
<P>
	The lowering of taxes committed thousands of youth in this 
country to smoke per year, ones who would not normally do that, 
and results in a dramatic increase in consumption.
<P>
	I have some data that just came out from the Addiction 
Research Foundation. There was, as has been said before, a long 
term decline in tobacco use but this stopped in 1994. Smoking in 
Ontario increased in the few short months that the tobacco taxes 
have decreased from 22 per cent to 26 per cent.
<P>
	Among women that increase is particularly dramatic. It has 
gone from 19 per cent to 25 per cent in the last four months. A 10 
per cent decrease in cost results in a 14 per cent increase in 
consumption particularly among the youth and an 8 per cent 
increase in consumption among the rest of the adult population.
<P>
	Some say that this decline in tobacco taxes has resulted in at 
least 800,000 new smokers in this country, of whom 175,000 are 
youth. These numbers translate on a personal basis to disasters 
that I cannot tell members enough about. They result in often 
fatal diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease and a myriad of 
other malignancies.
<P>
	They result in lives lost and the untold pain and suffering by 
people who are afflicted by these diseases and also to the 
families and friends of the loved ones who unfortunately 
succumb to these diseases.
<P>
	To put it in more impersonal terms, the decrease in tobacco 
consumption will cause a decrease in gross domestic product 
and increase in medical costs. Nobody has ever been able to 
show us the increase in costs that is going to result from the 
decline in tobacco taxes.
<P>
	I can tell members from working as a health care professional 
that the cost to our system is in the billions of dollars. In 1982 
the cost of tobacco consumption in this country was $7 billion, 
or $2 billion more than the total expenditures on tobacco 
including the taxes.
<P>
	A decrease in consumption would decrease revenues from 
tobacco taxes, this is true, but it will greatly decrease the cost to 
the taxpayers of this country by decreasing health costs and also 
to avoid the loss in gross domestic product from job losses and a 
decrease in losses from fires caused by smoking.
<P>
	The original idea to decrease tobacco taxes came as a 
response to the rampant tobacco smuggling that was occurring 
between Canada and the United States. I sympathize with the 
government completely on this issue.
<P>
	This is occurring especially in central Canada, particularly in 
the three native reserves, the Kahnawake, Kanesatake and 
Akwesasne reserves that straddle the border. The decrease in 
tobacco taxes was also strongly supported and promoted by none 
other than the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association.
<P>
	To give an idea of the scope of this problem, at the height of 
tobacco smuggling there were 35 cartons of cigarettes smuggled 
into the reserves per person per day, which is an incredible 
problem.
<P>
	The natives claim-I do not have any disagreement with this 
whatsoever-that they have an inherent right to trade across 
their border. I would not dispute this at all, certainly for their 
own needs. However, when that trade involves the distribution 
of a commodity to the rest of Canada which by-passes the laws, 
results in smuggling and results in the death of Canadians all 
over this country, native and non-native, I have a big problem 
with that.
<P>
	I have no sympathy at all for the people who are involved in it. 
I believe that this criminal conduct should be dealt with with the 
full force of the law as it must be dealt with in any part of this 
country. There has been a great reluctance to deal with this issue 
head on.
<P>
	A fear of confrontation permeates the whole situation as much 
of this activity is with organized crime. Illegal weapons are 
rampant in the whole situation. I know that this is a dangerous 
situation but it is also an illegal one. Like it or not, as a cancer in 
our midst that needs to be eradicated on behalf of all 
law-abiding citizens in this country, native and non-native 
alike, we have to deal with this situation and deal with it now.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Now that we have defined the problem of rampant smuggling 
of tobacco products into Canada from the United States, let us 
look at some constructive solutions that would obviate the need 
to lower tobacco taxes.
<P>
	I believe the first and foremost solution which has been 
proven to work is the export tax. I applaud the government in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5650"> 5650 </A></B>
<P>
instituting its export tax. In February 1992 the then government 
instituted a tobacco export tax of  $8. In six weeks it reduced 
smuggling by 70 per cent. However, under pressure from the 
tobacco manufacturers, the government of the day caved in and 
removed it. I applaud this government again for instituting this 
tax.
<P>
	I also applaud the investment in education but I would caution 
this government to spend its money wisely. It is not worthwhile 
investing money in 30 and 40-year olds who are addicted to 
tobacco to stop smoking. I would start at the ages of 6, 7 and 8, 
and please utilize your money carefully in that age group. It will 
pay off in spades in the long run.
<P>
	Also, if you are going to institute education in teenagers, 
which must be done, do not tell them that they are going to get 
lung cancer 20 years down the road, do not show them a bunch of 
nerdy teenagers who look like they jumped out of a Rosedale 
high school playing basketball and turning into cigarettes. Tell 
them that it will affect their looks, address their vanity, address 
narcissism, address them on a personal basis. That is the way to 
address education in teenagers.
<P>
	Getting back to the enforcement aspect, we must not accept a 
double standard of law enforcement in Canada, one for natives 
and one for non-natives. The problem of tobacco smuggling is 
one that extends far beyond the immediate problem of cigarettes 
but, as I said before, involves organized crime, the illegal 
smuggling of drugs, weapons and liquor. It is something that 
affects not only the reserves but also the rest of Canada. It is 
everybody's responsibility. Also, it does not serve the 
law-abiding citizens who live on the reserves. Nobody is 
addressing that problem at all, nobody is speaking out for them.
<P>
	It is an affront to the citizens of this country and the people on 
the reserves this affects. We must provide our enforcement 
officers with the equipment and training to deal with this 
problem expeditiously, at any cost. Law is law, you either have it 
or you do not.
<P>
	I would also ensure that we have an increase in the penalties 
for smuggling. Again, I applaud the government in its efforts 
toward this end. I also urge the judiciary to enforce these laws 
that have been brought in by the government to the fullest of its 
abilities.
<P>
	As I said before, I strongly implore the government to bring 
the tobacco taxes back where they were prior to February 8. I 
instituted private member's motion 295 that has been selected, 
requesting that tobacco taxes be where they were and bring them 
back to pre-February 8, 1994 levels.
<P>
	It is interesting to reflect right now on what is happening in 
the United States. It has instituted taxes and made changes to 
make it such that tobacco and cigarettes in Canada are now 
cheaper than in the United States, in Ontario and in Quebec.
<P>
	I would ask everybody in this House to please reflect carefully 
on this bill. I ask them to look at their children and look at their 
grandchildren and think of the tens of thousands of children who 
are going to be subjected to starting up smoking and who are 
going to suffer the pain and death of them and their loved ones 
by taking up this horrible habit.
<P>
	This bill is reprehensible and we have alternative solutions. 
We have alternative solutions to address the smuggling issue 
that are effective, and so there is no need whatsoever for this 
government to lower the taxes on tobacco.
<P>
	Bring in these other issues, enforce them to the fullest ability 
and do not drop the tobacco taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
short intervention because I was not quite clear on something. 
The hon. member came forward with some figures in terms of 
sales of cigarettes. I think he suggested that smoking was up in 
the past four months and I am wondering if that was based on 
sales. It is hard to determine, especially in the smuggling area, 
actually how many cigarettes people are smoking because they 
were buying them illegally. We can determine what was being 
sold either through the retail sector or we can just take a survey 
and say: ``Are you smoking, did you smoke today, did you 
smoke yesterday, did you smoke a year ago?''. That is important 
because government figures show that production is down and 
for the companies producing cigarettes the number of products 
they are producing since this bill came into effect is down. 
Government figures also suggest that it is down. People are not 
buying as many cigarettes. The numbers are down.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I wonder how that juxtaposes with what the hon. member said 
about his figures saying more people are smoking. The figures 
just do not show that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his question. It brings up some good 
points.
<P>
	There are two things. First, consumption globally is up. I do 
not know what statistics the hon. member is looking at but I 
would be more than happy to speak with him privately to see 
what he has. The figures I have show the exact opposite. Global 
consumption is up, particularly in youth. Youth consumption is 
up dramatically.
<P>
	As I said before, in terms of youth smoking it is not plain 
packaging that is the important issue. Cost is the single most 
important determining factor in consumption in youth. It affects 
how much they smoke and it affects even how many of them are 
going to start to smoke.
<P>
	Again, if it is cost we are looking at as the single most 
important determining factor, it is unthinkable, reprehensible, 
immoral and unjustifiable for the House to pass a bill that will 
lower tobacco costs to children and  commit tens of thousands of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5651"> 5651 </A></B>
<P>
them to take up this habit which will ultimately result in a 
decline in their age, an increase in their mortality and morbidity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
interested in listening to this debate. As the House has heard 
there is actually a small debate even within the Reform caucus, 
as I would suspect there might be within the Liberal caucus and 
for that matter the BQ.
<P>
	I find myself to be in a very ambivalent position on this one. It 
is very difficult. I am looking forward to my colleague being 
able to assist me with the concept. I suggest we ended up with 
the taxes as a result of the fact that they were called sin taxes and 
were on a commodity that people wanted to consume. Therefore 
for the longest period of time consecutive governments saw it as 
being a revenue source. After all that is what taxation is. They 
kept on adding and adding taxes to this particular commodity. 
As a result we ended up with the situation that we have all 
acknowledged, the smuggling problem.
<P>
	When the whole issue was being looked at we also discovered 
the connection that my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
has so ably put forward. We discovered the connection between 
price and the fact that if the price goes down, then we are 
undoubtedly going to end up with higher consumption. It is only 
a straight case of the law of supply and demand.
<P>
	I have to respect my Reform Party colleague because after all 
he is a medical practitioner and has seen the results of cancer 
and other respiratory diseases with respect to this particular 
product. Undoubtedly I have every respect in the world for the 
emotion that he brings to this question.
<P>
	Is it right, is it fair, is it proper to be trying to legislate 
people's behaviour on the basis of taxation? Is taxation not 
really a source of revenue and are we not mixing up principles 
here in trying to legislate people's behaviour by increasing a 
revenue source? It does not seem like quite a match there. 
Perhaps my colleague could help me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> I thank the hon. 
member for his question. It brings up a very important 
philosophical question that has been discussed at length 
privately.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not believe Parliament should legislate the behaviour of 
an adult population. However, we are dealing with legislation 
that is going to affect children more than anyone else, children 
who do not have the objectiveness and experience that adults 
have.
<P>
	Also, the product that we are talking about is something that is 
going to affect them in a horrible, detrimental fashion, as my 
hon. colleague just mentioned a few moments ago. It is going to 
kill them. It is going to affect them in horrible ways, in diseases 
and in morbidity.
<P>
	Smoking tobacco, a deadly product, is exempt from that 
because we are dealing with children, as I said before, who 
cannot make necessarily an objective decision for themselves. 
The cost is also another issue. We lose revenues by bringing the 
tobacco costs down. However, on the other hand, the cost to 
society globally is also very much increased in terms of health 
costs, fires and loss to gross domestic product.
<P>
	When people take up cigarette smoking it is not something 
that only affects them individually. The consequences of their 
behaviour is something that is borne out by all of us collectively 
as a society. As a result of that I do think we have a say in the 
matter as a society and as a House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am here 
today to address Bill C-32, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act 
and the Income Tax Act. I will concentrate on the section of Bill 
C-32 proposing a reduction in tobacco taxes and outline my 
reasons for opposing this legislation.
<P>
	There are some other aspects of this bill which I can support 
and which some Reformers certainly support, but my colleagues 
have and will continue to touch on these areas and I will leave it 
to them.
<P>
	Late June of this year has been declared tax freedom day by 
the Fraser Institute. From that day forward Canadians will be 
working for themselves instead of for government. We can all 
agree that the tax burden on Canadians is too high and I believe 
that all Canadians are looking for tax relief. However, I question 
whether Bill C-32 is the way to lower taxes for Canadians.
<P>
	As a Reformer I want taxes reduced. I want taxes reduced for 
all Canadians and not just for a select group which is what the 
effect will be of this bill. I do not think you could find many 
other pieces of legislation that propose tax reductions, possibly 
none, that I as a Reformer would not support. However, Bill 
C-32, in spite of calling for a reduction in taxes, has hit at the 
very last place that taxes should be reduced.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the problems with this legislation 
and later I will talk about, in the Reform tradition, some possible 
solutions that are better than this legislation.
<P>
	This legislation has been introduced in an effort to control the 
problem of smuggling, not with the intention of easing the tax 
burden. The government refused to control the smuggling 
problem, particularly in the areas of eastern Ontario and across 
the U.S.-Quebec border on native reserves. My colleagues have 
talked about the lack of action on the part of the government in 
dealing with smuggling across the U.S.-Canada border in the 
area of certain reserves.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="5652"> 5652 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	The criminal element of Canada has been allowed to get away 
with its crime of smuggling because the government is afraid to 
intervene in any meaningful way. This is wrong. Lowering 
tobacco taxes may reduce smuggling from the United States and 
may reduce the smuggling of cigarettes. Smugglers will just 
turn their efforts to smuggling other commodities.
<P>
	I would like the government to think about this. If smugglers 
are limited by this change in smuggling cigarettes-it will 
possibly have that effect-then what of smuggling liquor, a 
similar commodity with a high sin tax? What about smuggling 
narcotics, guns? What action will the government take next 
when smuggling liquor becomes a major problem, when liquor 
is being smuggled across the U.S.-Canada border? What action 
will the government take?
<P>
	I ask that question and I would certainly hope that members of 
the governing party will think about it and will answer it for 
themselves. If this legislation passes, we will certainly all be 
having to answer this question and not too far down the road. 
How are we going to deal with the problem of smuggling 
alcohol? What of narcotics and guns?
<P>
	We already know to some extent the attitude that the 
government has in dealing with guns. It is not a healthy 
approach. It is not the direct approach that we would all like but I 
will talk about that briefly later when connecting it to this issue.
<P>
	This legislation does not in any way solve the smuggling 
problem nor does it set a precedent to deal with any future 
problems should they arise. If it does set a precedent, then I am 
more concerned than I am now. If the precedent the government 
has set in dealing with future smuggling problems is to lower the 
tax and do anything but deal with that problem head on, then it is 
a bad precedent. That is another reason we oppose this 
legislation. Once again, it is an example of government dodging 
its responsibility.
<P>
	Bill C-32 will encourage young people to smoke because it 
makes tobacco products more affordable to them. This is 
irrefutable and my colleagues and others have talked about this 
already. It is very clear that the anti-smoking campaign aimed at 
young smokers has not worked. It has been ineffective. Now that 
cigarettes have become more affordable, many young people 
will be taking up smoking.
<P>
	I would like to relate an experience to the House. I was around 
12 years old when my bother and I obtained cigarettes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I know it is a shame. We went out behind the calf 
pens. We used to buy these Holstein calves and at chore time, 
after feeding these calves and dealing with the cows, we would 
go out there and sneak cigarettes.
<P>
	I believe the only thing that stopped my brother and me from 
smoking and from getting caught up in this terrible habit was the 
cost factor. It was the cost factor that stopped my brother and me 
from pursuing this terrible habit.
<P>
	This legislation therefore will be totally ineffective and by 
lowering the cost of cigarettes to everyone right across the 
country it will increase the problem of young people smoking. 
In a study examining the effects of the reduction of tobacco 
taxes in Canada-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will of course have the floor 
when we resume debate on this bill. It being 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 30(5) the House will now proceed to Statements 
by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize an important group in our society, a group which often 
gets overlooked: single parents. Each of us in this House 
undoubtedly knows at least one single parent. Indeed, some of 
us are single parents.
<P>
	Of all the diverse households in Canada, single parents 
represent 13 per cent of Canada's families. To me they are much 
more than a simple number on a statistical chart. As parents they 
play a crucial role in our society. As single parents their job of 
raising children is made doubly hard. Not only must they nurture 
and care for their children in an emotional sense, they must also 
bear the responsibility of supporting their families financially.
<P>
	Today I would like to recognize one particular single mother 
who has accomplished both tasks. When my niece became a 
single mother she decided she was going to take responsibility 
for her child. As hard as it was, she found a job and is raising her 
child to be a responsible young person, active in sports and 
school. She receives moral support from her immediate and 
extended family but still values her independence.
<P>
	I would like to commend her and other single parents today.

<P>
	Thanks to the efforts of Irene Martin and the late Marjorie 
Mann, June 21 has been declared Laughter Day in 
Ottawa-Carleton. They are encouraging Parliament to 
proclaim this date as National Laughter Day.
<P>
	Laughter tends to bring us together as a community and as a 
country. Laughter serves as a valuable coping mechanism and 
has many physical, psychological and social benefits. 
Sometimes Canadians need a shot in the arm to help them deal 
with the realities and uncertainties of job loss, high 
unemployment or just making ends meet. It is a well-known fact 
in the health care field that  laughter helps dissipate fears, 
frustrations and anger. It helps people regain the health and 
energy they need to keep on fighting.

the House of Commons to join us in celebrating Laughter Day. 
Let us all have a good laugh today.

Bid Committee in Winnipeg to host the 1999 Pan-American 
Games.
<P>
	Since Winnipeg was chosen as the Canadian bid city for the 
1999 Pan-Am Games the government of Canada and its 
partners, the province of Manitoba and the city of Winnipeg, 
have supported the bid both technically and financially. There 
has been tremendous community support for the hard working 
committee. This will ensure the setting of a standard of 
excellence and a very high profile for the Pan-Am Games both 
in Canada and abroad.
<P>
	In this bid Winnipeg has also pledged to strive for new heights 
of excellence in sports and culture while forging a new spirit of 
international understanding helping to ensure a bright future for

<P>
	I am appealing today to all Quebec and Canadian 
entrepreneurs who, as our economic leaders, have a social 
responsibility to provide jobs to a young, hard-working labour 
force eager to learn. Because they are motivated, student 
workers can substitute for vacationing employees, lend a hand

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

control in 1978 the annual homicide rate in my home province of 
Saskatchewan has averaged three per 100,000, the same as in 
adjoining Montana where there are almost no firearms 
restrictions. Economic and social conditions are parallel and so 
are the murder rates.
<P>
	On the other hand, since prohibition days New York state has 
had the toughest North American gun laws outside of Mexico, 
yet the murder rate there is five times higher than in Canada. I do 
not know why, but I suspect the presence of organized crime, 
widespread drug abuse, racial tension and grinding poverty just 
might have something to do with it.
<P>
	Instead of concentrating on the emotional rantings of the 
Coalition for Gun Control, the Minister of Justice should inform 
himself by comparing firearms legislation and crime statistics 
in a wide variety of jurisdictions. Prejudice makes bad law.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, government 
programs and policies should help preserve and strengthen 
traditional families. Families are the basic unit of society. A 
strong family life is important to instilling good moral values 
and coping with the day to day pressures of living.
<P>
	When I speak about traditional family values I do not 
disparage the loving and often heroic efforts of single or 
divorced parents. Nothing determines the shape of a child's life 
more powerfully than his or her values, beliefs and sense of right 
and wrong. It is the values parents teach their children that will 
determine a child's fate and  our country's future. Families are 
the instrument through which values and traditions are passed 
from generation to generation.
<P>
	As we celebrate the International Year of the Family let us all 
remember that it is up to each member of Parliament to fight for 
measures that recognize, promote and protect this traditional 
institution.

the Prime Minister have the nerve today to maintain the GST by 
hiding it and moreover how can he consider extending it to 
medicine, health care and food?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the commitments we made in the red book remain our 
commitments as a government. We asked a committee of the 
House of Commons with representatives from the three parties 
to try to come up with a unanimous proposal for us and they 
could not agree. The Liberal members on the committee 
considered four or five different proposals for us; they chose one 
which is not at all binding on the government. But I would like to 
thank all members who worked on that committee because their 
work will help us see the issue a little more clearly.
<P>
	In any case, I repeat that our commitment remains clear, and I 
would like to let the Leader of the Opposition know that on April 
10, 1990, he voted for the GST and when he resigned on May 22 
that year, he assured everyone in the Conservative Party that he 
would continue to defend the policies which he had the privilege 
to work on with them.
<P>
	We received the committee report, but we say that the GST 
must be replaced by another tax, and we clearly showed in the 
red book the conditions which must be met to satisfy us.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the Prime Minister's answer and 
he suggests that his government might dissociate itself from the 
conclusions reached by the members of the Liberal Party on the 
committee. I will point out that the only members on that 
committee who proposed maintaining the GST, hiding it and 
extending it to other sectors such as medicine, for example, are 
Liberals.
<P>
	So I ask the Prime Minister if it is true that he does not intend 
to apply the GST to medicine, health care and food. If that is not 
his intention, he is in the House today. He should tell us, in front 
of all of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are committed to consulting the provinces and trying to 
harmonize taxes with them. I see that the Leader of the 
Opposition wants me to give him a final answer without 
consulting anyone at the provincial level. He should make up his 
mind. Either he wants us to do in all circumstances, as was the 
case last week, when we were asked to impose a solution 
concerning interprovincial trade on all provinces and we said, 
``No, we are taking the time to consult on taxes. We want to 
harmonize the tax system''. I myself talked about it with the 
Premiers last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5657"> 5657 </A></B>
<P>
December. Everyone wants harmonization. We are unable to 
give a final answer. If  we did, we would not be a good federal 
government that likes to consult the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is laughable to hear this government which 
continually repudiates the will of the provinces tell us today that 
it wants to hide behind them to do something awful, to tax 
medicine, health care and food.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if he realizes that a hidden GST 
extended to medicine, food and health care can only result in a 
greater tax burden for low- and middle-income families and for 
the elderly. How can the Prime Minister today support the idea 
of taxing such essential goods? What has happened to Liberal 
convictions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we were very clear in the red book. We said that the system was 
not functioning well. We forgot to mention in the red book that 
the Leader of the Opposition voted for the GST. We also forgot 
to mention in the red book that he promised very solemnly to the 
Tory Party at that time that he would defend the GST when he 
got out.
<P>
	I just want to say that we will consult with the provinces. The 
Minister of Finance will have his budget next February. We have 
a lot of time. We will not get excited. We will take all the time to 
consult with the provinces to find a good solution.
<P>
	I am still amazed that the Leader of the Opposition is always 
trying to get at me because I am too nice with the provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
even the Conservatives did not dare to tax food, health care or 
medicine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> That is true, not even the Conservatives!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Liberal report on the GST 
proposes merging all provincial and federal consumption taxes 
into a single Canada-wide GST applied on a single tax base and 
managed by the federal government. Several provincial 
Premiers have already indicated that this centralizing proposal 
is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Given the rejection expressed by several provinces, including 
Ontario and Manitoba, does the Prime Minister not realize that 
his government's plan to integrate provincial sales taxes into the 
new hidden GST in an underhanded way is going to fail?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have not made any proposal to the provinces yet. So it is a 
<P>
little premature for the hon. member to conclude that they will 
reject our proposals. We had a committee which considered 
several proposals over a six-month period.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	At least on the Liberal side, they had the wisdom to offer us 
four or five options, unlike Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party 
members who took the easy way out by washing their hands of 
the whole thing. After asking us for so long to establish 
committees before making decision, when we gave them that 
chance, they ran away because they were afraid of taking 
responsibilities.
<P>
	We, however, are not afraid of doing our job. We will meet 
with provincial governments and make them proposals that we 
hope they will find helpful, that will eliminate duplication-one 
of the Bloc Quebecois's favourite words. We will try to simplify 
the system and trust that eventually good judgment and common 
sense will prevail on this side and in the provinces, but certainly 
not in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois's solution is simple: the Prime Minister 
should keep his word and abolish the GST.
<P>
	Given the general indignation of the people, who feel 
deceived by the Liberal government, and the flat rejection by 
several provinces of this centralizing takeover, does the Prime 
Minister still intend to negotiate with the provinces on the basis 
of the Liberal report of the Standing Committee on Finance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are going to study this report and see with the provinces how 
we could proceed to find a better solution for all Canadians.
<P>
	We intend to be very honest with the people and with them, 
unlike the hon. member for Gaspé who, on June 9, asked the 
Speaker of the House to help them hide their true political option 
by asking the Speaker to the use of the word ``separatist'' in this 
House, which is the true option of the members. They are 
ashamed of their choice.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The stock market index is down by 2 per cent as of noon today. 
At two o'clock the bank rate was raised to over 7 per cent and the 
long term bond rate is now almost 3 percentage points above that 
assumed in the budget documents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5658"> 5658 </A></B>
<P>
	This implies that lenders and investors continue to lose 
confidence in the government's ability to meet its deficit cutting 
projections.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister now not agree with his finance 
minister that further spending reductions beyond those 
contained in the budget are necessary to meet the government's 
deficit reduction targets?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no disagreement between the Minister of Finance and 
me.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance was so prudent in his projections that 
he predicted 3 per cent growth and apparently we will have much 
more than that. The Minister of National Revenue is telling us 
that the revenues coming into the coffers are better than 
predicted.
<P>
	Of course we have to pay more for interest rates. That is a fact. 
I recognize that. I hope the people of Quebec, when they have 
occasion to vote in the next few months in the election, will 
recognize that these people in front of us and the Parti 
Quebecois are trying to destroy the country. There is a price to 
pay for that.
<P>
	If Mr. Johnston were to win the election, interest rates would 
go down. If Mr. Parizeau were to win the election, unfortunately 
we would have to pay a bigger price for the irresponsibility of 
the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the money markets say there are two sources of uncertainty with 
respect to Canada. One is of course the constitutional question, 
but the other is the overspending and deficit of the government, 
the one that the government can do something about.
<P>
	An interest rate on government bonds of 2 per cent above the 
rate assumed in the budget implies a deficit increase of $3.4 
billion in the first year and $5 billion in the second year 
according to the government's own projections. There is nothing 
wrong with changing a battle plan that is not working. Will the 
Prime Minister now order a mini budget containing deeper 
spending cuts and that it be brought down before the fiscal 
situation gets worse?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this party has clearly made a commitment to the Canadian 
people that we will try to reduce the deficit in relation to the 
GNP to 3 per cent by the end of the third year. We are reviewing 
that on a constant basis. We will do what is needed to achieve 
this goal.
<P>
	This is not the time to panic. We have more people working in 
Canada, there is revenue coming in and growth will be higher. 
We have a problem with the level of interest rates, but as I said in 
two, three or four months from now the problem will be easily 
solved if the people of Quebec decide not to vote for the Parti 
Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
defending the status quo, whether it is federalism or the fiscal 
situation, will not reduce the deficit. If the government intends 
to meet its deficit targets it has one of two choices. Either it cuts 
spending more deeply or it increases revenue through tax 
increases.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if he is clearly prepared to make 
additional spending reductions to control the deficit and does 
this mean that the government is considering additional tax 
increases as the only other way of meeting those targets?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we said that we will do everything that is needed to meet our 
goal of 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the third year.
<P>
	At this moment I will not take the advice of the leader of the 
Reform Party to start talking about the Constitution. It is not the 
way to bring stability to the land. What will resolve the problem 
in this country is for people to realize that we live in a very good 
country and that we can be prosperous. We are still the envy of 
the world. A month ago the United Nations said that Canada was 
number one. Why is the hon. member complaining?

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, in its 
report, the Liberal majority on the finance committee 
recommended full integration of provincial sales taxes with the 
Liberals' hidden GST, in order to have just one national tax from 
coast to coast. This proposal would oblige the provinces to 
comply with federal legislation that would determine 
administrative procedures and the range of goods subject to 
GST.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Does he 
support the approach recommended by the report, which bodes 
ill for the autonomy of the provinces since fiscal policy would, 
from now on, be dictated by Ottawa, thus relegating the 
provinces and Quebec, at best, to the role of branch manager for 
the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, from what we have 
heard publicly from the vast majority of Quebecers, including 
consumers and the business community, it is clear that they want 
a harmonized tax. For instance, the Metropolitan Montreal 
Chamber of Commerce and also the Quebec Chamber of 
Commerce have already come out in favour of the harmonized 
tax, as has the Conseil du patronat. My question is this: Why is 
the Bloc

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Minister of Finance agree that the Liberals' hidden GST would 
oblige Quebec to relinquish control over the $5.7 billion it raises 
in retail sales tax and that consequently, this is a direct attack on 
the fiscal autonomy of the provinces, as was stated by the 
Quebec Minister of Finance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would just like to 
quote what was said by a Quebecer who testified when the hon.

harmonized with provincial sales tax. The Association 
manufacturière du Québec is ready to work with the finance 
committee to identify the potential measures which could lead 
to greater harmonization. Once those measures are identified, 
we will be willing to make the necessary representations to the 
Government of Quebec''. This was said by Richard Le Hir,

to the Deputy Prime Minister. Yesterday the Deputy Prime 
Minister confirmed that her government would kill the GST and 
that the Prime Minister would live up to this promise. On 
October 18, 1993 the Deputy Prime Minister in a CBC town hall 
stated that if the GST was not abolished under a Liberal 
government she would resign.
<P>
	If during the next year Canadians deem that the national value 
added tax, that very awful tax, the new GST, is just the son of the 
old GST under a new name and therefore not really abolished, 
will she still agree to resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will use all the means necessary to keep the Deputy Prime 
Minister in the House of Commons. Otherwise the spirit of this 
House would disappear.
<P>
	I am very surprised to have a question from a party that some 
months before the election was strongly opposed to the GST and 
then made a fabulous flip-flop before the campaign to support 
it. Don't complain. We won't satisfy you, we won't keep it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
complain. I want to know if the Deputy Prime Minister would 
resign. Why does the Prime Minister stand up on her behalf? She 
should answer the question.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, listen to these quick quotes: ``I would abolish the 
GST'', the finance minister, 1990. ``I hate it and I will kill it'', 
the Prime Minister, 1994. ``The tax should hit the whole works, 
from food to pharmaceuticals'', the Minister for International 
Trade, 1989.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister think that Canadians will be 
that gullible as to believe this new GST really kills and abolishes 
the old GST? If she would not mind, would she answer the first 
question as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can answer one question. 
When I made the statement on the CBC that I would resign if 
ever we did not live up to our promises, I made that statement in 
the full confidence that there is one person in this House who 
will not go back on his word and that is the Prime Minister of 
Canada.

of experts who will look into the effects of packaging on tobacco 
sales, especially tobacco sales to young people. They will then

to operate in, organizations delivering settlement and language 
training to immigrants were advised that only mandatory 
benefits such as CPP and UI would be able to be recovered.

<P>
	As a result of these new guidelines the Vancouver college 
refused to enter into negotiations despite the fact that eight other 
major colleges in British Columbia providing the same services 
have entered into a successful agreement.
<P>
	The cost for the fringe benefits that the Vancouver college 
would like us to reimburse amounts to almost $2 million

considerable size.

For example, a convicted serial rapist like Larry Fisher could 
still complete his sentence and be eligible for release even 
though experts say it is likely he will reoffend.
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General please explain how his proposed 
amendments to the parole act will protect society from a person 
like Larry Fisher?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate my hon. friend's support for these proposals which I 
understood he expressed outside the House. I hope he will 
continue that support.
<P>
	With respect to Larry Fisher, this individual completed the 
sentence imposed by the court and therefore we would need a 
different kind of legislation to deal with that kind of situation. It 
is something that is being looked into by a federal-provincial 
task force.
<P>
	Once the task force reports in a few months the Minister of 
Justice and I will develop proposals to deal with this kind of 
situation. It is troubling and we do not intend to ignore the need 
to take action about it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree it 
is troubling and Larry Fisher is not an isolated case.
<P>
	For example, there are convicted paedophiles in our prisons 
who the experts say can never be healed. Mr. Galienne is one of 
the examples of this type of prisoner. He is due to be released in 
October. The Solicitor General's proposals will have zero 
influence on Galienne's case.
<P>
	Regardless of all the ridiculous remarks it is very important 
that the safety of Canadians is considered. Will the Solicitor 
General admit that the proposals he has brought forward will not 
affect people like Galienne one bit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the </B><B>House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the proposals that I tabled today are designed to deal with people 
before the end of their sentence primarily and the situation 
which he has raised has already been recognized by the Minister 
of Justice and me.
<P>
	We intend to have measures to deal with that in light of 
federal-provincial task force reports because we believe to deal 
with the situation effectively we need to have the involvement 
and co-operation of the provinces.
<P>
	I look forward to the hon. member's support for our further 
proposals, just as he is supporting the proposals we tabled today.

my question is for the minister of indian affairs. After having 
made the acquisition of land located south of highway 344 a

the so-called ``forgotten of Oka''.

<P>
	I met with the delegation from 344 outside the House of 
Commons with members from the Bloc. They are satisfied that 
the obligation went through committee, through cabinet and our

willing seller, willing buyer.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> I have a 
supplementary, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister recognize that it 
is high time to do justice to these people who are exasperated, 
and rightly so, by four years of government carelessness and 
promise that formal negotiations in relation to the purchase of 
their properties will start no later than July 1?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

government inherited from a former government which that 
leader was in.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In the Young Offenders Act there is a preamble which has a 
list of things that is a guide for its operation. Some of these are 
that young people must be held accountable, society must be 
protected, young persons need guidance and assistance, a focus 
on offenders needs. The minister has now admitted the preamble 
is not sufficient.
<P>
	Why is the term victims not mentioned in the preamble of the 
current act when victims' concerns should also be a guiding 
factor in the operation of the Young Offenders Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the preamble to the Young 
Offenders Act speaks at length and in more than one place about 
the protection of the public, the protection of society.
<P>
	The amendments that we introduced two weeks ago in Bill 
C-37 strengthened the Young Offenders Act in a variety of 
ways, among others by making it plain that from now on after 
the enactment of Bill C-37 victim impact statements can be 
received at the time of the sentencing of young offenders.
<P>
	This government believes that with those changes and with 
other changes we proposed in Bill C-37, we have strengthened 
the Young Offenders Act so that it is very much operating in the 
interest of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a supplementary, will the minister take action and 
change his policy to spell out in the Young Offenders Act 
preamble that where the rights and needs of the victims conflict 
or need to be balanced with those of the young offender, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5663"> 5663 </A></B>
<P>
concerns of the victim will be paramount and be clearly written 
as a principle in law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the view of this 
government the amendments that we proposed in Bill C-37 will 
strengthen the Young Offenders Act and, as amended, it will 
serve as a workable and ideal juvenile justice system for 
Canada.

<P>
	The overview of the Canada-Ontario infrastructure

this House nears summer recess I am happy to bring more good

<P>
	On the national infrastructure program, we have reached the 
$2.3 billion mark and by the end of this month we will have 
reached the half-way point of the $6 billion program that we 
initiated just some seven and one half months ago.
<P>
	I was asked about jobs. To date we have created over 36,000 
jobs, over 2,300 of those being long term. We are well on the 
path toward the 90,000 jobs that I have announced to this House 
before that we would be creating in this program.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
in this House, the Minister of Indian Affairs recognized the 
problem of band councils overestimating Native populations. 
These figures are then used to set the amount of federal 
subsidies. According to <I>La Presse</I>, this overestimation may cost 
over $1.2 billion in expenditures for non-existent Natives.
<P>
	My question to the minister is this: Given the drastic state of 
the federal government's finances, does the Minister of Indian 
Affairs undertake today to ensure that Statistics Canada census 
takers will have access to aboriginal lands so that these 
populations can be counted accurately?

fishing vessels accompanied by a 150-foot American coast 
guard cutter conducted a black cod fishery while 15 miles south 
of the Canada-U.S. border between Alaska and British

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr.

<P>
	The member knows it is not unusual over the years that both 
Canadian and American vessels are in this disputed zone and 
that each nation conducts its fishery and enforces its own fishery 
in this disputed zone.
<P>
	The question is being asked in a manner that would suggest 
that somehow there is something unusual or something that is

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Vegreville has 10 
minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, before the 
break I was debating Bill C-32 and I was talking about the fact 
that this bill will encourage young people to smoke by making 
tobacco products more affordable to them.
<P>
	I discussed my own experience in that regard, but I will also 
quote Professor Robert C. Allen, a visiting professor from 
Harvard University. It was noted how the decrease in tobacco 
taxes will directly impact on increasing the number of people, 
including young people, who take up smoking. He stated that 
tobacco consumption would increase by 14 per cent. Teens, 
being about two and a half times as price sensitive on this issue, 
would increase their consumption of cigarettes by about 35 per 
cent. All of this is because of the reduction in tobacco taxes. 
Even the money being used from the surtax will do little to 
discourage 175,000 young people from smoking. The use of 
tobacco and the hazards of second hand smoke are well known 
and documented.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	One main concern I have, like many of my constituents, is the 
effect this legislation will have on our health care system. 
Another major consideration is the toll the legislation will have 
on human lives as increased consumption leads to further health 
complications.
<P>
	I am not going to talk at any length about the personal 
tragedies caused by increased disease due to smoking. We all 
understand that so I will not discuss it today. However I would 
like to talk about the less direct human toll which will be 
brought about as a result of this tax.
<P>
	Reformers support decreasing overall taxes, but we have to 
question whether this bill will do that at all. Does this bill 
decrease tax? I say it does not. A select group may be paying 
lower taxes to start off with, but all Canadian taxpayers will end 
up paying more money in the future because of the increased 
health care costs associated with smoking. It will require 
increased taxes to pay this additional cost brought about by 
increased smoking and the increased health hazards that result.
<P>
	Professor Robert C. Allen notes that further proposed 
reductions in tobacco taxation will have a devastating impact on 
the health of Canadians since they will significantly expand 
tobacco consumption. He also states that lowering cigarette 
taxes would lead to large increases in cigarette consumption 
with significantly higher levels of death from tobacco related 
diseases. Professor Allen is backing up what I said and what 
many have said before  me. Therefore the health expenditure 
would rise sharply and tax receipts would drop.
<P>
	Have the long term costs of our health care system been 
considered properly by the government in this legislation? I say 
the answer is no.
<P>
	Extra costs to health care resulting from increased smoking 
and related disease have not been properly considered, as I 
discussed earlier and reductions in the much needed health 
services, including elective surgery, will be put under further 
stress as a result of this further spending on this group who need 
additional services because of smoking related health problems.
<P>
	I am saying that because of these increased smoking related 
health problems and costs there will be less money available for 
elective surgery. I am sure all of us know already the problems 
that we have in receiving elective surgery on time. This will 
further complicate that problem.
<P>
	Even if the government does down the road, as I hope it will, 
decide to bring increased efficiency into our health care system, 
thus reducing the cost of delivering our system as it is today, we 
also need to bring the cost of health care to a reasonable level. 
We must, in any way we can, reduce unnecessary disease such as 
that brought about by cigarette smoking.
<P>
	The next point I would like to discuss is the timing of reducing 
tobacco taxes. I think it is impeccably bad. I believe I will put 
this point off until a little bit later and if I do not have time to 
come back to the point I am sure my colleagues will question me 
on the issue of timing.
<P>
	For the past four months my constituents have told me, in no 
uncertain terms, that they do not support the government in 
reducing this tobacco tax. This Liberal government told us 
during the campaign and has told us since that it is determined to 
listen to the will of Canadians. The Liberals said they would be 
more democratic, they would be more responsive to the wishes 
of Canadians. We have heard that again and again. The action 
the government has taken on this issue indicates that it is just 
talk. It is just hot air. The government is not willing to listen to 
Canadians. I have heard from MPs across the country that their 
constituents do not support the government on this issue of 
lowering tobacco taxes. The government may pay lip service to 
consulting with Canadians, but once again the action does not 
match the lip service.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I would like to present what has become a Reform tradition; 
that is, when Reformers criticize the views or legislation 
presented before the House, they present constructive 
alternatives. Today I will do that in regard to the tobacco tax 
issue.
<P>
	It is important to examine whether there are other ways to 
combat this problem of smuggling other than reduction of 
tobacco taxes. Unfortunately Bill C-32 is just  another example 
of the government avoiding the real problem and refusing to 
face it head on.
<P>
	Real solutions can come only if the problem has been clearly 
identified and then dealt with in a straightforward manner. I 
believe that by caving in on the issue of cigarette smuggling and 
the problem it has caused and will continue to cause, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5667"> 5667 </A></B>
<P>
government has taken the easy way out. The government did not 
have any difficulty identifying the fact that smuggling was the 
problem, and I give it credit for that. It seems to have difficulty 
coming up with a common sense solution.
<P>
	A more rigorous attempt at enforcing our laws should have 
been the first action undertaken by the government. Smuggling 
is a crime and those involved must be dealt with accordingly. 
Criminals should be treated like criminals regardless of race, 
colour, gender, religion or geographic location. If rigorous law 
enforcement meant going on the reserves where over 70 per cent 
of the smuggling took place, according to RCMP figures, this 
action should have been taken.
<P>
	Was the government so intimidated by past events such as the 
Oka crisis-I admit a very scary, undesirable situation-that it 
backed down on enforcing the law? It is a question I would like 
the members opposite to ask and answer of themselves. If this is 
true it sets a very dangerous precedent on how we deal with 
crime. We have seen a similar process of dealing with crime in 
regard to the Young Offenders Act and gun control.
<P>
	On the Young Offenders Act, was direct straightforward open 
action taken to help solve the problem? From the legislation we 
have just seen presented to the House, direct action was not 
taken.
<P>
	On gun control, the Minister of Justice has shown again and 
again that the approach he will take is not the direct common 
sense approach, but rather is a roundabout approach, that of 
restricting guns and the use of guns, to no avail. No direct action 
is taken which really deals with the problem.
<P>
	A further effect of this legislation is that it creates inequity 
from province to province. The prices for tobacco are now vastly 
different from province to province. I recognize there are other 
tax provisions that combat interprovincial smuggling. What if it 
gets out of hand, as did the cross-border smuggling between 
Canada and the U.S.?
<P>
	I believe that will happen, and I have heard members of the 
House comment, hopefully in jest, that they should take a box of 
cigarettes back to Alberta or Saskatchewan or B.C. with them 
because there is good money to be made in smuggling between 
the provinces now. It is absurd way to deal with the problem. 
What happened to the direct common sense approach?
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	My home province of Alberta has never before experienced a 
smuggling problem, at least until now, but I do believe that is 
what will happen with this bill.  Reducing the tobacco taxes in 
some provinces but not in others will lead to smuggling between 
provinces at an ever increasing rate. It certainly will lead to 
substantial smuggling into Alberta.
<P>
	In defending Bill C-32 this morning the hon. Secretary of 
State for International Financial Institutions stated that the 
smuggling problem was undermining the government's health 
plan. Let us look at the logic of that statement. Let us follow the 
path of logic through.
<P>
	Smuggling led to a lower price per package of cigarettes and 
therefore people were buying more. Because people were 
buying more, this increased the costs incurred by Canadian 
health care because of the health risks associated with smoking. 
What was the government's solution? It lowered the tax on 
cigarettes.
<P>
	This resulted in a lower price for cigarettes making them more 
affordable for everyone, not just those who were buying 
smuggled cigarettes. Does any member in this House buy that as 
a path of logic? I think not. This further undermines the 
government's own health plan in Canada. The government has 
legalized the demise of its own health plan. Nothing is 
accomplished by this legislation.
<P>
	In conclusion, this keep the peace style of government has not 
worked in the past and will not work in the future. It is time for 
the government to stop shirking its responsibility in dealing 
with this problem and to show some leadership. That is what 
Canadians want. If the government is not prepared to do that 
then I want to assure members in this House that Reformers 
certainly are prepared to do so and we will if government does 
not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the debate and some of the concerns which have 
been expressed, I am now aware that there are at least three 
states which have higher taxes on cigarettes than the 
neighbouring provinces in Canada.
<P>
	Could the member comment a little bit on the taxes in the 
United States, the direction they are heading and whether we 
could co-operate with them in that respect. It is a key issue. I do 
not know if we can solve this problem by ourselves. We are 
looking at it in this light and is something which needs to be 
discussed. We need to co-operate with the authorities and attack 
the problem in this way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do agree the timing of this bill 
could not be worse. Just to back this up I would like to read a 
very short piece from yesterday's <I>Financial Post</I>. The title is: 
``The Sky is the Limit for Tobacco Tax in the U.S.''. The article 
lays out very briefly that in the U.S. some experts believe that 
tobacco taxes will increase substantially and they will be used to 
fund the new health care plan which is being talked about in the 
U.S.
<P>
	I will read this very short article: ``Canada may have learned a 
lesson about the dangers of overtaxing cigarettes, but it has not 
filtered through to the U.S.''. No pun intended. ``As Congress 
and the White House  crank up the campaign for a national 
health care program, tobacco taxes have emerged as everyone's 
favourite way to pay for it. The only dispute is over how high to 
raise them. Sam Gibbons, who took over as chairman of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5668"> 5668 </A></B>
<P>
House Ways and Means committee when Dan Rostenkowski was 
hit with 17 corruption counts, has proposed a 45 cent U.S. 
increase, raising the total price to $1.69 U.S. a pack. President 
Bill Clinton suggested 75 cents U.S. while Senator Edward 
Kennedy, who chairs the Senate Labour and Human Resources 
Committee, wants a $1.50 U.S. increase per pack of cigarettes''.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	There it is. At a time when we are reducing our price per 
package of cigarettes the Americans are talking about 
increasing the cost and the sky is the limit, as the article said. 
This article was in the Washington Notebook column by Kelly 
McParland. It is a very interesting little section and I encourage 
members to read it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to my colleague's presentation.
<P>
	My question is with respect to the statistics on the increase in 
cigarette smoking due to the reduction in the price which in turn 
was due to the reduction in the taxes. There are some who hold 
that this merely reflects the increase in the number of people 
who are now buying cigarettes legally who before were buying 
them on the black market.
<P>
	Does the member have any statistics on that and if so, how 
were they derived?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, the exact statistics have escaped 
me. I did read statistics and they were presented in the House 
earlier. There is no doubt that statistics have shown very clearly 
that the consumption of cigarettes has increased due to this 
reduction in cost which was brought about by the lowering of the 
tax on cigarettes. I cannot quote the exact figure but I am sure 
one of my hon. colleagues will use it in a presentation later. 
However, there is no doubt about the impact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard some 
comment about division in various caucuses on this bill. I 
wonder if there was a vote taken in this caucus and one member 
voted against the caucus. Can the hon. member comment about 
what would happen to that member? Also, if there were 
dissenting votes from the other side and a vote came of dissent, 
what would happen to members if they voted against their 
caucus on such an issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course the hon. member knows 
there was a vote cast against caucus. That is not unusual in our 
caucus. Members are free to vote and are expected to vote for 
what their constituents want. That happens commonly. It is 
extremely common to have people voting differently on various 
pieces of legislation. It is probably as common in other caucuses 
as it is in ours.
<P>
	Of course in our caucus we do propose free votes when it 
comes to voting in the House on certain issues. Certainly we 
propose always and it is the requirement and responsibility of all 
members of the Reform caucus to vote according to their 
constituents wishes. Even if the caucus takes a position and 
members have gone to their constituents through formal 
mechanisms and not just talking about them and have clearly 
ascertained that their constituents want them to vote a different 
way than caucus votes in general, then it is the obligation and 
not just the right of that member to vote in that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill is 
very interesting as has been discussed previously. It actually 
combines or marries three different things the House has been 
working on.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	As a new parliamentarian I find an omnibus bill, which is the 
description of this kind of bill, to be quite interesting. It begs the 
question does the government really expect there to be some 
debate, some pros and some cons? This bill covers the area of a 
second section of tobacco taxes. It also covers the Air 
Transportation Act and the reduction of the GST for business 
meal exemption.
<P>
	How does the government actually expect a party or even an 
individual member to be able to intelligently vote yea or nay 
when such totally unrelated fragments are pulled together in one 
bill? Or does the government actually have the idea that because 
it has 177 members it is going to get its own way anyway? Has 
the government pulled it all into one bill with the expectation 
that the people in its caucus, once the Prime Minister or the 
Deputy Prime Minister has risen to lead the way, will follow like 
sheep? It really begs the question as to why these would have 
been put together in one bill.
<P>
	I intend to spend most of my time speaking on the air 
transportation tax changes, but I would like to address the issue 
of tobacco taxes. The majority of our caucus is opposed to the 
reduction of the excise tax on tobacco products. The majority 
believes it encourages more people, particularly young people, 
to smoke.
<P>
	Having been in the field of sales and marketing for an 
extended period of my life, I appreciate there is always the law 
of supply and demand that is intervened with by the actual price 
point of a given commodity. If the situation is that prices for 
cigarettes are going to be lowered, it goes without saying that 
consumption will undoubtedly increase. Furthermore, my 
understanding is that studies have shown that young people are 
most sensitive to this price point.
<P>
	The second factor is that the long term health costs for 
Canadians have not been calculated. With the tremendous 
amount of legislation which is currently coming before the 
House, this statement could be applied to probably the vast 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5669"> 5669 </A></B>
<P>
majority of the legislation. In fact, there is no costing before the 
legislation comes before the House.
<P>
	What will the cost be to the Canadian people? This is a very 
real part of the reason that when the federal, provincial and 
municipal debts are combined, we in Canada are in debt at a rate 
of over $1 trillion. It is because governments simply do not do 
the costing.
<P>
	What will the health care costs be for Canada and for 
Canadians if there is an increase in consumption?
<P>
	There has been a lot of debate today about the issue of more 
aggressive enforcement. Looking at the situation as it was prior 
to the decision of the government to lower the taxes, it is clear 
that the government was shying away from certain areas of our 
country and not addressing the issue.
<P>
	If the government was attempting to address the issue, how 
hard did it try particularly when one area of our country was 
identified as having a 70 per cent hold? Of all of the product 
coming into Canada, 70 per cent was coming in through one very 
small geographic area, yet the government would not address 
the smuggling in that area.
<P>
	Another reason the majority of our caucus is opposed to the 
reduction of the excise tax is it is believed there should have 
been new export taxes on tobacco products. I believe it was 
during the debate on Bill C-11 when I brought to this House two 
clearly marked Export A cigarette packages.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Both packages had been purchased in Manitoba. One package 
had been purchased immediately prior to the imminent 
imposition of the export tax. It was identified as having been 
made in Canada. It was the green package with white lettering 
that said ``Export A'' and ``made in Canada'' and very proud of 
the whole issue. That was fine. The second package was 
purchased a week later from the same illegal vendor. It was 
clearly marked as having been manufactured in Winston Salem 
under licence by RJR MacDonald.
<P>
	The point of export taxes with respect to this product is that 
they will not work. Clearly that particular company's product 
was going through Buffalo and back into Canada. It had decided 
that if there was to be an export tax put on it would simply go to a 
licensing arrangement whereby it would have its product 
manufactured in Winston Salem and still be in the marketplace. 
I seriously question whether export taxes or even the imposition 
of export taxes as they presently sit really make any difference.
<P>
	The final point is that constituents in the west are opposed to 
the tax reduction. Some feel they are being treated as second 
class citizens because their provinces oppose the reduction of 
taxes. Obviously what we have done is change the situation so 
that instead of north-south smuggling now we have east-west 
smuggling.
<P>
	It begs the question that I raised earlier when the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca was speaking. Does it really make 
sense? Is it really proper if we walk away from principles when 
it comes to laws, if we walk away from the foundation stone of 
how laws are brought in, the background to the laws? Is that 
really right and proper?
<P>
	In other words taxes on cigarettes have basically happened. 
Over a period of time they simply have happened in exactly the 
same way as taxes on alcohol and other commodities people 
want and will pay for. Successively over the last 25 or perhaps 
even 50 years governments have said that people want or are 
addicted to cigarettes, that people want or demand their alcohol 
or whatever the case may be, and that therefore they are a source 
of taxation.
<P>
	Over a period of many years-some 25, 30 or 50 years-taxes 
have happened. They have been added on and on until we 
suddenly reached the point with a slightly higher degree of 
sophistication of taking a look and saying that prices were so 
high on this particular commodity we had dampened 
enthusiasm, particularly of young people, for the product. Now 
we get into the whole issue we described earlier: If we reduce 
taxes will we actually end up increasing consumption?
<P>
	The following question must be raised: If we are enacting 
good law and if as a member of Parliament I am expected to vote 
on various laws, am I actually voting on a matter of principle or 
a matter of expediency? To this extent, as I have expressed in a 
previous intervention, I find myself somewhat ambivalent about 
this specific question, fully recognizing that we have two 
doctors in our caucus who are very emotionally attached to the 
particular issue and the reality that if we end up lowering taxes 
we end up increasing consumption, particularly among young 
people, and recognizing that these people are faced with the 
reality that this is what will end up happening.
<P>
	On the other side of the coin what about the principle that is 
involved? By saying that the taxes should stay up are we actually 
attempting to legislate behaviour or influence behaviour in a 
way that is not correct and not based on the basis of principle?
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned our data indicates that 40 per cent of total 
production of Canadian companies was being exported before 
the changes. Only 3 per cent was being consumed abroad. This 
shows the extent of the smuggling and this law allows an 
exemption for the 3 per cent.
<P>
	The question I have is about the moral responsibility of 
tobacco companies. I am not speaking about tobacco farmers 
here because I recognize they are people who planted a crop in 
the ground, who have equipment and who have capital invested 
in various aspects of their business of growing tobacco. They are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5670"> 5670 </A></B>
<P>
caught in a real bind on the particular issue. However I would 
like to talk  particularly about the multinational companies and 
again reflect on what I was speaking about a few moments ago.
<P>
	These companies suspected an export tax was coming. With 
abject cynicism they turned around and took a package-and 
until one looked at it very closely one would not realize it-that 
had been manufactured in the U.S. I submit for the consideration 
of the House that it had been manufactured in the U.S. with the 
full knowledge of people in the tobacco companies that the 
package would end up being smuggled back into Canada. It 
would not only be smuggled back into Canada but smuggled in a 
way that was dangerous to life and limb.
<P>
	I appreciated the interjection of the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell this morning. If his constituents 
were literally being shot at as a result of the smuggling effort, if 
there was absolute lawlessness as a result of the smuggling 
effort, I can appreciate the emotion the member brought to the 
debate this morning. How much culpability or how much 
responsibility should there be on behalf of international 
corporations? I suggest a tremendous amount.
<P>
	The measure to ensure that unmarked tobacco products sold 
on reserves in Ontario and Nova Scotia are taxed at the same rate 
as marked products is a very touchy issue. I acknowledge that. 
When a commodity will be consumed by people, no matter what 
their distinction may be, when we have a two-tier tax system 
and when we have this situation, the difficulty is that it feeds the 
whole issue of illegal activity. That is really unfortunate.
<P>
	We also recognize that until the particular legislation is 
passed and enacted wholesalers and retailers will have difficulty 
in looking for $150 million in tobacco taxes that have previously 
been extracted in inventories when the changes were announced. 
We look forward to the legislation being able to go forward. It is 
just unfortunate that it was not prepared at the time Bill C-11 
was before the House. It would have saved the whole problem. 
The difficulty is that the government bunched together the 
tobacco tax question with the other two questions: the air 
transportation tax and the GST rebate.
<P>
	We are looking at the fact that there will be a health promotion 
surtax, an increase of 40 per cent on taxes paid on the profits of 
tobacco manufacturers. Surely we recognize in the same way as 
price is a factor in the consumption of tobacco products that 
advertising must be both a positive and negative factor with 
respect to the consumption of tobacco products.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The main topic I would like to address is that of the air 
transportation tax. There has been very little discussion about it 
as I have listened to the debate today. Perhaps I could give a 
little background and description about the air transportation 
tax.
<P>
	Currently there is a flat fee of $10 plus 7 per cent to a 
maximum of $40 on all airline tickets purchased in Canada. 
These fees are part of the Excise Tax Act even though they 
appear to be closer in function to user fees than actual taxes. 
This is the positive part. All revenues from the tax are directed 
toward the Department of Transport which routes the funds to 
the aviation component of its expenditures.
<P>
	The reason I pause to mention that I consider this to be 
positive is that frequently taxes extracted from businesses and 
individuals do not ever end up where they are supposed to go. 
They just end up in consolidated revenue. I encourage the 
government to take a look at this as a model. There is also a new 
model within the Department of Canadian Heritage under 
National Parks. The specific revenues it is taking in for 
campgrounds, for pools and for specific functions are paying for 
the functions from which the funds were originally extracted. 
Surely that is the way it should be.
<P>
	Going back to the air transportation tax, it makes up most of 
the funding for aviation services provided to all Canadian 
airports whether public or private. These services include air 
traffic controllers, aviation control for takeoff and landing, and 
air navigation costs. It is important to note that the current 
revenues from this tax of nearly $600 million do not cover the 
full government cost of aviation which runs at about $870 
million.
<P>
	Whether we are talking about airlines, aeroplane fees or the 
cost of running airports; whether we are talking about VIA rail 
and the cost of running trains down the track; or whether we are 
talking about transportation such as trucking where there are 
diesel fees and taxes on the fuel actually going into the trucks, 
historically in Canada we have shied away from making sure the 
revenue derived from the users of a particular transportation 
system ends up benefiting that transportation system.
<P>
	The trucks pay the diesel road tax. Interestingly, CP rail also 
pays for its diesel locomotives which, the last time I looked, are 
not using our highways. The CP Rail corporation has to pay for 
the maintenance of its track, its roadbed and all other 
infrastructure with respect to locomotives in spite of the fact 
that a component of the fuel tax pays for roads for its 
competitors, truckers. It is a bit of an anachronism and probably 
points out as well as anything the component I am speaking 
about, that users should pay for the service they are receiving.
<P>
	The air transportation tax will reduce the tax burden on short 
haul domestic and transborder flights by decreasing the flat 
charge per ticket and increasing the maximum fee. Living in 
Cranbrook I can appreciate many people take a look at whether 
they want to be going back and forth to Calgary by aeroplane or 
by road. Coming back to the factor we were just talking about, 
the costs of gasoline, fuel taxes, road maintenance and upkeep 
plus the time, I believe this will ultimately be of benefit. It will 
get more people off the road, through  Kootenay National Park 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5671"> 5671 </A></B>
<P>
and through the Crowsnest. Probably this will be duplicated in 
many areas throughout Canada.
<P>
	The flat fee is decreased to $6 and the maximum increased to 
$50.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	The changes will bring in an additional $24 million in 1994 
and $41 million in 1995. While this is an improvement for the 
reason that I just set out where one has short haul being more 
competitive price wise because the taxes on the short haul are 
going down, on the other side of the coin I submit to the 
government the fact that the changes are only going to be $24 
million and $41 million still leaves a significant shortfall in the 
concept of user pay.
<P>
	I believe this levy should not be part of our complicated tax 
system. It is beneficial that the funds do not go into general 
revenue and that they are spent specifically on aviation. I would 
encourage the government as it goes through more bills and 
motions and as it takes a look at the practices within the 
Department of Transport to take a look at the concept of 
changing the user fee to full cost recovery basis.
<P>
	I would suggest that in addition to air transportation tax, there 
are probably other areas in the cost of running airport terminals 
and being able to provide services to private pilots. We would be 
able to take a look at moving forward and getting closer to a user 
pay principle.
<P>
	The final section of this act has to do with GST changes for 
meal allowance. Having been a commercial traveller for a 
number of years, I recognize the chagrin that was faced by the 
small commercial traveller who suddenly was faced with the 
cost of being able to expense his meals and being able to get, for 
example, shop owners and people he was selling to out of their 
place of business into a neutral location and being able to talk to 
them. This was a tax increase to someone who earns their 
income by travelling, by working and selling with people.
<P>
	The Reform Party supported the changes when the budget 
came out on the basis that they amounted to a business subsidy. 
While we recognize that these expenses are legitimate business 
expenses for some, the reality is in the overall picture there was 
a tax break for a select few.
<P>
	As I just indicated with a tremendous amount of sympathy, to 
the people who are commercial travellers and business people 
who use the business expense deduction for meals, it was 
exceptionally unfortunate for them that they ended up caught in 
the squeeze between these two factors. However, overall we 
support that.
<P>
	On balance and in summary, I consider it exceptionally 
unfortunate that the government has chosen to cluster these 
three totally different and unrelated parts of our taxation system 
together. It is really unfortunate and I hope that in future the 
government will look with more favour to in this case bringing 
forward three separate bills so that we can vote on them 
separately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question. I was going to ask it a little later, however I appreciate 
the opportunity.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member who has just spoken to 
elaborate on how, had he been in government, rather than 
putting this bill forth as an omnibus bill, he would have broken it 
down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned at the outset, the 
difficulty is that when one combines the issue of tobacco taxes 
with airport tax, air transportation taxes and GST changes for 
meal allowance, it clearly is unworkable.
<P>
	The simple answer would be to have brought them forward as 
three totally separate bills so that they could have been handled 
and discussed with more intelligence.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The other factor I question is why the government would have 
chosen to pull C-32 with the tobacco taxes together with these at 
this time and why it would not have brought it forward at the 
same time when Bill C-11 was brought forward. Again, as 
memory serves, from Bill C-11 there were some aspects that 
were totally supportable but on the other side of the coin there 
were some serious problems and there was a balance. Had we the 
opportunity for the section on tobacco taxes of Bill C-32 being 
combined with Bill C-11, I believe this House would have been 
able to have much more intelligent deliberation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's remarks. One area 
he could perhaps provide a bit more insight into is the moral 
responsibility of the tobacco companies and of the international 
companies that are going to reap the rewards of an increased 
level of smoking in our population.
<P>
	I wonder if he has given any thought to how perhaps we could 
make the tobacco companies more accountable for the huge 
increases in our health care costs that are bound to come 
somewhere down the road so that they could pay their fair share 
since they are the ones reaping the rewards caused by this 
lowering of tobacco costs with the increase in the smoking 
population.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, in this instance we have spoken 
about the connection or the user pay principle. I am wondering if 
there is not something that we could be taking a look at with 
respect to a direct connection between their cost of doing 
business. In the same way that we have no deposit, no return, in 
other words a deposit system on bottles, cans or glasses, in the 
same way that we have been talking about user pay for air 
transportation tax, I am wondering if we could not be seriously 
taking a look at the connection between the taxes that we should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5672"> 5672 </A></B>
<P>
be levying on tobacco and see them as a specific piece of 
revenue that would be going toward health care costs.
<P>
	Additionally, one of the interesting things coming out around 
the world in all commodities, for example the forest product 
companies in Canada, is that there has been a glare of light in 
some of their practices that historically have been unacceptable 
and have actually been poor for our ecology. In the same way 
that there has been this glare of light suddenly these companies 
have taken on the responsibility of responsible sustainable 
forest practices. They are very proud to be able to show people 
in their communities and to put on demonstrations of how they 
are being responsible at this point.
<P>
	In addition to the actual financial suasion of a tax connection, 
such as I have just spoken about together with the moral suasion, 
that is, making them have more of a feeling and an 
acknowledgement of responsibility for what their product is 
doing within our community, that is part of the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief comment. I could speak to illicit some 
comment here as a proponent of the bill. Does my hon. colleague 
here really believe that our borders are such that we can keep a 
profitable small package such as cigarettes out of circulation?
<P>
	Further to that, without dropping taxes, would we not be using 
our policing resources to maintain an artificially high price in 
order to sustain smuggler profits?
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is part of the question that I 
posed at the outset and why I have clearly stated that I have no 
position, that I am ambivalent. There is a principle involved, the 
secondary principle that I did not speak to earlier which is the 
fact that we effectively were rewarding people for being 
involved. I am talking about ordinary citizens who were going 
out and purchasing the illegal cigarettes. We actually rewarded 
those people by taking taxes off. It seems to me that the principle 
is all wrong.
<P>
	Principle is one thing, but when I speak to doctors, nurses and 
medical practitioners and they tell me of the difficulties that this 
is going to create by not lowering the taxes I fully recognize that 
there is a physical reality here. I stand to be convinced but 
nonetheless I am taking a look at the fact that again we have 
combined the tobacco taxes with the air tax, with the GST rebate 
and we will be voting as best we can on what is a poorly cobbled 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I wonder if 
there would be unanimous consent to revert to the presentation 
of reports by committees. I have a report from the procedure and 
House affairs committee concerning the membership in 
committees. I consulted earlier and there would be consent to 
proceed with that now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, is that the procedure and 
House affairs report that we are looking at here? Is that the only 
one?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
I begin my discussion of Bill C-32 I would like to comment on 
the operation of our democratic system, the authority of 
Parliament to fully discuss legislation and the way that this bill 
is being moved so quickly through the House.
<P>
	The first reading of Bill C-32 occurred on May 27, a short 
time ago. As everyone in this House knows, this is a very 
complex bill of 62 pages, filled with highly technical 
information.
<P>
	The government should show respect for the role of 
opposition parties to study, analyse and prepare constructive 
criticism on such bills by allowing sufficient time for 
comprehensive review.
<P>
	This is particularly true when a great deal of new legislation, 
again much of it very lengthy and complex, is being introduced 
all at the same time toward the end of this session. I believe it 
does a disservice to our country, to this House and the members' 
roles in it to be dealing so quickly with some very important 
legislation and this is one example of that.
<P>
	By pushing debate ahead so quickly on this and other last 
minute legislation the government is disrepecting the spirit and 
purpose of our democratic institutions. Canadians deserve 
better than this. Canadians do not want to sacrifice principles, 
respect for democratic process and due process for the sake of 
expediency.
<P>
	Unfortunately this expediency has a severe cost in the case of 
Bill C-32. While Reform supports certain elements of this bill, 
such as some of the anti-smuggling initiatives, the air 
transportation tax changes and the meal allowance changes, 
there is much that is questionable about Bill C-32. It is a flawed 
piece of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5673"> 5673 </A></B>
<P>
legislation because it deals with the health of Canadians and in 
the view of many caves into the pressure of the tobacco lobby, 
discriminates against western provinces and can well contribute 
to interprovincial smuggling. These elements make it a bad bill, 
pure and simple.
<P>
	The first issue which I would like to speak to is the 
government's unfortunate provision in this bill which removes 
one deterrent to the threat to the health of Canadians. This is the 
lowering of the tax on tobacco products. Nothing is more 
important to Canadians than their health and the health of their 
loved ones. This concern of Canadians is an especially strong 
case for young people when it applies to our future generations.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately it is this age group that tobacco manufacturers 
have been targeting for many years with their advertising 
campaigns. The government, however, seems to have lost the 
will to combat this problem directly. It decided to lower tobacco 
taxes without making a proper evaluation of the impact of its 
actions on health care costs and on possible increased addiction 
among the nation's young.
<P>
	As we were reminded last week by the hon. Reform member 
for Yorkton-Melville, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Health clearly stated in one of her speeches that the 
government fully recognizes that the action plan to combat 
smuggling and the tax measures associated with it would pose 
health risks. How can the government pursue such measures in 
good conscience when it knows that one serious result of this 
legislation before us today may lead to greater addiction and 
result in heart disease, cancer, and death?
<P>
	Where is the logic here? Where are our priorities? How are we 
to believe the government's professed statements about concern 
for the health of Canadians, indeed statements made today in 
this House by the Minister of Health showing great concern and 
great sympathy for a very unfortunate case?. These actions do 
not square with that professed concern.
<P>
	I do not doubt that there are some in our country, mainly the 
tobacco lobby, who are pleased with this legislation but it should 
not be the concern of this House to cater to special interests, 
especially interests which put their own profit margins over the 
health concerns of the nation. This House is here to provide good 
government to all Canadians and this is the goal of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Even if we were to consider the idea of tobacco tax reductions 
as legitimate, this bill does not even handle the tax decrease 
fairly. The provinces of western Canada which wanted no part of 
the tax decrease and desperately needed the revenues, mostly to 
pay for health costs, a good portion of which are incurred by 
smoking, have been bullied by this government. They have been 
given no choice. They have lost a great deal of revenue and 
received no compensation whatever. This is clearly 
discriminatory in our federal system.
<P>
	Worse still, western provinces which never had a tobacco 
smuggling problem before now are having to cope with a large 
inflow of cigarettes from the eastern provinces that have lower 
tobacco taxes than they do. This is unfair and it must stop.
<P>
	We recognize that you cannot beat a plan with no plan so the 
Reform Party would like to suggest an alternative route to the 
hasty and misguided path upon which the government has now 
embarked.
<P>
	We recommend a plan for restoring tobacco taxes to previous 
levels should be considered. It is true that tax levels need to be 
lowered in this country but lowering them in this one instance in 
this one narrow area without regard for all the consequences is 
not the proper way to go. The government may complain that 
increased taxes will again lead to increased smuggling. 
However that is not wholly true.
<P>
	As has been mentioned in this House before the majority of 
cigarettes being smuggled into Canada, in the region of about 70 
per cent, were coming from reserves located on Ontario and 
Quebec borders with New York State. However, due to a U.S. 
court decision on Monday New York will now be limiting the 
supply of duty free cigarettes to these reserves based on a per 
person quota. All cigarettes in excess of this quota will be fully 
taxed. This means that cigarettes coming through those reserves 
will already cost about 35 cents more per pack than those legally 
purchased in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, if the proposed American health tax on 
cigarettes is added later this year as anticipated, Canadian 
cigarettes will be cheaper by around $1.50 a pack than their U.S. 
equivalent. This opens the door for the return to previous 
taxation levels with no increased risk of smuggling.
<P>
	The Reform Party would therefore ask the government to act 
on this development as soon as the House resumes sitting in the 
fall. If the government still finds that there is a smuggling 
problem then it should consider the reinstatement of an export 
tax on those cigarettes sold to neighbouring jurisdictions which 
are above and beyond our historic levels of cigarette exports, 
which are about 3 per cent of Canadian cigarette production.
<P>
	The Reform Party also suggests that the health promotion 
surtax imposed earlier this year on the profits of cigarette 
manufacturers be extended from three years to six years.
<P>
	I would ask the government to introduce a complete ban on all 
advertising for tobacco products. It is high time that government 
put the health concerns of Canadians first on its list of priorities. 
The more time we lose, the more health care resources and lives 
of our citizens are going to be lost. Now is the time for more 
considered action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5674"> 5674 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that this is an important debate of 
concern to all Canadians and we believe that the government 
should now re-examine this matter of lowering tobacco taxes. A 
vote against this bill now could be a vote for a better approach to 
this problem in the future and indeed a vote for a better future for 
the health of our Canadian citizens.
<P>
	I would urge members of this House to vote to suspend the 
implementation of Bill C-32 at this time so that with the 
resuming of sittings in the fall we can all work together to get it 
right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again I listened to my colleague's comments with great 
interest. I noted that she is advocating the re-examination of this 
legislation in order to take another fresh look at just where the 
country is going with this reduction in cigarette taxation.
<P>
	Could she give us some indication of what she would come up 
with for a better enforcement strategy. If we are not going to 
have the reduction in the cigarette taxes and the reduction in the 
cost of cigarettes in order to combat the cigarette smuggling, 
what other avenue is open and what would she advocate? Would 
it be in the form of a higher export tax? Would it be in more 
money spent on law enforcement? Would it be more patrols of 
our borders? Would it be those types of things? I just wonder 
what she would advocate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> I thank my colleague for his question. It is 
clear that we need to examine this matter of putting some 
inhibitions on the use of cigarettes by citizens in our country. 
There are a number of ways that this can be done, some of which 
I mentioned when I spoke earlier in the debate. I think this 
matter of an export tax would take a lot of the economic 
incentive out of smuggling activity. That is a very important 
consideration.
<P>
	I think there can be better enforcement through higher 
penalties for this type of activity. There has to be a cost benefit 
analysis for people engaged in cigarette smuggling. If the costs 
start to outweigh the benefits then we will find fewer people 
finding it attractive to engage in cigarette smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	We also need to start educating citizens about the cost to them 
of the use of cigarettes. A lot of us as citizens are under the 
impression that somehow things are free, particularly health 
care costs associated with the use of cigarettes and that this is 
paid for by government or by the health care system. In fact, 
these costs are paid by Canadians who work very, very hard for 
their money and who then turn it over to government to 
administer programs that protect us from the consequences of 
certain actions.
<P>
	Canadians need to have some cost benefit analysis for 
themselves as well, realizing that the buck does not stop 
anywhere but with us and it does not come from anyone but us. 
Then I believe our choices will be a little more realistic when it 
comes to cost benefit.
<P>
	When we talk about diminishing the use of cigarettes, 
diminishing the demand for smuggled cigarettes there are all of 
these aspects of enforcement and deterrence that are tied in 
together. That is why I recommended to the House a need to just 
back up a little bit and re-examine what we are doing here. I 
think we moved ahead too quickly when this legislation was first 
considered, promised and introduced. I think it can work better 
if we bring the pieces together in a more thoughtful manner. I 
think giving it a few more months and re-examining and 
redrafting some of its provisions would serve our country better 
than the bill before us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the comments of my colleague 
from Calgary North. I have two comments I would like her to 
respond to.
<P>
	She related in her speech the importance she places on this 
issue. Knowing her personally I know she would not make those 
statements lightly. I wonder what her reflections are with regard 
to how serious the government is taking Bill C-32. I know my 
eyesight is failing me, but I do not even see a minister in the 
House during the debate of this very important issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I must interrupt the 
member. I appreciate that he has not been here as long as some of 
us. It is quite contrary to our rules to make notice of the fact that 
a member or minister is or is not in the House because of the fact 
that he or she might be away for a very good reason.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps just a clarification. 
Even when there are no ministers in the House you are not 
allowed to make note of it? I am not speaking of anybody 
specifically. I see a parliamentary secretary has arrived and I 
appreciate that.
<P>
	I will get on to my second comment. I was quite interested to 
hear my colleague from Calgary North speak about cigarette and 
tobacco advertising. She made the statement that it should be 
banned. This is quite a serious statement. I am sure she has some 
very concrete reasons for suggesting that. I would be quite 
curious to find out what rationale the hon. member has for 
suggesting that cigarette advertising should be banned in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, we learn so much every day 
from the Chair and we appreciate that.
<P>
	My colleague asked me to comment on two things. One was 
how seriously I think the government is taking this matter of 
health hazards associated with these attempts to diminish 
cigarette smuggling. I think the government is serious about the 
problem. There has been an attempt to address it vigorously. The 
only problem is that I do not believe this way of addressing it is 
the most effective. I do not think it was well thought through. I 
do think the costs of this particular approach outweigh the 
benefits and that there can be some changes to the legislation 
which will make it much more effective in addressing the 
problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5675"> 5675 </A></B>
<P>
	All of us in this House including those on the government side 
are concerned that we not have a problem of cigarette smuggling 
in the country. We know the disruption and the social cost but we 
have to make sure that what happens to stamp out one fire does 
not start a bunch of others.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The second thing mentioned by my colleague was banning 
cigarette advertising. This has not been talked about too much in 
the House. I guess my comments to start us thinking about 
advertising are these.
<P>
	The goal of advertising is to create a need, to create a desire. 
In simple terms, why are we allowing an activity that creates a 
need and a desire in our citizens to use a product that is very 
harmful to them personally, has an enormous social cost and an 
enormous economic cost?
<P>
	We need to sit down and do a cost benefit analysis on that. 
Yes, it does create some jobs and that is good, but at what cost? It 
seems to me that when we are so eager to legislate, to make 
moves to change social policies and social structures, this is an 
area that we really have not considered as seriously as we could.
<P>
	I would suggest that it would certainly be an appropriate use 
of the legislative powers of the House to diminish activities that 
create a need and a desire for a very harmful product for 
Canadians and for Canadian youth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before we continue, it is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, human 
rights; the hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
trade; and the hon. member for Richelieu, mass layoffs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to be 
able to stand in the House today and state that I support this bill. 
If I were able to put on simply a politician's hat, there would be 
enough in this bill for me to support. As my colleague from 
Kootenay East said, this is one of those difficult bills as it has 
more than one unrelated issue in it.
<P>
	The omnibus bill is a problem. I presume that they are all 
lumped together because of the excise tax component to them. 
However I would like to express my objection to an omnibus bill 
as an issue here and having said that, branch off into the areas of 
this bill that I do agree with.
<P>
	I agree with a manufacturers' surtax. The $185 million can be 
used to prevent smoking but of course that $185 million must be 
used effectively. As far as I can determine it is only in effect for 
three years. I wonder what will happen after the three years are 
up?
<P>
	I also agree with the excise tax on exports of tobacco. That 
makes sense to me. I believe that to have tobacco going across 
the U.S. border and coming back makes no sense at all. The 
government made a good attempt to try to treat fairly those retail 
and wholesale outlets with inventory on hand when the changes 
were announced. It was a reflection that this bill might have 
some effect on the businesses that dealt with tobacco products.
<P>
	I have occasion to also agree with the airline tax changes and 
philosophically agree with the fact that there will be GST 
changes on businesses when people entertain at restaurants. 
Those are the portions of the bill with which I agree.
<P>
	However, I pause to think about the portions of the bill that I 
believe are the most important. Those of course are the portions 
that relate to smoking and to cigarettes.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to express what expertise I have on this subject. I 
reflect back to my university days when in my medical training 
we spent two years of our lives in what we call basic sciences, 
studying books. We learned about anatomy, we learned about 
physiology, we learned about biochemistry, we learned about 
pharmacology.
<P>
	The very first opportunity we had to deal with patients 
directly I was assigned an elderly patient, a fellow who had 
fought in the war. He was hospitalized in a veterans' hospital in 
Edmonton where I trained. He had a smoking related disease. He 
had emphysema.
<P>
	I was particularly interested and keen to look after this man so 
well. He was my very first patient. I had responsibility for him. 
He was aged. He was in his mid-sixties. He had problems that 
related specifically to the fact that all his life he had smoked and 
he had emphysema. His chest was barrel shaped. He had 
difficulty breathing. He lay in the bed unable to get up. He was 
on medication that would hopefully prevent infection which 
often affects somebody with that disease.
<P>
	I spent many hours with him. I spoke with him at length about 
his life, his family and his history. I spoke with him about his 
hopes, dreams and desires when he was a young person. I spoke 
with him in fact about when he started smoking and why he 
started smoking. Over a span of about six weeks I felt that I 
became his friend and his confidant. In fact he and I had many 
good hours together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5676"> 5676 </A></B>
<P>
	As he slipped quietly and slowly into a state where he was no 
longer able to communicate, I remember very clearly his last 
words to me before he passed on. He called me doctor even 
though I was not at that point in time a full-fledged doctor. He 
said to me: ``Doctor Hill, I beg you to tell the young people not 
to smoke. I beg you to tell them not to start''.
<P>
	I have never forgotten that man. I have never forgotten the 
anguish in his heart when he died of this problem relating 
directly to tobacco.
<P>
	One of the things we did as medical students was participate 
in autopsies. One of our pathology experts was a somewhat 
ghoulish individual in fact. I felt that his way of dealing with 
material that was so special was quite interesting. He had a lung. 
It was a lung he had taken from a specimen that had smoked. He 
had a lung from an individual who had not smoked. With great 
delight he used to come into the anatomy lab for the young 
students and say: ``I'd like to show you young students what it 
means to smoke''. He took the lung from the person who had 
smoked and it was black as coal. It looked like somebody had 
sprayed it with spray paint. He would take that lung and squash 
it between his hands. After he squashed it he would let go of it 
and it would stay squashed.
<P>
	Then he would show us the nice pink lung, the dried up lung 
from someone who had not smoked. This lung was not black as 
coal but was pink and supple. He would compress that lung and 
when he let go it would expand immediately back. It was in fact 
very much like a piece of foam rubber. He would shake his 
finger at us individually and say: ``Don't you ever smoke. You 
are going to carry the medical message to the country. Don't you 
ever smoke''.
<P>
	I reflect back on my first hospital duties and the medical staff 
in the hospital where I first practised. I looked around the table 
at my confreres and over 50 per cent of the doctors in that room 
smoked. I graduated back in the late 1960s. I practised medicine 
from 1970 until coming to the House.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I have noticed a significant change in the medical profession 
over those 25 years of practice. At the end of those 25 years-I 
hope not the ultimate end, I hope to be able to return to that 
practice if we can get some sanity back into the House of 
Commons-there was but one of the medical staff smoking.
<P>
	The medical profession has learned over the last 25 years 
what a serious problem smoking is. It is a serious enough 
problem that I became a confirmed anti-smoking medical 
doctor. I lectured my patients about smoking. I begged my 
patients to quit smoking. I gave them nicotine gum to have them 
stop smoking. I tried hypnosis to get them to stop smoking. I 
sent them to acupuncturists hoping they would quit smoking. I 
gave them a medication called Inderal which we thought maybe 
would help.
<P>
	I would like to say that you can usually tell how successful the 
medical profession is on an issue by how many different forms 
of treatment they have. If you are successful in the medical 
treatment there is one treatment. I gave you the list of the things 
that I tried to do as a medical practitioner to stop people from 
smoking. It is very difficult, very unsuccessful. I have to stand 
here and say that my success rate in my practice of medicine was 
singularly poor. I am embarrassed to admit that but it is true.
<P>
	Smoking is highly addictive. It is much harder to quit once 
you start, and in my view all the efforts of the medical 
community should be directed toward youth to prevent them 
starting.
<P>
	I believe the main problems with this bill are just those issues. 
All efforts are not being directed toward our youth.
<P>
	I have youth in my family. I have given them every 
opportunity to be educated on this issue. I had a foster native son 
who chose to smoke and one of my natural sons also chose to 
smoke. Of course I asked them why. The answers they gave me 
were in both instances peer pressure and rebellion. If dad told 
me not to do it I probably should do it, an if my buddies told me 
to do it for sure it was going to be good. My firm hope is that 
those two sons of mine who chose to smoke will change their 
minds.
<P>
	There are four main factors in starting to smoke. The price of 
the product is number one and this bill does have an impact on 
the price. Promotion of the product is number two and that is 
something that we can do something about. The product itself 
and the place in which you live are other factors in this issue. 
Societal factors are a big deal.
<P>
	I believe that we should have freedom in this country. I 
believe we should have freedom to do many things that are 
harmful for us. It is extremely difficult to legislate people into 
doing what is good for them. I believe we should have freedom 
to eat junk food even though junk food ultimately may not be 
good for us. I believe we should have freedom to drink water, or 
juice, or alcohol even though one of those products ultimately 
may not be good for us. I believe we should have freedom to run 
home from the office for exercise or ride in a vehicle with no 
exercise.
<P>
	I believe we should have the freedom to smoke if we choose to 
smoke but I do not believe that we should make it easy to start. I 
do not believe that we should encourage our youth to start. I 
certainly hope that this House will do none of those things.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I tried to look with as much favour as I could on the 
government's strategy here because this was not just a smoking 
issue. I tried to ask what is the all-embracing, anti-smoking 
strategy of our health minister. I have not really been able to pin

<P>
the health minister down on this  issue, but there have been some 
pieces that have dribbled out in terms of that strategy.
<P>
	The minister has said that the $185 million that will be taken 
in the manufacturers' surtax will be used in large measure for 
advertising to prevent smoking. I said before that the money 
must be used effectively and I have yet to see an advertising 
campaign that would prevent teens from starting. It certainly 
will have no effect on adults who have already started.
<P>
	I also heard the minister talk about plain packaging. Plain 
packaging has had a significant amount of input and feedback in 
our committees and a significant amount of witnesses on both 
sides of the issue. If plain packaging will make a difference to 
prevent youth from smoking I will support it and support it 
strongly.
<P>
	I simply ask that before plain packaging is embarked upon, an 
expensive proposition, a job dislocation proposition, that we 
have proof it will work. In my view that proof is not so far away. 
There is a study at the University of Toronto looking at this 
specifically. I thought we would have a good study from our 
Department of Health. I am not sure of that anymore, but I hope 
that study will also prove that plain packaging of cigarettes 
would be efficacious.
<P>
	The health minister has said eventually we will raise taxes. I 
hope that eventually is not so far down the road that eventually 
will never happen.
<P>
	The other point that I wanted to bring up on this debate was 
the issue of the freedom in this House. There are actually more 
medical doctors in Parliament today than I believe have ever 
been in Parliament before. Three of them sit on the government 
side. I have listened to the three of them speak about their view 
on this bill as it relates to health. We are going to have 
individuals on this side of the House voting against my personal 
position on this bill. I have to oppose it for health reasons. I 
believe there will be members of my caucus who will stand up 
and say they disagree with me, they agree with the government. 
However, I will watch with profound interest what my medical 
colleagues do with this bill on this issue.
<P>
	I reflect upon two members in the last Parliament who voted 
against their government on a specific piece of legislation. I 
watched what happened to them. I watched them removed from 
their caucus. One of those individuals is in this House today. I 
say to the medical individuals on the government side that if you 
vote for this bill you are voting against everything that your 
medical profession taught you. You are voting against the 
Hippocratic Oath.
<P>
	I will watch with great interest, if they do vote against the 
government on this bill, exactly what happens to them in their 
caucus. If they get booted out of their caucus for voting for the 
<P>
health of Canadians our government is down the tubes. I will 
state that as strongly as I can state it.
<P>
	There is one thing that tobacco companies have done in terms 
of the advertising of their product. They have a mobile billboard 
that they are using now. The race cars that race on the tracks of 
this country are now advertising tobacco. I hate to say this 
because I am a race car driver, but the tobacco companies have 
found a way around the advertising ban.
<P>
	As much as I hate to say this to Jacques Villeneuve who drives 
a car with logos all over it, this should not continue. The racing 
car fraternity will choke as I say this-millions of dollars being 
put toward the activity that I enjoy a tremendous amount-there 
should not be the allowance of cultural events sponsored by the 
tobacco companies. There should not be mobile billboards on 
the tracks of this country to attract our youth to smoking.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I am going to use an illusion that comes from the race car 
world. When you are driving a car very fast you know that you 
are running into a wall of air. The car shakes and shudders, but if 
you can get right behind another car and draft that car you can go 
faster. The turbulence decreases, you can go faster than you 
could by yourself. Interestingly enough, you can push the car 
ahead of you faster. Drafting actually makes both vehicles go 
faster. It has something to do with the turbulence behind the 
vehicle that you are pushing.
<P>
	I look upon this government as the car in the lead. I look upon 
this party as the drafting car, pushing the government faster than 
it would otherwise move. I challenge this government to keep us 
in the draft, continue with legislation like this and there could be 
a passing manoeuvre coming up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the illustration that has just been used is an excellent 
illustration of what has been happening in this House. It is not 
just with regard to this piece of legislation, but the Young 
Offenders Act and some of the other things that have been 
happening are good examples of how an opposition that is strong 
and prods the government can have quite an influence in some 
positive directions that government can take.
<P>
	That goes along with what this government is advocating, 
does it not? Is not this government saying it is listening, it wants 
that co-operation to take place, it is looking for input?
<P>
	I hope it is listening because we are trying to make a point. We 
have been addressing this for quite some time and the health 
concerns are not going to go away. We have heard some of the 
statistics that have been quoted and some of the results of this 
legislation already coming forward on how smoking seems to be 
on the increase. It is a legitimate concern that we have.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5678"> 5678 </A></B>
<P>
	Coming back to the remarks that were made, I am not an 
expert in this area, someone who is in medicine of course would 
be. There are some people who will absolutely never smoke. No 
matter what advertising might take place, they would not be 
lured into that habit. There are others who will probably smoke 
no matter what contrary advertising took place. No matter what 
the government did to try to discourage that, they would still 
smoke.
<P>
	There is a group on the edge. They can be influenced one way 
or the other. I would like the member to maybe comment in this 
regard about the vulnerable sector of our society that will be 
influenced by the price. Would that not be a factor that the 
government should consider?
<P>
	Some will say they are not going to start smoking just because 
the price has been lowered. That may be true, there may be an 
element out there. Some will smoke no matter what the price is. 
That could be true. I am wondering if there is not an element in 
between there, a vulnerable element that would be influenced by 
price. I do not know if the member has any research or any 
opinion on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I happen to have some 
research and data on that issue. I think we should maybe join up 
in Question Period. We could have a very similar process as I see 
across the way.
<P>
	Smoking increase is the first in 30 years, and this actually 
came across the wire this morning from Toronto on CP. For the 
first time in 30 years tobacco use is on the rise in Ontario and 
women account for most of the new smokers.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Among those women age 18 and older smoking soared to 25 
per cent this year from 19 per cent in 1993. These particular data 
suggest that the availability of cheaper cigarettes has halted the 
decline. In Canada that decline in smoking has been going on for 
30 years and has perhaps reversed the trend. The fellow who 
conducted the research at the foundation said the greater 
increase for women is consistent with the fact that women's 
lower incomes make them more price sensitive than men and 
more likely to react to the tax cuts.
<P>
	One of the tragedies in medicine is that women have 
overtaken men in terms of cigarette smoking, and cancer of the 
lungs in women has now overtaken the other horrible cancer in 
women, breast cancer, as one of the major causes of female 
death. Preventable illness-there is nothing in medicine more 
satisfying than preventing disease.
<P>
	These data are the first data we have had made available to us. 
It has not been very long since these proposals have been on the 
books. Surely 30 years of decline in smoking with a sudden 
spike tells us something. This spike has nothing whatever to do 
with legal or illegal cigarettes. It is simply a spike, an 
indication. As we get more indications I think the  government 
will backtrack on this bill. Why backtrack on it when we can 
prevent it right now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate my hon. colleague for the wonderful speech he 
made. I listened to the graphic details of what happens to our 
organs when we smoke and he talked about lungs that seemed to 
be rather unpleasant to see.
<P>
	Then he went on to talk about the fact that it was against the 
Hippocratic Oath of doctors to vote in favour of this bill and he 
expected any doctor in the Liberal government would oppose 
this bill.
<P>
	At the same time the Minister of Health acquiesced while her 
government introduced this legislation and dropped the excise 
tax on cigarettes.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague what he feels the 
position of the Minister of Health should be and whether the 
minister should resign when her government has introduced this 
type of measure which will increase smoking. We have all 
agreed that it is going to increase smoking. We have started to 
see the effects of it already in the statistics.
<P>
	The health minister by her position is dedicated to protecting, 
enhancing and improving the life of Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague what he feels her 
position should be and whether the minister should resign based 
on what the government is trying to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not think the 
health minister should resign on this issue. The minister has 
enough trouble without worrying about resigning on this issue.
<P>
	Traditionally the health minister on an issue like this would be 
the strongest and most vocal supporter of the health of 
Canadians. I did watch with interest to see whether that took 
place. I am dismayed to report to this House that I do not believe 
it did take place. There seems to me to be at least four 
individuals who should vote against this bill.
<P>
	I would strongly state that the Minister of Health should stand 
in this House and state her opposition to anything that would do 
what this bill will do and that is increase cigarette smoking in 
our youth. I state that strongly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on February 8 this government announced its national action 
campaign to combat smuggling. Bill C-11 was introduced to 
address some of the enforcement measures and tax changes were 
implemented using a number of ways and means motions until 
Bill C-32 was introduced on May 27. As has already been 
outlined, there are a number of positives mixed up in the bill 
with the obvious negative of lowering cigarette taxes and 
thereby lowering the price of cigarettes to smokers.

<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	On February 10, I wrote a column on this very issue for 
newspapers back home. It was printed in all the local papers. I 
think it is of interest and I would like to quote from my column 
and read it into the record:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Prime Minister says there is a breakdown in respect for the law in Canada 
and this will no longer be tolerated. His House leader states that smuggling is a 
crime and we must restore law and order. Brave words, hopefully to be followed 
by strong action undertaken with a resolute strength of will.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government unveiled its national action plan to combat smuggling, the 
objective being to eliminate cigarette smuggling in Canada. Like most 
government plans, it is a mixture of good and bad. Its plan to step up enforcement 
by police forces and customs officers is certainly commendable as is the 
implementation of an $8 per carton export tax.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Stepping up the anti-smoking education campaign is also a positive move. 
However the government's announced reduction in taxes on legal cigarettes sold 
in Canada must surely be a disastrous error. Make no mistake, the federal 
government struck this deal primarily for the benefit of one province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Quebec has been clamouring for action on this for weeks. Almost 
immediately after the Prime Minister's announcement, Quebec indicated its 
willingness to participate fully in the tax reduction scheme. As a result, the price 
of a carton of cigarettes in Quebec will fall from $47 to less than $23 when 
federal and provincial taxes are removed, along with relevant GST and sales 
taxes. What is the fallout from this?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Criminals have been sent the message that we cannot protect our borders or 
enforce our laws, particularly on the Akwasasne Indian reserve through which 
an estimated 70 per cent of contraband tobacco is funnelled. We will instead 
lower the price of legal cigarettes and compete for their customers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Provinces other than Quebec will be forced to match the tax reductions. If 
not, an international smuggling problem will simply become an interprovincial 
one. Every province will face a resultant drop in tax revenue at the very time 
they are all struggling to balance income with expenditures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Price is a deterrent. Cheaper cigarettes will act as an incentive for Canadians 
to start or to continue smoking, especially our youth. The end result will 
undoubtedly be higher health costs for all Canadians in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For years, our policy has been to attempt to offset the costs attributable to 
smoking by levying higher tobacco taxes. Now suddenly with one stroke of the 
pen, this government has reversed that policy. This new policy of reducing 
domestic taxes in lieu of initiating a higher export tax will primarily benefit the 
tobacco industry by maintaining or increasing current cigarette consumption 
levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If past performance is any indication this government, just like its 
predecessor, will lack the political will to follow though with its announced 
crackdown on smugglers. In my opinion what is needed is a comprehensive plan 
which would include strict enforcement of our laws. If the present police and 
customs forces are inadequate as the past record of seizure of only an estimated 
1 per cent of illegal cigarettes would seem to indicate, then those forces should 
be augmented.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If necessary, our armed forces should be called upon to assist with this 
mission. Perhaps a little trip down the St. Lawrence might make a good 
shakedown cruise for our new frigates. It is time for politicians to make some 
tough decisions and give the police a mandate to enforce our laws.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was my column on February 10. What has changed since 
February 10? I note not a lot.
<P>
	I would like to change the focus of the debate a little at this 
point and talk about cigarettes from a personal perspective. I 
have been a smoker for approximately 25 years.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Shame. That is 
right.
<P>
	When it comes to quitting smoking, I am a professional 
quitter. I have quit hundreds of times. However, I can attest to 
just how powerful a hold cigarettes have on an individual.
<P>
	Make no mistake, nicotine is a highly addictive drug. We have 
all heard that it is perhaps even more addictive than the drug 
heroin. I started smoking when I was 16 years old and as one of 
my colleagues remarked earlier, being raised on a farm I started 
smoking out behind the barn at a very early age. Why the barn 
did not burn down I have no idea.
<P>
	At that time cigarettes were 35 cents a pack. I can remember 
very clearly when they were raised to 50 cents, then 75 cents, 
finally climbing to $1. Of course with each price increase a few 
more people would quit smoking. That is the reality of it.
<P>
	I can remember my father for one stating that when cigarettes 
got to be $1 a pack that was it, he was going to quit smoking. It 
certainly was a deterrent for young people and although that was 
many years ago I was a young person at that time. It was hard to 
come up with 35 cents some days.
<P>
	Last night on my way home I stopped at a corner store to 
purchase a package of cigarettes. Three dollars and thirty cents 
is how much it costs to buy them by the pack. I heard an hon. 
member earlier state that they are down around $2 a pack if you 
buy them by the carton.
<P>
	The very thing we spoke out about in February when the 
government announced this legislation and their intentions are 
actually coming about, the lower cost of cigarettes in central 
Canada. With the resultant lower cost we are starting to see an 
increase in consumption, especially among young people who 
would not be able to afford cigarettes in many cases at $7 a pack 
or thereabouts where it was a while back.
<P>
	I ask the government, what message does this send to 
teenagers. That it is this frivolous with their health? The 
government cares this little about the health of teenagers that it 
lowers the cost of cigarettes like this. Tobacco is a drug 
addiction. I would equate it to alcohol. Once you become an 
alcoholic everyone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5680"> 5680 </A></B>
<P>
recognizes that you are an alcoholic for life. It does not matter if 
you have not had a drink for 20 years, you are still an alcoholic. 
Past alcoholics who are successful are people who recognize 
that fact and never take that first drink. I can certainly attest to 
the fact it is very similar once you take that first  cigarette. It 
does not take long for nicotine to take hold of your life again.
<P>
	Probably since the lowering of the tax and consequently the 
cost of cigarettes, in the neighbourhood of hundreds or perhaps 
even thousands of young people have begun to smoke. Certainly 
a lot of young people who perhaps would seriously have 
considered giving up the cigarettes are continuing to smoke.
<P>
	As I outlined in my column, the international smuggling 
problem has become an interprovincial one. Westerners, the 
people I represent, feel very disenfranchised by this. They feel 
they are second class citizens when they know what the price of 
cigarettes is in central Canada and it is still over $6 a pack back 
home.
<P>
	Polls are indicating, as some of our hon. members have 
indicated, that the use of cigarettes is going up for the first time 
in recent history. Common sense would seem to dictate that hon. 
members opposite should vote against this, but common sense 
seems to be sadly lacking on the other side of the House on this 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to sum up by making three points. 
My colleagues have addressed the majority of their concerns 
with this legislation.
<P>
	Nicotine is a powerful drug. It is well if we all remember that, 
especially when it gets a hold on our youth, when the youth take 
to smoking.
<P>
	There is ample evidence to note that smoking is dangerous to 
a person's health. I know that used to be disputed for many 
years. Certainly when I first started smoking it was not as well 
known as it is now just what are the inherent dangers of cigarette 
consumption. We are just beginning to learn about the real 
danger of second hand smoke to our children, to our spouses, to 
people around us in the workplace.
<P>
	I find it somewhat ironic that the government would initiate 
lowering the cost of cigarettes at the same time as municipalities 
across the country are having smoke free zones, smoke free 
buildings. Yet the government through this lowering of the cost 
of tobacco is actually encouraging people to either begin to 
smoke or to continue smoking.
<P>
	We note that the government has no real handle on what the 
cost to future taxpayers is going to be in health care. It is very 
relevant to remember that it is future taxpayers who are going to 
pay this. Just like the deficit and the debt, we are passing on this 
cost to our children.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Pass the buck.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is right, pass 
the buck.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Pass the butt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Or pass the butt.
<P>
	The third point I want to come back to is that price is a 
deterrent. I can attest to that, as I said earlier. Any young person 
who smokes today would also be witness to that fact. There is a 
big difference at $2 or $3 a pack than if it is $7 or $8 a pack of 
cigarettes in how much they will smoke or whether they will 
even continue smoking.
<P>
	I am very pleased to be able to rise today and voice my 
opposition to Bill C-32, not because, as other speakers have said 
that it does not have some good built into it but that strictly on 
health reasons alone I feel that in all good conscience, if we care 
about future generations, if we care about the young in Canada, 
we should vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the reasons I enjoy going home from Ottawa is not simply 
because the humidity is much less, although it is partly that. 
There is a lot of space, that is true. But there is also a lot of 
common sense out there.
<P>
	One of the things that Cariboo-Chilcotin people are often 
criticized for is perhaps their lack of subtlety. There may be 
some subtlety in this bill that I find distressing.
<P>
	If I remember correctly the reason we came at this is because 
of a problem with smuggling. We have heard hon. members talk 
about the consequences of this problem on the lives of 
community members where this smuggling was taking place, 
the hardships that people endured with smuggling taking place 
in their driveways, of not being able to deal with the threats that 
were involved, of the police being overwhelmed. There is no 
denying the government was confronted with an enormous 
problem.
<P>
	The difficulty that I have and the subtlety that I am speaking 
to is that the problem has been taken from the streets of these 
communities and passed in general to the young people across 
the nation. The problem is such that the lives and the of these 
people are going to be affected at a time when the federal and 
provincial governments are facing enormous problems with the 
country's medical plan. In a sense, we are placing extra burdens 
on the medical profession and the hospitals in caring for people 
in the long term.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	This kind of subtlety, this kind of passing the buck, or the butt 
as we have mentioned this afternoon, raises an extremely 
important moral issue. It does deal with the original problem but 
it makes the problem move from that area of the country and 
generalizes it across the country. It increases the difficulties for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5681"> 5681 </A></B>
<P>
many people and increases the costs for a long, long time to 
come.
<P>
	My hon. colleague has spoken so well of the difficulties of 
smoking in his own life. How would he encourage the 
government to deal with the smuggling which was the original 
problem the government faced?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly thank my hon. colleague for his comments and his 
question.
<P>
	As he so ably put it, the government was faced with a 
horrendous problem, the smuggling problem in Canada. As I 
said in my column, 70 per cent of it had been identified as 
coming through the native reserves in central Canada. What I 
advocated then and what I still advocate is we have to get tough 
with law breakers no matter who they are and no matter where 
they are in our country.
<P>
	I felt then as I do now that a dual approach is needed of raising 
the export tax enough to take away the incentive as well as 
clamping down on smugglers wherever they may be, even if it 
were to cause bloodshed. If we have laws on our books but are 
not prepared to enforce them, then what good are they?
<P>
	This government developed a national strategy with this 
legislation to address primarily a central Canada problem. 
Certainly we did not see the same problem in western Canada. If 
it had been there those governments would have reduced their 
cigarette taxes as well and they have not, except by a minimal 
amount.
<P>
	We have to get tough with the smugglers instead of sending 
them a clear message that we will compete with them for their 
own customers by lowering the costs. If we follow this train of 
thought through where does it lead? Other things are smuggled 
into the country. Are we going to address them in the same 
manner? That is ridiculous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again speaking as someone who might be a 
proponent of the bill, my hon. colleague who has been a smoker 
for 25 years, does he believe that Canadian smokers will only 
smoke Canadian cigarettes if there is a large price differential? 
Does my colleague not have concerns about other damage to 
society which might occur if the ill-gotten gains of cigarette 
smuggling were to find their natural investment path in other 
criminal activity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking as an experienced smoker, I can tell my hon. colleague 
that Canadian cigarettes are the best cigarettes in the world. I 
have travelled in Europe and I have travelled quite extensively 
in the United States. I must say their cigarettes and tobacco 
simply do not stack up. I am quite prepared to state that yes, 
Canadian smokers would be prepared to pay more for Canadian 
tobacco. That is a great indication of what a terrific job 
Canadian farmers do in growing quality products.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
the member on his fine speech. He mentioned the problems he 
has had in wrestling with smoking for 25 years.
<P>
	We have been talking about reducing the price of cigarettes 
making them affordable for young people. More and more 
young people, especially young ladies, are starting to smoke. 
We heard the medical opinion from my colleague from Macleod 
who told us how dangerous it is, how it ruins one's health, ruins 
one's lungs.
<P>
	My hon. colleague personally knows how difficult it is to stop 
smoking. I think he said he has tried at least a thousand times, so 
he is a professional stop smoking person. I would therefore ask, 
is it far more important that we put the emphasis on making sure 
people do not start smoking rather than allowing them to start, 
thinking we will to convince them to quit later on by raising the 
taxes through the roof? Surely it would be much better to focus 
on not allowing these children to start smoking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
agree the emphasis has to be placed on trying to educate the 
young people. With my three young children at home I certainly 
have endeavoured to do that. I have tried to tell them to do as I 
say and not as I do, obviously.
<P>
	Although I have smoked on and off for 25 years, I did quit for 
four and a half years at one point, quite an accomplishment I felt 
at the time. However, along came the 1988 election and by the 
time I had gone through the election I was smoking again. It 
might say something for the profession I am currently in.
<P>
	As to what we can do to encourage young people, I think it is 
incumbent on every one who has children or young people 
around them-if you are a coach of a team, if you have young 
nieces, nephews, grandchildren, whatever-to certainly 
encourage them not to smoke and to warn them about the 
dangers of smoking. That is something each and every one of us 
can do.
<P>
	I do not believe, as someone else said earlier, that plain 
packaging or government advertising programs which spend 
millions of dollars will be that effective. I have talked to a 
number of young people. When they see these frightening ads on 
television that try to portray the danger of cigarettes, they do not 
relate to them. Peer pressure is much greater and it will not be 
offset by that advertising.
<P>
	Personal contact from people they know and trust, their 
family and friends, would be much more successful in 
preventing them from starting to smoke or convincing them to 
stop if they do start.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-32, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act and the 
Income Tax Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32 has 
been introduced by the government to make some changes to the 
way we tax cigarettes.
<P>
	Remember that what caused this bill to be tabled in the House 
was the smuggling problem we had along our border with the 
United States. I think back and say that a nation is not a nation if 
it cannot defend its borders and if it cannot enforce its laws.
<P>
	It is from that beginning that we are debating a bill which is 
going to dramatically reduce the taxation of cigarettes and 
tobacco and will cause young people to start smoking. These 
young people in essence are going to put their lives on the line. 
They may die an early and difficult death in order for this 
government to defend its borders and enforce its laws. That is 
quite a tragedy we are putting on the shoulders of some of our 
young people.
<P>
	We have watched while the federal government has frittered 
away its authority to protect its borders. In January and February 
the government took questions every day in this House from 
members regarding what it would do while millions of dollars 
worth of cigarettes were being smuggled across the border. 
Unfortunately the government members sat there, took the 
questions and basically did nothing.
<P>
	The RCMP would not enforce the laws of the land. Smugglers, 
criminals, were able to cross over with impugnity bringing 
cigarettes illegally into this country. The irony and the insult is 
that the cigarettes being brought into Canada were being 
exported by this country. They would go through a security 
check, come back on a tax free basis and compete with cigarettes 
being sold in the stores. Yet the government did nothing 
whatsoever about it.
<P>
	The whole problem arose because this country has a very high 
tax on cigarettes, which is great because we do not want to 
encourage people to smoke. We exported the cigarettes tax free 
and they went into the various native reserves along the border 
between Canada and the United States. They would come back 
into Canada on a tax free basis. An illegal distribution system 
developed over a period of years while the government sat by 
and did nothing to protect its borders. It did nothing to enforce 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5683"> 5683 </A></B>
<P>
the laws and the criminal element raked billions of dollars away 
from the legitimate businesses of this country.
<P>
	Who knows where that money is today, but we do know that 
some of it bought guns. Every night we would see on television 
boats and skidoos crossing the St. Lawrence River between the 
United States and Canada. We would hear the crackle of gunfire. 
Yet this government stood back and did nothing whatsoever to 
enforce its sovereignty and enforce the laws to ensure that this 
country protected its citizens from the illegal cigarettes being 
brought into Canada. The government was elected to uphold 
democracy in this society and it refused to do its job. Now we 
have another bill before us, Bill C-33. When I talk about the 
supremacy of its laws I was rather taken aback to read one 
particular clause in Bill C-33 regarding land claims agreements:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between a final agreement or 
transboundary agreement that is in effect and any federal or territorial law, 
including this Act, the agreement prevails to the extent of conflict or 
inconsistency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This says that the government has given way and is no longer 
saying that the laws of this land will have supremacy over Bill 
C-33. Bill C-32 is another example where the government will 
not enforce the laws of this country.
<P>
	The government introduced a law to reduce the duty on 
cigarettes. It raised the age from 16 to 18 and turned many 
thousands of young Canadians into criminals instantly. One day 
they were allowed to buy cigarettes perfectly legally and the 
following day they could no longer buy cigarettes. Once they 
were hooked and able to buy cigarettes the government changed 
the law and said: ``That is going to be illegal. You can no longer 
buy cigarettes if you are under the age of 18''.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately 
initiate the the privatization of all or part of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise and lead off the 
debate on Motion 278 which urges the immediate, partial or 
complete privatization of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation.
<P>
	On May 4, 1994 the minister said there are some aspects of the 
CBC operations that could be privatized.
<P>
	When we look at the question of the future of the Canadian 
broadcasting system emotions often run high. I hope that the 
debate today is rational, thought provoking and well 
intentioned.
<P>
	Certainly I recognize how difficult this issue is to raise on the 
floor of this House. There has been a nervousness exhibited by 
the industry that tells me how very sensitive it has become.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CBC is made up of five totally distinct organizations: 
English radio, French radio, English television, French 
television and Newsworld. My speech today is especially and 
exclusively concerned with the television organizations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are often told that the attitudes of Reformers toward the 
free market and private enterprise are simply knee-jerk 
reactions to the deficit and debt situation that Canada faces. As 
well we often hear that the Reform Party is anti-culture. 
However, such allegations are quite simply false and do not 
benefit nor elevate the debate.
<P>
	In the recent past whenever the subject of the CBC arose and 
its performance was put into question the charges of anti-CBC 
and thereby anti-culture emerged. This is a classic case of 
denial by those who call themselves supporters of the CBC, 
absolutely unwilling to accept any criticism of the mother court.
<P>
	We must recognize and acknowledge at the outset of this 
debate that the CBC has problems and that these problems must 
be remedied. The CBC has existed in one form or another for a 
very long time. It has a distinguished history. Before I make my 
proposal on the matter of privatization I think it necessary to 
provide an historical backdrop by exploring the when, how, why 
and what regarding the evolution of the CBC. Having 
appreciated some of its history we will be in a better position to 
understand the CBC in its present circumstances to determine if 
it is accomplishing what it set out to do.
<P>
	Ultimately, and this will come as no surprise to anyone, I do 
not believe that the CBC is able to fulfil its mandate any longer. 
What I hope to accomplish here is to set the process in motion 
that will assist the CBC in working through these very troubled 
times.
<P>
	In the 1920s the Canadian National Railway developed a radio 
network of stations in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Moncton and 
Vancouver. Its schedule included concerts, comic opera, school 
broadcasts and historical dramas. In 1929 the Aird commission 
recommended to Mackenzie King's government that public 
ownership of broadcasting was necessary to protect Canada 
against American cultural penetration. The Aird commission 
recommended the creation of a national broadcasting company 
with the status and duties of a public utility and  a source of 
public funds to develop a service capable of fostering a national 
spirit and interpreting national citizenship.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5684"> 5684 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	It specifically called for the elimination of the private stations 
albeit with compensation. Because of the economic crisis of the 
times, remembering the Aird report was calling for the further 
allocation of federal funds in the 1930s when federal coffers 
were not filled to overflowing, the consideration of the Aird 
report was delayed. This enabled some of the more powerful 
private stations and their principal lobbying agency, the 
Canadian Association of Broadcasters, to launch a campaign 
against it.
<P>
	The basic principles of the report were defended by the 
Canadian Radio League, known as CRL, an informal voluntary 
organization set up in Ottawa in 1930. It prepared pamphlets 
stating the case for public ownership. The CRL recruited other 
voluntary organizations as well as representatives from 
business, banking, trade unions, the farming community and 
educational institutions and sent a formal delegation to meet the 
minister of marine.
<P>
	The new elected Conservative government of R. B. Bennett, 
after defeating Mackenzie King's Liberals, responded to the 
appeals of the CRL by passing the Canadian Radio Broadcasting 
Act n 1932. It established a publicly owned Canadian Radio 
Broadcasting Commission, known as the CRBC, with a mandate 
to provide programs and extend coverage to all settled parts of 
the country. The CRBC took over the radio facilities of the CNR 
and began to broadcast in English and French.
<P>
	Researchers who studied the CRBC say that it suffered from 
underfunding, an uncertain mandate and inappropriate 
administrative arrangements.
<P>
	During his second term King was persuaded to replace the 
CRBC with a stronger public agency rather than abandon 
broadcasting to the private sector. In response to these pressures 
a new Canadian Broadcasting Act was introduced in 1936 
creating the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the CBC. It 
was given a better organizational structure, more assured 
funding through the use of a licence fee and decreased 
vulnerability to political pressure.
<P>
	Successive Canadian parliaments have decided that 
broadcasting should be an instrument of national purpose. For 
this they set up a publicly owned system within which private 
and commercial broadcasting have always had a place. The clear 
intent was then and still is today to give the dominant role to the 
public service, yet the pressures of the private broadcasters are 
now stronger than ever and there is still no settlement of the 
conflict between service and profit as the guiding motive of 
broadcasting.
<P>
	What appeared to be the same questions of policy are thought 
and rethought: Does Canadian broadcasting meet Canadian 
needs? Are we prepared to pay for a system to meet them? Can 
Canadian broadcasters provide increasing quantities of 
American mass entertainment without surrendering totally to 
the siren's call of a commercial ethos? What public controls 
should there be, if any? How should they be exercised and by 
whom?
<P>
	What is quite interesting to note is these questions were being 
asked in the early 1930s as policy makers were addressing the 
need for a national broadcaster. These are the same questions 
that we as parliamentarians have to ask ourselves today as we 
consider the future of the CBC. We do the CBC and Canadians a 
great disservice if we fail to answer these difficult questions.
<P>
	In fact it is extremely important to continue asking these 
specific questions as our economic, cultural and technological 
environment continues to change so rapidly. The expectations of 
our constituents are changing both in response to and in 
anticipation of these changes.
<P>
	Remember the CRBC was underfunded. It had an uncertain 
mandate, one it could not fulfil. It suffered from inappropriate 
administrative arrangements. It was in response to those 
problems that Mackenzie King decided to address the problems 
of the CRBC. He ultimately decided with the best of intentions 
toward the health of Canadian broadcasting to strengthen the 
CRBC. He did that by creating the CBC.
<P>
	When King decided to create the CBC he entertained 
arguments from all sectors before coming to a decision. In fact 
there were a good number of representations made by 
individuals and groups which were in favour of keeping 
broadcasting in the private sector.
<P>
	The problems that plagued the CRBC are the same problems 
that plague the CBC today as I have mentioned: funding, 
mandate and administration. Exploring these problems should 
demonstrate conclusively that the CBC must change.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	Before I do that, I want to first discuss a problem that affects 
today's debate. It affects the CBC. It affects us as 
parliamentarians and ultimately it affects the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Quite simply the problem is the lack of access to information 
about the CBC. The Liberal government and the CBC both 
espoused an interest in hearing constructive criticism on how 
the CBC can better fulfil its mandate. I do sincerely 
acknowledge that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5685"> 5685 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet neither the government nor the CBC has been very 
accommodating in supplying the public with the information 
necessary to make constructive suggestions. The CBC receives 
$1.091 billion. It was requested to appear before the committee 
for a full discussion on the estimates so that the committee could 
report to the House as it is permitted pursuant to the standing 
orders.
<P>
	Unfortunately the CBC and the government decided that the 
single largest funded organization in the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, the CBC, which receives one third of the 
budget of the portfolio would not appear in time for the 
committee to make a report on this year's estimates.
<P>
	The CBC's lack of timely appearance before the committee on 
the estimates is just one example that highlights perhaps the 
temerity of the Prime Minister and his government to take fiscal 
action and demonstrate perhaps a lack of sincerity by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage who states that parliamentarians 
will have a large contribution to make in the future of the CBC. 
How can the government continue to express this openness to 
the Canadian taxpayer by such actions? I ask these questions.
<P>
	In 1991, the Tories introduced a new broadcasting act. The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage seems content to extol the virtues 
of this act without meeting its compliance requirements. For 
example, on April 6, 1994, I sent a letter to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, a letter to which he has yet to reply.
<P>
	The letter reminded the minister of his obligation under 
section 54 of the act. Let me share with this House that 
obligation. The CBC is required to provide every year for the 
minister a copy of the corporate plan of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation. As well, the CBC must also provide a 
summary of this plan under section 55(4) of the Broadcasting 
Act.
<P>
	The minister must submit the summary to the House. Since 
the Broadcasting Act has been enforced since 1991, no summary 
has been tabled in the House of Commons. This is in direct 
violation of the act. Today however, curiously the summaries for 
these years 1991 to 1994 did appear at the standing committee.
<P>
	How can we as parliamentarians participate in the debate 
when the government withholds information? Unfortunately 
this is not the only example we have of finding the CBC in a 
closet environment. In early May my office contacted the CBC 
seeking budgetary information on the CBC sponsored national 
journalism symposium.
<P>
	The CBC would not provide the information. Therefore on 
May 24 I wrote to the minister requesting the information. The 
questions were simple. How much money was spent on the 
symposium? The CBC brought people from all over the world at 
taxpayer expense to this conference, a conference which was not 
even open to the public.
<P>
	How much was spent on travel for the symposium? The 
symposium was held for the first time last year and even last 
year's figures are being withheld. As well, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has admitted that the federal government 
commissioned a study from the Nordicity group to explore 
alternative means by which the CBC could generate revenue.
<P>
	When my office approached Nordicity and the government for 
a copy of this report, neither would produce it. What is this 
government hiding?
<P>
	Despite the fact that there is a great deal of information that 
we cannot access, there is enough information in the public 
domain to adequately demonstrate that the CBC is facing a 
crisis. When I say that I am not fearmongering. I am simply 
stating the obvious. As a nation, we are not poor. We are just 
broke. We are $519 billion in debt.
<P>
	Public television is facing a reality jolt. Canadians are being 
asked to make priority choices. The primary services competing 
with public television include education, health and welfare. I 
believe that we can keep the necessities that both serve the 
public interest and ensure the survival of the company.
<P>
	Consumers are faced with a multiplicity of channels today. 
Most areas that receive cable already have some 50 channels and 
just two weeks ago the CRTC issued licences to 10 more 
channels. As technology continues to develop at this rate, there 
will no longer be a need for the CRTC to issue licences.
<P>
	The reality of a much heralded 500 channel universe is with 
us. Regardless of whether there will be 100 channels or 500 
channels there is going to be in the very near future 
extraordinary competition to maintain market share. There 
seems to be a consensus in the history that one of the best ways 
for a broadcaster to survive in the market would be to specialize. 
The CBC will have to dare to spend more time doing less but 
better and make itself unique.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The CBC has hit the wall. It is continuing to lose its audience 
support at least in its English television market. One needs only 
to look at how much ground it has lost in its news broadcasting 
in the last five years to prove this.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the CBC actually fell dramatically from its 
previous year. We saw another television station, the CTV, jump 
dramatically. Also employees within that environment are 
becoming increasingly nervous. In the last few months in order 
to replace people who have quit the corporation the CBC English 
television network has witnessed a new president, several new 
vice-presidents, and the resignation of the chairman of the 
board of the CBC.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5686"> 5686 </A></B>
<P>
	The sad truth is that the CBC is undergoing a profound 
transformation but in an unsatisfactory, unsystematic and ad hoc 
manner directed by those who have magnificently proven how 
little they deserve the confidence of the viewing public or the 
employees of the corporation.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate some of the problems that face the 
CBC, all of which are interrelated. We have tough economic 
times with competing priorities for government funds. CBC 
appropriations are not likely to be increased. Technological 
convergence has caused great competition throughout all the 
industry, but it is contributing to decreased audience support not 
only for the CBC but for others.
<P>
	The CBC has been forced to seek out greater advertising 
revenues to make up for its budgetary shortfalls. This has 
resulted in the perception that the CBC is airing too much 
American material and that Canadian content is being 
sacrificed. I have also mentioned the criticism about the CBC 
withholding information from the public. Surveys show that 
there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of people who 
believe that the CBC assists in maintaining distinctive Canadian 
culture.
<P>
	In the light of these problems what should we do, 
acknowledging that I am not the definitive catalyst to resolving 
these problems but only a foot soldier attempting to clear a path 
for more open debate? As mentioned it is my understanding that 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage has commissioned a study to 
seek out alternative means of funding for the CBC. He has also 
stated publicly that he is in favour of partially privatizing the 
CBC.
<P>
	Now that the CBC needs a new chairman, the minister has an 
opportunity to do two things. He can make good on the promise 
the Prime Minister made to give the standing committee more 
power by asking the committee to provide him with a list of 
three names for his consideration and appointment to the chair 
of the board of directors of the CBC.
<P>
	The CBC already procures more than 50 per cent of its 
Canadian drama from independent producers, up from 
essentially zero a decade ago. A policy to increase external 
drama purchases further would provide additional stimulus to 
the development of the competitive independent production 
industry and I suspect lead to lower production costs. As well, 
an idea to save money would be to encourage more co-operation 
between CBC's English language and French language network 
services. The exchange of programs should be actively pursued 
and some programs jointly produced or procured.
<P>
	Further to this we should do three things. First, the Canadian 
public needs more access to information about the CBC. The 
arm's length principle is often trotted out as an excuse to keep 
information from the public. Providing such information does 
not violate the cultural  integrity of this crown corporation, and 
it should not be exempt from the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Second, all financial information should be readily available 
to the public just as it is for any other government department. 
The auditor general should be required to regularly perform 
audits within the CBC based on general accounting principles. 
As well the AG should regularly perform forensic audits which 
should also be made public because presently this crown 
corporation under part X of the Financial Administration Act is 
exempt from regular forensic audits.
<P>
	Third and most important, it is not my job to develop the plan 
by which the CBC will reorganize itself. That is the job of the 
experts within the CBC and those financial advisers with the 
capabilities to assist them. Quite bluntly, and this is the core of 
my message, I believe the government should now direct the 
CBC as it directed Petro-Canada to prepare an initial public 
offering on the basis of complete or partial privatization of the 
CBC by the end of 1995. If the minister believes in partial 
privatization as he has stated then he can do no less.
<P>
	The timing for this share issue is critical. Employees in the 
CBC must sense that something is wrong. Talented individuals 
are defecting. They are bailing out. Ill-planned, unexpected 
budget cuts and juggling schedules have resulted in the loss of 
talent as well as lost corporate support. Something surely is 
rotten.
<P>
	What seems clear is that in an increasingly multichannel 
environment the current mandate of the CBC to provide a wide 
range of programming that informs, enlightens and entertains is 
too broad. Therefore the mandate of the CBC also needs to be 
revisited and made dramatically more specific so that the CBC 
is able to specialize as it downsizes and privatizes.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It cannot do everything it did, but if we make the difficult 
decisions now, it will survive in some form that can last for 
years.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the next few 
minutes, I would like to comment on the motion presented by the 
Reform member for Calgary Southeast. It is Motion No. 278, 
which advocates the partial or total privatization of the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	First of all, I want to say that my colleague, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, is not considering any privatization of the 
CBC. This corporation was created in 1936 by the Liberal 
government of the day especially to give Canadians control over 
broadcasting in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5687"> 5687 </A></B>
<P>
	Even today, the CBC remains the cornerstone of Canadian 
broadcasting policy. The present Liberal government also 
considers this national public broadcaster to be essential.
<P>
	The CBC has followed the evolution of our country over the 
decades and today its importance justifies its continuing to 
receive public funding. After all, it is thanks to the CBC that 
Canadians get to know one another better and stay in touch 
locally, regionally, nationally and with the whole world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The previous government had an addiction to privatization. It 
even had in hand a resolution passed by its party membership 
calling for the complete privatization of the CBC, but it too 
recognized that this was not a viable option. It was also the 
Mulroney government that took a scalpel to the corporation and 
forced some very painful surgery. In an interview given shortly 
after his appointment the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
described such treatment as de facto privatization.
<P>
	Our new government made a clear commitment prior to the 
October election. We committed to stop forcing the CBC into 
anorexic behaviour in recognition of the vital role it plays as a 
national cultural institution. We also committed to finding the 
right means of providing the corporation with stable, multiyear 
funding.
<P>
	Just three months after the election, on February 3, the 
government made its first stride toward meeting our 
commitment. At that time the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
announced a strategy for the CBC designed to give the 
corporation the capacity to plan for the future with confidence 
and to be the distinct Canadian voice we need as we continue to 
forge our national identity.
<P>
	The first step in this strategy was the Prime Minister's 
announcement of a new president for the CBC. With the 
appointment of Anthony Manera, the CBC can continue to 
benefit from the talents of an individual with a distinguished 
career both within the corporation and beyond. I beg to differ 
with the hon. member. I understand Mr. Manera has appeared 
twice before the committee and has been very forthcoming.
<P>
	Mr. Manera's commitment to the ideals of public 
broadcasting and his intimate understanding of the challenges 
facing the corporation were among the attributes which earned 
him the reins of our most important cultural institution.
<P>
	While the previous government's commitments are still filed 
under fiction our government has taken decisive action to 
achieve our commitment to stable, multiyear funding.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The government has already announced that it does not intend 
to impose new cuts on the CBC over the next five years. It is 
prepared to reprofile the cuts announced in April 1993 so that 
they can be more easily digested by  the CBC. In effect this 
reprofiling represents an investment of $100 million from the 
consolidated revenue fund as the program cuts will start to be 
implemented in 1996-97 rather than 1995-96.
<P>
	In addition to this reprieve the government has also 
recognized that the corporation needs more businesslike 
flexibility. This is being provided through the CBC's new power 
to borrow up to $25 million under highly specified 
circumstances and with the case by case approval of the Minister 
of Finance.
<P>
	Most recently the minister announced his intention to consult 
with his colleagues, the new CBC president, and other players in 
the industry to identify other revenue generating mechanisms 
for the CBC which could lead to a reduction in the corporation's 
dependence on commercial advertising revenues. The minister 
also confirmed recently that the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage of the House would undertake the review.
<P>
	These commitments are consistent with the government's 
desire to give the corporation some flexibility in terms of its 
strategic orientation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This government believes that instead of taking financial 
resources from public broadcasting for the benefit of private 
broadcasting, as the Reform Party's privatization proposal 
suggests, we must try to find ways to do the opposite.
<P>
	With the advent of many television services, all private, the 
government must mobilize resources for the public sector and 
for the production and dissemination of Canadian programs. In 
this multi-channel world, the government must ensure the 
survival of the distinctive Canadian voice which the CBC 
represents.
<P>
	That said, this government believes that the goal of 
redistributing resources for the benefit of the national public 
broadcaster can only be achieved through a public process in 
which parliamentarians, the general public and all concerned 
can participate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is mindful of the concern felt by all 
Canadians about the economic situation we are currently facing. 
Our strategy for the CBC is based on a shared approach. We have 
granted the CBC important tools designed to restore financial 
stability and provide the corporation with a clear planning 
horizon. At the same time we have made clear to the CBC that 
our financial flexibility is severely limited and that we have 
expectations on how the CBC will manage its affairs.
<P>
	Specifically the minister has notified the new president that 
the CBC would be expected to eliminate its structural shortfall 
and to absorb other costs, inflationary or otherwise, which may 
be required to carry out its operations. The government has 
asked that the CBC's development of a new corporate plan 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5688"> 5688 </A></B>
<P>
remain faithful to  the objective of maintaining its regional 
presence and existing radio services.
<P>
	These restrictions were deemed necessary in light of the 
unique and highly prized reputation of CBC radio services and 
the corporation's ability to serve national and regional 
audiences. We recognize the CBC is being asked to scale many 
challenges. We expect the corporation will have to adapt aspects 
of its operations. Over the course of the next several months the 
CBC will be on the receiving end of many suggestions about 
what kind of changes Canadians would be prepared to see 
undertaken.
<P>
	Nevertheless the uncertainty which has prevented the 
corporation from planning beyond the current fiscal year has 
been eliminated. It is now possible for the corporation to take 
long term decisions and make multiyear commitments or 
investments aimed at improving the efficiency of the 
corporation.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The most important result of these efficiencies is that they 
will allow the CBC to maximize its investment in the kind of 
quality Canadian programming we expect and need from CBC. 
It may be interesting to note that while technology has changed 
the issues and principles related to public broadcasting 
remained largely unchanged since the genesis of the CBC and its 
mandate.
<P>
	The royal commission on radio broadcasting examined the 
possibility of establishing a Canadian public broadcasting 
corporation for radio in 1929. This commission, the Aird 
commission, stressed that a public broadcasting system should 
provide national coverage and varied programming which 
would be informative, educational and entertaining.
<P>
	These principles have been echoed repeatedly in the 
parliamentary committee hearings, task forces and royal 
commissions dealing with broadcasting in 1951, 1957, 1963 and 
1986 and they remain as relevant today as they were 60 years 
ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian broadcasting system is definitely characterized 
by a fair sharing of-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. parliamentary 
secretary's time has expired. The hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, although the Bloc Quebecois may disagree 
emphatically with the way certain situations are dealt with at the 
CBC, it does not support the motion presented by the Reform 
Party member for Calgary-Southeast to privatize the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, a name that is indeed more in tune 
with the cultural profile of this Crown corporation.
<P>
	According to the Bloc Quebecois, our public radio and 
television network should be preserved, but the government 
should oblige the corporation to deal with its problems. We are 
primarily concerned about the challenge to the corporation in 
section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, especially in paragraphs (l) 
and (m) and in a number of subparagraphs which read as 
follows: ``The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation should 
provide a wide range of programming that informs, enlightens 
and entertains''. The programming should reflect Canada and its 
regions to national and regional audiences, while serving the 
special needs of those regions.
<P>
	The programming should be in English and in French, 
reflecting the different needs and circumstances of each official 
language community, including the particular needs and 
circumstances of English and French linguistic minorities. 
Finally, the programming should contribute to shared national 
consciousness and identity.
<P>
	But what is national identity and how should this mandate be 
interpreted? In Canada, the national identity is Canadian. So 
what is Canada? What is Canada about? How is it constituted? In 
addition to its aboriginal peoples, Canada has two founding 
peoples. There is more than one national identity in Canada and 
hence a problem for the CBC. Furthermore, the concept of 
Canadian identity does not include the Quebec identity. In fact, 
its purpose is to assimilate or even deny it. Canadian identity has 
the effect of acculturating Quebecers.
<P>
	Quebec's march towards sovereignty started in 1960 with 
Jean Lesage. It seems to me that if the CBC had fulfilled its 
mandate while remaining neutral and objective, if it had tried to 
inform and enlighten, the rest of Canada would not ask what 
does Quebec want. We have said many times that we want to 
control the economic, social, political and cultural levers that 
are essential to our development as a nation.
<P>
	Despite the reassurances of CBC president Anthony Manera 
that the mandate to contribute to a national identity will not 
interfere with the mandate to provide objective information and 
reflect the various views held in Canada, we are inclined to be 
sceptical. In fact, the most senior politicians in this country put a 
very different spin on this mandate and tend to cloud the issue.
<P>
	To the Prime Minister of Canada, this mandate means, and I 
will quote what he said in this House on June 16: ``The law says, 
in defining the mandate of the CBC, that it must inform people 
on the advantages Canada represents. This is the reason for the 
creation of the corporation. Objectivity is all we ask for''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5689"> 5689 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	As if objectivity only meant showing the advantages.
<P>
	To the Deputy Prime Minister, the corporation's mandate to 
contribute to national identity means, according to what she said 
on CBC radio on June 17, that the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation has a responsibility to acknowledge that one of its 
responsibilities is to promote Canadian unity.
<P>
	As for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, we know now that his 
political assistants regularly called the CBC to order it to 
promote Canadian unity, especially, it seems, during the 
Charlottetown episode.
<P>
	At that time, CBC management had issued instructions 
reminding its journalists of current policy on the coverage of the 
constitutional debate. A document, and I quote: ``also contains 
details concerning analysts and commentators''. According to 
management, any guests who had publicly taken a position on 
the question at issue were to be clearly identified as such. The 
document went on to say: ``If a political expert is an active 
sovereigntist, he must not be introduced simply as a professor of 
political science. If a commentator is a known supporter of 
unilingualism, this should be included in the introduction. 
Furthermore, one should point out, as appropriate, whether an 
editorial writer or columnist has taken a definite stand on the 
issues to be discussed.
<P>
	As for the separatist witch hunt within the CBC, this goes 
back a long time.
<P>
	In 1969, then president George Davidson was literally 
besieged by federal politicians who criticized the corporation's 
coverage that was biased towards the separatists.
<P>
	Tensions had risen to such a degree that when the Parti 
Quebecois was elected in 1976, the CRTC held public hearings 
on the subject, and its report made it clear that CBC reporting 
had observed the standards of professional reporting. However, 
many federal politicians, especially Quebec Liberals, argued 
that these journalists were not doing their job since the 
corporation had a mandate to promote national unity.
<P>
	Former president Al Johnson said, and I am quoting Wayne 
Skene in his <I>Fade to Black: a requiem for the CBC</I>, referring to 
interference from federal Liberal members: ``They made my life 
hell''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, considering the position taken by government 
members and their interpretation of the corporation's mandate, 
there is no indication it will be any different during the next 
provincial election and an eventual referendum, except for the 
assurances given by the president of the CBC. We will take him 
at his word, until further notice.
<P>
	Before the advent of television, Quebecers listened to the 
radio. They listened to radio serials and to the daily news 
programs throughout the war. Not long after television 
appeared, Quebec was coming out of the  so-called Dark Ages. 
Father Legault and his Compagnons de Saint-Laurent, the 
TNM, the Rideau-Vert and a number of celebrities who came 
over from France had made Quebecers develop an appetite for 
culture. The corporation was to continue this work, and the 
development of Quebec's cultural potential during the past 
thirty years was possible largely to the existence of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	We remember travel documentaries with commentary by 
André Laurendeau, important political broadcasts with Judith 
Jasmin, ``Point de mire'' with René Lévesque, ``Le 60'' with 
Pierre Nadeau, ``Noir sur Blanc'' with Denise Bombardier, big 
variety shows, tv dramas which introduced us to a host of 
authors and which were also an opportunity for Quebecers to 
make a living by writing; tv series, either historical or 
contemporary, with rural or urban settings, concerts of every 
description, the ``Soirée du hockey'', and many more.
<P>
	There is one particular sector I know very well, in which the 
corporation performed superbly, and I am referring to television 
programming for children, which has left several generations 
with some unforgettable memories. Remember ``Pépinot et 
Capucine'', ``M. Surprise'', ``Grugeot et Délicat'', ``Marie 
Quat'poches'', ``la Souris verte'' and ``Bobino''!
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Speaker, I feel I must mention one area where the 
corporation showed poor judgment, and I am referring to its 
decision to close television stations in eastern Quebec. I hope 
that as the corporation considers ways to deal with its problems, 
it will find a way to give eastern Quebec its voice again and thus 
improve the way it fulfils one of its mandates which is, and I 
quote: ``to reflect Canada and its regions to national and 
regional audiences, while serving the special needs of those 
regions''.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed 
a pleasure to rise in this House in support of my colleague's 
private members' motion 278 which calls for the federal 
government to immediately initiate the privatization of all or 
part of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	The topic of privatizing the CBC comes at a very interesting 
time. During debate on Bill C-17, the ominbus bill on budget 
implementation, it was no surprise that members of the 
government opposite were staunchly defending the CBC. They 
claimed the CBC is the vehicle for protecting Canadian tradition 
and heritage with its programming.
<P>
	However, today I would be very interested to hear what these 
same members of the Liberal Party would say. Several weeks 
ago CBC television announced it was changing its 
programming. It is now going to make a grab for ratings and 
revenue with a fall schedule that has  more U.S. drama and fewer 
Canadian entertainment programs in prime time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5690"> 5690 </A></B>
<P>
	It would appear that CBC television is moving away from 
being the voice which preserves Canadian culture. It would 
appear the CBC television is moving away from programming 
which is chock full of Canadian heritage.
<P>
	It would appear the arguments used by numerous Liberals 
during the Bill C-17 debate now have a somewhat hollow ring to 
them. The fiscal and economic realities of the day demand that 
the CBC make these changes. I submit that for the CBC to 
become truly viable and competitive it should move toward 
privatization.
<P>
	It is quite interesting to note how times have changed. In the 
words of CBC vice president, Jim Byrd, it would be nice if we 
could stick our heads in the sand and say let us not worry about 
revenue. Mr. Byrd realizes that the CBC cannot proceed this way 
as he explained why the corporation is moving toward more U.S. 
programming. Not long ago this type of head in the sand 
thinking was indeed the norm for CBC. Given the debate on Bill 
C-17 it would appear that line of thinking was prevalent among 
some members of this House.
<P>
	Unfortunately Canadian taxpayers can no longer afford to 
foot the $1 billion plus bill it costs to run the CBC every year. 
The taxpayer thinks in terms of dollars and cents. The taxpayer 
cannot understand why he or she must pay for something they 
generally seem not to want.
<P>
	If one looks at the ratings of the CBC it becomes apparent that 
the CBC is not a very high priority for Canadians. In the 
interests of clarity I will outline 10 reasons why the CBC should 
move toward privatization.
<P>
	The taxpayer of this country would seem to demand it 
according to the ratings and the fiscal realities that face the 
government demand it as well.
<P>
	First, only 15 per cent of television viewers watched the 
CBC's English network for some part of the day in the 1990-91 
season. The trend continued into the 1992-93 season when only 
13.5 per cent of the viewing audience were tuning in to CBC 
television.
<P>
	Reason number two is the declining audience viewing CBC 
during prime time which is between 7 and 11 p.m. In 1990-91 
only 15.8 per cent of viewers were watching the CBC during 
prime time hours, which is any network's bread and butter. Two 
years later only 13.6 per cent were watching.
<P>
	The third reason the CBC should be privatized lies within the 
programming. Huge sums of money are being squandered. A 
case in point is the marginal French service being offered by 
CBC radio stations in many parts of the country. CBUF-FM, the 
CBC's French language FM radio station in Vancouver, has a 
staff of 25 and an annual budget of $2.2 million. Its average 
audience in any given quarter hour over its entire broadcast area 
is 100 people. This is according to the Bureau of Broadcast  
Measurement. It is quite obvious that this is not an optimum use 
of taxpayers' money.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The fourth reason, and it is similar to the previous one, can be 
seen in Edmonton's French language station, CHFA, which has a 
staff of 32 and an annual budget of $2.4 million. Again, 
according to the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement, the station 
is lucky if it tops 600 listeners.
<P>
	The fifth reason is that overall funding is increasing for the 
CBC while the number of people tuning in is decreasing. 
According to the CBC's 1993 financial statement, over $941 
million was spent on CBC television. One year earlier $913 
million was spent. What is the justification for spending $28 
million more on CBC television when fewer people are 
watching?
<P>
	The sixth reason is that overall funding for CBC radio 
services went up from $293 million in 1992 to over $307 million 
in 1993 but listnership is declining. In 1991, 12.6 per cent of the 
listening audience had their dial tuned into CBC English radio. 
One year later only 11.7 per cent were listening.
<P>
	A similar pattern occurs when we consider CBC French radio. 
In the spring of 1990, 9.1 per cent were tuned in compared to 
only 8.7 per cent in the fall of 1992. What is the justification for 
funding increases?
<P>
	Reason number seven is the poor performance of CBC 
English television during the supper hour from 6 to 7 p.m. The 
regional CBC television stations cannot compete with their 
private counterparts during the all-important news hour.
<P>
	In Edmonton the CBC news hauled in a paltry 8 per cent of 
viewers during the supper hour in 1992. In 1993 viewership 
dropped to 5 per cent. The same can be said on almost all 
regional CBC networks. In Regina the CBC was watched by 25 
per cent of the viewers during the news hour in 1992. That 
number was cut by over half with only 12 per cent watching in 
1993. The trend seems to be nationwide, fewer people watching, 
yet it takes more and more money to run the CBC.
<P>
	Reason number eight is something called debt. Recent 
estimates put the CBC at a shortfall of $180 million over the 
next four years. The CBC has a $45 million deficit on its 
operating budget on revenues of over $1 billion.
<P>
	Reason number nine deals with the CBC's power to borrow 
money. Why is the federal government allowing the CBC to 
borrow money in the first place? Would it not be more 
financially sound to privatize, at the very least, portions of its 
operations, thereby realizing substantial savings? The savings 
could then be applied to finance new cost effective ventures.
<P>
	Last but not least, the tenth reason for privatizing the CBC is 
the very nature of its existence. The CBC is changing its 
mandate. No longer will CBC television be the vehicle for 
Canadian culture and heritage. It is moving to more U.S. content 
in order to boost its ratings.  Taxpayer dollars are no longer 
required to support the old mandate of protecting and promoting 
Canadian culture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5691"> 5691 </A></B>
<P>
	For the CBC to have the incentive to go after advertising 
dollars and increase its ratings, it certainly should move toward 
privatization. Privatization would ensure a viable CBC that 
should make money rather than fritter it away.
<P>
	In the last 10 years about 2,000 jobs have been cut at the CBC 
in an effort to downsize and streamline the crown corporation. 
Despite drastic cuts to the staff budget, CBC's deficit continues 
to climb. There is no incentive at the management level to 
ensure a bottom line.
<P>
	The federal government took another step toward killing the 
CBC's profit motive by giving it the authority to borrow another 
$25 million. As long as this type of practice continues the CBC 
will remain an indebted corporation, and that is unacceptable to 
Canadian taxpayers. It is time for a major overhaul of ``mother 
corporation''.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin my speech on this motion by reading an excerpt 
from my party's official pre-election program ``Creating 
Opportunities'', commonly referred to as the red book.
<P>
	``Canadian culture embraces our shared perceptions and 
beliefs, common experiences and values, and diverse linguistic 
and cultural identities: everything that makes us uniquely 
Canadian. Culture is the very essence of national identity, the 
bedrock of national sovereignty and national pride. It gives 
meaning to the lives of every Canadian and enriches the country 
socially, politically and economically''.
<P>
	At a time when globalization and the information and 
communications revolution are erasing national borders, 
Canada needs more than ever to commit itself to cultural 
development.
<P>
	Since its creation in 1936, the CBC has been and continues to 
be an essential mechanism for defending our national cultural 
sovereignty.
<P>
	The motion now before the House deals with the possibility of 
privatizing all or part of the CBC. Let me just take a few minutes 
to remind the House of the services provided by the CBC and the 
raison d'être of Crown corporations. The Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation was created on November 2, 1936 
pursuant to an act of Parliament. It reports annually to 
Parliament on its activities through the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. Its provides comprehensive national broadcasting 
services in both official languages, that is French and English, in 
addition to running the Northern Service and Radio Canada 
International, a shortwave service for listeners abroad.
<P>
	The CBC is governed by the Broadcasting Act and is regulated 
by the CRTC, the Canadian Radio-television and 
Telecommunications Commission.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The CBC has a permanent staff level of approximately 9,100 
people. Seventy-five per cent of these employees are involved 
in program production and distribution, with the remainder 
providing administrative and support services. Apart from its 
own employees, each year the CBC provides work to about 
25,000 Canadian artists, writers and performers such as 
musicians, soloists, members of groups or orchestras, singers, 
graphic artists, authors, critics, dancers, actors and actresses, to 
name a few.
<P>
	It is the largest single employer of Canadian artists and has 
provided a training ground for many of our finest Canadian 
stars. Anne Murray, receiving one of her numerous and well 
deserved awards recently, thanked the CBC for giving her the 
chance so many years ago to launch her career.
<P>
	The CBC has helped to develop and establish a wealth of 
Canadian stars whose unique ability to express their vision of 
Canada and what it is to be Canadian has helped us to know 
ourselves and each other. Without the CBC, Canadians would 
not have had the opportunity to share and appreciate the rich 
cultural diversity of our English, French, aboriginal and ethnic 
communities.
<P>
	Talent development remains a key objective for the CBC. 
Variety specials with Canadian music stars and new Canadian 
artists as guests, the broadcasting of the Genie, Gemini and Juno 
awards programs are important tools through which our artists 
reach their public and gain national and international exposure.
<P>
	The need for talent development is critical today, and of 
course more remains to be done. In an era in which new 
technology further fragments audiences and globalization 
diminishes national boundaries, the CBC's role in ensuring that 
there is a service to which Canadians can turn to see our images, 
hear our stories and be inspired by our artists is now more vital 
than ever.
<P>
	The CBC is the principal instrument of the government's 
cultural policy. In 1994-95 its parliamentary appropriation is 
approximately $1 billion, representing 62 per cent of all federal 
appropriations to cultural agencies in the portfolio of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. In addition the corporation 
expects to raise some $396 million this fiscal year, mostly from 
television advertising, bringing its total resources to $1.4 
billion.

<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	With this funding the CBC offers and extensive array of 
separate services:
<P>
	English and French television networks;
<P>
	English and French AM mono and FM stereo radio networks, 
free of commercial advertising;
<P>
	CBC North which covers more than four million square 
kilometres encompassing the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and 
Arctic Quebec by providing radio and television programs in 
English, French and eight native languages, also provides 
specialized training services for native broadcasters and 
journalists;
<P>
	Newsworld, 24-hour national satellite to cable English 
language news and information service funded entirely by cable 
subscription and commercial advertising revenues but achieves 
its quality level by making extensive re-use of news and current 
affairs programming that is drawing on public funding;
<P>
	Radio Canada International, a shortwave radio service which 
broadcasts in seven languages, provides material specifically 
targeted for Canadians abroad, consisting of the most popular 
domestic CBC programs, and plays an important role in 
promoting Canadian artists abroad, is managed by the CBC and 
financed by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Both the English and French television networks have reached 
a remarkable 88 per cent Canadian content level in prime time. 
The television networks provide a balanced mix of news, current 
affairs, dramas, arts, science, music, variety, sports and 
children's programs.
<P>
	Including the non-prime time schedule, about 69 per cent of 
CBC television broadcast by the English and French networks is 
Canadian produced though not necessarily all by the CBC.
<P>
	The corporation is an important outlet for the work of 
Canada's independent production community. In fact, about 48 
per cent of Canadian entertainment programs shown in prime 
time are produced either entirely by independent producers or in 
conjunction with outside producers or agencies.
<P>
	While AM radio covers music and entertainment, its 
programming is primarily informational. FM stereo produces a 
wide variety of music, drama, arts and literary programs. All 
four radio networks offer Canadians commercial free, 
intelligent, appealing, and unique Canadian programming for 
which they have achieved a devoted following.
<P>
	About 99 per cent of English and French speaking Canadians 
have access to CBC television. Almost 94 per cent of English 
and French speaking Canadians have access to CBC AM mono 
radio in their respective languages and 70 per cent of 
anglophones and 76 per cent of francophones have access to 
CBC FM stereo in their respective languages.
<P>
	The ability to reach so much of our population comprised of 
two official language communities, scattered over a huge 
amount of rugged terrain and no less than six different time 
zones is a major technological challenge for the corporation.
<P>
	Like the railroad, the CBC links Canadians every single day 
of the year in my riding with aboriginal peoples in the north, 
farmers on the prairies, fishermen on the east and west coasts, 
and everyone in between.
<P>
	The CBC is also a proud ambassador abroad. In addition to the 
important role played by Radio Canada International, it 
maintains formal and informal contact with at least 10 
international broadcasting unions and associations. It also 
encourages program exchanges and participates in more than 50 
radio and television festivals around the world through which 
our artists and programming are promoted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, the CBC's mission is to carry out the official 
purposes set forth in the Broadcasting Act and it has the duty to 
conduct its activities in accordance with sound business 
practices. I fully agree with hon. opposition members in this 
House who think that we are going through a difficult economic 
period and that we should scrutinize every dollar of taxpayers' 
money that we spend. Nevertheless, advocating the total 
privatization of the CBC suggests that section 3 of the 
Broadcasting Act could be satisfied by the private sector or that 
we are prepared to forget about meeting the objectives stated 
there. Neither of these assertions is correct. Providing 
authentically Canadian broadcasting services of good quality to 
the whole country has never been and undoubtedly never will be 
something that the private sector could do profitably.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The efforts made to build our country never met the criteria of 
strict profitability. Nevertheless, we have built a remarkable 
country of which my constituents and I are immensely proud and 
the CBC has helped to shape it.
<P>
	My colleague has already told you about the significant 
support measures that the government has offered the CBC. 
Nevertheless, given the serious financial difficulties before the 
government in the coming days, the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation is fully aware that it might have to change some 
aspects of its activities. If the CBC, in assessing how to face 
future difficulties, concludes that it could better serve the 
Canadian public by privatizing some particular aspects of its 
activities, the Minister of Canadian Heritage will let the CBC 
make that decision, as he said.

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to inform the 
House that an agreement has been reached, pursuant to Standing 
Order 78(2), with regard to an allocation of time to the report 
stage and the third reading stage of Bill C-34. Therefore, I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in relation to Bill C-34, an act respecting self-government for First 
Nations in the Yukon Territory, not more than one hour shall be allotted to the 
consideration of the report stage of the said bill, and not more than one hour 
shall be allotted to the consideration of the third reading stage of the said bill 
and, at the expiry of each of the said hours, any proceedings before the House 
shall be interrupted, if required for the purpose of this order, and, in turn, every 
question necessary for the disposal of the report stage or the third reading stage, 
as the case may be, of the bill shall be put forthwith and successively without 
further debate or amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Is it 
appropriate or permissible for the government to bring in 
closure before the bill is even debated?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. House leader for the Reform 
Party has asked a question to which the answer appears to be yes. 
Standing Order 78(2) which the member will have on his desk 
makes it very clear that in a situation such as outlined, the 
motion can be moved.
<P>
	For example, it was a minister of the crown who moved it. 
More important, it is the majority of the representatives of 
several parties who have come to an agreement in respect of the 
proposed allotment of time and so on, it seems to me, down the 
line. I believe that this motion is a sharper one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State

House that an agreement has been reached pursuant to Standing 
Order 78(2) with regard to an allocation of time for the report 
stage and the third reading stage of Bill C-33.
<P>
	Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in relation to Bill C-33, an act to approve, give effect to and declare valid land 
claims agreements entered into between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, the 
government of the Yukon Territory and certain first nations in the Yukon Territory, to 
provide for approving, giving effect to and declaring valid other land claims 
agreements entered into after this act comes into force, and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, not more than one hour shall be allotted to the consideration 
of the report stage of the said bill and not more  than one hour shall be allotted to the 
consideration of the third reading stage of the said bill and, at the expiry of each of the 
said hours, any proceedings before the House shall be interrupted, if required for the 
purpose of this Order, and, in turn, every question necessary for the disposal of the 
report stage or the third reading stage, as the case may be, of the bill shall be put 
forthwith and successively without further debate or amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This afternoon I 
was engaged in committee. The government has throughout this 
session of Parliament stressed the importance of committee 
work. I also find it very important to be here for a vote, although 
the loyal and Official Opposition and also the government have 
decided that they would take this away from me, my privilege to 
vote on this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The point the member was making was 
a question for debate. On a point of order, the hon. member for 
Elk Island.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, mine is truly a point 
of order.
<P>
	Standing Order 78 says explicitly that there is agreement 
among the representatives of all parties.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	I submit that this action is not correct because we are still a 
party notwithstanding what is thought here and therefore this 
motion is not appropriate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is quite right in 
referring to Standing Order 78(1). That is where all the parties 
agree, as he has just indicated. What he will have to look at is 
Standing Order 78(2)(<I>a</I>) where it is a majority of the parties that 
have agreed.
<P>
	I thank the member for raising the point because it gives me 
an opportunity to say that this motion has also been considered 
carefully. It is a valid motion under Standing Order 78(2). 
Accordingly the members will vote on that motion.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Does the 
government have to give a reason to limit debate for an hour or 
can it just do it?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is not a point of order. That is a 
point of information.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-34, an act 
respecting self-government for First Nations in the Yukon 
Territory, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
There has been quite a change in the scenery over the last hour 
with four closure motions being passed. It lends some doubt as 
to what the intention of the government is in the order of bills we 
have brought forward. I wonder if the government would bring 
forward some type of statement as to the bills it plans to bring 
forward and the order in which it intends to consider them.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I might ask the 
assistance of the hon. parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to the hon. member 
we will be calling this evening Bill C-34 for report stage, then 
Bill C-33 for report stage, one hour on each. Then we will 
proceed I believe with Bill C-32 unless discussions between the 
parties result in some other arrangement. I believe that will be 
the order for this evening which should take us to ten o'clock.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of the events and an 
hon. member calls it a disaster, I would move that this House do 
now adjourn.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Members cannot move 
adjournment on a point of order, but only in fact when they 
rightfully have the floor on debate.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There are three

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOTIONSINAMENDMENT">MOTIONS IN AMENDMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-34, in Clause 5, be amended, by striking out lines 40 to 45 on page 3 
and lines 1 to 4, on page 4.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House do now adjourn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I can propose the 
motion for adjournment, the hon. member will have to submit 
the motion in writing to the chair and include a seconder of the 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	The motion for adjournment is ruled out of order. The hon. 
member for Athabasca, in moving the motion for adjournment, 
cannot move an amendment to his own motion which would 
have the effect of superseding his motion if passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to voice my 
disappointment and concern over the process that just took 
place. How can we expect to believe the provisions of the bill if 
the drafter of the bill and the supporters of the bill would put us 
through a process of not allowing us to debate the amendments 
and bills fully and properly?
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	The amendments we are putting forth would have had some 
impact on our decision whether or not to support the bill at third 
reading. Having been through a process which I believe is a real 
abuse of the parliamentary process, I do not hold out real hope 
for the success of the agreements these bills bring into effect.
<P>
	Even more so, it goes to emphasize the serious concerns we 
are raising in the amendments we are bringing forward. The first 
amendment to clause 5(2) has the effect of removing from the 
agreement those 10 First Nations that have not yet signed final 
agreements.
<P>
	Those 10 First Nations would be the Carcross-Tagish First 
Nation, the Dawson First Nation, the Kluane First Nation, the 
Kwanlin Dun First Nation, the Liard First Nation, the Little 
Salmon-Carmacks First Nation, the Ross River Dena Council, 
the Selkirk First Nation, the Ta'an Kwach'an Council, and the 
White River First Nation.
<P>
	Those First Nations, as well as the four First Nations covered 
by this agreement, should have genuine concern with the 
process. We are abolishing the designation of an aboriginal band 
in this piece of legislation and replacing it with an organization 
called a first nation.
<P>
	Under the Indian Act and under present legislation the rights 
of aboriginal peoples are protected as Indian bands. Until the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5699"> 5699 </A></B>
<P>
bill becomes legislation and has royal assent the 10 First 
Nations are in limbo. They have lost their rights as aboriginal 
bands and have not yet attained  rights as First Nations. If I were 
a member of one of these bands I would be certainly concerned 
with situation. The whole process calls into question what we 
are trying to achieve.
<P>
	If I were a member of one of those First Nations I would have 
seriously considered the situation before being willing to sell 
my rights as an aboriginal person for the few dollars being 
provided here. Certainly there are legal questions and legal 
concerns about where this process leaves the aboriginal rights 
afforded to aboriginals through the treaty process, through the 
Indian Act and legislation that has gone before.
<P>
	Through a simple amendment to the legislation before us in 
the bill those First Nations could lose their aboriginal rights and 
they could be extinguished in that process. Not only do I believe 
these things, but I have been contacted by a number of First 
Nations groups that also have the problem. Even a number of the 
groups that have yet to sign on with final agreements covered 
under the umbrella agreement have those concerns, particularly 
the extinguishment of the right of the tax exempt status. That 
should be of great concern.
<P>
	Further to that the 10 nations that have not signed on will not 
come before Parliament to be examined, to be evaluated and to 
be discussed. Where does it leave us as members of Parliament 
when we abdicate our responsibility as a Parliament to examine 
legislation before it and delegate that authority to the governor 
in council?
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	If there is nothing different in the next 10 agreements why are 
they not signed on as final agreements at this point? If there are 
different provisions in the 10 agreements why should not 
Parliament have a chance to examine these differences, to 
debate them and to discuss them? If we as parliamentarians do 
not need to examine the 10 future agreements why are we going 
through the somewhat convoluted process of examining the four 
that are there?
<P>
	There are some very serious questions to be answered. I hoped 
we could have had support for this amendment as well as the 
other two amendments that we proposed. Clearly that is not to 
be. We are not to have serious discussion and serious debate on 
the issues. That saddens me truly for Canada's parliamentary 
process, for Canada's people, and for Canada's aboriginal 
people. It is a sad day for the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a pleasure to be able to finally speak to the issue. There is 
such concern from the party for aboriginal people what can I 
say? It is from the same party that thinks we are giving away 
large tracts of land to the aboriginal people and that we are 
giving away large amounts of money to the aboriginal people. 
All of a sudden there is all this concern for the poor aboriginal 
people. We have to be consistent when we are talking about 
whether we are supporting aboriginal people or whether we are 
against the process they are trying to go through.
<P>
	Before I comment on the amendment I received a letter 
attached to the <I>Toronto Sun</I> about the member from the Reform 
Party apologizing for depicting us as spoiled or denying 
depicting us as spoiled. The letter quite clearly follows the lines 
of the attitude of the Reform Party. It says: ``Hey, Jack, if it is 
any consolation we also think our natives are a bunch of lazy, 
drunken layabouts who have been fleecing we hardworking fed 
up taxpayers for too long. Cut all the federal money they get and 
make them, the whole lot of them, work for their keep. Let's see 
if they can make it on their own, but I doubt it''.
<P>
	This letter shows the ignorance of some Canadian people. 
Who do they think the land came from? Whose land does this 
person think it is? That letter is ridiculous. It basically follows 
the lines of the remarks made in the House by a member of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	The Reform's amendment would delete subclauses 5(2) and 
(3). Subclause 5(1) brings into effect the self-government 
agreements of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the 
First Nation of Nacho Hyak Dun, the Teslin Tlingit Council, and 
the Vuntut Gwitch'in First Nation on the day this act comes into 
force. That is subclause (1).
<P>
	Subclause (2), which they would delete, provides that the 
remaining 10 First Nations self-government agreements may be 
brought into effect by order in council.
<P>
	Subclause (3), another one they would delete, ensures that the 
effective date of a self-government agreement will be published 
in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>.
<P>
<B>(1945 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform's amendment would delete subclauses (2) and (3) 
of clause 5 so that each of the remaining 10 First Nations 
self-government agreements would have to be brought into 
effect by other acts of Parliament. The proposed amendment 
would also move the requirement by the minister to publish the 
effective date of these self-government agreements.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 is unacceptable because, one, the process of 
bringing the subsequent 10 self government agreements into 
effect should be the same as the process used to bring the land 
claims agreement into effect. This clause mirrors a clause in Bill 
C-33. The amendment  would create inconsistent processes and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5700"> 5700 </A></B>
<P>
would defeat the intention in the land claims agreement to allow 
for orders in council to bring future agreements into effect.
<P>
	Two, clause 5 does not prevent Parliament from reviewing 
any future agreements.
<P>
	Three, this bill establishes the parameters of the subsequent 
10 self-government agreements. These parameters cannot be 
exceeded in the negotiation of the subsequent 10 
self-government agreements.
<P>
	For all the reasons I just cited, the government finds Motion 
no. 1 unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Motion No. 1 talks about deleting clause 5 of Bill 
C-34. This provision in the bill speaks volumes about the 
Liberal government commitment to governing with integrity. 
We have seen that again in spades tonight.
<P>
	I quote from its famous red ink book: ``People are irritated 
with governments that do not consult them or disregard their 
views or that try to conduct key parts of the public business 
behind closed doors. Open government will be the watchword of 
the Liberal program''.
<P>
	This is not my main beef. My main beef is that this bill 
displays a serious lack of parliamentary accountability and 
scrutiny. It is a blank cheque for the government through order 
in council to make or ratify all future agreements in Yukon.
<P>
	In our view, Parliament has a responsibility to the people of 
Canada to carefully consider and pass judgment on any initiative 
within its legislative agenda, but particularly in matters as 
important as aboriginal self-government. Self-government is a 
critical policy initiative which deserves the highest level of care 
that Parliament can muster. As I noted earlier, this would be 
evident to any impartial observer.
<P>
	The legislative journey of Bill C-34 appears to involve undue 
haste for even a conventional piece of legislation. However, this 
bill is anything but conventional. It is extraordinary because in 
it Parliament delegates its fundamental responsibilities to the 
executive and bureaucratic branches of government. This 
delegation takes place in the context of critically important 
questions of what place will our aboriginal nations take within 
our federal state.
<P>
	Parliament is being asked to breach its constitutional role in 
and responsibility to enact legislation in the public forum of 
Parliament. What is being sought is approval for a process 
legislatively to which the Government of Canada and its 
bureaucrats in negotiation with First Nations developed 
fundamental legislation in private. Thus, what Parliament is 
being asked to do and do extraordinarily quickly is engage in 
radical constitutional irresponsibility.
<P>
	With respect to the 10 bands which have not yet entered into 
self-government and have not negotiated final agreements and 
transboundary agreements, let us remember that these 
agreements are integral parts of this legislative package. 
Parliament is being asked to approve legislation it has not seen 
and will never see. Not only do these agreements I just 
mentioned have the status of legislation, but according to the act 
they enjoy paramountcy over the self-government act. Even the 
existing agreements which are part of this package can in the 
future be amended in very fundamental ways.
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	Truly astonishing, anti-democratic and totally 
unconventional, the legislation provides that the 
self-government agreement and amendments thereto may go 
beyond the subject areas dealt with by the act. These agreements 
can be brought into effect upon the coming into force of the act. 
This gives the self-government agreement some legislative 
status. As long as there is no conflict between Bill C-34 and the 
provisions in the self-government agreement, these provisions 
are valid.
<P>
	Moreover, they can be brought into force without the scrutiny 
and indeed even the knowledge of Parliament as law by the 
governor in council making orders and regulations to implement 
self-government.
<P>
	This time allocation has placed me in a situation where I have 
a lot of information I cannot get.
<P>
	I want to speak to Motion No. 2.
<P>
	Existing clause 9, the delegation provision is such that a First 
Nation can delegate its law-making power-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I do not want to 
add to the confusion. Quite to the contrary. While members still 
want to speak to Motion No. 1, we must continue that debate as I 
understand it. Unless the member has other remarks he wants to 
make to Motion No. 1, I will seek if other members in fact want 
to speak to this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, assuming I have more time on 
Motion No. 1, I will carry on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If the member is going to 
continue to speak to Motion No. 1 certainly he has the floor, but 
if he is going to go to any other motion I would have to ask him 
to give the floor to some other member who might want to speak 
to Motion No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Just for clarification, am I not restricted to 10 
minutes on Motion No. 1?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> These agreements, most of which have not been 
negotiated and therefore are unavailable for Parliament's 
scrutiny and which may be amended in any event even if 
existing prevail over the provisions of Bill C-34, have not been 
negotiated, go beyond the act and its provisions may be enacted 
by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5701"> 5701 </A></B>
<P>
law by the governor in council. There is nothing in Bill C-34 
which precludes this sort of amendment.
<P>
	In our view the combined effects of all this is that the 
legislation has invested parliamentary powers in the First 
Nations, bureaucrats and the executive branch of government. 
Surely this is an improper delegation of legislative powers, what 
the Supreme Court in re Grey, 1918, 57SCR. 157, 165, 171 and 
176 referred to as an unlawful and therefore invalid abdication, 
abandonment or surrender of Parliament's power.
<P>
	The Constitution of Canada contemplates that legislation be 
enacted by representative houses of assembly, not by 
bureaucrats negotiating with First Nations and not even elected 
members of government executing their executive and 
administrative functions.
<P>
	Accordingly, I am concerned that what Parliament is engaged 
in here is an abuse of power which undermines the integrity of 
the parliamentary process. Minimally we collectively need 
more time to think through the consequences of what we are 
doing. After all we are not faced with a national emergency that 
requires the best possible but nevertheless instant response of 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>
	There are three motions in amendment on the <I>Notice Paper</I> 
for the report stage of Bill C-33, an act to approve, give effect to 
and declare valid land claims agreements entered into between 
Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, the Government of

	Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted upon separately.

<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOTIONSINAMENDMENT">MOTIONS IN AMENDMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-33 be amended by deleting Clause 5.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as mentioned, Motion No. 1 deals with 
the provision for future Yukon land claim agreements to be 
ratified by order in council and not by Parliament.
<P>
	Of course it is common for legislation to delegate to the 
governor in council the responsibility to implement broad 
legislative principles to provide the details so to speak. We have 
no problem with that.
<P>
	Parliament should be concerned with broad matters of social 
policy and not the minutiae of implementation. The normal rule 
relating to the promulgation of regulations and other forms of 
subordinate legislation are very telling. Subordinate legislation 
is invalid unless it is specifically authorized by the act. 
Regulations which go beyond the scope of a provision are 
invalid, what the legal system calls ultra vires.
<P>
	The basic ideas is that Parliament, not government, makes law 
and policy. Subordinate bodies may be delegated the task of 
implementing this law and with it the underlying social policy 
objectives sought to be accomplished by Parliament.
<P>
	Bills C-33 and C-34 through the clever expediency of 
providing for final and transboundary agreements skirt around 
the convention and good sense of the ordinary rules of 
delegation to subordinate bodies. These agreements, most of 
which have not been negotiated and therefore are unavailable 
for parliamentary scrutiny and which may be amended in any 
event, even if existing, prevail over the provisions of Bills C-33 
and C-34.
<P>
	Moreover, land claim agreements and most of these have not 
been negotiated, can go beyond the act and its provisions may be 
enacted as law by the governor in council.
<P>
<B>(2055 ) </B>
<P>
	The result is that without Parliament's involvement, laws of 
great import may be formulated. For example, an agreement 
could provide or be amended to provide a limitation of liability 
for a First Nation or one of its citizens for any misconduct, 
default of debt, even breach of fiduciary obligation or fraud.
<P>
	If this type of provision is not presently permitted, this can be 
altered through the amendment of the relevant agreement. There 
is nothing in these bills that precludes this sort of amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to have a chance to speak to this 
bill as well as the motion. I would like to start off by 
acknowledging the presence in the gallery of people from the 
Council for Yukon Indians who are eagerly awaiting the passage 
of these bills.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote from the 
presentation to the aboriginal affairs standing committee from 
Miss Judy Gingell, the chair of the Council for Yukon Indians, 
with regard to the agreements that we are debating here today: 
``These agreements manifest a vision of our elders. Our elders 
maintained that our homelands must be protected in a manner 
that allows the sharing and natural resources with other 
Canadians. Our elders have instilled in us a great respect for 
other cultures and other people. Their visions of justice and 
fairness form the basis of our agreements''.
<P>
	We are debating these couple of motions with regard to 
amendments to Bill C-33. This has to do with the land claims. 
When we were trying to deal with the issue of land claims, this 
has taken some 21 years to date to come to this state.
<P>
	It started by being a vision, a dream. It started by being 
something that people wanted to talk about but did not really 
have any understanding of what it would all lead to. Twenty-one 
years later this is what it is coming to.
<P>
	I am very honoured to have taken a part in helping that dream 
come true. As well, I am sure that thanks and appreciation go to 
all the negotiators over the years on the government side and on 
the CYI side, and of course all the Yukon Indian people as well 
as the non-Indians whose hopes and trust are placed in the 
success of these agreements.

<P>
	As we have found out in the last few days, these two bills have 
the support of all the Yukoners. We had the Yukon territorial 
government, the Council for Yukon Indians, the member of 
Parliament for Yukon and others all supporting these two bills.
<P>
	In supporting this bill, we are making the dreams of Yukoners 
come true. In light of the local support, the position of the 
Reform Party which has opposed these bills from the outset can 
only be characterized as decidedly undemocratic.
<P>
	The Reform Party which professes to uphold and respect the 
wishes and the will of the people has shown profound disrespect 
and contempt for the people of Yukon. The Reform's effort to 
thwart this bill and the will of the people from the Yukon 
through this process has been appalling.
<P>
	What is most disturbing about the position of the Reform 
Party in all this in my view is it does not really even care what 
happens in the Yukon. It is more concerned about the potential 
land claims agreements in British Columbia.
<P>
	By imposing its fears and concerns about land claims in B.C. 
and Yukon, it forced Yukoners and especially Yukon Indian 
people to unnecessary stress and indignities.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. It seemed to me 
that this was a treatise about the Yukon self-government bill not 
about how dreadful the Reform Party is. We were asked to keep 
these discussions specifically to the amendment. I would ask the 
hon. member to withdraw that and address-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I believe that is not a 
point of order but a matter of debate. The hon. parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, rather than lecturing Yukoners, 
members of the Reform Party should be humbly taking lessons 
from them. Through compromise and consensus Yukoners of all 
origins have built a foundation for their future together. This is 
not social and government engineering, as the member of the 
Reform Party has called it, it is nation building.
<P>
	On February 14, 1973, Chief Elijah Smith and all Yukon First 
Nations chiefs presented a petition to Canada to negotiate a 
comprehensive claim settlement agreement. The petition was 
entitled: ``Together Today For Our Children Tomorrow''. On 
that same day Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau accepted 
the Yukon Indian request to commence negotiations.
<P>
	Our present Prime Minister was the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development at that time. As the chair of the 
Council for Yukon Indians pointed out last week in a 
presentation to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development, it is entirely appropriate that the 
Prime Minister conclude the  circle of negotiations of our final 
self-government agreements. Tomorrow is here.
<P>
	The Reform's amendment would delete clause 5 from Bill 
C-33. Subclause (1) of clause 5 allows final land claim 
agreements and transboundary agreements concluded in the 
future to be given effect by order in council. Subclause (2) of 
clause 5 requires that such an order in council be tabled in the 
House of Commons within 30 sitting days after the order is 
made. The Reform's amendment to delete clause 5 would mean 
that 10 remaining First Nations final agreements and future 
transboundary agreements would have to be brought into effect 
by other acts of Parliament.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 is unacceptable because first, the four final 
agreements being given effect by this bill require this bill to 
provide that future agreements may be given effect by order in 
council. Deleting clause 5 would make the legislation 
inconsistent with the four agreements the bill is bringing into 
effect. Second, clause 5 does not prevent Parliament from 
reviewing any further agreements. Third, deleting clause 5 
would require consequential amendments to other clauses of 
this bill, for example clauses 14 and 15.
<P>
	For all of the above reasons, the government finds Motion No. 
1 unacceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, before I 
focus on the mechanics of the motion as such, I too would like to 
extend greetings, both personally and on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois to the people in the gallery from the Yukon who, as 
we know, have waited 21 years to see their dream finally become 
a reality. Let me also say that they have persevered peacefully 
for 21 years. Even though the negotiation process can at times be 
rough, they never took up arms but focused on the task at hand. 
As a result, as I mentioned, their dream is about to become a 
reality in a few hours' time.
<P>
	The 21-year-period is worthy of mention, as I pointed out in 
my speech on second reading. For Yukon natives, it is extremely 
important to consider the views of their elders.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	During the course of the testimony by Yukon natives, we were 
told that previous generations of elders had expressed concern 
about whether these negotiations would ever come to fruition. I 
think that these elders would be very satisfied today, as will the 
children of those seated in the gallery who will finally be able to 
claim ownership once and for all to land that has been theirs 
forever.
<P>
	As for the crux of the motion before us, obviously if we were 
to delete clause 5 of the bill, we would automatically be calling 
into question clause 4 which basically describes the four nations 
with whom land claim agreements have already been reached. 
Therefore, if we delete clause 5 and prohibit the Governor in 
Council  from concluding a similar agreement with the ten other 
first nations, we would be left with a kind of parliamentary 
vacuum and there would be no known way of resolving the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5707"> 5707 </A></B>
<P>
claims pending with other first nations. On that subject, 
negotiations are progressing well. The feeling is that an 
agreement will be reached within a year or two with five nations. 
It would be encouraging for them to know that, as soon as their 
final agreement is reached, they come under the act that is 
before us and the Governor in Council simply brings them under 
the provisions of this act.
<P>
	As for dispelling fears, I think it is something that must be 
demystified. The four land claim agreements before us which 
the act will give effect to today for the most part contain the 
same provisions. This was also the case with Bill C-34: you 
could open agreements with different nations to any particular 
page and find just about the same text. I asked the Indian affairs 
department officials who came to reassure us about the various 
clauses: can a first nation avoid the final umbrella agreement? 
And they said no. In other words, the ten nations still in the 
negotiating process will have to follow the exact same line 
already agreed to by the other four.
<P>
	Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against Motion No. 1. 
I am also concerned about the manner in which this entire debate 
has progressed. We have two bills before the House and we have 
been debating now for almost a week. A refusal to allow the 
Governor in Council the power to implement these agreements 
would implicitly mean that any such agreement would have to 
be brought before the House in the form of a bill, and at the 
speed we are going in passing these two bills, you can imagine 
what it would be like to have ten more before us over the next 
several years. I think it would take months to get these bills 
through the House, given the amount of time which the Reform 
Party has taken blocking the two bills now before us.
<P>
	For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will reject Motion 
No. 1.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the House concerning 
amendments to Bill C-33, but first I want to say one thing. The 
ghosts of the champions of democracy that have passed on from 
this House will be moving very slowly with their heads bowed 
tonight. Because of this government this respected House of 
democracy has become a House of shame. This government has 
prostituted the principles of democracy. It has prostituted the 
fundamental values of democracy and it has prostituted 
everything sacred about democracy.
<P>
	Members of the party at this end have sold their souls for 30 
pieces of silver and they will find their potter's field before their 
term is over. It is a shame what has happened in this Chamber 
tonight. Those who value the fundamental richness of 
democracy will indeed be hanging their heads in shame tonight.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	In relation to Bill C-33, I would like to focus on one of the 
amendments put forward by my party. It deals with clause 5, the 
first amendment. The existence of clause 5 in this bill is a 
contradiction to the election promise of openness and 
transparency the government made. It takes away the 
democratic values and rights of this House to debate bills, to 
debate legislation which affects Canadians. This government 
has squashed that value.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have come to this House as the 
servants of the people of Canada. We have been entrusted to 
speak for the good of Canada, to question moves like this one 
tonight, to question the government's determination to ram 
through legislation that generations of Canadians will be paying 
for over and over again. The very thought that this government 
would ram through legislation that would take away the public 
debate-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I have followed the 
debate attentively. I have been known in another light to have 
somewhat of a peripheral vision, but I have never been able to 
master hearing two or more people speak at any one time. I 
would like to share in hearing interventions by members on both 
sides of the House. I would ask the hon. member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley to continue, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> As I was saying, this government has the 
audacity tonight to ram through a bill which will take away the 
debating privileges of this House on legislation that will be in 
the interests of all Canadians. It will not be debated in this 
House because this government has brought in closure on the 
further debate on Bill C-33.
<P>
	I consider it only appropriate for the good of all Canadians, 
for the good of Canada, and for the good of the reputation of this 
House, that our amendment to clause 5 be adopted.
<P>
	We are officials elected to represent the views of our 
constituents indeed, the views of all Canadians. This 
government would think otherwise. Government members 
would self-serve their private agendas, but this part of the 
House and this party speaks for the Canadian people, not for the 
special interest groups that supply support for the party.
<P>
	The constituents, the taxpayers of this country, pay our 
salaries. They expect us to look after the best interests of Canada 
and Canadians, especially when it comes to the appropriation of 
land under public domain. They have paid for federal territorial 
and aboriginal negotiators who have drafted these land claim 
settlements. With clause 5 this government is telling the 
taxpayers that future settlements will not even come before this 
House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5708"> 5708 </A></B>
<P>
for scrutiny by their elected representatives. Shame on this 
government.
<P>
	With clause 5 the negotiators are no longer accountable. They 
are no longer accountable to the taxpayers since their 
settlements will simply be rubber stamped in cabinet. No 
debate, just a rubber stamp. That is something government 
members are very familiar with as they sat on this side of the 
House and accused the previous government of rubber stamping 
legislation. They learned very well from the Tories as they were 
sitting over here. Their apprenticeship is now complete and they 
are doing exactly the same thing they railed upon in this House 
in the last Parliament.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Tories never did it with no debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, in not allowing their elected 
representatives to speak on their behalf, the taxpayer has no say 
in the distribution of lands to the remaining 10 bands in the 
Yukon. This is not acceptable to the people of Canada. This is 
not acceptable to the values of democracy that were present in 
this House until this government got on that side of the House.
<P>
	I repeat again, our amendment to clause 5 will preserve the 
values of democracy. It will give security to the Canadian 
people, security to know that bills will not be rammed through 
Parliament in the back rooms of this place.
<P>
	I say it again. Shame on this government, shame on the way it 
has desecrated the democratic principles of this House. I hope 
they all sleep well tonight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had not initially intended to speak on this bill tonight 
but after hearing some of what I heard moments ago, I now feel 
that I must.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You do not understand democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The member across says I do not understand 
democracy. Maybe that is so. Maybe he is much more 
knowledgeable in such things than I. For 18 years I have had the 
opportunity of serving those who have elected me at the 
municipal, provincial and federal levels of government. But 
perhaps the member across has learned a lot more in the time he 
has been here. Perhaps that is so. I will defer of course to that 
wisdom, the kind of wisdom we have just heard in the speech he 
delivered to this House. I will let my colleagues decide on just 
how much wisdom was heard in the previous 10 minutes.
<P>
	The member across has just said with this Bill C-33 that 
democracy is stifled by the government, or something to that 
effect. I am not going to refer to people who are presently here in 
Ottawa because I cannot refer to anyone who would be in the 
gallery. That would be improper. I want the people who are here 
in Ottawa to know that I feel that the 21 years they have waited is 
more than long enough.
<P>
	For members who say this bill was not debated sufficiently, 
last week we had an all night debate in committee, 16 hours 
straight of debating this bill in committee. Prior to that we had a 
second reading debate on this bill. Then we had an additional 
four hours of debate by the committee dealing with it and now 
another hour at report stage to be followed tomorrow by another 
hour at third reading.
<P>
	Perhaps members think that individual bills should all be 
dealt with with more than 22 hours of debating time each. That is 
their privilege. That is more than an hour for every year that the 
people who are here in Ottawa have waited for this bill, not those 
in the gallery because I cannot refer to the gallery, but if I could I 
would.
<P>
	I was at the committee last week for a good part of the time. I 
took three or four hours off and then came back. I saw people 
like the hon. member for Yukon who stayed there all night. The 
hon. member who is the chairman of the committee stayed their 
all night to defend the interests of constituents.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I tip my hat to both of them and to the others 
who were there to stand by their constituents in obviously very 
difficult times. I make no apology tonight for people who have 
waited 21 years. I do not believe they should have waited 
another three months beyond the parliamentary recess and into 
the fall because that was the position the Reform Party was 
taking.
<P>
	Reform Party members thought the bill should be dragged 
into the fall before being debated at third reading. They have 
every right to want to delay whatever they want to delay, but I 
also have every right to disagree with them, particularly after a 
bill has been debated in the House at second reading, for 20 
hours in committee, for 2 hours at report stage, and then at third 
reading. That is more than long enough for the people in 
question to endure.
<P>
	Finally, members across the way have said that they are the 
true defenders of democracy or some such nonsense. I wonder 
under whose definition that is. Is it under the definition of the 
people who have waited for 21 years, who are in Ottawa but not 
in the gallery, whom I cannot refer to but I would if I could? No, 
not according to them.
<P>
	Let us apply another test. Three parties in the House tonight, 
the Liberal Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic 
Party, voted to end this debate. They as one party representing 
approximately one-quarter of the membership of the House say 
their view of democracy as explained by their number 
supersedes the wish of every one of us including people who 
have waited for 21 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5709"> 5709 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a test of democracy. Could it be that democracy if one 
is a Reformer means that which one can agree with as opposed to 
that which is good or that which is approved by the majority of 
the people? Could it be that is their definition of democracy? 
Perhaps it is.
<P>
	I am proud we have taken plenty of time to debate the bill at 
all stages. All members were given an opportunity to debate the 
bill, including an opportunity to sit all night on a parliamentary 
committee. Some members did it. They put forward the 
propositions they felt were important.
<P>
	I was at the committee for part of the time and I saw motions 
for adjournment. Does that sound familiar? We heard one of 
those tonight, except it cut into the time of the people proposing 
it. We shant mention that. That happened at the parliamentary 
committee. We had a dilatory motion. The last vote of the 
committee was if shall the bill be reported to the House. It 
carried unanimously at committee. I challenge anyone to read 
the proceedings of the committee.
<P>
	When the chair asked ``shall I report the bill to the House'' the 
vote was yes. Let us hold that thought for a minute. When the 
bill returned to the House a few hours later who said the bill was 
not receivable by the House? It was the same people who gave 
unanimous consent to table it three hours before.
<P>
	I am no expert in parliamentary procedure but surely there is 
something wrong with people who give unanimous consent to 
report a bill to the House and then say three hours later that the 
bill should not have been reported. That effort in itself proved to 
me that it was not the intention of the party to debate the bill 
further. They did not want the House to receive the report. How 
could those members say they want to debate it some more? 
Tonight, when we tried to debate these bills in addition to what 
we had debated them previously, what did they propose? They 
proposed adjournment to subtract time from the debating time 
they already had. This is sheer and utter nonsense on the part of 
the Reform Party. All members of Parliament know it, all 
Canadians know it, the people of the Yukon and the people who 
have waited 21 years know it especially.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
very interesting that the just made speech across the way is very 
typical of Liberal damage control. If you have a problem point 
your finger, accuse someone else and say it is all their fault. Are 
the people of Canada fooled by this? No, sir.
<P>
	I would like to address the people of Canada on this motion. I 
take the word of my colleague a while ago. The word is shame. It 
is a terrible shame. The people are not going to be fooled by this. 
Closure is a shame. It is a travesty of democracy. You know it 
and you are going to pay for it.
<P>
	The biggest shame however is figuring out what the 
motivation is. What has been the motivation across the way to 
dampen debate, to cut out debate, to stifle it? Could it possibly 
be that we do not want to hear any countervailing arguments? 
Could it be even that you want you want to catch your plane? 
Could it be that the Bloc Quebecois joined in because they want 
to catch their plane home? Or could it be that there was a little 
deal struck here? If so, more shame.
<P>
	This is the first time that I have personally had to undergo this 
sort of a travesty. I will not forget it ever and I assure you that the 
voters of Canada will not forget it either.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member for Nunatsiaq who mentioned his 
dream that I sincerely hope, sir, that this will culminate in a 
dream for your people and a dream come true for the people of 
the Yukon. I hope, because of the ill-consideration of all of the 
facets of this, that it will not turn a dream into a nightmare.
<P>
	I would like to underline a few principles that the Reform 
Party applies to native issues. The first is equality not among 
just natives but equality among all Canadians. The second is 
self-reliance. In this we mean elimination of the department of 
Indian affairs. The third would be the right to 
self-determination, the freedom to choose not to have the 
federal government or band councils impose lifestyle.
<P>
	The fourth would be self-sufficiency, native self-government 
fashioned after municipal government models with input from 
all other Canadians. The fifth would be treaty negotiations, fair 
resolution of all past, present and future native and non-native 
obligations involving input from all Canadians. Finally, we 
believe in settling land claims through a fair negotiation 
involving all Canadians and not just orders in council.
<P>
	This bill addresses some basic problems concerning the role 
of the House of Commons. It has always been my belief as a 
non-politician, perhaps as a naive Canadian, that this House is 
here to represent the interests of all Canadians. Obviously that 
means all Canadians without regard to race, religion or ethnic 
background. I sometimes believe this to be true particularly if I 
talk person to person with members of this House, even across 
the way. There are other times however when party machinery 
gets into gear and I doubt very much at that time that the 
common wheel of all of Canada is the objective. The handling of 
Bills C-33 and C-34 certainly raises such doubts. If there was 
any doubt before tonight that doubt is out the window now.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	The original purpose is no doubt well-intentioned but its 
execution here in Parliament raises very fundamental questions 
about the operation of the House. What is the hurry? We have to 
ask that in the case of these two bills. What is the hurry?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5710"> 5710 </A></B>
<P>
	We have legislation here of the greatest importance that, as we 
have heard, has been worked on for over 20 years, legislation 
that will have a profound influence on the future of Canada, 
legislation so voluminous that it has to be measured in inches 
and weighed in pounds and the government says: ``Okay, look at 
it quickly, now get on with it''.
<P>
	The situation was well described when we heard about this for 
the first time by my colleague from North Island-Powell River 
when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, yesterday we had the introduction of Bills C-33 and C-34 which 
would ratify land claims and self-government agreements in the Yukon. Last 
week we were told the government wished to have these bills introduced later in 
June with the understanding that MPs would have time to prepare properly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These bills represent the culmination of 21 years of mostly behind closed 
doors work without the involvement of federal parliamentarians. Today, 24 hours 
after tabling, Parliament is being asked to debate these bills at second reading.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is an obvious abuse of power. The Liberal red ink book speaks of the 
integrity of Parliament. Surely assimilating over nine inches of text overnight 
with a rushed departmental briefing the next morning does not speak well of the 
integrity of Parliament or the interest of all Canadians. This action is a travesty 
of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Since then, because of the limited time for debate and in 
reaction to the government's desire to get the bills passed, the 
Reform Party has had to drag out discussions of the bill in 
committee. Here we are back in the House. We were hoping to 
forestall any precipitate decision on the bills but obviously that 
is out the window as well.
<P>
	We have an obligation to the Canadian public, not just us but 
all Canadians, to let the public know what is going on.
<P>
	Remarkably, the same hasty panic occurred in the House a 
year ago when a similar bill zipped through the House in a single 
day. That was Bill C-133 which created Nunavut. Bill C-133 
dealt with one-fifth of the Canadian land mass. In effect it 
created a new province, therefore affecting the Constitution of 
the country. It allocated $580 million to 17,000 Inuit. Bill C-133 
was rushed through the House in one single day on June 4, 1993.
<P>
	The opposition agreed with the bill. What deal was made? In 
spite of the enormous implications of that bill the Canadian 
public did not react. Why did it not react? Timing and 
orchestration. Rush a bill through. Restrict debate and nobody is 
the wiser. What was going on there and what is going on here? 
What on earth is the hurry?
<P>
	I can only identify two people who spoke out against Bill 
C-133. One was the Reform member for Beaver River; the other 
was Pat Nowlan, the then member for Annapolis Valley-Hants. I 
would like to quote from of Mr. Nowlan's remarks, he being an 
independent Conservative. After he gave a little plaudit, Mr. 
Nowlan went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I speak almost with a forked tongue. That gets into the substance of the 
agreement I am glad to say is here today. It has to be put on the record that I am 
totally against the process. To have had the minister of Indian affairs speak for 18 
minutes as he did in introducing this bill at second reading does not even begin to 
equal the 15 or 16 years it took to get the agreement. The member for 
Comox-Alberni said 20 or 25 years-If there was ever an example of a dead 
Parliament doing dangerous things, this bill sadly is it. This bill should not have 
been brought in in the closing days of Parliament, the last weekend before we rise. 
Whether we come back, we do not know.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	He was prescient, was he not? Look at the similarity of that 
situation one year ago today to what we have here in this House 
tonight. I go on to quote, time coming up.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With all the good things the minister of Indian affairs and other speakers have 
said about it, this bill has the potential of nation building, of bringing the Inuit 
into the federation on some of the major points of the agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That was his cry of shame, that the thing was not properly 
debated and considered.
<P>
	In summary, we have had a shame before this House this 
evening. I hope the people of Canada will lock it away and 
remember it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise with a certain amount of 
sadness. I thought I would hear something more profound, more 
healing tonight.
<P>
	Nine months ago when we arrived I was given the red book. I 
come from a steel town with not a lot of aboriginal people. 
Within the red book there was a map, a direction. Part of that 
map involved exactly what we are doing tonight.
<P>
	I went to the Yukon. I went north three times. I met with the 
Yukon people. I met women who talked about Bill C-31 status 
with tears in their eyes. I met elders who thought that they would 
never have any honour given back to them. Poverty, you have no 
idea of the poverty or the housing.
<P>
	When the white man came to Canada-and the aboriginal 
people use that term not in a derogatory way; they mean 
non-aboriginal people-we came with a certain amount of 
avarice. We came here for our property which they were holding 
temporarily for us for 10,000 years.
<P>
	We went there and we said we would do the honourable thing. 
We hired the best negotiators. I wish I had them today. If you 
look at the 11 treaties, what do they have? A suit of clothes for 
the head man, a suit of clothes for the chief, a medal which 
tarnishes, a few acres for each family of five, $8, $9 or $10 a 
year. We would take the equivalent of half of provinces. There 
was one thing honoured in those treaties-

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I believe there is a 
well established practice in this House that we refer to one 
another by ridings or portfolios, as the case may be. Obviously, 
it is no great news when I tell you that this debate is one of great 
importance and which brings great conviction from both sides of 
the House, from both sides of the debate. I would hope that we 
could be able to follow that debate and be able to all share and 
hear whatever interventions might be made by whatever 
members from whichever side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Mr. Speaker, after that meeting with the 
aboriginal people I took the time to meet with the mayors. They 
said they want this legislation. I met with their legislative 
people, all of them. They not only want it, they have passed the 
mirror legislation already. I met with the mining association. 
They want it. I did not meet anybody up there who really did not 
want it. I said: ``This should be easy legislation. When I get back 
to Ottawa I am going to have difficulty on other legislation. 
Reform Party members say they will listen to the people. This is 
in their platform. I heard it for eight months during the 
campaign. This should be easy to get through the House of 
Commons''.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Boy, were you shocked.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> I was shocked. I was surprised. I am facing an 
agenda of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Put it to a referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Stay quiet and you will learn something. 
Somewhere in this city is a lady called Judy Gingell. Somewhere 
in this city she is sitting close to tears because she has been 
working on this matter for 21 years. She did not come on the 
scene eight months ago with this agenda.
<P>
	Then we started hearing the agenda of the Reform Party. I 
must apologize to the Reform Party because last week I said on 
the first sentence of any substance I heard that it was 56 words 
and there were 8 derogatory words about aboriginal people. I 
apologize. It was 56 words and there were 9 derogatory 
statements. This is the sentence and these are the words talking 
about aboriginal people: misappropriation, fraudulent, 
mismanagement, authorized purposes, interference, fear, 
intimidation, assault and forcibly. They were in one sentence. 
That is the agenda.
<P>
	I have a direct quote on April 25 from a member of the Reform 
Party: ``I will not accept the popular myth''-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Listen to your own words. No wonder members of 
the Reform Party are groaning. They cannot stand to listen to 
their own words: ``I will not accept the popular myth spread by 
certain self-serving interests that the encroachment of European 
settlers constituted an injustice against aboriginal people here or 
anywhere  else in Canada''. That was said by the member for 
Athabasca on April 25 in the House.
<P>
	I wish the Reform Party would read the recent report of the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission in which it says that the 
plight of native Canadians is by far the most serious human 
rights problem in Canada. It continues that the failure-and I 
see it here tonight with the Reform Party-to achieve a more 
global solution can only continue to tarnish Canada's reputation 
and accomplishments.
<P>
	Last week I was sitting here with some Liberals and I heard a 
Reform member say: ``Indians are lazy. They live in south sea 
islands and periodically''-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> The husbands sat around and burned their wives 
on their arms. That is not acceptable in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
words that were attributed to an hon. member were not accurate 
and I would ask the hon. minister to withdraw them 
immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret that is not a point 
of order, although I know an issue of great sensitivity has been 
dealt with at another time in the House, something that all 
members may want to keep in mind through these deliberations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not only what they said after 
being admonished in every newspaper I saw on my way to B.C., 
from here to Victoria. Yesterday or the day before that hon. 
member said he was quite proud of those words, even after that.
<P>
	If I never stand another night in the House, tonight is a proud 
night for me, to be among Liberals and Canadians from across 
Canada in all parties who want to do the right and honourable 
thing for some people in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> If you do not want to listen, you do not want to 
listen. Leave or stop shouting. We want to do the honourable 
thing along with the member for Yukon, a member I am very 
proud to sit in the House with, notwithstanding that she is sitting 
in that section.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	She is a woman of passion, of caring, of knowledge and it is 
too bad the Reform does not periodically stop staring at us and 
turn around. It might learn something.
<P>
	These people in Yukon have been living there for 10,000 years 
and negotiating for 21 years with various governments. Tonight 
they are going to get justice and I am going to be proud to stand 
for that justice.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise tonight to speak to bills C-33 and C-34. I 
would like to thank the Bloc Quebecois for allowing me this 
opportunity to express my support for the first nations of the 
Yukon and for justice for Canada's aboriginal peoples.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the short time I have there were several things said tonight 
that I would like to take this opportunity to correct. One was 
from my good friend across the way who spoke about the 
negotiations being 21 years which indeed they were.
<P>
	I would say that the people of Yukon and the Yukon Indian 
people have been waiting 92 years because it was in 1902 that 
Chief Jim Boss first raised the issue of land claims in Yukon. I 
say if not after 92 years, then when? Now is the time for the 
justice that the minister spoke of earlier.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> The member for the Reform Party said this 
was done behind closed doors. I say to this House that these were 
the most open closed doors I have ever seen in the 15 years I 
have been in the Yukon.
<P>
	There have been many consultations throughout Yukon. The 
previous government leader of Yukon in giving evidence before 
the committee mentioned that in the previous government they 
had done 100 public consultations. The current government 
leader of Yukon and his government have also done numerous 
consultations around Yukon in the communities and with 
various organizations including the Chamber of Commerce and 
the outfitters and so on.
<P>
	The Council for Yukon Indians has done extensive 
consultations with aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in 
Yukon.
<P>
	For many of us in Yukon, and for myself not originally 
coming from Yukon, it has been a very educative process over 
the last 15 years to watch the development of this issue. What we 
see tonight with the co-operation of at least three political 
parties in this House is expressing real democracy for justice, 
for a historical obligation, long overdue.
<P>
	I congratulate the minister on his remarks and on his 
perseverance on this issue. We are showing through these two 
pieces of legislation an opportunity for Canadians to come 
together to resolve historical obligations, to fight for real 
equality of every citizen.
<P>
	As a Yukoner, not as a member of Parliament, I say that these 
pieces of legislation bring real equality to every person living in 
the Yukon and serves as a model for the rest of Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say there has been much 
discussion about what we are giving to aboriginal people. This is 
a fundamental misunderstanding of what this legislation is 
about and the history of Canada.
<P>
	As a European politician some time ago said, the land was 
stolen fair and square.
<P>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	This is an attempt to redress a wrong to a people. I would also 
like to correct one other statement that was made. It was that 
Yukon First Nations peoples have been in that region for 10,000 
years. Anthropological evidence will indicate it has been at least 
20,000 years.
<P>
	Surely it is time the people of Canada and this Parliament say 
it is time for Yukoners, it is time for Yukon First Nations to have 
what is their right, to have what is their responsibility and for us 
to stand proudly tonight to support that justice and to see that 
justice is done.
<P>
