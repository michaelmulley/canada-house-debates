<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
certainly are times when perseverance pays off.  A classic 
example of this is Margaret Penwarden from Victoria West, which 
is in my riding of Egmont in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Margaret was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis almost three 
years ago.  She started taking Betaseron in July 1996.  This drug 
produced a substantial improvement in her condition.  The 
problem, however, was that Betaseron was a very expensive drug, 
with an average annual cost of approximately $17,000.  Even with 
a drug plan she had to pay $6,000 out of her own pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many P.E.I. MS sufferers had no drug plan and therefore could 
not afford the drug.  Margaret, supported by the Atlantic 
division of the MS Society of Canada, started a crusade to have 
these drug costs covered by the provincial health plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it was a long and arduous fight, ranging from a letter 
writing campaign to an actual sit-in at the provincial 
legislature, Margaret and her MS sufferers eventually prevailed. 
In October of this year the provincial government finally 
announced that the cost of Betaseron and three other MS treatment 
drugs would, in part, be covered under the provincial plan.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
recently received the following letter from the owner of Toby 
Theatre & Video Rental in Invermere, B.C.:  “Regarding this EI 
fund that our government thinks it has a right to use however it 
sees fit, what really upsets me is the fact that high school 
students who work for me have to pay EI even though the 
government admits that they are eligible to collect EI but do not 
qualify as long as they are going to school.  Doing this to a 
group of Canadians that do not even have a vote is, if not legal 
fraud, certainly moral fraud.  As to the rest of the EI fund, it 
belongs to the workers and business people of this country and 
not to the federal government.  I think that it should be given 
back to the people that it is”—euphemistically—“borrowing it 
from, especially our young people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is signed by Ron Peters, Invermere, B.C., and it is well 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would remind all hon. members that we 
cannot use words in here which are used by someone else which we 
ourselves are not permitted to use.  I would caution all members 
in their statements.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL CHILD DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Friday, November 20 marks the sixth anniversary of National Child 
Day, a day to increase awareness and understanding of healthy 
child development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the National Children's Agenda Caucus, I believe 
that by providing a warm, loving and responsive environment for 
young children our society can provide a better and more 
promising future for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>November 20 was chosen as National Child Day because it is the 
anniversary of two historic events for children:  the United 
Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959 and the 
United Nations adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child in 1989.  The convention recognizes children's basic human 
rights, protects them from harm and addresses the important role 
of the family in bringing up children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But National Child Day does something else.  It reminds us that 
all children need love and respect to grow to their full 
potential.  That is why healthy child development is everyone's 
concern and responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured today to pay tribute to the 50 holocaust survivors 
seated in the gallery of the House of Commons.  They are here 
representing all Canadian holocaust survivors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These distinguished men and women who survived unimaginable 
horrors have contributed to making Canada the greatest country in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These heroes in the gallery today and other holocaust survivors 
living throughout Canada have moved forward to help us learn from 
the past.  They have seen, firsthand, the consequences of 
discrimination and have pledged to do their part to see it is 
erased forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many would have simply given up, these brave Canadians are 
working to eradicate discrimination, bigotry, hatred and violence 
that we still face today.

I too today rise to honour these survivors of the holocaust.  The 
Canadian Society for Yad Vashem today honours these survivors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been enriched by the decision of those survivors who 
have made our country their home.  Theirs has been no mean 
contribution.  After a dehumanizing challenge unparalleled in 
history, after losing property, family and friends, these men and 
women, survivors of the worst infamy perpetrated by humanity on 
its own kind, came to Canada to seek out a society wherein they 
could help build regard for tolerance, respect for diversity and 
the elimination of discrimination and bigotry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their lives in Canada read like a model of good citizenship.  In 
short, they came, they saw and they made a difference, in 
business, in education and in community building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be associated with true heroes like those in the 
gallery and like my constituents, Alex Grossman, Elas Chandler, 
Fanny Silberman and my good friend Michael Rosenberg.  Like all 
other Canadians, I thank them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on November 11 Canadians honoured and remembered the 
sacrifices that veterans made to protect our freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World War II veteran, Stuart Scott, a Radville, Saskatchewan 
farmer was fined $1,500 on November 6 and was ordered to 
surrender his 1988 car to Canada Customs for moving four bags of 
hulless, waxy barley into the U.S.  According to Mr. Scott, 
“While I was fighting for the freedom of my country, my country 
took my freedom away”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students have been pepper sprayed for protesting against a 
dictator and farmers have been jailed for selling their own 
grain.  History can only judge this government harshly for 
neglecting to protect the freedom for which so many Canadians 
fought and died.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt about it now: a PQ government would 
keep working for another four years at preparing the next 
referendum and promoting Quebec's separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear. The leaders debate enlightened Quebeckers on the 
future of Quebec. On the PQ side, there is this will to hold a 
referendum and to work hard to make it happen. 
They want to expend time, effort and money to this end and 
ultimately achieve separation, even if it goes against the 
interests of Quebeckers, who object to a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, let us be clear: a vote for the PQ is a vote for holding a 
referendum. And a vote for the Liberal Party is a vote for 
economic growth and a better quality of life in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we know.  We were treated to a Lucien Bouchard who repeated 
his commitment to a referendum, provided he would win.  First 
ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also treated to a Lucien Bouchard who did not dare 
remind people that his party's reason for being is sovereignty 
and independence.  Not a word on that.  Second ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were treated to an ambiguous Bouchard, one who was on the 
defensive and, if re-elected, promises another period of 
political uncertainty and unproductive confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we saw very clearly that a vote for the 
Liberal Party is a vote for a strong Quebec, one that is open to 
the world, a Quebec which believes that the best way to develop 
fully is within Canada.

Canada sends observers to third world countries to make sure 
elections are fair and above board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada recently supervised elections in Chiapas to ensure, among 
other things, the principle of a secret ballot.  Yet in Canada 
the Canadian Wheat Board is holding elections for board members 
and every single ballot is identified with a number on the return 
envelop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stephanie Mainil, who lives in Saskatchewan, is No. 8-8948.  Her 
father is 8-8938.  If this happened in Mexico everyone would 
suspect intimidation and tampering.  Added to this problem is the 
matter of ballots being sent to people who have been dead for 
several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear that the minister is going to appoint the 
scrutineers for this election.  In a democracy it is the 
candidates who appoint the scrutineers.  Is it any wonder why 
farmers are complaining that this whole process is corrupt?

one second in announcing that, in a coming PQ mandate, the 
Government of Quebec would do everything possible to hold 
another referendum on Quebec independence.

the way to go, and they are prepared to use any means to achieve 
it.

are health, education and employment.

thousands of hepatitis C victims hung out to dry, 188,000 sick

in the last two years, and $7 billion in transfer cuts to the 
provinces.

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians across the country are concerned about the future of 
medicare.  They have seen changes in recent years.  They have 
seen cutbacks.  The government has made it clear that the era of 
cuts is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has made it clear that health care will be 
the subject of our next major reinvestment.  We have said that in 
the next budget the government will reinvest the dividends that 
we have earned through years of fiscal discipline. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no one believes these Liberal stock answers any more. 
Canadians are looking at what the Liberals have done to health 
care, not what they say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial transfers from the health minister to the provinces 
are at an all time low.  Federal funding for Ontario hospitals 
alone has fallen from 50% of federal funding to 11.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With $10.4 billion in the bank why have the Liberals not done 
anything to follow up on their so-called number one priority? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have done a great deal, from the health transition fund to the 
$1.5 billion increase in the transfer last year, to increases in 
health research in the last budget.  I urge the Leader of the 
Opposition to await the next budget to see proof of our 
commitment to this reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of transfers, since he refers to Ontario let the 
record show that the tax cuts which Ontario chose to implement 
instead of paying off its deficit have cost $4 billion in 
revenue.  That is the real source of the problem that Harris and 
his crew are having.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister defends his own abysmal record by attacking 
others, but it was the Liberal government that cut the $7 billion 
in transfers.  This minister is the one who is responsible for 
188,000 sick people being on waiting lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know how long those waiting lines have to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
quite apart from the errors in the numbers cited by the leader of 
the Reform Party, I think there is something more significant 
that Canadians should focus on, which is the irony of the leader 
of the Reform Party standing in the House to ask about the state 
of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will remember that he is the man and that is the party 
which promised to amend the Canada Health Act to provide for what 
they call a choice.  We know what they mean.  They want American 
style health insurance.  They want American style health care. We 
are here to say that we shall never throw away medicare like the 
Reform would do.

government raised finances for medicare?  I am sure he knows 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the government wants to follow the auditor general's advice, how 
about acting on his comments of the past two years to the effect 
that the minister has no right to take money out of the 
employment insurance fund, which is money contributed by 
workers? That is what the auditor general said.

the surplus and reduce taxes for the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Finance know that the ministers, the 
members and certain professionals do not pay into the employment 
insurance plan?  Does he not find it shameful that the

Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, over the first 10 months of 1998, 321,000 new jobs

Canadians want us to reduce overlap and duplication. They want 
us to get rid of the red tape.  Provinces are supportive.  This 
is what Canadians wanted.  We have listened to Canadians.  We 
heard and we are responding to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if the provinces are interested it must be something like the

are a figment of his imagination.  I would like the minister to 
name one province which is committed to participating in this IRS 
style tax agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister pressing ahead when he has been 
criss-crossing this country and not a single province has 
indicated its willingness to support this plan?  The provinces in 
fact are going in the other direction.  Why does the minister not 
stop, take a minute and consult with Canadians before he makes a

Nova Scotia to look at collecting WCB premiums. The member should read

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Mr. Pinochet is at present in Great Britain. 
The matter is being considered by the House of Lords legal 
committee.  We expect we will have a decision by that committee 
under the British law at that point in time.  How it would apply 
under the present Canadian law would be a matter that would have 
to be examined if, when and how it ever happened here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that a major bill dealing with 
extradition is going through the House of Commons at the present

extradition would be applied.

involves the use of false papers.  Two of these refugees were

charging them $1,000 each as a rehabilitation fee for having used 
these documents.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL S-13 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
concerning Bill S-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been passed in the other place and is currently at 
first reading.  Even though the bill is not presently being 
debated, it has now been introduced and it is my first 
opportunity to speak on it under a point of order. I wish to 
discuss what I believe to be the constitutional and procedural 
propriety of this bill's being initiated in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear at the outset that I am not in any way 
taking the position at the present time on the policy embraced by 
this bill, as there will be ample opportunity to do that.  What I 
am doing is responding in my duty as Leader of the Government in 
the House of Commons to defend the rules, the rights and the 
privileges of the House and all members who sit here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with Bill S-13, which has been initiated in the 
other place, as I intend to demonstrate, is that it constitutes 
in fact a tax bill and as such constitutionally and procedurally 
may be initiated only in the House of Commons and only after the 
House has concurred in the notice of ways and means tabled by a 
minister of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that the Speaker of the other place had occasion to 
rule on this question when the bill was in the other place.  The 
question before us, however, concerns the constitutional rights 
of the House of Commons and only the Speaker of the House of 
Commons has the authority to assert these rights, no one else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are standing orders of the House of Commons 
that I maintain are violated by this bill and no ruling in the 
other place or anywhere else can have any impact on the decision 
of the presiding officer of this House in interpreting the rules 
of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two principles that come into play in this case.  The 
first is stated in Bourinot's parliamentary practice, fourth 
edition at page 491: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general rule, public bills may originate in either house; 
but whenever they... involve directly or indirectly the levying or 
appropriation of any tax upon the people, they must be initiated 
in the popular branch, in accordance with law— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is based on section 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for 
imposing any tax or impost shall originate in the House of 
Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is stated at Bourinot's page 430 which 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now a fixed principle of constitutional government that 
all propositions for the imposition of taxes should emanate from 
the ministry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first proposition then is that the bill must start in the 
House of Commons and, second, from the ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle is embodied in our own rules governing tax bills. 
Standing Order 83(1) permits that only a minister of the crown is 
able to table a notice of ways and means which, under our 
procedures, must be concurred in before a tax bill may even be 
introduced. 
Since Bill S-13 clearly meets the test of neither of these 
principles, the question revolves around the issue of whether it 
does qualify as a tax bill.  In my opinion it does not meet these 
tests and it is a tax bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this for the following reasons.  Bill S-13 proposes what 
it refers to as a levy of 50 cents per carton on the manufacture 
of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  This levy would raise, 
so we are told, $70 million to be paid into a non-government 
foundation that would support health and education and 
anti-smoking programs as well as transitional funding for arts 
and sports groups and tobacco farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proponents of the bill assert that this is not a tax but a levy 
and as such is not subject to our ways and means procedures and 
lends itself to initiation in the other place.  This assertion is 
based, so they claim, on citation of Erskine May's parliamentary 
practice, 22nd edition, on page 779: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levies upon an industry for purposes beneficial to that industry 
are regarded as not covered by the rules of financial procedure 
and so do not require authorization by ways and means resolution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if Erskine May stopped there one would dispute whether the 
proposal meets the criterion of proposing a levy for the purpose 
beneficial to that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern legislation frequently makes provision for the imposition 
of other types of fees or payments which, although not taxes in 
the strict sense, have enough of the characteristics of taxation 
to require to be treated as `charges upon the people' and 
therefore to be authorized by ways and means resolution moved by 
a Minister of the Crown. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This distinction between the two types of payments which are or 
are not covered by the rules of financial procedure is not always 
straightforward in practice.  In particular, May suggests: 
“Where payment is imposed in order to meet the cost of enforcing 
a new regulatory scheme which is for the general benefit, rather 
than for the benefit of the industry”, such a regime is one that 
requires the use of a ways and means procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May makes it clear that a levy must be narrowly based 
and must also have a narrow purpose benefiting the industry on 
which the levy is made.  This is not the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the very commendable objectives of the bill are of 
broad public policy, namely to reduce smoking related health 
costs for young people and for supporting tobacco farmers and 
others.  It is not the tobacco manufacturers who would obviously 
benefit from this levy on them but of course smokers, farmers and 
indeed the general public. That is the pith and substance of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the summary of the bill states that the mandate is to 
reduce the use of tobacco by young persons in Canada.  This 
certainly does not meet Erskine May's test of being a levy on an 
industry for the narrow and specific benefit of the same 
industry. As a matter of fact, it is the direct opposite. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in the other place who support Bill S-13 relate it to last 
session's Bill C-32 amending the Copyright Act, which imposes a 
levy on an industry, but was not preceded by a House of Commons 
ways and means motion.  A comparison of the two bills, S-13 and 
last session's C-32, emphasizes the ineligibility of Bill S-13 as 
far as procedure is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last session's Bill C-32 imposed a levy on the manufacturers or 
importers of blank tapes into Canada and provided for the 
distribution of royalties to writers and performers, whose 
creativity would result in increased demand for the blank tapes 
distributed by manufacturers and importers.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to the advantage of all those affected by the levy, 
unlike Bill S-13, which is advantageous to all except those 
having to pay the levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of Bill S-13 is not to increase the demand for 
tobacco, of course—if it were, we would not be discussing it—but 
rather to reduce the demand, or in other words to bring about 
the opposite of a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are in fact several examples of bills, like the old C-32, 
which imposed levies for limited purposes, for the benefit of 
certain specific industries.  These include expenditure and 
other levies in connection with marketing plans, broadcasting 
licence fees, and charges for insurance forms relating to 
specific activities within specific industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each case, however, when ways and means procedures were not 
required, these levies were very specific, their purpose 
narrowly defined, their direct benefits as far as the levy is 
concerned, directly and specifically apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May, 22nd edition, makes reference to a case that 
illustrates our subject on page 780.  It relates to a bill 
concerning shipping, which was examined in the British House of 
Commons in 1973-74. 
This bill required oil importers to contribute to an 
international reserve to be used as compensation for damage 
caused by pollution, and these funds were not part of the 
consolidated fund.  This bill required a ways and means 
resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an obvious parallel with Bill S-13.  Like the levy 
proposed by Bill S-13, this levy was not to be part of the 
consolidated fund and, as in Bill S-13, the sums amassed would be 
advantageous only to those who are not part of the industry and 
have provided the funds in question. As I have already 
indicated, this bill was subject to the ways and means 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated at the start, I do not wish to see my objections 
to the procedure for Bill S-13 misinterpreted.  They probably 
will be, anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the objectives of this bill are highly desirable.  The 
policies proposed by the bill are creative and innovative. I, 
however, have problems with this bill, namely that the 
implications relating to procedure are totally regressive and 
undemocratic. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 300 years it has been a fundamental of 
parliamentary democracy that a taxation measure may not be 
initiated in the upper house.  It must be initiated by this House 
on a motion of responsible government.  That is equally true in 
the United Kingdom and it is even true in the United States of 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how interesting I may find a program proposed in a 
bill that comes to us from the other place, it is my duty, Your 
Honour, to draw to your attention the fact that this bill 
violates the constitutional practices and more important the 
rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the presiding officer of the other place thought 
the bill was in order is not material to the discussion.  It is 
our constitutional system, and in this constitutional system only 
Your Honour as Speaker of the House and no one else can determine 
what a money bill is or what a tax bill is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that Bill S-13 is indeed a taxation 
measure.  As such it should have been initiated and can only be 
initiated in the House of Commons after concurrence in a ways and 
means motion and furthermore proposed by the minister of the 
crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Your Honour to consider this and to rule that the House 
cannot consider this bill for the reasons that I have just 
stated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We will have quite a 
few interventions on this.  Those of you in the House at this 
point who wish to intervene will please stand so I can see who 
you are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how I would propose to attack this particular problem. I 
caution members to begin with that we are not going to discuss 
the 44 or 45 clauses of the bill.  I would like your advice on a 
very narrow interpretation, which is whether or not this bill 
should be introduced into the House of Commons. If I find that 
the arguments members are putting forward are going to be dealing 
with the clauses, I will intervene. I would ask you, my 
colleagues, to stick to that very narrow point.  I want your 
advice.  I want your very best advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how I am going to proceed.  I am going to take the mover 
of the bill. I will hear from her first.  Then I am going to hear 
from a spokesperson for the Reform Party.  If there is a 
spokesperson for the Bloc Quebecois, I will hear from him or her. 
Then I will hear from an intervener for the New Democratic Party. 
I will hear from an intervener for the Conservative Party.  I 
will then come back to the Liberal side.  At that point, I will 
go back and forth from the Liberal side to the opposition side 
until we have the information put in front of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask you, my colleagues, to stick to that very narrow 
point. Please do not get into the clauses of the bill because 
that may come later if we, or if I decide that this will come 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for St. Paul's. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise to speak on this point of order concerning 
Bill S-13, an act to incorporate and to establish an industry 
levy to provide for the Canadian anti-smoking youth foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I rise as you suggest, not to speak to the merits 
of this bill but to address the four main concerns which have 
been raised by the House leader. I intend to address each of the 
concerns individually.  There is some overlap between those 
concerns.  I hope we can deal with this carefully and that we can 
put the proper clarity on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the government has the prerogative of financial 
initiative in respect to the imposition of taxes by the 
convention and as the hon. minister pointed out proposed by 
section 53 of the Constitution Act.  They must be introduced in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue today is whether the levy as established in part II of 
the bill is indeed a levy or a tax.  The principal authority, 
Erskine May, says that a levy on an industry for its own purposes 
is not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four issues that the House leader has raised are: what is 
the criteria to determine a levy; what is the stated industry 
purpose; whether this bill proposes a levy or a tax in 
relationship to a ways and means motion; and does the beneficiary 
group of the levy have to be specific as in Bill C-32 to which 
the House leader referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply because the benefits of the levy are not narrowly 
identified, we do not believe that it constitutes any procedural 
justification to rule Bill S-13 out of order. Nothing in Erskine 
May supports the notion that beneficiaries of the levy need to 
operate on the model of Bill C-32, i.e., be directed to a 
specific group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that the hon. member was referring to a previous 
version of the bill.  I would like to point out that the version 
passed in the Senate in June of this year has nothing to do with 
sponsorship or farmers.  This is purely to set up the foundation. 
I think the hon. House leader has referred to an older version 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to talk about levy criteria.  In British practice 
as followed here in Canada, a levy is in order procedurally.  We 
have to remember we are only talking about procedural issues and 
the definition of a levy.  The levy must be imposed on the 
industry.  It must serve an industry purpose. The funds from the 
levy never form any part of government revenues. I can say that 
Bill S-13 was very carefully drafted to meet these three 
criteria.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is the tobacco industry's publicly 
stated purpose.  Mr. Robert Parker stated before the Standing 
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in April 
1997: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member companies are prepared to work with any responsible 
agency on the issue of youth smoking to further reduce it.... As I 
have said, I have some legitimate questions of how credible we 
can be.... A program started voluntarily by the industry when it 
is selling cigarettes to tell kids they should not smoke would be 
attacked most vocally by... the anti-tobacco people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus we have S-13 to help them out here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine next year the public relations benefit to the industry 
if Mr. Parker gets to hold a copy of the bill and say “We are 
spending $120 million a year to stop Canada's youth from 
smoking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the first two paragraphs of clause 3 
refer to the industry's objectives.  Clause 3 deals with the 
purpose which is that of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding clause 3(a), the industry would like to be involved in 
initiatives to reduce youth smoking but it does not have the 
credibility to do so.  It would participate in 3(b) however in 
any initiative of a credible agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as October of this year, Mr. Don Brown the chairman 
and president of Imperial Tobacco, made similar comments 
regarding youth smoking and the industry's absence of credibility 
to the Vancouver Board of Trade.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe children should not smoke.... We might achieve more if 
we tried working together.  Perhaps a better approach would be 
for like-minded groups to take a fresh look at the issue of 
underage smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we cannot be the messenger; we simply just do not have 
the credibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-13 is a measure that has been created to assist the 
industry in accomplishing this publicly stated objective.  Six 
explicit industry purposes are listed in Bill S-13. Clause 3(1) 
gives the purpose of the act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act is to enable and assist the Canadian 
tobacco industry to carry out its publicly-stated industry 
objective of reducing the use of tobacco products by young 
persons throughout Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3(1)(c) addresses the lack of credibility: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>the industry is incapable of addressing on its own the problem of 
tobacco use by young persons because, by its own admission, its 
members and agents lack credibility as advocates for a reduction 
in the use of tobacco products; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3(1)(e) talks about pre-empting further restrictions: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>it is foreseeable that the industry's ability to manufacture and 
sell tobacco products will be further restricted if the rate of 
use of tobacco products by young persons is not reduced— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry is well aware of the flood of legislation attacking 
the use of tobacco in the U.S. and recognizes that it will not be 
long before it arrives here in Canada, for example the recent 
B.C. and Quebec legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3(1)(f) deals with co-ordination: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>industry efforts to reach this objective need national 
co-ordination. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In as much as tobacco companies market their products 
nationally, there needs to be national co-ordination of industry 
efforts to reduce or eliminate youth smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 31 is about sponsors: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a sponsor of the Foundation may use the name of the 
Foundation— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the debate around this the bill allows the industry to 
use the name of the foundation for the purpose of seeking 
recognition for the sponsorship. There is no point in the 
industry being a party to the legislation without receiving 
appropriate recognition for its contribution. Clause 31 
specifically entitles the industry to seek recognition of its 
sponsorship of this foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 32(1) is about independence: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Foundation is established on behalf of the Canadian tobacco 
industry but is independent of it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the very independence of the foundation that provides the 
legislation with the credibility Mr. Parker said the industry 
lacked in his statement of April 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is also beneficial to the industry in a number of less 
specific ways.  It is likely to help improve its negative public 
image. It will probably reduce the possibility of civil 
litigation and restrictive legislation being enacted, both of 
which restrict the industry's very existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well accepted that smoking is addictive, toxic and in many 
cases fatal. The industry's defence to liability lies in the 
smokers' voluntary acceptance of these risks.  The industry 
recognizes that addiction is more likely when smoking starts in 
youth who are less likely to make informed decisions regarding 
this risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-13 could contribute to a successful defence against 
liability for causing the addiction of youth. 
It is evidence of the industry's efforts to combat youth 
smoking.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Broader purposes are served by Bill S-13 as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the levy in Bill S-13 is to provide the tobacco 
industry with a credible claim that it does not deliberately 
market its products to youth and that it supports efforts to curb 
youth smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that any reduction in youth smoking also serves a 
public policy objective does not challenge the procedural 
acceptability of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in Erskine May's <I>Parliamentary Practice</I> suggests 
that an industry purpose cannot also coincide with a public 
policy.  Indeed, the precedents cited in May have both a private 
and a public purpose.  They include the Industry Training Act of 
1964.  This bill was to establish a mechanism for the creation of 
a number of industry boards, the purpose of which was to provide 
training opportunities for the employees.  Such a scheme not only 
benefited the particular industry, but served a public purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my favourite ones is the Betting Levy Act of 1961.  This 
bill was designed to improve horse breeding and to further the 
advancement of veterinary science.  This clearly goes beyond the 
private industry purpose and is in the interest of the public at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Sea Fish Industry Act of 1951, a white fish organization 
was established to develop and regulate the white fish industry. 
The purpose was to benefit the industry and to serve a public 
objective to preserve employment in the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the bills cited in May that were not exempted from the 
financial procedures and therefore required a ways and means 
motion failed to meet the criteria because they were not for an 
industry purpose or the funds became part of government revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1974-75 there was the Air Travel Reserve Fund.  This bill 
established a levy to compensate passengers who sustained a loss 
as a result of the financial failure of a travel company.  The 
charge was considered to have an industry benefit.  As such, it 
met the first of the two criteria for a charge to be a levy for 
industry purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It failed, however, on the second criteria, that the funds would 
not form part of the consolidated fund.  The charge was held to 
be a tax because the government had the discretion to dispose of 
the assets of the fund in the event of its being wound up, thus 
making it possible for the consolidated fund to benefit at the 
expense of the travel organizers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill S-13, any surplus reverts to the tobacco manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merchant shipping bill which the hon. member mentioned 
established a charge to pay for pollution damage.  This impost 
was viewed to be so clearly not for the benefit of the industry 
concerned that it was held to be a tax in spite of the fact that 
the proceeds were not payable to the consolidated fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedent that the hon. member mentioned in terms of Bill 
C-32, an act to amend the Copyright Act, adopted in the last 
parliament, contained a levy provision.  In this particular case 
the levy was imposed on the sale of blank audio tapes and the 
funds thus collected were to be distributed to authors, 
performing artists and recording companies.  That also did not 
require a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act of 1987 established a levy to be paid by 
the ship owners for the purpose of creating a pollution fund to 
deal with oil spills caused by ships and tankers.  The rate of 
the levy is set by the Minister of Transport and the money 
collected is in a special account in the consolidated revenue 
fund.  This act was presented twice without a ways and means 
motion preceding its introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Petroleum Resources Act created an account known as 
the environmental studies research fund to be under the 
administrative responsibility of the Minister of Energy, Mines 
and Resources or the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development to finance environmental and social studies to assess 
the impact of petroleum exploration and development on frontier 
lands.  Every interest owner in the frontier lands is to pay into 
that fund according to a rate set by the minister.  Again, this 
act was presented twice without a ways and means motion preceding 
its introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the first two points.  The third point is the whole 
issue of a levy versus a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Bill S-13 does not require a ways and means 
resolution because it does not impose a tax and therefore does 
not have to originate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy in Bill S-13 is not a tax.  The express provision of 
the bill makes this clear.  The clauses of the bill refer to a 
levy, not a tax.  Levies, for industry purposes, and as we have 
talked about in Erskine May, are recognized in all procedural 
authorities as being distinct from taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the levy in Bill S-13 were indeed a tax it would constitute a 
charge on the people.  According to Erskine May's 21st edition at 
page 726, a charge on the people is normally imposed generally 
and intended to be used for general purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, as May further explains, that levies upon an 
industry, the proceeds of which are intended to form a fund for 
the purposes of that industry, have been held not to be charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May lists 12 bills that have been considered levies for 
industry purposes and not taxes, and so did not require the ways 
and means resolutions.  Some of these include the Industrial 
Training Act, the Betting Levy Act and the Sea Fish Industry Act 
that we talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as I have just alluded to, there were a number of Canadian 
precedents of levies for industry purposes which did not have a 
ways and means resolution:   Bill C-32, the act to amend the 
Copyright Act; the Canada Shipping Act; and the Canada Petroleum 
Resources Act.  The last two examples were introduced twice, as 
we said, without a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian precedents suggest that the criteria applied in 
Canada to the consideration of bills containing levies are not as 
strict as those followed in British practice.  Bill S-13 not only 
meets the criteria suggested by those Canadian precedents, it 
also meets the more strict criteria spelled out in Erskine May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate, levies for industry purposes have three 
characteristics:  the levies must be imposed on the industry; the 
levies must be imposed for the industry's own purposes; and the 
money must never form a part of government revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy under Bill S-13 is clearly imposed on the industry. 
Clause 36 of the bill expressly provides that the funds come from 
the tobacco companies: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>36.(1) Every person who, for the purposes of trade, manufactures, 
produces or imports tobacco products is liable, on selling, 
transferring, or otherwise disposing of the tobacco product, to 
pay a levy... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy in Bill S-13 is imposed for the industry's own 
purposes.  Of course, there is also a broader public policy 
objective which I will not go into.  The two purposes, however, 
are not mutually exclusive goals and there are Canadian and 
British precedents to prove that this is acceptable procedurally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds generated from the levy never form part of government 
revenue.  The specific clauses of the bill make this clear. 
Subclause 33(1) states that the foundation is not an agent of Her 
Majesty and the funds are not public funds.  The funds are 
collected by the foundation, placed in its own account and 
distributed to the foundation alone.  Any surplus funds after 
wind-up of the foundation are returned to the tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 35(3) states that in the event of the dissolution of 
the foundation, any property of the foundation shall be 
transferred to the council, that is, the Canadian Tobacco 
Manufacturers' Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the question as to whether the levy imposed is in 
fact a tax is really a question of law to be determined by the 
courts, not the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedural question must be limited to whether the bill, on 
the face of it, is a tax or a levy for industry purposes.  The 
bill expressly provides that the foundation is established for 
the industry and that the purpose of the bill is to meet this 
industry's objective.  Inquiring beyond the face of the bill and 
questioning the express provisions of it is going well beyond the 
realm of procedure and into an area of law with which the Speaker 
is not to deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more legal opinions cited for or against the question of 
whether Bill S-13 is a levy or a tax, the more obvious it becomes 
that the issue is a matter of law and legal interpretation. 
These matters do not normally fall within the jurisdiction of the 
Speaker of the Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of law, a number of legal experts have already 
testified before the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, 
Science and Technology that the charge imposed in Bill S-13 is 
not a tax.  They have also provided written opinions to that 
effect. 
Mr. Mark Siegel, senior tax counsel at Gowlings, Strathy & 
Henderson, is of the view that the levy in Bill S-13 is part of a 
regulatory scheme.  The money is not intended to provide revenue 
for general public purposes.  The money is to be used to carry 
out the objectives of the foundation for the tobacco industry. 
He reaffirmed his opinion on November 5, 1998, as a result of the 
Supreme Court of Canada decision in the Eurig Estate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Michael Clegg, an expert on matters of parliamentary law and 
procedure, also has concluded that this bill is not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point concerns whether the beneficiaries of this levy 
are specific, as the House leader pointed out, in terms of Bill 
C-32. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the argument is that Bill S-13 is out of order because the 
beneficiaries of the levy are not specific, simply because the 
beneficiaries are not narrowly identified does not constitute any 
procedural justification to rule Bill S-13 out of order.  Nothing 
in Erskine May supports the notion that the beneficiaries of the 
levy have to be specifically designated.  What is required is 
that the levy must serve an industry purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no precedent available from British or Canadian sources 
that substantiates any claim that the beneficiaries must be a 
specified group.  There are numerous British and Canadian 
examples which suggest that the beneficiaries of a levy can be 
broadly defined and that they do not need to be directly related 
to the industry on which the levy is imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, consider again the Betting Levy Act which was 
implemented for the advancement and encouragement of education in 
veterinary science.  This purpose was much broader than the 
specific industry objectives of improving breeds and horse 
racing.  We believe that certain dogs, cats and cows also 
benefited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the industry objective of the Canada Shipping Act is to 
protect that industry from excessive liability with respect to 
suits for pollution damage, there is clearly a broader public 
policy objective in ensuring that spills are properly treated and 
that the environment is preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that we are here to debate whether or 
not this is a tax or an industry purpose levy.  Mr. Speaker, we 
believe that you are a servant of the House and that your rulings 
will seek the interest of the House as a whole.  The question as 
to whether the levy imposed is a tax is really a question of law, 
as I have explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedural question we must limit ourselves to is whether 
the bill, on the face of it, is a tax or a levy for industry 
purposes.  Bill S-13 expressly provides that the foundation is 
established for the industry and that the purpose of the bill is 
to meet the industry's objective.  Inquiring beyond the face of 
the bill and questioning the express provisions goes well beyond 
the realm of procedure and into an area of law in which the 
Speaker does not deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of any doubt, we know that the Speaker should favour 
the course that will allow the House to debate the merits of the 
bill and to decide rather than the Chair.  This can only happen 
if the Speaker lets the bill proceed to second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Speaker rules that there are other arguments and 
precedents not discussed in this debate, we would appreciate the 
opportunity to address them at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian practice provides a precedent based on British cases, 
proving that it is possible for a ways and means resolution, 
should it be deemed required, to be moved post-second reading.  I 
believe that the Speaker should consider this option.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I personally 
support the principles of Bill S-13, due to its health 
ramifications.  This bill deals with many of the weaknesses in 
the Liberal tobacco measures, specifically the weakening of the 
tobacco control act by Bill C-42 which is currently being 
debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health groups throughout this country are supportive of this

without a royal recommendation.  I recommend them to you, Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to your attention the specific authority mentioned 
earlier to help you in your considerations.  Erskine May's 21st

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The imposition of charges on funds other than the Consolidated 
Fund or the National Loans Fund does not require the royal 
recommendation, unless it involves an increased payment out of 
one or other of those Funds, or increases the liability... upon

Parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker of the Senate deemed the bill not to have required 
royal recommendation and therefore sent the bill to this Chamber 
quite properly according to the rules as they now stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government wishes to raise a constitutional principle 
of money bills not originating in the Senate.  Following my 
Liberal colleague's comments I will also refer to Beauchesne's, 
page 97, citation 324.  These citations deal very much with the 
House leader's reference to Bourinot's mention of two principles 
outlined on page 491.  The two citations on page 97 and 98 are 
citations 324 and 325.  Citation 324 says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker will not give a decision upon a constitutional 
question nor decide a question of law, though the same may be 
raised on a point of order or privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 325 says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all matters of doubt, the Speaker will consider attentively 
the opinions of Members.  Sometimes, instead of expressing an 
opinion of either side, the Speaker may ask instructions from the 
House or reserve his decision on the point of discussion, or 
suggest that the House may, if it thinks proper, dispense with 
the Standing Order in a particular case.  In doubtful cases, the 
Speaker will be guided largely by circumstances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers of the Senate are not the only procedural issue at 
stake here.  It would be very useful for us and for you, Mr. 
Speaker, to consider the broad procedural history of the way 
tobacco legislation has been treated by the governmental 
institutions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that the current round of the Tobacco Act, of 
which in effect Bill S-13 is a part, resulted from the fact that 
the supreme court ruled that sections of the Tobacco Act were 
unconstitutional because it held that the government had not 
provided enough evidence of the public health benefits of the act 
to infringe upon the free speech rights of tobacco companies.  In 
essence, the court placed the burden of proof on governments if 
they wish to regulate the advertising of addictive drugs to 
children.  The court effectively gave the act of convincing 
children to become addicted to a health damaging drug the 
constitutional protection of free speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the government ignored its deadline in the Tobacco Act 
for the introduction of tighter regulations on tobacco 
sponsorships.  It has acted as if an agreement it had struck in 
private with the tobacco companies had the force of law.  I 
brought this matter to your attention, Mr. Speaker, in a point of 
privilege on September 30, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also worth pointing out that the government is seeking to 
pursue a technicality to trump a badly needed public health 
measure to protect children.  At the same time it refuses to take 
effective measures to enforce existing laws against the sale of 
tobacco to children and is therefore collecting some $80 million 
a year from the sale of tobacco to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is concerned about technicality and is 
preoccupied with procedure and formality then there is clearly 
one area where the government should be focusing its attention. 
It clearly should be looking at technicalities around the 
enforcement of laws today which restrict the sale of tobacco to 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this sad episode all the legal, constitutional and 
procedural cards have been stacked against those who want to 
improve public health and in favour of those who seek to profit 
from selling an addictive poison.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to keep this in mind in your decision, 
because I think we truly are dealing with a grey matter in terms 
of procedures and constitutional and legal issues around Bill 
S-13 before us today.  Given that the precise occasions requiring 
a royal recommendation and the definition of a money bill are in 
that grey area of procedure and history of procedure in the 
House, I ask you to give the benefit of the doubt to those who 
wish to advance the cause of our children's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my final point it is worth mentioning that it is curious 
indeed that the government, in rising on this point of order, 
actually has expressed concerns about the democratic rights of 
the elected Commons versus the rights of the unelected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly it is causing us some concern because we know this is 
a government that resurrected the undemocratic practice of 
routinely introducing government bills in the Senate before the 
House, something which the New Democratic Party has vigorously 
protested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government that has steadfastly refused to act upon 
calls from the New Democratic Party and millions of Canadians to 
scrap the unelected Senate, so we think it is rather 
inappropriate at this point to be focusing so much in terms of 
constitutional issues and the origins of a bill from the Senate. 
We believe that the government cannot have it both ways.  It 
cannot use the Senate when it finds it convenient to do so and 
then hide behind it when it does not want to proceed with a 
particular measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with the most important message I think all of us 
concerned about Bill S-13 are raising today, and that is we are 
procedurally dealing with a grey area.  We need to look very much 
at the circumstances surrounding the bill and the history of 
tobacco legislation in the country.  We need to very much 
consider the public interest and the health of children in these 
deliberations.  I recommend that position to you, Mr. Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to speak to 
this point of order and to offer my humble comments.  I commend 
the hon. member for St. Paul's for her initiative in this regard 
as well as the original mover of the bill in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to follow the remarks of opposition members, 
particularly from the Reform and the NDP, who at least appear to 
be prepared to embrace a bill coming from the Senate, which is 
refreshing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped the government House leader would have reconsidered 
this strategy of buck-passing to you, Mr. Speaker.  It seems that 
the government is content to hand this ticking time bomb to the 
Chair as opposed to clearly and publicly state the government's 
opposition, or should I say cabinet's opposition to this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record will show that the government House leader in his 
remarks admitted that there is a technical difference between a 
tax and a levy.  That is an important admission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is doubtful that any decision that you will make, Mr. 
Speaker, will have more far-reaching impact on the health and 
longevity of the lives of young Canadians than the decision that 
you will be making on this point of order.  I say this at the 
outset as a backdrop to the procedural arguments I would like to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have every confidence that the Chair will make its decision 
based solely on the rules of the House, not the merits of the 
bill, not the emotion or the rhetoric that sometimes follows a 
bill such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My earnest submission is that there are grey areas for the 
Speaker to decide.  Your Honour is treading into an unchartered 
area.  These grey areas, I submit and as has been previously 
submitted, should be decided in favour of this House, this 
Chamber as a whole, not the government which has refused to 
engage in a debate on Bill S-13.  It is only the cabinet, it 
appears, that is unwilling to declare its opinion with respect to 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will have available to you, Mr. Speaker, the decision of the 
Speaker of the other Chamber.  I will admit that that is not 
binding on you, Mr. Speaker, but it is in fact a compelling 
argument and something that should be considered by you.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has suggested that the levy proposed 
in the bill amounts to a tax, a burden on people.  Certainly the 
levy has some similarity to a tax at first blush, that is to say, 
it looks, smells and perhaps acts like a tax but is not a tax. 
One might say that there is a charge to be made on anyone selling 
tobacco products and an offence is created by failing to pay that 
levy.  However, there is proof that this is not a tax if one 
examines in detail the provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this closely.  The charge is made not on the 
population at large but is placed on the industry itself, with 
the proceeds directed specifically.  The proceeds are to be used 
completely outside the purposes of the government.  The proceeds 
are not to be used by the government. It is specifically directed 
in the bill that they not be used for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is precedent for this situation and it is dealt with at 
page 763 of the 18th edition of Erskine May.  Speaking of the 
instances when levies have been treated as matters outside the 
ways and means rules, Erskine May cites 10 instances of bills 
which imposed levies and levies which have been used for purposes 
other than the direct positive benefit of an industry.  The levy 
can be used for other purposes.  I submit this is the case with 
respect to Bill S-13.  I quote from page 763 of Erskine May: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may sometimes be difficult to define the limits of an 
industry, as in the Wheat Bill of 1932 (which was treated as 
within this rule) under which levies upon importers of flour 
formed a fund for making payments to growers of wheat.  An even 
more difficult case was the Mineral Workings Bill, 1951, under 
which a fund fed by contributions from ironstone operators, 
owners and the Exchequer was set up to restore agriculture land 
from which iron ore had been extracted.  This again was held to 
be a levy on the operators and owners though it involved some 
extension of the rule. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal recommendation was required on the mineral workings 
bill because of the contribution required from the exchequer. 
That was significant in the House, as recorded in volume 486 of 
<I>Hansard</I>, column 1809.  There was no royal recommendation 
required in the instance of the wheat bill.  Both bills passed 
both houses without being treated as taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My submission is that Bill S-13 has nothing to do with public 
funds at all.  Further, it distinguishes itself from this 
traditional definition of tax because there is no reference to 
public funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House passed in the last parliament a levy under the 
amendments to the Copyright Act.  A levy was placed on the sale 
of audio tapes and the proceeds of the levy were directed to go 
to a board, not for the improvement of the audio tape industry 
but for the benefit of music composers.  The House at that time 
did not treat this levy as a tax.  I suggest that this situation 
is very akin to the one now before the Chair presented by Bill 
S-13.  It is a strong precedent that I urge Your Honour to 
examine closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not a levy proposed by Bill S-13 is a tax may be a 
question for the determination of the courts, as was mentioned by 
my hon. friend across the floor.  There is a legal definition 
that I would refer Your Honour to and that is in the case of 
Lawson v Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of 
Direction, 1931, SCR,357, a Supreme Court of Canada decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite from a crib note in the decision where a definition of a 
tax was given:  “Whether a levy is a tax or a fee was considered 
in Lawson—Duff J. for the majority concluded that the levy in 
question was a tax because”—and this was the test—“it was 
enforceable by law”.  Clearly it would be here.  Second, it was 
“imposed under the authority of a legislature”.  There is no 
difficulty with that.  Third, it was “levied by a public body”. 
This is not the case here.  Fourth, it was “intended for a 
public purpose”.  Again, it does not fall squarely within the 
definition contemplated by the supreme court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in that discussion you will read of the evolution 
of tallage to taxes.  The central theme is that taxes are funds 
for the use of the crown. The industry levy in Bill S-13 provides 
no support for the crown.  Indeed the funds from the levy are 
specifically denied to the crown by the terms of this bill. That 
is specifically set out. This is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proceeds of the levy do not accrue to the crown and equally 
important, are not for public uses, that is, uses determined by a 
government body.  Here the body is non-governmental.  The 
proceeds go to a private body, the foundation, for its use within 
the restrictions that are set out in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there may be a general benefit to the community derived 
from the work of the foundation, the work is not carried out by 
the crown or any agent of the crown. The work of the foundation 
is not subject to the scrutiny of parliament.  Indeed one of the 
criticisms against this bill is that the auditor general would 
not be able to examine the funds or the foundation. That again I 
submit is an admission that this is outside of government 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ordinary language it is not a government body supported by 
tax revenue from the consolidated revenue fund.  This clearly 
demonstrates that the body is outside the purview of government 
regulation or interference and not subject to direct government 
scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I submit that if there is any doubt in your mind, Mr. 
Speaker, about the difference between a tax and a levy on this 
industry, as discussed in Erskine May, that doubt should be 
resolved in favour of consideration by this House, leaving 
ultimate determination for the courts, should it go that route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the precedents which may be cited of instances where the 
Speaker has disallowed Senate bills on the basis of their being 
taxation measures, please keep in mind that in most instances 
these bills altered existing tax rates.  There was no doubt or 
grey area in those precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a case to err on the side of caution or exclusion 
regardless of the merits of this bill.  There is provision in our 
standing orders to permit the House to waive any claim to its 
financial privilege vis-à-vis the Senate.  If the House is to 
have the opportunity to either waive such a claim or to have a 
conference with the Senate on a bill such as Bill S-13, which is 
also an option, the Speaker ought not to intervene to prevent the 
House from considering those questions.  This is tantamount to 
the government posing a pre-emptive strike.  Any intervention by 
the Speaker at this point before the House is fully seized with 
the complexities of Bill S-13 would deny the House the 
opportunity to perform its usual duties to deliberate on these 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would urge Your Honour not to intervene in this 
matter.  This pre-emptive strike would in fact deny the 
opportunity for us in this House to do the work that is important 
and desired by all Canadians and all members of the chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one techical point I would like to make. The hon. 
government House 
leader referred to the summary of the bill in his 
remarks. Your Honour will be aware that the summary is not part 
of the body of this bill and is not really a proper point of 
reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is essentially trying to do is on the one 
hand to give the impression that it likes the bill.  The 
government House leader used words like praiseworthy and 
commendable.  Yet the government is trying to kill this bill. He 
is saying “Wash me but don't make me wet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one final point. The government House leader gave 
a public interview on this matter and he asserted that the bill 
was improper “in its present form”.  Those were the words that 
he used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader and the government itself has within 
its power the ability to cure each and every one of these alleged 
irregularities in the bill if that is in fact the government's 
concern.  If that is what the government is worried about, the 
Minister of Health or any minister of the cabinet can adopt this 
bill and take it under their wing and can call it their own. I do 
not believe there would be any objection from the movers of this 
bill in either the Senate or this chamber to the government doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this month I asked the government House leader if he was 
prepared to provide government time for this bill and he refused. 
The government could and should assume responsibility for the 
carriage of this bill. I ask that this House waive any alleged 
claim to its privilege.  This is what the government should be 
prepared to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my remarks with respect to this point of order. As a 
final note, again I am urging you, Mr. Speaker, not to do what 
the government itself is not prepared to do.  If we strike down 
Bill S-13 at this particular time, the House and the government 
will not have the opportunity to speak or propose remedies to the 
government's objections, nor will the entire membership of the 
House, and through us, the Canadian people, be provided with a 
true and healthy discourse on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, make the government politically responsible.  The 
government does not have the votes to defeat this bill, if that 
is the route it wants to go.  In the name of patience and what is 
right for this House and what is right for every house in Canada, 
I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to deny the government House leader's 
arguments.  Let us put children ahead of political preference on 
this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I raise this point of order at the first opportunity so 
that I may conform to your dictum suggested in the House in your 
ruling of October 16, 1995 when you said “It is the duty of 
every member of the House to be vigilant in regard to section 53 
of the Constitution Act and to scrutinize bills no matter where 
they originate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, section 53 of the Constitution Act as you are 
aware, states that bills for “appropriating any part of the 
public revenue or for imposing a tax or impost shall originate in 
the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that Bill S-13, an act to incorporate and 
to establish an industry levy to provide for the anti-smoking 
youth foundation, while not a bill that appropriates any part of 
the public revenue requiring a royal recommendation, is 
nevertheless a bill that imposes a tax or an impost and 
accordingly should have been originated in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bourinot on page 491 of his fourth edition reminds us that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general rule, public bills may originate in either house; 
but whenever they... involve directly or indirectly the levying or 
appropriation of any tax upon the people, they must be initiated 
in the popular branch, in accordance with law and English 
constitutional practice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this practice, Bourinot points out that it is 
now a fixed principle of constitutional government that all 
propositions for the imposition of taxes should emanate from the 
ministries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our standing orders provide that in order to introduce 
legislation that imposes a tax or an impost there must first be a 
notice of ways and means followed by the adoption of the motion 
and only a minister of the crown may do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 36 of Bill S-13 requires those who manufacture, produce 
or import tobacco products to pay a levy.  Historically in Canada 
tobacco has been taxed by means of legislation preceded by a ways 
and means motion that provides for “that it is expedient to 
impose, levy and collect on tobacco and cigars manufactured in 
Canada”. So reads the Commons <I>Journal</I> of 1918, page 233 
and so reads the act based on that ways and means motion, an act 
to amend the Inland Revenue Act 1918, C.28,2.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, going back even earlier in Canada's history, the Inland 
Revenue Act of 1883, section 248 uses the same language, i.e., 
“on tobacco and cigars manufactured within the Dominion of 
Canada, there shall be imposed, levied, collected the following 
duties of excise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same wording continues to this day.  In the Revised Statutes 
of Canada 1985 in chapter E-14, the Excise Act, section 200, 
duties of excise, states “there shall be imposed, levied and 
collected on tobacco and cigars manufactured in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Shakespeare said, what's in a name, a rose by any other name 
would smell as sweet.  That is in the case of Bill S-13 it may be 
demonstrated that a levy is in fact a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate in the other place in support of the 
procedural acceptability of the bill, the sponsor of Bill S-13 
relied particularly on Bill C-32, an act to amend the Copyright 
Act, which was adopted by this parliament in 1997. Bill C-32 
imposes a levy on persons who manufacture blank tapes in Canada 
or imports them and arranges for the distribution of these levies 
to groups, including those representing authors and performers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Bill C-32 may not have been preceded by a ways and means 
motion, it was yet introduced by a minister of the crown. 
Furthermore, the summary of Bill C-32, now chapter 24 of the 
Statues of Canada for 1997, points out that the enactment in 
effect provides among other things a regime to protect 
performers' performances to conform to an international 
convention, and establishes a remuneration regime in relation to 
the private copying of musical works, performers' performances 
and sound recordings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words Bill C-32 comes within the exception set out in 
May's <I>Parliamentary Practice</I>, 22nd edition, at page 779 
where it states “Levies upon an industry for purposes beneficial 
to that industry are regarded as not covered by the rules of 
financial procedure and so do not require authorization by a ways 
and means resolution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sponsor in the other place relied considerably upon the 21st 
edition of May's <I>Parliamentary Practice</I> in support of his 
position.  The 22nd edition of May notes at page 779 “Modern 
legislation frequently makes provision for the imposition of 
other types of fees or payments which, although not taxes in a 
strict sense, have enough of the characteristics of taxation to 
require to be treated as `charges upon the people' and therefore 
to be authorized by a ways and means resolution moved by a 
minister of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also goes on to say “This distinction between the types of 
payments which are or are not covered by the rules of financial 
procedure is not always straightforward in practice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular May suggests “Where payment is imposed in order 
to meet the cost of enforcing a new regulatory scheme which is 
for the general benefit”—and I highlight general 
benefit—“rather than for the benefit of the industry”. That is 
on pages 779-80. Such a regime is one that requires the use of 
financial procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 3 of Bill S-13 says the purpose of the act is “reducing 
the rise of tobacco products by young persons throughout 
Canada”. While the section refers to that being an industry 
objective, there is nothing more fundamentally public than 
matters of health, in particular the health of our young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill S-13, the smoking public would be the real 
recipient of any benefit, not the tobacco industry.  The purpose 
is a public purpose.  That is its pith and substance.  It is a 
public purpose.  As the summary of Bill S-13 states, the mandate 
is to reduce the use of tobacco by young persons in Canada.  In 
fact, the new title of the bill endorses the public purpose. 
Accordingly, Bill S-13 does not come within the exception 
mentioned above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Bill S-13 is not unlike the reference in the 22nd 
edition of May to the case of the merchant shipping bill, 1973-74 
which imposed an obligation on importers of oil to contribute to 
an international fund for the compensation for oil pollution 
damage, which required a ways and means resolution, even though 
the contributions were not to pass through the consolidated 
revenue fund. The levies to be raised by Bill S-13 are also not 
destined for the consolidated revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect the levy to be imposed by Bill S-13 smacks of a tax. 
It represents the imposition of levies, charges or fees which are 
akin to taxation in their effect and characteristics and thus are 
subject to a ways and means resolution.  That can be found on 
page 777 of May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the public policy of permitting a group or an 
industry to raise money either through a public tax, levy or 
impost for a benefit that flows to the public, as opposed merely 
to the industry, Bill S-13 would also not only breach the 
historical constitutional convention that only the crown may 
impose a charge upon the people, but it would also fly in the 
face of the House of Commons jealously guarding its role in 
parliament.  As Bourinot reminds us, such measures “must be 
initiated in the popular branch”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of raising public revenue from the tobacco industry 
in Canada shows clearly that it was done by means of imposing a 
levy of excise under the aegis of the financial procedures in our 
standing orders. This is not the case for Bill S-13.  Accordingly 
this bill should not remain on the Order Paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am here to speak on the point of order concerning Bill 
S-13, an act to incorporate and establish an industry levy to 
provide for the Canadian anti-smoking youth foundation, a bill 
that I personally support.  I rise not to speak on the merits of 
the bill but to address the concerns raised on the point of order 
by the hon. member and also to compliment the hon. member for St. 
Paul's for her action on this as a member of parliament and as a 
physician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would not have come up if not for the failure of the 
government to deal with the issue of smoking in Canada, a failure 
of a government that in 1994 lowered the tax rate on cigarettes 
which has caused nearly a quarter of a million children to take 
up cigarette smoking. Bill S-13 attempts to deal with it. That 
the bill had to be brought in this way is unfortunate but it has 
been dealt with and brought in this way because of the 
government's failure to actually do very much on the issue of 
smoking in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on procedure and the way this is done is 
supported by a number of precedents, including Bill C-32, the 
Canada Shipping Act, and the Canada Petroleum Resource Act that 
show very clearly this is a levy and not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage you, Mr. Speaker, in your position as an upholder of 
the House and as an upholder of the rules of the House, to look 
at that issue and see very clearly that the hon. member for St. 
Paul's is correct in her assessment and that the government House 
leader is not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will not take long on this point of order, but I want to address 
the concerns raised in the point of order by the hon. minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express first of all my sincere concern that this legislation 
will not be given the proper attention that I think it deserves 
in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members well know, parliament evolved out of the 
Westminster model of parliamentary government. There are three 
very important actors in this model, the government, the House of 
Commons and the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our brief but colourful history as a nation has progressed, 
two basic principles have emerged that govern the relationship 
between the government, the parliament and the electorate.  These 
principles are a responsible and representative parliamentary 
government.  Responsibility and representation is what we have 
known for the life of this nation.  We have a responsible 
cabinet.  We have a representative parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A responsible and representative parliament performs very 
important functions.  Parliamentarians deliberate, investigate 
and legislate items that come under their purview.  The upper and 
lower chambers that compose the Parliament of Canada share these 
roles.  Parliamentarians deliberate.  We look at issues and try 
to decide if these issues are worthy of debate, worthy of change 
or whether the issues raised are worth our attention at all. We 
use our collective judgment to decide what work gets done 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians investigate.  We have investigated many issues 
that relate to smoking.  We investigate many issues that often 
result in the creation of laws.  We legislate.  We have been 
given the honour to create laws, to be the ones who make 
decisions that affect the welfare of all Canadians, our youth 
included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am not here to tell you whether this bill or 
should not be passed.  I am here simply to say to you that this 
bill deserves to be fully scrutinized by the traditional 
mechanisms of our parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill S-13 deserves the attention and the process that 
it and many other bills in the history of this nation have 
received.  Let us give this bill the attention it deserves and 
let the members of this Chamber do their jobs and decide whether 
it deserves second reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to expand on some of the comments 
made by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have a possible solution to assist you in your 
decision and in a sense get you off the hot seat. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the other place is involved in this issue.  It has 
dealt with it.  It has passed it duly through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the House of Commons now is captivated by this issue. 
The government certainly is interested in the issue but, most 
important, the people of Canada and the children of Canada are 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the constitutional arguments, notwithstanding 
the procedural arguments, notwithstanding whether this is a tax 
or a levy or an impost, if there is a will to pass this 
legislation surely we can agree among ourselves today to just set 
this aside and the government can introduce a ways and means 
motion tomorrow morning.  It will pass before Christmas if there 
is a will here on behalf of the people of Canada to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than perhaps go on for hours, if the will is here and I 
suspect from what I have heard that the people have spoken 
through their duly elected representatives in the House, we can 
actually have legislation before us in the morning and deal with 
this expeditiously and actually have the entire legislation 
passed and proclaimed before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a generous gift it would be for the Parliament of Canada to 
give the people of Canada a life saving gift for generations to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Yukon, the environment; the hon. 
member for Tobique—Mactaquac, Asia-Pacific economic co-operation 
summit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to intervene on this point of order, but not to 
reiterate the excellent arguments of my colleague from St. 
Paul's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on two very specific points.  The first is the 
matter of the ways and means motion as it pertains to a tax 
rather than a levy. The second point concerns the criteria 
associated with the levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Mr. Speaker, you will have to decide whether a levy or a 
tax is involved.  When a bill proposes a levy and not a tax it 
is exempt from certain prerequisites.  A ways and means motion 
must be concurred in before a bill imposing a tax on the public 
can be introduced. 
There is no such requirement for a bill proposing a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It serves no purpose to repeat that a ways and means motion may 
be moved in the House only by a minister of the crown. 
According to the traditions in this House, a levy must meet 
three very specific criteria. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is that the levy is imposed on the industry.  The 
second one is to serve an industry purpose.  The third one is 
that the funds from the levy never form any part of the 
government's revenue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, yours is the role of judge.  As you said earlier, 
you want our opinion.  Other opinions, including legal ones, 
have been or will be submitted to you, no doubt.  You yourself 
will also seek other opinions, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close on the comparison, which was used earlier by the 
government House leader, between Bill C-32 on copyright and Bill 
S-13 before us.  Unlike the government leader, I see a lot of 
similarities between the two bills.  Bill C-32, which includes 
the levy on blank cassettes, did not require a ways and means 
motion and royal assent, because it essentially involved a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill must be passed and debated by this Parliament, which 
will judge it on its merits. 
I believe this bill meets all the criteria necessary to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission, I would like to table in this House legal 
opinions to this effect, which I hope will help you in your 
consideration of the matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want an idea of how much time I have because I want to 
go through some supreme court rulings in relation to the topic 
today.  They are somewhat detailed and will take more than a 
minute or two of your indulgence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am prepared to listen to the hon. member 
as long as he has pertinent information to this point of order. 
If the hon. member feels he could refer me to a particular case 
he might give a summary of the case in his own words and deposit 
the information on the table so I will have access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will go through it as 
quickly as I can.  It certainly speaks to the issue at hand.  It 
is very specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the arguments raised by the House leader is this is a tax 
and not a levy.  I want to step through here for the Canadian 
public. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that through your examination of 
this you have discovered some of this on your own, but to put it 
on the record I think is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tax is generally defined as a compulsory contribution levied 
on a person by a government body with the intent to transfer 
resources from the private to the public sector.  A tax is 
imposed to finance public sector goods and services and to 
redistribute income among different economic groups in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of whether a charge imposed by a government is or is 
not a tax has been examined by the courts in relation to section 
92(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867 in determining the status of 
various charges, some of them federal and some of them 
provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since pursuant to section 92(2) a province or the federal 
government may impose a direct but not an indirect tax, if the 
charge were an indirect charge it would be invalid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has examined this issue in the 
following cases and I will use the appendix of some of these 
cases to explain in more detail: the Agricultural Products 
Marketing Act, 1978; the Exported Natural Gas Act, 1982; Allard 
Contractors v Coquitlam, 1993; the Ontario Home Builders' 
Association v York Region Board of Education, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the agricultural products case the Supreme Court of Canada 
held that marketing levies imposed by a marketing board were 
regulatory charges intended to deal with the expenses of the 
marketing board.  The marketing levies were not a tax because 
they were not imposed to raise revenue for the public purse. The 
member for St. Paul's articulated this very clearly in her 
argument, that it is not moneys for the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Allard Contractor's case the Supreme Court of Canada held 
that a fee imposed by a municipality on companies engaged in the 
extraction of gravel was not a tax, as the fees raised were 
intended to be used to repair roads. The fee had a specific use. 
The key is specific use and because that was a specific use it 
was a valid regulatory charge.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In The Ontario Home Builders' Association case, the Supreme 
Court of Canada held that a charge imposed by school boards on 
land developers, which was intended to be used to fund the 
construction of new schools, was a regulatory charge and not a 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Court of Appeal found that the probate fees levied 
by the province of Ontario were part of a regulatory scheme 
relating to the maintenance of the Ontario court.  The levying of 
probate fees was part of a general revenue raising program and as 
such was not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the natural gas tax case, the Supreme Court of Canada found 
that the charge in issue was intended to raise revenue for 
general public purposes and as such was a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of these cases is that a levy imposed by a public 
body can be characterized as a regulatory charge and not a tax if 
the amounts received pursuant to the levy are to be used for a 
specific governmental service and the amount of the levy 
reasonably relates to the cost of providing that service.  That 
was articulated very well by the member for St. Paul's in terms 
of what would be raised by this levy, where and how it would be 
spent, how much of it would be spent and what would happen if all 
the money were not spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy intended to be imposed pursuant to part two of Bill 
S-13 is a levy that is clearly intended to provide funds to 
defray the cost of providing the services and products referred 
to in section 5 of the proposed act.  It is not intended that 
the levy provide revenue to be transferred to any public 
authority to be used for general public purposes.  The levy is to 
be specifically applied toward the needs of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between the levy and the expenses of the 
foundation is indicated in section 36(3) of the proposed act in 
that if the number of young persons in Canada who are smoking 
tobacco products declines to 5% or less in the fifth or the 
subsequent year of the foundation, the foundation may reduce or 
eliminate the levy imposed pursuant to section 36(1) of the 
proposed act for the particular year.  It is to be presumed that 
the expenses of the foundation would decrease if there were fewer 
young persons in Canada smoking and as such the need for a levy 
to satisfy these expenses would be correspondingly reduced. That 
is articulated very clearly in the bill. It is my opinion that 
the levy to be imposed pursuant to part two of the proposed act 
is not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another two or three pages to go.  In the interests of 
time I would like to table them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This would be a proper way to do it.  He can 
give the information to the page and I will personally take 
charge of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know we must speak to 
the technicalities of the bill.  We are talking about 40,000 
deaths per year in Canada because of smoking.  We have to do 
everything in our power to address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make a point that goes back to a precedent and I do not think 
it has been mentioned today.  Canadian practice provides a 
precedent based on British cases.  This proves it is possible for 
a ways and means resolution should it be deemed required to be 
moved to the bill post-second reading. 
Mr. Speaker, that is an option you should consider because that 
would allow the bill to be on the floor of the House of Commons 
and debated for its merits.  Obviously that has to be part of 
your consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to back up the arguments of my colleague from St. 
Paul's and all the other members who have spoken in favour of the 
recognition of Bill S-13 as valid to be introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear among all of us that a tax is a charge on the 
people.  We agree with that.  If a tax is a charge on the people 
then it must be preceded by a ways and means motion.  We all 
agree with that.  A ways and means motion must be introduced by a 
minister of the crown. A tax bill can originate only in the House 
of Commons.  In one way or another tax revenues will form part of 
the general revenues of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A levy is a very different thing.  A levy is imposed to serve a 
particular beneficial industry purpose.  The funds from the levy 
never form part of the revenues of the government.  We need to 
find out whether the levy imposed on the tobacco industry in this 
case is a charge on the people and forms part of the revenue of 
government.  If such is not the case, if it is not a charge on 
the people generally and does not form part of a revenue of 
government, it is a case for saying Bill S-13 constitutes the 
introduction and imposition of a levy on a particular industry 
and is valid for introduction in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very clear.  My colleague from 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant quoted section 36, saying there is a 
distinct imposition on a particular industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a the ruling by the Speaker of the Senate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two things to do here.  I do not have authority on 
constitutional law but I can look at the bill and compare it to 
precedents to find out whether it is valid for introduction or 
not as a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is within my authority, however, is examination of the bill 
in order to assess what it declares itself to be.  I accepted the 
plain and ordinary meaning of its words and studied them to see 
if all the clauses relevant to the issue of the levy were 
internally consistent.  I then measured the levy described in the 
bill against the criteria Erskine May sets out at pages 730-737 
for identifying levies that are exempt from financial procedures 
governing the imposition of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the matter of the plain language of the bill, it 
speaks in terms of a levy rather than a tax.  This is evident 
from part II of the bill.  It is also clear that the levy is 
imposed upon the tobacco industry alone. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is not a charge on the people.  It is a charge on 
the tobacco industry.  He states further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the levy, as stated in the bill, is to meet an 
industry purpose beneficial to it, although this industry purpose 
also has a public benefit.  Clause 3 states categorically that 
the purpose of the bill is: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>... to enable and assist the Canadian tobacco industry to carry 
out its publicly-stated objective of reducing the use of tobacco 
products by young persons throughout Canada. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, with respect to the language of the bill I must 
accept that what is proposed is a levy, not a tax. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he goes on to compare it with Erskine May: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first criterion is that the levy must be for industry 
purposes.  The second is that the funds collected must not form 
any part of government revenue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concludes by comparing the provisions of Bill C-32: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is further evidence that the levy [in Bill C-32] was not 
viewed as a tax.  I say this because, so far as I have been able 
to determine, the bill was not preceded by a ways and means 
resolution, which would have been a prerequisite if the funds had 
been viewed as a tax. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to section 35. I am not discussing the substance but 
just the case of proving that it is a levy.  If part of the 
general revenue, the consolidated revenue of the government, it 
would have to come back to the consolidated revenue of the 
government.  If a charge on the people, it would have to be part 
of government revenues and, if anything happened, come back to 
government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates a foundation and section 35 clearly establishes 
that if the foundation is wound up the revenues have to be 
transferred from the council of the foundation and therefore back 
to the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill clearly identifies that the objective is to impose a 
levy on one particular industry just as was done with the blank 
tapes on Bill C-32.  There is no difference at all.  It is for 
the benefit of a particular purpose which is beneficial to the 
industry as a whole.  The tobacco industry supports Bill S-13 by 
saying “We cannot do it ourselves, we are not credible, nobody 
will accept it from us.  Therefore an arm's length foundation 
that keeps the revenue which it is totally in control of can do 
this on our behalf”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference between this and Bill C-32?  There is 
none at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Pierrefonds—Dollard tabled two legal opinions

</I></B></P><P align=left>They appeared before the Senate and they clearly established 
that in their minds it was a levy and not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a letter in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today from one of 
our foremost lawyers, Lawrence Greenspon, and I would like to 
quote from it because I think it is very important at this time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian courts are used to dealing with this issue and have 
distinguished between these kinds of regulatory charges on the 
one hand, and taxes on the other.  They are not the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first legal requirement is that the levy be imposed on the 
industry for what is called an industry purpose.  Here the aim is 
clear.  The bill targets the tobacco manufacturers, collects the 
money from those manufacturers and then uses the money 
exclusively to direct information at a segment of the population 
affected by the products of those same manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second condition that must be satisfied is to ensure that 
none of the money collected ends up in the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund.  The provisions of the bill ensure that if there is a 
surplus it goes back to its source, the tobacco manufacturers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the case with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Greenspon also says “As a lawyer I am saddened by the 
prospect of legal interpretation being misused to overcome this 
life-saving effort”.  Mr. Greenspon concludes that in his mind 
it is definitely a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, to recognize this as what it very 
clearly is.  My colleagues, I would say, fully support the 
principle of this bill.  I disagree with others who say they do 
not because I know that they do, and strongly do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that members feel duty bound to intervene on a question 
which is very germane to what we do here.  I think it is very 
important that they did.  I appreciate that they did.  It will be 
your ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that members opposite invoked section 53 of the 
Constitution Act.  Members referred several times to the 
Constitution and I suggest that in Beauchesne's it is very clear 
that matters of constitutional law and matters of the law itself 
are not your prerequisite.  I think this goes beyond the scope of 
what the Speaker should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is within your scope, Mr. Speaker, to look at this 
legislation which is expressed in very clear and plain language, 
which clearly identifies its purpose, its meaning and its 
objectives.  Look at it and agree with us that there is no tax 
chargeable on the people, that there is no need for a ways and 
means motion, that it can be introduced in the other place, as 
has been done, that it is valid here and that we should deal with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope, Mr. Speaker, that is the way you will conclude your 
recommendations to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  There are still four members on the list who 
wish to speak.  At 5.30 p.m. we are supposed to go to Private 
Members' Business.  That is an order of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are approximately 12 minutes left and there are four of 
you on your feet.  May I suggest that you summarize your remarks 
in three minutes, if you can.  I am going to hear the hon. member 
from the Reform Party, then the hon. member for Whitby—Ajax, 
then the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas and then you will wrap 
up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, some people in this House seem to be under the mistaken 
assumption that the 50 cent a carton donation is a tax or a levy. 
In my view it is not a tax, it is not a levy, it is merely a 
compulsory donation supporting a cause which I think is above 
reproach, that is, to discourage children from experimenting and 
becoming addicted to a totally foul and nasty drug.  The intent 
of this bill is not to fill the pockets of the taxman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, the issue of whether it is a tax or a levy 
is a grey area.  I think that gives the Speaker some latitude 
when considering this.  It certainly gives you some latitude in 
determining whether or not this bill is appropriate to come 
before the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that when you consider this you consider 
the fact, as you have said many times, that you are a servant of 
the House and the members of this place.  I believe that the will 
exists on both sides of the House to see that this issue is 
brought forward and debated in full.  I ask you to take that into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it unseemly that the government should attempt to 
prevent the introduction of this bill through a technicality.  It

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
you have already heard eloquent arguments about whether this bill 
really constitutes a tax or a levy and I do not intend to repeat 
them.  However, I do intend to highlight another aspect of this 
process as it concerns your involvement as Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, asking you to rule this bill a tax bill and 
therefore out of order is asking you to contradict the stated 
intentions of the bill.  The bill states that it is proposing a 
levy, not a tax.  The bill states that the levy is for publicly 
stated industry purposes and objectives.  The bill states that 
these funds will not flow into the consolidated revenue fund.  As 
articulated by my colleague from Lac-Saint-Louis, this bill 
clearly states and proves that it will impose a levy, not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with the greatest respect, it is not your role to 
impugn motives other than those stated in the bill.  You are in 
effect being asked to speculate about the possible impact this 
bill will have in law.  You are being asked to provide both a 
legal and a constitutional decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you are familiar with Beauchesne's, but for the record I 
repeat citation 168(5) at page 49 of Beauchesne's 6th edition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker will not give a decision upon a constitutional 
question nor decide a question of law, though the same may be 
raised on a point of order or privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the role of the courts to make this determination, not the 
role of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, your role, as you well know, is to guard the 
privilege to debate and speak freely on virtually every issue. 
In the absence of any compelling reason proving that this bill is 
procedurally unacceptable, your duty is to allow the debate to 
continue and to allow us, the members of this place, to make an 
appropriate determination on the merits of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to say that it is unfortunate that such 
a worthy initiative is being caught up in procedural wrangling, 
particularly when there appears to be broad multi-party support 
for the goal of this bill, which is to protect the health of our 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have a bill with stated intentions.  You must 
apply the rules, not interpret the law or impugn other motives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will obey your injunction and be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to associate myself with the eloquent arguments that were 
made initially by the member for St. Paul's and thank her for 
bringing this important legislation before the House.  I also 
want to pay tribute to Senator Colin Kenny who has travelled 
tirelessly across this country, in the shared objective of 
members on all sides of this House, to deal with the human 
tragedy of 40,000 deaths each year, too many of which are 
teenagers and young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there have been a range of arguments on the issue of a tax 
versus a levy and the constitutional acceptance of this 
legislation, I suggest an alternative which might meet with the 
approval of members on all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consulted with the Table.  There is another option, other 
than a ruling at this stage which may or may not preclude debate 
on the substance of this bill.  I appeal to members to consider 
seriously this option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make it very clear that this argument is without prejudice to 
the position that I, the member for St. Paul's, my colleague from 
Winnipeg North Centre and others would take, which is that the 
bill is in order and should proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to members that the House is in a position, should it 
agree not to give unanimous consent to allow this bill to proceed 
through all stages, to give consent to allow this bill to proceed 
through second reading and committee stage.  The House can give 
that consent now.  Members can give that consent.  Should that 
consent be forthcoming, then Canadians would be in a position to 
be heard on this issue through members on all sides, both in the 
House and in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the government could consider the advisability 
or the wisdom of proceeding with a ways and means motion, should 
it believe that necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Mr. Speaker, procedurally I would suggest that should 
consent be granted, your ruling would be postponed until 
necessary to rule on the specific issue of the necessity for a 
ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to appeal to members of the House.  There is a will on 
all sides of the House to allow the merits of this very important 
legislation to be heard.  Therefore, I want to ask members on all 
sides of the House for unanimous consent to allow Bill S-13 to 
proceed through second reading and committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should consent be granted, then obviously it would still be very 
much within the purview of the government to consider the wisdom 
of proceeding with a ways and means motion.  But what this would 
allow—and, as I say, I have consulted with the Table—is for the 
merits of this very important legislation to be considered in the 
House and in committee.  Therefore, I seek that consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want to understand, so I will put this to 
the member.  The member wants permission to ask for unanimous 
consent to advance this bill to a certain stage, and I believe he 
said second reading and committee stage.  That is what he wants 
the consent of the House to do.  That is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to put the 
motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to give you some constructive suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue around Bill S-13 seems to be revolving around the 
definition of the word levy.  I point out in the legislation that 
under definitions it says “Levy means the levy”.  The 
legislation defines levy by the same word.  It is a levy for 
industry purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there have been arguments that you should pay 
careful attention to what judges say, to what the supreme court 
says on issues like this, and to what the courts in general say. 
I will ask you to speak as the president of the highest court in 
the land.  I look to you to make a decision that is above the 
courts because this place is above the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I do not think we need to go to the courts to 
define what the word levy means.  All we have to do is go to the 
table in front of you and examine the <I>Concise Oxford 
Dictionary</I>, which is the Table dictionary.  If we look up the 
word levy we will find that the definition is “the collecting of 
a contribution, tax, et cetera”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, were you to go to the parliamentary library and 
look up the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I>, volume 8, you would 
find this definition of levy:  “the action of collecting an 
assessment, duty, tax, et cetera”. <I>Collins English 
Dictionary</I> defines levy as:  a) the art of imposing and 
collecting a tax, tariff, et cetera; b) the money so raised”. 
The <I>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</I> 
defines it this way:  “to impose or collect a tax”.  Finally, 
if we look at <I>Larousse</I>, we will find that “prélèvement” 
is translated as “impôt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there is no question about what the English and the 
French language mean by the word levy, and it is a tax.  However, 
you have heard arguments that there have been interpretations of 
the word levy made by the courts as having something to do with 
raising money by regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for New Brunswick Southwest drew your attention to 
the Ontario probate fees.  He said that if you want an example of 
a levy you could look at the Ontario probate fees, and he cited 
court documents. 
Recently that has been the source of a court challenge and those 
fees have been declared a tax.  As I understand it, the Ontario 
government is now on the hook for about a billion dollars on this 
levy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to consider very carefully what we 
really do mean by a levy.  Again the dictionary before you on the 
table defines tax.  We have seen in that dictionary that a levy 
is a tax and now we will look at the definition of a tax.  It 
reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a contribution to government revenue compulsorily levied on 
individuals, property, or businesses. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the arguments we have been hearing is that because this 
compulsory tax goes to a foundation it is not really a tax at 
all.  I submit that because a foundation is a creature of this 
parliament, a creature of this government, it is indeed a 
recipient of a tax.  We do not evade the question of whether a 
tax is a tax simply because it goes to an arm's length agency 
that has been created by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key word is the fact that money is being raised from people 
compulsorily.  I point out that normally in our legislation we do 
not make a distinction between individuals who are persons like 
myself, single people, and corporations.  They are often viewed 
in legislation as individuals and they are regarded as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to another definition in the 
legislation: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“sponsor of the Foundation” means a person who pays a levy. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we transpose the word levy for tax, that definition actually 
is that sponsor of the foundation means a person who pays a tax. 
In other words, this is all about taxing somebody.

afternoon.  I would imagine that this will be a far-reaching 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the advice that you have given me and I will look to 
other sources so that I get a complete view of this particular 
problem.  Of course you would not want me to limit myself only to 
what was said in the House because there is, no doubt, other 
information that I will need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take into consideration the very valuable information 
that you have given me today.  When I have looked all the 
material, I will return to the House with a decision on this 
particular point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if you come across 
information that would be interesting to the House or possibly 
new information that was not raised here this afternoon, would it 
be possible for you to bring that to us so that we could comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know you do not want to get into a debate 
with your Speaker, but when I bring my decision forth there will 
be no doubt as to where I get my information from.  That will be 
laid before the House when I make my decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.)</B> moved that Bill C-207, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(trespass), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a privilege to begin 
debate today on my private member's Bill C-207 dealing with 
amending the Criminal Code with respect to trespassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill arises out of community response.  My motivation is 
based on complaints from police officers, security at shopping 
malls and so on; my experience in dealing with family disputes 
being an officer of the criminal justice system in the past; and 
comments from the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly my motivation is to protect my community, to protect 
the viability for children in a library, at a skating rink, on 
the school grounds or at a local shopping mall. 
In domestic family disputes it would certainly go a long way to 
facilitate voluntary compliance in preserving the peace in 
residences to protect children there.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the frustration is that persons are trespassing on 
property, causing a public disturbance and destroying a sense of 
community and livability for children, yet are unable to be 
removed permanently for a small period of time.  For example, 
malls are a popular place for youth to hang out, sometimes for 
young drug dealers to strut their style, or for casual gangs to 
want to show off and simply take over an area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security in malls consistently has a difficult time in 
maintaining civility.  The main reason is that they have little, 
if any, authoritative jurisdiction when they want to give a 
warning to someone.  They really cannot warn the person with 
anything other than saying that legally they could remove them 
from the property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the security staff of the mall, a library or whatever, is 
forced to remove a problem person, that person can just re-enter 
within minutes.  There is no place in the Criminal Code that 
states the trespasser must stay off the property for any period 
of time.  The only way the person could be charged is if he or 
she resists while being removed from the property.  If the person 
never resists that act could continue over and over again, and it 
does in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that federal government officials seem to often forget 
is that teenagers are extremely street smart.  I recall when 
serving on the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs we 
were dealing with the Young Offenders Act.  A witness wanted me 
to believe that most young offenders have no idea of what the 
possible penalties were under the Young Offenders Act.  That is 
certainly not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time now, Reformers have been calling for the Young 
Offenders Act to be strengthened in order to deter young 
offenders from committing crime.  One of the reasons for that is 
the community reputation.  The observation of outcomes from that 
act were known to be rather light or inconsequential.  Therefore 
there is no respect for the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became a member of parliament I served as a family 
justice counsellor and a probation-parole officer in the attorney 
general's ministry of British Columbia.  I spent a great amount 
of time dealing one to one with young offenders.  After a while 
in that kind of role one understands how they think.  In many 
circumstances they know exactly what they are doing.  Their 
actions are quite calculated.  Many know how to beat the system. 
If there is a loophole in the system, an offender will certainly 
find it and the word quickly travels on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reformers have been doing for the past five years is 
attempting to amend the justice system by closing some of these 
obvious loopholes, one loophole at a time in an orderly way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every province seems to have a different way of dealing with 
trespassers.  In British Columbia trespassing laws are rather 
weak.  Something has to be done with this most serious issue. 
With the provinces sometimes doing very little to remedy the 
situation, I believe that something should be done to amend the 
Criminal Code so that we can have a national standard of 
reasonable social behaviour in a public place, perhaps a Canadian 
identity of civility to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently an employee of the Department of Justice phoned my 
office to inquire about the bill we are discussing.  The official 
asked a member of my staff why we just do not lobby the provinces 
to amend their legislation as this change apparently borders on 
federal-provincial jurisdiction.  My response was that we cannot 
always look to the provinces as an escape for federal inaction. 
We cannot simply blame the provinces and say that it is their 
fare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example where the federal government needs to take 
some lead for once.  It is rightly in the jurisdiction of the 
federal government to amend the Criminal Code, section 41, and it 
will not be trampling on the feet of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that I am proposing in Bill C-207 would 
strengthen section 41 of the Criminal Code.  Section 41(1) 
clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That every one who is in peaceable possession of a dwelling house 
or real property, and every one lawfully assisting him or acting 
under his authority, is justified in using force to prevent any 
person from trespassing on the dwelling house or real property, 
or to remove a trespasser therefrom, if he uses no more force 
than is necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proposing an amendment to section 41 of the code, making it 
a summary conviction, that is a minor offence, for a person who 
has already been lawfully removed from real property or a 
dwelling house not to be able to lawfully return for just 24 
hours.  The reason for 24 hours is to provide adequate time for 
the individual to cool off.  It is amazing how attitudes change 
the following morning.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also provides a social intervening time for the crowd 
mentality behaviour and the show off behaviour to others to be 
interfered with.  Often the issue is the timing.  When someone is 
being legally removed the whole idea of their being able to come 
back within minutes and mock the system is often the game that is 
played. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a hypothetical situation.  A teenager is removed 
from a shopping mall for causing a disturbance short of a serious 
crime.  That teenager then must stay out of the shopping mall for 
a total of 24 hours under my provision.  Otherwise, he or she 
could be charged with trespassing and may be found guilty of an 
offence punishable upon summary conviction.  In other words, the 
teenager would be given a ticket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another hypothetical situation a boyfriend enters the 
property of his girlfriend and little children and is told to 
leave.  He will not leave so the police are called.  They arrive 
and legally remove him from the property.  But under the law 
there is nothing that stops him from repeating this an hour later 
and the lady will be forced to go through the same exercise over 
and over.  The police know their hands are tied, especially if 
this happens on a Saturday afternoon rather than prowling by 
night on residential property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment to section 47 would keep this fellow off that 
property for 24 hours.  Otherwise he would be charged with a 
summary conviction.  When being removed for the first time he 
then could be warned of the consequences if he returned before 24 
hours had passed.  In the current situation no such warning could 
be given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a real gap in the issue of domestic disputes and 
preserving the peace for children.  Because of the way the 
government has manipulated Private Members' Business, Bill C-207 
is unfortunately finished at the end of this hour.  However I do 
not plan to give up on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to make 
the criminal justice system loophole free and get rid of these 
problems.  That is why from time to time we receive omnibus bills 
that deal with a variety of issues throughout the Criminal Code. 
We do have the larger agenda of trying to provide peace, order 
and good government and to have safer streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today should have been the first hour of three hours of debate 
on Bill C-207, but the way in which the subcommittee on Private 
Members' Business conducts its selection is rather atrocious.  It 
is a travesty that members who diligently work to create 
legislation are not allowed the opportunity to get something 
through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected in 1993.  Since that time I can count on one hand 
the number of times I have had a bill drawn.  Once I made it 
through that lotto I was rarely fortunate to have one of my 
private member's bills adopted into federal legislation which 
eventually became law.  I was lucky at one point to have that 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill I introduced amended the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
It was a minor amendment but it was significant as far as I was 
concerned.  It closed a loophole and was similar in nature to 
what I am proposing today.  The Minister of Industry at the time 
acted justly and adopted my bill into the government bill and the 
contents of my proposal is now the law in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really did not matter where the bill came from.  It was the 
matter that we got the job done.  The issue is trying to provide 
co-operation and reconciliation in the House instead of always 
dividing on every issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee on Private Members' Business held a round table 
discussion on the issue of making all private members' motions 
votable.  It is my hope, and I am sure the hope of every 
backbencher in the House, that change will occur soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of the House knows the Criminal Code has loopholes. 
When the justice minister introduced omnibus bills amending tiny 
flaws in the code the minister was admitting there were 
adjustments that needed to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not expect the Criminal Code to be perfect.  It is 
an evolving piece of social legislation in some respects which 
reflects public sentiments and attitudes.  It needs to be 
adjusted over a period of time to new realities.  The public does 
expect government to act forthwith when a flaw is clearly pointed 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out a loophole in section 41 of the Criminal Code. 
Bill C-207 would help to eliminate a great deal of problems for 
local authorities and citizens who have spent a great amount of 
time investing in their local community centre, only to see the 
peace and enjoyment of that centre or hockey rink degraded to the 
point where it becomes unusable and they are afraid to bring 
their children there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a concern in my community.  My constituents asked me to 
help to throw water on this little fire.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that Bill C-207 was not made votable. 
Therefore I will have to tell my community that its voice has 
little weight in Ottawa because of the arrogance of the Liberal 
government.  The people's agenda is not reflected here.  It is 
sadly just the agenda of old tired ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is no more of an expert in community 
justice issues than any of us are.  All she needs to do is once 
in a while look on the order paper at some of the bills 
introduced by backbenchers to see the needs are for better law 
and order in Canada.  It is not complicated, not difficult. It 
just requires courage provided the minister and the rest of her 
cabinet cronies have the will to make Canada a better place to 
live. I have outlined a community need.  May this House find the 
same sense of courage to act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-207 would provide for an amendment to the code to create a 
new offence in relation to trespassing.  It would also create a 
summary conviction offence of subsequent trespass.  This offence 
would occur where a person trespasses on a dwelling house or 
other real property within 24 hours of having been lawfully 
removed from or prevented from entering the same property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It essentially criminalizes the second trespass that occurs 
within a 24 hour period with respect to the same property. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would provide for an amendment of the Criminal Code to 
create a new offence in relation to trespassing. The hon. 
member's bill would create a summary conviction offence of

</I></B></P><P align=left>This offence would occur where a person trespasses on a 
dwelling-house or other real property within 24 hours of having 
been lawfully removed from or prevented from entering the same 
property.  Essentially, it would criminalize a second trespass. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to begin with a clear understanding of what 
trespass means.  Trespass is a specific legal term referring to a 
civil fault or tort.  A trespasser is a person who enters a 
premises without the permission of the occupier or owner.  A 
person invited on to the property can become a trespasser if the 
individual is revoked by the owner asking the person to leave. 
Nothing more is required for trespass to occur than for a person 
to enter without permission or to remain on the property after 
being asked to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the most minimal intrusions on to property constitute a 
trespass in law.  There is no need for any damage to be caused to 
the property.  Trespass is a private matter between the 
trespasser and the occupier of the property.  The proper remedy 
for trespass is a civil action for damages and injunctions are 
available in extreme cases to prevent future or ongoing trespass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing law allows the owner of the property to lawfully 
eject the trespasser at any point. As a matter of property and 
civil rights, the law of trespass falls within the legislative 
jurisdiction of each of the provinces.  In addition to the civil 
law relating to trespass, many provinces have enacted legislation 
creating provincial offences for trespass. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of property and civil rights, the law of trespass 
falls within the legislative jurisdiction of each of the 
provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trespass to property is not currently a criminal offence. 
Trespass is not a criminal offence because in and of itself it 
may be a relatively minor intrusion into the rights of another 
and may not be sufficiently harmful to require the criminal law 
as a response. The civil remedies combined with provincial 
legislation cover most situations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trespass to property is not currently a criminal offence. 
Trespass is not a criminal offence basically because, in and of 
itself, it may be a relatively minor intrusion into the rights 
of another, and not sufficiently harmful to require the criminal 
law as a response. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Law Reform Commission of Canada studied the issue of whether 
to criminalize mere trespass without any further criminal intent 
or criminal conduct.  The commission found this inadvisable.  In 
addition to restating the fundamental principle that the criminal 
law should be used with restraint, the commission found that 
provincial trespass legislation and civil tort law provided 
adequate protection.  The hon. member's proposed amendment does 
not seek to make a mere trespass a criminal offence.  Instead, it 
is aimed at the mischief caused when a person who trespasses is 
asked or made to leave and then returns within a short period of 
time. 
It basically seeks to make a second trespass a criminal offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the first trespass is not a criminal offence, it is 
difficult in principle justifying making the second trespass a 
criminal offence.  If a first trespass is not sufficiently 
harmful conduct to be considered criminal then it is not entirely 
clear what feature of the subsequent trespass makes it serious 
enough to be criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly it does aggravate the owner and requires the owner to 
eject the trespasser a second time.  But this added aggravation 
in itself is not sufficiently harmful to render the trespasser 
subject to the criminal process although at this point they may 
clearly be violating the civil property rights of the owner of 
the property and be subject to a civil action and they may also 
be violating other provincial legislation.

they may also be violating other provincial legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the hon. member's proposal creates a somewhat arbitrary 
offence as well in that it criminalizes a return to the property 
only within 24 hours.  It is not exactly clear why two trespasses 
within 24 hours should be a crime and not two within 25 or 30 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many situations there might be little or no serious harm 
caused to society but the mere presence of a trespasser if there 
is not also some more serious criminal intent or interference 
with the rights of others.  While it may be the case that a 
property owner is inconvenienced or aggravated by the repeat 
trespasser, the hon. member's proposal would make a criminal out 
of every person who returned to a place after having been asked 
to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance a door to door salesman who we all know tries twice 
to sell his wares would be captured as would be the teenager 
delivering flyers against the wishes of a homeowner.  Such people 
may very well be a nuisance to the property owner and this kind 
of behaviour may well be a violation of civil or provincial law, 
but there should be evidence of at least more serious or 
potential harm before that behaviour is deemed to be criminal 
under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the hon. member's concern that it can be difficult 
to deal with a teenager who returns to a favourite spot to loiter 
or a person who returns to a party after having been asked to 
leave.  What is really at issue in these instances is the 
occupier's desire to control what happens on their property, and 
this is a matter regulated by the civil law of the provinces and 
in some cases by provincial offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not at all to say that the existing criminal law does 
not protect the rights of property owners and occupiers. This 
government strongly supports and protects private property rights 
and various legislative provisions in the Criminal Code already 
address many forms of conduct by a trespasser who poses a real 
risk to society and to individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, it is an indictable offence to break and enter 
into any place with intent to commit and indictable offence.  A 
person breaks and enters not only where they forcibly find a way 
in but if they enter by an existing permanent or temporary 
opening without lawful justification or excuse.  In the case of a 
dwelling house it is a further offence to be in the dwelling 
house without lawful excuse with intent to commit an indictable 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These offences criminalize the conduct of a trespasser who is 
trespassing for the purpose of committing a serious criminal 
offence.  In these cases, there is serious harm or potential for 
harm caused by the trespasser.  They also recognize that if the 
trespasser is present for an innocent purpose, for instance a 
lost hiker seeking refuge from the elements in a cabin, there 
would be no criminal offence.  There may, however, be a tort and 
the property owner could sue for any damage to the property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional offence is in section 177 of the Criminal Code 
which creates the offence of trespassing at night.  This offence 
prohibits loitering or prowling at night on someone else's 
property near a dwelling house.  Here the circumstances of the 
trespass are clearly in and of themselves serious enough to 
warrant being criminalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code also contains various offences that prohibit 
behaviour that interferes with the rights of others to enjoy 
public and private spaces.  For instance, section 175 of the 
Criminal Code makes it a summary conviction offence to cause a 
disturbance in a public place in various ways such as screaming, 
shouting or impeding people.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an offence to loiter in a public place while 
obstructing people.  Further, it is an offence to disturb the 
peace and quiet of the occupants of a dwelling house by 
disorderly conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These offences target the harmful and disturbing consequences of 
conduct on others who are lawfully entitled to peace or to 
unimpeded movement in public places.  A trespasser who goes so 
far as to interfere with the rights of others in these ways by 
causing a disturbance or by interfering with people's movements 
commits an offence and can be charged accordingly. For example, 
the teenager who loiters in a shopping mall would be committing 
an offence if his behaviour was disturbing others or preventing 
them from moving freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the teenager is sitting quietly despite being asked to leave 
repeatedly, he may very well be violating the mall owner's 
property rights in some way or committing a provincial offence 
and the mall owner will have options available under provincial 
law. However, the teenager should not be labelled a criminal if 
he is not disturbing or interfering with anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's proposal would criminalize the mere trespass 
without any requirement of proof of a negative impact on the 
person's free movement or right to undisturbed enjoyment of 
public places.  The criminal law should target the harmful 
consequences of action instead of criminalizing all action simply 
because they may have a negative impact under certain 
circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-207 is straightforward and what I would deem a common 
sense piece of legislation that would in essence crack down on 
those who repeatedly trespass on the private property or dwelling 
houses from which they have already been lawfully prohibited or 
removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned, the bill would amend section 41 of the Criminal 
Code to make it a summary conviction offence for a person who has 
been already lawfully removed or prevented from entering a 
dwelling house or real property within the previous 24 hours to 
trespass on that dwelling house or real property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such a provision in the Criminal Code, police and the 
courts would have an additional tool to protect individuals who 
can be terrorized.  As a former crown attorney I challenge any 
member in this House to stand here tonight and say this would not 
have a positive effect on keeping criminals away from their 
victims.  It would be an effective deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, Bill C-207 would give our justice system one more 
tool to create the ability to combat the serious problem of 
criminal harassment commonly known as stalking.  This is a crime 
whose victims, more often than not, are women.  Criminal 
harassment has been around for a long time but it has only been 
codified in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support Bill C-207 I feel that there must be more done 
specifically to address this problem created by stalkers. As on 
most issues of concern, the Conservative government actively 
pursued measures to crack down on stalking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1993 the hon. Pierre Blais, justice minister of the 
day, introduced legislation that created for the first time in 
the history of Canada in legal statute the offence of criminal 
harassment.  This bill quickly received passage in both the House 
of Commons and the Senate and received royal assent on August 1, 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the first of an important series of steps in providing 
victims of this horrendous crime with recourse within our 
criminal justice system.  Regrettably, the effectiveness of this 
legislation has since proven to be less than stellar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996 the Department of Justice issued a report which 
evaluated the new law's effectiveness in prosecuting harassment 
behaviour in the protection of victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report concluded that the offence of criminal harassment 
was not treated seriously enough by judges and lawyers.  Several 
indicators illustrate this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that the number of criminal harassment charges withdrawn 
or stayed by the crown as well as the number of charges withdrawn 
in exchange for peace bonds are extremely high when compared with 
charges related to other specific categories of crime.  This is 
something that happens quite often in the context of plea 
bargains; that is that a criminal harassment charge may be laid 
in conjunction with another charge, for example assault, and the 
criminal harassment charge is essentially dealt away.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This illustrates the point that sadly this type of criminal 
offence has not been as effective as it was originally intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department review reported that almost 60% of 
criminal harassment charges are withdrawn or stayed.  It is also 
disheartening to hear from the justice department's information 
that 75% of those convicted of criminal harassment receive either 
probation or suspended sentences.  The report concluded that the 
severity of the sentences imposed by the courts in cases of 
criminal harassment has not met the expectations in that 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may be asking why is this a problem. It is a 
problem because the previous criminal record, a record of 
violence against that same victim, or a record of breaching court 
orders, does not assure a stronger sanction from our criminal 
justice system, which is what this legislation in effect is 
intended to do.  It gives crown prosecutors, police officers and 
ultimately judges greater ability to impose sanctions in response 
to criminal activity.  Moreover, the great majority of accused 
criminals are released prior to their trial even though many of 
them had previous criminal records.  Many of them had records of 
previous breaches of courts orders and many of them had been 
violent to their partners in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the justice department's report from 
1996 seems to indicate that the strong anti-stalking legislation 
message has not been received by Criminal Code provisions and 
those who practice law in this country.  It has not adequately 
been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more than a codified definition of criminal harassment. 
Although I support Bill C-207 and its simple positive intent, we 
need legislation that extends much further, legislation that 
would clearly and unequivocally state that Canadian society does 
not accept this type of crime in any way, shape or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore use this opportunity to highlight a related piece of 
legislation, Bill S-17, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
respecting criminal harassment and other related matters.  Fellow 
Nova Scotian and Progressive Conservative Senator Donald Oliver 
introduced Bill S-17 in May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the House, particularly members of the Reform 
Party, have an unfortunate propensity for taking needless cheap 
shots at the upper house.  While the Senate is an institution no 
doubt in need of change and in need of comprehensive change to 
reflect Canadians entering into the 21st century, the majority of 
senators as individuals are making positive contributions in 
federal legislation.  We have witnessed such positive 
contributions, particularly laudable legislation such as Bill 
S-13 which was the subject of debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have Bill S-11 regarding amendments to Canadian Human 
Rights Act from Senator Erminie Cohen, sponsored in this Chamber 
by my caucus colleague from Shefford.  We also have another 
example in Senator Forrestall, another fellow Nova Scotian 
Conservative, who introduced several successful amendments to the 
Canada Marine Act this spring.  Senator Forrestall's hard work 
even drew applause from the hon. member for Sackville—Eastern 
Shore, whose New Democratic Party favours outright abolition of 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of using the Senate as a tired political prop, to which 
my colleague from Calgary West appears chronically addicted, let 
us work with senators to ensure that Canadians get the best 
legislation from this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that vein I hope that Bill S-17 presently before the Senate 
committee on legal and constitutional affairs will make it to the 
House.  If it does I look forward to obtaining the support of all 
hon. members and even the sponsor of this bill.  Regardless of 
political affiliation we should be worried about preserving the 
law in order to help pass good law into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to Bill C-207, on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party we speak in favour of it. It is consistent 
with our party's overall tradition of keeping Canada's streets 
safe through effective legislation.  I cannot say enough, 
however, that we need more co-operation on all sides of the House 
to ensure this type of effective legislation passes. 
Specifically, we need to do more to get tough on stalkers and 
protect innocent Canadians.  This bill goes a long way to 
accomplish that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to work together and ensure that bills such as 
Bill C-207 and Bill S-17 are passed there will be no confusion 
among Canadians as to what the purpose of parliament is, that 
Canada has a zero tolerance policy with respect to criminal 
harassment.  This is a laudable aim.  I urge all hon. members to 
support this legislation. Again I commend the hon. member who 
moved this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to summarize what we have 
heard today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly what I have heard from the justice department are some of 
the most arcane arguments that are not really relevant to the 
point I put before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main understandings we have to get with this motion 
is that it really supports community resolution of these 
conflicts without having to use a heavy handed approach.  In 
these situations it is contemplated that the warnings are given. 
Generally if there is some legal sanction that backs up the 
warning, then alternative dispute settlement actually happens and 
no one is actually charged in the end because someone would know 
that if they cross the line then they will be charged.  Therefore 
it positively supports community peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other aspects that is often overlooked is around the 
area of domestic disputes.  Restraining orders in themselves are 
not all that easy to obtain, especially from the supreme court or 
a provincial legislation such as non-interference with children 
orders.  So the availability in those circumstances is often 
difficult. Then there is the ongoing viability.  A policeman is 
called and some lady puts an order to the policeman saying she 
wants it enforced.  The policeman does not know if the order is 
still valid and what the essential jurisdiction of it is. The 
whole history of these extra court orders to deal with ongoing 
difficult situations of an identified individual showing up on a 
premises is very poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation would greatly help in that circumstance around 
child access problems and protecting the peace for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other circumstances is public school grounds. 
Individuals who may be known drug dealers or whatever may not be 
carrying drugs with them but will come to an elementary school 
ground, hang around wanting to become familiar with certain 
children.  We have had the circumstance of their trying to 
ingratiate themselves to individuals.  The long term agenda as we 
know from discovering the circumstances later is that they want 
to get these children involved in prostitution.  School 
authorities have had great difficulty protecting the sanctity of 
the public school grounds from these individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really upset when I hear this hand wringing, do nothing 
approach from the justice department.  It is just incredible. It 
fails to reflect the community mood about these obvious breaches 
of the public peace. The system appears absolutely incompetent to 
do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having someone lawfully removed in the first place is the 
trigger for this offence.  It is not entered into lightly. 
Someone would have to be removed for the circumstance involved in 
the second instance.  I believe this is in the public interest to 
preserve the peace.  It is not a draconian measure.  It is most 
reasonable and it does go a long way to preserve the peace and 
order of the community and especially to protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, for 
several weeks now the Prime Minister and the solicitor general 
have been avoiding answering questions about APEC, with the 
excuse that they could not say anything because the matter was 
under investigation by the RCMP public complaints commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has totally contradicted what he said 
previously in discussing APEC in a public place, on a plane. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has questioned the accuracy of the account 
taken by the member for Palliser on that plane, but he has never 
denied that he discussed APEC, nor has he ever stated exactly 
what he said in that conversation.  In fact, the Prime Minister 
has made reference to the accuracy of the account as it deals 
with Airbus. 
By trying to impress a friend and chattering on in a public place 
about very sensitive information entrusted to him in his position 
as the minister responsible for the RCMP, he has demonstrated he 
is unfit to sit in cabinet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, by his indiscretions he has become an object of ridicule 
by his colleagues, the media, voters and even his own 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was best summed up by an editorial in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> on October 8: “Stupidity isn't a crime, but it's no 
foundation for cabinet office either”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Hill Times</I> said: “This has damaged the solicitor 
general's career and has raised some serious questions about his 
competence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Halifax <I>Herald</I> said: “The member from Fredericton 
should not be solicitor general.  His offence was to say anything 
about a matter before a public tribunal for which he has 
ministerial responsibility.  This was as wrong as a judge 
casually talking about cases out of court”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fredericton was indiscreet by talking about 
confidential information in a public place.  It is immaterial 
what were his exact words used in that conversation.  It does not 
matter who heard the conversation.  The fact that he had this 
conversation at all shows that the member has compromised the 
office of the solicitor general.  He has put his own 
self-interests ahead of the interest of Canada and the APEC 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not changed my mind.  He should do the honourable thing 
and resign. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
ability to question any perceived wrongdoing makes up a 
fundamental component of our criminal justice system and indeed 
our human rights as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the RCMP act, members of the public can make complaints 
regarding the conduct of RCMP members to the public complaints 
commission which has the power to look into and make 
recommendations on the conduct of RCMP members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of reference of the APEC hearing show clearly how 
broad the scope of such an inquiry can be.  The APEC panel will 
hear all evidence and will report on “the events that took place 
during or in conjunction with demonstrations during the APEC 
conference in Vancouver”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the public complaints commission has stated that 
the panel will follow the evidence where it leads and that the 
scope of the investigation will be broad.  Any questions 
regarding RCMP operations prior to and during the APEC summit are 
squarely within the scope of the hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Tobique—Mactaquac has inferred that there 
was inappropriate political interference in the actions of the 
RCMP with regard to security at the APEC conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the solicitor general is the minister responsible for the 
RCMP it must be remembered that it is the commissioner of the 
RCMP who is solely responsible for criminal investigations 
undertaken by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the solicitor general has pointed in the House on many 
occasions, he does not get involved in operational matters of the 
RCMP.  With regard to the APEC conference he was kept informed by 
the commissioner in general terms about security for this major 
event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the APEC conference, as with other large and 
complex international meetings, it was appropriate and necessary 
that the RCMP consult with interested parties such as the 
Departments of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the 
Prime Minister's office in finalizing security arrangements. The 
RCMP, however, made the decisions regarding security in this 
event.
