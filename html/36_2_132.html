<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for raising this matter, 
as well as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Justice, the hon. member for Winnipeg South and the House Leader 
of the Official Opposition for their submissions on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot 
stated that the Department of Justice had wilfully misled members 
with respect to the views of the privacy commissioner concerning 
Bill C-206, an act to amend the Access to Information Act and to 
make amendments to other acts by circulating a document in which 
the commissioner was characterized as opposing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He claimed both that the privacy commissioner had indicated 
support for the bill and that, in any case, the commissioner had 
not made his views with respect to the bill known when the 
Department of Justice had prepared the document which it provided 
to members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, in his 
intervention, indicated that the government considered the 
comments in the document to be a fair and accurate assessment of 
the privacy commissioner's view. He cited a number of sources in 
support of this position, including a meeting with officials of 
the Office of the Privacy Commissioner as well as the privacy 
commissioner's annual report tabled in the House on May 16, 2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I examined with care the document submitted and I have reviewed 
all the arguments presented to me.  This is a matter which the 
Chair views with extreme seriousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Jerome, when dealing with a case related to the 
misleading of a member, quoted the procedural principle d issue 
which is clearly set out in Erskine May (<I>Journals</I>, November 
9, 1978, page 126): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a breach of privilege to present or cause to be presented 
to either House or to committees of either House, forged, 
falsified or fabricated documents with intent to deceive such 
House or committees— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, there is disagreement in the present case over the 
interpretation of the views of the privacy commissioner available 
to the government prior to the vote on Bill C-206.  However, it 
is not the Speaker's role to adjudicate concerning such matters 
of interpretation.  What I am required to rule on is a more 
narrow procedural issue: whether a wilful attempt has been made 
to mislead the House.  While members may disagree with the way in 
which others view a situation, at times disagree very strongly, 
that is a different matter than the serious charge that such an 
interpretation is knowingly and wilfully false.  Only on the 
strongest and clearest evidence can the House or the Speaker take 
steps to deal with cases of attempts to mislead members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present case, on the basis of the statements made in the 
House and of the documents presented for the Chair's 
consideration, I can find no support for a claim that the 
privileges of the House have been breached in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot for drawing this matter 
to the attention of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the hon. member for Louis-Hébert has two parts. 
The first part would make labelling a genetically modified food 
compulsory.  The motion also calls for the government to carry 
out exhaustive studies on the long term effects of genetically 
modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that the protection of our food supply 
for the well-being of Canadians, animals and our environment is 
of the utmost importance to the government.  Canada's food supply 
involves many hardworking partners from producers, processors and 
distributors to consumers.  Throughout the system new food 
products, including those derived from biotechnology, are subject 
to stringent regulation, enforcement and inspection.  Canada has 
high standards for new food products of biotechnology and we are 
known world wide for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of labelling foods, our federal legislation 
calls for Health Canada to set the requirements for mandatory 
labelling.  Each new food product, whether produced through 
biotechnology or some other process, must go through a rigorous 
pre-market safety evaluation before it can be introduced on to 
the marketplace.  The data requirements for the safety 
assessments are established by Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, on the other hand, is 
responsible for all aspects of the federal food legislation 
relating to non-safety matters, such as the control of fraud in 
food labelling.  The agency carries out inspection and 
enforcement activities relative to food safety standards set by 
Health Canada.  The CFIA also has responsibility for the 
environmental safety assessment of a number of agricultural 
products, such as plants, animal feeds and veterinarian vaccines, 
including those derived through biotechnology.  In carrying out 
these responsibilities, the CFIA protects consumers from food 
safety hazards or product misrepresentation, as well, it protects 
the safety of animals and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear that current labelling regulations in Canada 
require that all food products, including those developed through 
biotechnology, be labelled if a potential human health or safety 
issue has been identified or if foods have been changed in 
composition or nutrition.  Labelling decisions are made by Health 
Canada and are based on the results of their food safety 
evaluations.  These decisions are science based.  In fact, the 
best available science is used to make these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the first part of the motion before us by 
reminding the House that several initiatives are already now in 
place to study the question of how and when to label a 
genetically modified food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that all food labelling must be 
truthful, meaningful and enforceable.  We have strongly 
encouraged the establishment of a Canadian standard for the 
labelling of foods derived through biotechnology.  This standard 
will include provisions for clear definitions, acceptable label 
statements and claims in advertising, as well as compliance and 
verification measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian General Standards Board, under the sponsorship of 
the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors, is in the process 
of developing this standard through open and inclusive 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives and individuals from a broad range of Canadian 
interests have formed a committee to work on this standard.  They 
have been working hard over the past year and are putting 
together a definitive draft standard which is expected to be 
completed over the next number of months.  By endorsing a 
consensus based process to develop a labelling standard, Canada 
is indeed a leader world wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently the U.S. food and drug administration announced 
its attention to facilitate a voluntary labelling approach, a 
development process that will start this fall.  In addition to 
such initiatives, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food began its hearings on the labelling of genetically 
modified food this spring.  It has already heard from Health 
Canada, the CFIA and consumer groups.  Canada is leading the 
development of international standards governing how and when 
genetically modified foods are labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member is aware, Canada chairs a Codex Alimentarius 
committee on food labelling, otherwise known as the CCFL.  At the 
May 2000 Codex meeting in Ottawa, Canada was recognized for its 
success in chairing the CCFL working groups that drafted key 
options and recommendations for the labelling of biotechnology 
derived foods.  Again this year Canada has been asked to lead a 
working group to turn these May 2000 options into a Codex 
guideline that can be then implemented.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Informed consumers making informed choices is paramount.  These 
initiatives represent a significant and dedicated effort by 
Canadians for Canadians as we seek the best way to make truthful, 
meaningful information available to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that the House should not support Motion No. 230 on 
the basis of the first part of the motion on labelling and turn 
to consideration of the second part of the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part recommends that exhaustive studies be carried 
out on the long term effects of genetically modified foods on 
health and the environment.  The safety assessment of 
conventional products and products derived through biotechnology 
are both subject to stringent health and safety requirements 
under Canada's food safety system.  The Government of Canada is 
diligent when it comes to food safety and the protection of 
Canadians, animals and the environment.  Our regulatory process 
is fundamental to Canada's strong reputation as a producer of 
foods that are consistently safe, nutritious and of high quality. 
Canada built its international reputation by putting very 
rigorous regulatory systems in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approval systems are science based and transparent.  The 
government's decision to accept or reject a product is based on 
sound science and factual information.  Federal regulatory 
scientists have experience in a wide range of areas, including 
nutrition, molecular biology, chemistry, toxicology and 
environmental science to name just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian regulators set the comprehensive data requirements for 
the environmental safety of new agricultural products derived 
through biotechnology.  These scientists demand that the quality 
of this data be of the highest calibre and that the research 
directly assess and address the potential risks of the product to 
human health and the environment.  If there is any question as to 
the safety of these products, they are not approved.  The 
government continually reviews the effectiveness of its approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada takes pride in advocating its science 
based approach around the world.  It relies on the need for 
scientific research to settle questions related to long term 
health, safety and environmental issues.  The government is 
committed to a regulatory system that meets the highest standards 
of scientific rigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commitment is reflected in the establishment of two 
important groups, an expert panel and an advisory committee.  The 
Royal Society of Canada has appointed an independent expert panel 
to examine future scientific developments in food biotechnology 
and to provide advice to the federal government accordingly. This 
proactive, forward thinking body would advise Health Canada, the 
CFIA and Environment Canada on the science capacity the federal 
government will need to maintain the safety of new foods being 
derived through biotechnology in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal society named its expert panel this past February. 
From examining the leading edge of this technology, the panel 
will recommend what new research, policies and regulatory 
capacity will be needed to ensure that Canada's standards of 
safety remain stringent for the next generation of biotechnology 
derived foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of challenges and opportunities associated with 
biotechnology require detailed consideration and public 
discussion.  Food biotechnology presents Canadians with 
challenges but also great and unprecedented opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee, or CBAC, will 
bring stakeholders and interested parties together to advise the 
government, to raise public awareness and to engage Canadians in 
an open and transparent dialogue on biotechnology issues. 
Canadians want to take part in the dialogue on food 
biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBAC will create opportunities for Canadians to participate 
in its activities and discussions.  This includes an interactive 
website for interested Canadians to review, consult and provide 
input into this topic among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the royal society's expert panel will contribute to 
this balanced and consultative process where all questions and 
concerns can be thoroughly considered.  The government looks 
forward to the contributions the expert panel and the CBAC will 
make to furthering the dialogue on biotechnology issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member for Louis-Hébert that the government 
will continue to undertake the steps necessary to ensure the 
health of Canadians, animals and our environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 federal budget confirms this priority in Canada's 
regulatory system.  The $90 million investment in the regulatory 
system for biotechnology products will allow Health Canada, 
through the CFIA and other regulatory departments, to continue to 
enhance and evolve their regulatory approach of safety first to 
keep pace with the next generation of scientific discoveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increased investment illustrates the Government of Canada's 
continued dedication to supporting the regulatory system for the 
benefit of all Canadians.  We can take pride in the steps the 
Government of Canada has taken.  We have initiatives under way to 
ensure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The House has already 
given the hon. member as much time as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
before I get into the meat of the motion itself I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Louis-Hébert for bringing forward a 
motion with respect to genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity for most of my time in the House to 
sit on the agricultural committee.  It has been a very enjoyable 
part of my business here.  I am sure the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert brings this motion forward because she honestly 
believes in her heart that this is the most important issue now 
facing Canadians, particularly in agriculture.  The hon. member 
is very knowledgeable.  She speaks very eloquently to the motion 
put before us today with respect to mandatory labelling and 
making sure that when foods are put forward to the Canadian 
public they are safe and edible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency of Brandon—Souris agriculture is a very 
important facet of the economy.  The economy of my area is 
basically agriculture.  As we know, agriculture has not had too 
many bright spots recently.  We have had a major problem with 
competition from the Europeans and Americans, particularly in 
terms of unfair subsidization.  We have had some disasters in my 
area and suffered subsequent losses in production.  There has 
been a cloud over agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one bright spot, it could and should be 
biotechnology and genetically modified organisms.  There is a 
real opportunity here in agriculture to diversify.  There is a 
real opportunity to make sure that agriculture increases its 
production in the next numbers of years through biotechnology and 
genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject of GMOs makes most people nervous.  It makes most 
consumers nervous.  Although much of the focus in the media has 
been on food products derived from biotechnology, pharmaceuticals 
and health and pest control products on the market are also 
derived from biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to food products, biotechnology has the potential 
to increase the competitiveness of the Canadian agrifood industry 
by increasing individual competitiveness and exporting high value 
agrifood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology has the potential to increase the yields needed to 
compensate for the increase in world population.  It offers the 
opportunity and the potential to develop more sustainable 
agricultural practices by reducing the need for chemical weed and 
pest control.  This in itself is a major potential opportunity in 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology has the potential to enable the environmentally 
beneficial practice of no-till agriculture.  This would reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions.  Biotechnology also has the potential 
to create markets by introducing value added products, the 
diversification that agriculture so desperately needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the potential for value to be passed on from the 
producer to the consumer.  This can and is being done, and we can 
prove it.  It is possible to immunize the population by placing 
in foods medications to lower cholesterol, for example.  These 
are known as neutraceuticals or output traits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it was reported recently that scientists in the 
United States have created a strain of genetically altered rice 
to combat vitamin A deficiency, the world's leading cause of 
blindness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges we must face in creating a solid and dynamic 
biotechnology industry are two-fold.  First, we must create a 
climate in which industry sectors can flourish both here and 
internationally.  Second, we must meet the public's concerns 
about their own health and the environment in terms of the safety 
of genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified foods have helped the Canadian agricultural 
industry become competitive in the global economy.  They have 
helped farmers make better use of their land and provide more 
food for a world that needs food.  However, it is absolutely 
mandatory that the government take every step possible to address 
the definition of genetically modified foods and to protect 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal concern with the use of biotechnology in food 
products is the question of food security.  Numerous reports, 
mostly from Europe, have negatively impacted consumer confidence 
in Canada as a result of claims made about food safety.  There 
are concerns that there is not enough risk assessment work being 
done on consumer products delivered from biotechnology in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers have clearly indicated that they want to be informed, 
through labelling, about foods that have been altered, and favour 
such foods that provide tangible benefits.  An Angus Reid survey 
found that two-thirds of Canadians say that they would be less 
likely to buy food they know has been genetically modified. I 
would argue that the simple part is the change of label.  A far 
more extensive process is needed to determine the GM status of 
foods and to monitor their continuing status.  In any event, 
developing national guidelines on labelling must be done in 
conjunction with the development of standards at the 
international level, for instance through the Codex commission, 
the international standards setting body for foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to agriculture and agrifood, the Canadian food 
inspection agency conducts safety and environmental assessments 
of fertilizers, seeds, plants, plant products, animals, vaccines 
animal disease kits and feeds.  It also enforces portions of the 
Food and Drugs Act.  Health Canada is responsible for assessing 
the safety of novel foods that may include biotechnology 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before a genetically modified crop is approved for production it 
must pass through a series of rigorous tests designed to protect 
the health of humans, animals and the environment.  When biotech 
companies wish to market a certain genetically modified organism, 
they must provide all information required to carry out an 
environmental safety assessment.  Without providing the necessary 
information, approval will not be granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, there is still much work to be done in terms of 
long term studies on health and environmental considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes Canada's 
biotechnology industry and genetically enhanced foods have for 
the most part benefited our agriculture and agrifood sectors and 
Canada as a whole.  Biotechnology offers major opportunities to 
improve both environmental integrity and food quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as technology advances quickly, there are also concerns 
that biotechnology will put the safety of Canada's food at risk. 
That is why our biotechnology regulatory system must be based on 
science.  The federal government must still actively play a role 
in clarifying and explaining future Canadian policy on labelling 
in consultation with all stakeholders in order to help alleviate 
any concerns Canadians have with respect to GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must be more forthcoming in explaining 
the regulatory system to Canadians.  The federal government must 
ensure that there are sufficient resources and expertise within 
both Health Canada and the Canadian food inspection agency so 
that Canadians retain a high level of trust in the regulatory 
process for GM products.  The whole country is looking to the 
government for leadership on this issue.  It is an issue that 
must be addressed.  The Department of Health must provide the 
regulatory system to control this whole subject.  Labelling is 
part of that, but it is not enough.  It does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The onus is on the government to deal with this situation.  I 
applaud the hon. member for bringing forward this motion 
requiring labelling, but it is not enough.  It does not address 
some of the main issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food has not yet 
completed its analysis of this issue, and this motion would 
unnecessarily pre-empt the work of the committee.  Exhaustive 
studies on the long term effects cannot be defined.  It would be 
very difficult to do exhaustive studies on the long term effects 
without stopping the process now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Progressive Conservative Party unfortunately will 
not be supporting the motion although I do have the utmost 
respect for the member for Louis-Hébert.  Unfortunately it is 
not the best way to assure Canadians that the genetically 
modified organism debate is ongoing.  It is necessary that 
government be more forthcoming with Canadians.  It is necessary 
that Canadians be educated on the benefits of genetically 
modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In grocery stores right now, a number of the products on the 
shelves do have components of genetically modified organisms and 
have for years and years.  We see a great deal of opportunity in 
biotechnology and GMO.  We do not believe that a mandatory 
labelling system right now should be done without the 
international concurrence of other trading partners of ours.  For 
that matter, consumers, to be better educated, must have input as 
to what is going to happen with respect to GMO.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Motion No. 230 presented by the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert which asks the government to make the 
labelling of genetically modified foods compulsory and to carry 
out exhaustive studies on the long term effects of these foods 
on health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of progress has been made since the month of May. A 
similar motion was presented by an NDP member and, less than a 
week ago, the member for Davenport introduced Bill C-500, which 
also seeks to make the labelling of genetically modified foods 
compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Louis-Hébert 
for her determination. All the members of this House are now 
aware of this issue and some are even following her example by 
proposing similar measures. This is all to the credit of my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of GMOs involves many aspects, particularly as regards 
health. But today, I want to emphasize the environmental 
aspects. The environment must be a central concern, if only 
because it is related to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all began in 1996 with the Convention on Biodiversity, which 
sought to deal with the issues relating to ecosystems and 
species by providing a framework of principles on which 
signatory states agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 19 indicates that the signatories must be encouraged to 
put into place tools which will regularize, manage or control 
the risks related to the use or presence of living modified 
organisms resulting from biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Rio conference, and within the framework of meetings 
of the parties to the Convention on Biodiversity, negotiations 
for the creation of a protocol on biosecurity were soon to 
follow, with a view to providing a more solid and detailed 
framework as far as prevention of biotechnological risks are 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meetings between countries on biodiversity that have taken 
place since Rio are: Nassau, in November and December 1994; 
Jakarta, in 1995; Buenos Aires, in 1996; Bratislava, in 1998: 
and Nairobi, in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Jakarta meeting, the parties to the convention decided to 
put into place a special group charged with preparing a protocol 
specifically on biosecurity, an issue related to the transfer 
and handling of genetically modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, at a multilateral meeting in Cartagena, negotiations 
focused on a project aimed at creating a risk evaluation 
procedure for GMOs and rules for their labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most regrettably, Canada unfortunately blocked ratification of 
this protocol, joining forces with the five country Miami group 
led by the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the European countries, they felt that the principle of 
precaution ought to take precedence, believing that in the 
absence of scientific certainty on the hazards of GMOs it was 
necessary to take all of the steps needed to avoid harmful 
effects on human health.  A responsible attitude, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Canada opposed this example of responsible 
management of a product with potential danger to human health. 
Clearly Canada has always defended commercial interests. 
Moreover, this was pointed out by the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development in his last report in 
May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a new study that was released last July 
which tends to confirm that the pollen from genetically 
modified corn is fatal to the larvae of certain butterfly.  This 
adds fuel to the GMO controversy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of countries manage GMOs rationally.  They make 
labelling of food containing such products mandatory.  In truth, 
they make the precautionary principle a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical to note that this week the Minister of 
Health favourably received the recommendation of the Standing 
Committee on the Environment that the precautionary principle be 
applied in the registration of pesticides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture could care less about the 
precautionary principle in the case of the GMOs.  When will this 
government be consistent in its positions?  I do not suppose 
it will happen overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GMOs can have considerable impact on the environment through the 
transmission of genes in nature, in other words,  the gene flow. 
This is no theoretical eventuality but a certainty which has 
been shown in many countries, including in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is distressing to see certain multinationals, certain 
Canadian companies, testing genetically modified crops in the 
open.  The government must be aware that this approach releases 
into nature the characteristic of resistance to herbicides of 
certain GMOs, which could find their way into natural species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore not rare, and we learned this fact in a report 
by Radio-Canada on the weekend in which huge fields in Africa had 
become sterile because of genetically modified seed. 
Given that the development strategy of many African nations 
relies heavily on the export of raw materials, particularly 
agricultural ones, it is clear that the issue of genetically 
modified organisms is of great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that urgent action is required and that the 
federal government should make labelling of genetically modified 
foods compulsory.  With all these problems, it is easy to 
understand the public's fears.  People want to know what they 
are eating.  We know that at the present time between 30% and 
50% of canola plants in Canada are GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to upset members of the public by telling them 
to stop eating products containing canola or to stop eating 
altogether.  That is not my purpose today.  Given the risks 
associated with GMOs, I think the government has a moral 
obligation insofar as it is required to ensure public safety. 
How can the government allow the public to go on being afraid 
that what they are eating is a time bomb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the issue of pesticides, caution must prevail and I urge 
the member for Davenport to wake up and get this across to his 
Liberal colleagues.  The member for Davenport, who tells all and 
sundry that protection of the environment is his priority, must 
support the motion by the member for Louis-Hébert.  When we vote, 
I want him to know that I will be watching him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers, people just like us, all those listening today, must 
know exactly what they are eating.  That is why all 
parliamentarians in the House should support the motion by the 
member for Louis-Hébert and get it passed today so that we can 
resume consideration of it after the election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here today to 
speak to Motion No. 230 with regard to genetically modified 
organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that my speech will be relatively 
short.  I found the solution to long speeches in this place when 
I had a farm accident and broke my leg.  As a result I cannot 
stand for long periods, so I will make my speech relatively 
short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the Bloc Quebecois talk about 
genetically modified organisms.  What I hear throughout their 
speeches is in essence fear-mongering to the Canadian public that 
there may in fact be something wrong, that there is a time bomb 
on our plates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of discussion appeals more to the emotions of 
Canadians and not to the scientific evidence that is in place. 
When it comes to issues of food and food safety in Canada, we 
have to rely on science, not on emotion.  The scientific facts 
are that Canada's food supply is safe and that it is going to 
continue to be safe because we have a bureaucracy in this country 
that is reflective of Canada's desire for a safe food supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members absolutely that in the agriculture standing 
committee I have asked every witness who came forward this 
question “Are you aware of anyone who has ever become sick or 
ill from eating genetically modified products or who in any way 
felt that food they ate that contained genetically modified 
products made them sick in any way?”  Every one of them said 
that not in any place in this whole world has there been a case 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the science is not 100%, and there is always risk in 
everything, I think the scientific evidence to date is very 
clearly on the side that shows foods produced from plants that 
have had a genetic modification for disease resistance or pest 
resistance are in fact safe.  Until there is some kind of 
evidence or until something shows up that would actually indicate 
a threat of any kind to human health, or an unacceptable risk 
even, I will even go that far.  There is no unacceptable risk 
at this time.  I do not believe that our scientific community or 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency would ever let that happen, 
because nothing gets onto our plates that has not been fully 
checked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance strongly believes that consumers must be 
given a choice in the products they purchase.  A consumer driven, 
voluntary labelling system for GMOs should be put in place 
immediately, which would market GMO-free products in a way 
similar to organic foods.  No one is saying that we should not 
have labelling if the wholesalers, retailers and consumers want 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government on the other side, the Liberal government, has 
been very slow in bringing about the necessary studies and 
research to indicate what should be on a label if in fact a food 
distributor wanted to put something there.  We are not against 
labelling but we are against labelling that is mandatory, that 
would be put in place right now like the Bloc would have it, 
without any knowledge about what in fact should go on the label. 
In effect it would be like trying to tell people that we do not 
have any real scientific evidence but they should be afraid of 
something that has GMO on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly Canada's position right now not to support mandatory 
labelling is the right one, because there is no consensus as to 
what should even be on the label.  If food distributors start 
putting big scientific explanations on labels, I guarantee that 
the very consumers the Bloc is talking about will not understand 
it and will not be any better informed than if there is nothing 
on there and they rely on the food inspection agency, which 
guarantees that the food is safe, that it will not harm them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned that regulatory decisions involving Canada's 
food supply must be based upon clearer scientific information. 
There is no alternative to that.  Emotion cannot be the deciding 
factor, or provinces or countries which for economic reasons 
might want to use the big GMO scare as a non-tariff trade barrier 
or protect some other social or economic issue they feel is 
pertinent to their region.  I am thinking either of Canada or, in 
the case of our trading partners, the whole world, the best 
example being European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clear fact that the European countries, the very ones 
the Bloc is saying are in favour of mandatory labelling, are 
proceeding with scientific research and development of GMO 
products.  If we do not continue with our scientific endeavours, 
the economic future of the new technology and new industries that 
will be important in years to come will be located in Europe, not 
in Canada or North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also hear the scare about big companies, those ferocious 
companies that will ruin the world.  That is a very socialistic 
kind of concept.  Big corporations provide us with a lot of our 
jobs and have the wherewithal to make scientific advancements 
like we see happening in space and in biotechnology.  These 
things would not happen without the corporate structure to drive 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen countries like the Soviet Union that have tried to 
do it through regulatory processes.  That does not work. In a 
market driven economy consumers will tell retailers. Retailers 
who want to make a profit will respond by saying that it seems 
folks want mandatory labelling showing that the corn, for 
example, has been genetically modified. Therefore they agree, the 
food is safe, and wholesalers respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that is all well and good, those three levels must 
understand that there is a cost to everything.  That cost cannot 
be passed on to grain companies that pass it along to farmers. 
Our farmers cannot afford the cost of segregating grain and 
delivering it through to elevators and railways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not hear the Bloc Quebecois saying anything about how 
mandatory labelling would be paid for.  I guarantee that by hook 
or by crook it will not be western Canadian farmers who produce 
canola and whom the Bloc has identified as culprits in the GMO 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have laid out the position of the Canadian Alliance.  We want 
consumers to choose and for the government of the day, which 
after November 27 will be the Canadian Alliance, to put in place 
a very clear voluntary labelling system so that retailers know 
what kind of informative label to put on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect to be back here in January 2001.  I do not expect to be 
sitting on this side of the House.  I expect to be on that side 
of the House.  I do not expect to see the member for 
Brandon—Souris here either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in very general terms that the NDP caucus and party have 
looked closely at the whole issue of GM products and foods.  We 
believe we have to take both a balanced and a cautious approach. 
I will go into a bit more detail on that in a few minutes. 
However from the outset I state that we support compulsory 
labelling for GM food products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing more personal, more intimate or more 
significant than the food each one of us puts into his or her 
mouth.  We must have knowledge of what is actually on our plates 
and going into our bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when most people in the world grew their own 
food or hunted it and prepared it themselves.  In those cases 
they would have known exactly what the food contained.  Society 
is now much more complex and compartmentalized.  We are not able 
to do that so we have to rely on information provided to us.  In 
this complex society we have to rely on government to protect us 
by regulation.  That is what we are talking about and that is one 
of the strong arguments for compulsory labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through this many years ago with a whole range of other 
products when the consumer movement, if I may call it that, was 
born.  We have been through a cycle of this sort.  It seems now 
in certain ways that there is some regression setting in, in the 
way voluntary labelling is being described.  With respect I want 
to tell government members that their support of voluntary 
labelling is simply not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a little digression, the hon. member of the Canadian Alliance 
said a few minutes ago that consumers would tell us what they 
want.  They have already told us in this case.  Various polls 
indicate that more than 90% of Canadian consumers want compulsory 
labelling.  I say to that member of the Canadian Alliance, if we 
are to follow consumers as he says we should, that is where we 
would be following them and not down the trail he has described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers have caught on to all of this, as the polls indicate. 
They have especially done so in Europe.  The member of the 
Canadian Alliance went on to say that this is some sort of scheme 
and a non-trade barrier.  He said that somehow or other we have 
the right not only to put whatever food products we want into 
Europe and anywhere else in the world, but in a sense to 
force-feed people, to put food into people's mouths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the beginning of my speech, there is nothing more 
sacred than people's right to know and to choose what they will 
put into their bodies.  There might be some non-tariff thinking 
going on in the European Union.  I am not saying there is not.  I 
am simply saying it is not good enough for us to say we have the 
right to blast our way into that market, on to the plates and 
into the mouths of millions of consumers wherever they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put the question of GM food, if I may, into some context. 
The NDP caucus and party have described this in some detail.  We 
know that biotechnology as applied to food production is poised 
to expand significantly in the next millennium.  We also 
recognize that agricultural biotechnology contains both the 
promise of increasing production and adding value to agriculture. 
It also poses potential risks to production patterns, food 
safety and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken a look at the issue.  We believe we have to put 
safety first when we determine through science based decision 
making what we will do about GM products and GM foods. We believe 
that so far we have not had adequate public discussion of the 
issue.  There should be a full scale, national public discussion 
on genetically modified food, which should include mechanisms for 
meaningful public input and feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, we also want a labelling process that will 
make consumers aware of genetically modified produce and 
components in processed foods.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. When

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member is

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the startling thing in the budget yesterday was the $100 
billion tax cut.  It sounded like a budget of the Canadian 
Alliance in putting that much money into tax cuts, in particular 
because the tax cuts are greater for wealthy people, for 
millionaires, for people with all kinds of cash and for people 
who make all kinds of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government had choices.  It made a choice to 
reward its wealthy friends.  It made a choice for big corporate 
tax cuts.  It made a choice to help those who have the most money 
in Canada rather than put money into health care, education and 
the environment.  That is how I see last night's mini-budget. I 
would like to know whether the member for Halifax West sees it in 
a similar vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, sometimes when 
mini-budgets or economic statements are being debated they seem a 
bit abstract.  They may seem as though they are about big figures 
which are hard for people to identify with. Let me tell the House 
what choices of the government are reflected in the budget 
statement.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a single mom living on an income of $15,000, the tax cuts 
announced by the government will amount to $350 a year, probably 
enough to pay for a prescription drug for a couple of months 
because the government has not put in place the promised 
pharmacare program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the bank president or the big corporate director on an 
income of $750,000 with stock options of say $23 million, the 
choice that the government has made represents a tax saving of 
literally millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for people to realize that a budget is about 
choices and those are the choices that the government has made. 
The Liberals went to the electorate and told them they would do 
something about child poverty.  What they have done is pump up 
the incomes of the wealthiest Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government went to the public and said it would 
introduce a universal child care program, it would do something 
about home care and would do something about pharmacare.  Not one 
cent in the mini-budget introduced yesterday advances those 
commitments.  What have they done instead?  The Liberals have 
said that tax cuts a la reform alliance are the only thing that 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did a tax cut ensure safe drinking water for working 
families?  When did a tax cut repair an education system that is 
tattered because of the federal downsizing and downloading of 
financial responsibilities?  When did a tax cut hire nurses who 
are desperately needed throughout the health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can see the choices.  Canadians can see that this is a 
government absolutely firmly in the clutches of the corporate 
elite who last night slurped champagne and pigged out on caviar, 
not in celebration of the leader of the reform alliance, but 
because it considers itself to have won the battle to ensure that 
the finance minister and the federal Liberal government are 
squarely in the clutches and in the corner of the corporate elite 
of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, naturally when an MP reads or hears 
a budget, their attention is drawn to how it affects their own 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the member of the New Democratic Party has said, 
one of the things which really disturbed me, representing a 
province where the number one industry is falling and falling 
very quickly, representing a province that has lost 6,200 of its 
main producers in the last year, September to September, 
representing a province that will lose that many more and the 
rural area of the last best west is becoming desolate, not one 
word was mentioned in this budget to support an industry that 
stretches across the entire western Canadian area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the government has only paid out 42% of the 
total amount of money allocated by the government to assist in a 
small way to keep some bread and butter on the table of these 
people. As a parliamentary measure, I understand that we may be 
seeing AIDA come to Saskatchewan and maybe we can get a few more 
cheques out. In a briefing with a radio station last night, I 
said that would not buy one vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am pleased to see tax cuts and I am pleased to see that 
the government has listened to us with regard to tax reduction. 
All one needs to do is take a look at my province with the worst 
health system in Canada, the worst road system in Canada, 
absolutely the poorest drug plan in Canada and part of that, not 
all, is the fault of the NDP. It could be fixed by their 
potentially new leader.

That is the problem with NDP philosophy.  The problem with NDP 
philosophy is part of the problem why Saskatchewan has no 
highways, no health care under an NDP government and the absolute 
poorest rating in Canada.  For them to talk about this budget is 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last comment, the western grain industry will never forget 
the government for the lack of attention that it has paid to it. 
The government will reap the results come November 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, that was a rant 
rather than a question.  I will try not to respond in kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the member for Souris—Moose Mountain a diatribe 
about how much his party cares about what the farmers of 
Saskatchewan and the prairies are facing.  Yet, this is the party 
that has blood on its hands when it comes to the federal 
Liberals' reasons for decimating support for agricultural 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you go back over the seven years of this reform alliance, 
you can see the reason why the mini-budget introduced yesterday 
was so pathetic.  It was absolutely silent on the question of 
agriculture support because the reform alliance has egged them on 
and egged them on to do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see in yesterday's mini-budget?  What was the 
commitment to farm families facing bankruptcy, to farm 
communities that are having a desperate time surviving?  What the 
federal Liberals said is we will monitor what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means is that they will be prepared to report to 
Canadians on how many bankruptcies have been caused by the 
Liberal government endorsing the reform alliance demands to 
shrink agricultural support programs to the point where they do 
not do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What monitoring will mean is that they will tell Canadians, and 
I am not sure if they are telling the truth, but if they 
accurately monitor what they will be able to report to Canadians 
is the out-migration effect of their policies.  Make no mistake 
about it, this is a rural depopulation policy that is being 
pushed and promoted by the reform alliance and embraced wholesale 
by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As devastating as the budget introduced yesterday is for working 
families across the country, for farm families, for rural 
communities, for ordinary working people that are having to work 
harder and longer for less and less while their public services 
shrivel up, one thing is darn sure.  It is that people can see 
how critically important it is for the New Democratic Party to be 
here with increased strength and greater numbers in the next 
Parliament of Canada to push back against not only the reform 
alliance, but the increasing dominance of the right wingers in 
the federal Liberal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time in this debate with the member for 
Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally a budget sets forth the goals of a society and the 
economic measures that are necessary to achieve them.  To use a 
phrase which the Prime Minister's pollsters have told him to 
adopt, it is about values not just taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's statement does reflect the government's values.  It 
offers no help to the poorest of our taxpayers.  It shortchanges 
our health system by billions of dollars.  It offers only token 
assistance to students who are driven away from the education 
they need by its high costs.  The cynical symbol of this 
statement is its promise to help with winter heating costs. 
Help for how long?  For one winter, an election winter.  This 
statement is about elections, not about economics.  Even the tax 
cuts are driven by polling.  Tragically, typically, the statement 
sets no goals for Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we are drifting behind a world we should lead, 
there is nothing here that will make Canada a leader again.  The 
government has been in office for seven years.  During this time 
extraordinary growth in the United States economy has propelled 
Canada forward.  The singular Canadian initiative which had the 
greatest impact on our own growth was the negotiation of the free 
trade agreement which the Liberal Party opposed when it was 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a time when other countries were becoming more competitive, 
changing their tax systems, training their people to prevail in 
the new economy, the government let Canada fall steadily behind. 
Ireland, Germany and a growing list of other countries have tax 
systems which attract more investment and more innovation than 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries adapt much more quickly than we do to the new 
e-economy.  Canada is suffering a real and severe brain drain of 
the best, brightest people upon whom we have to build our future. 
Even in health care where Canada should lead the world, we are 
ranked 30th by a report of the World Health Organization. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot be called a budget. It is an election platform. It 
is political shortsightedness. The best proof of that is the 
promise to reduce the cost of heating for one winter only. It 
just so happens that it is the winter when an election is to be 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no help for agriculture, no money for infrastructures 
such as highways, and not much for students. In our modern 
society, young people need to get the best possible education. 
It is the key to their future. But education costs are 
prohibitive. 
This budget provides some relief to students who are currently 
enrolled, but it does nothing for all the graduates who have a 
huge debt to repay. We can do a lot more to help our young 
people prepare their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also ignores people who are in dire straits. The 
government could have changed the basic personal credit and have 
completely exempted low income Canadians from having to pay 
taxes. But it did not. We can do a lot more to help low income 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no long term commitment on debt reduction.  The $10 
billion debt reduction the government talks about is a one time 
payment.  It is an accident because the government revenue 
forecasts were wrong.  If the government was serious about debt 
reduction, it would have outlined a long term strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this economic strategy on agriculture, 
infrastructure, equalization or regional development.  There is 
very little help here for students.  Nothing to address the issue 
of high student debt.  Even doubling the education credit which 
students can claim will not help the average student today whose 
graduation present is on average a $25,000 debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of Canadian values, nothing was done to reduce the 
basic personal exemption.  It is appalling that someone earning 
just over $7,000 has to pay federal income tax.  A staged 
increase of the basic exemption to $12,000 would take two and a 
half million Canadians off the tax rolls entirely and provide an 
across the board cut of $800 to every taxpayer.  That is what 
should have been done in this statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government devastated the health care system and it crippled 
education with its unilateral cuts to transfer payments.  Finally 
last month it was forced by the provinces to restore transfers 
for health and social transfers to 1993 levels.  That full 
transfer will not occur until April of the year 2002.  This is 
not an honest restoration of funding.  It is at best a post-dated 
cheque.

because Canadians, particularly in the high tech sector, are 
increasingly being given stock purchase options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capital gains tax is a tax on savings accumulated once 
income tax has been paid.  Capital gains are in a way subject to 
double taxation, because the same income is taxed twice.

than the capital gains tax.

in line with that of the United States.  Yet what Canada needs 
is a better system than the American one.  Our economies are not

be done away with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the measures announced yesterday will take effect 
immediately.  Others may never see the light of day, because they 
require action by parliament and the Prime Minister is closing 
parliament down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was elected in 1997 with a 60 month term.  It is 
now in its 40th month with a long list of urgent public business 
awaiting action.  Instead of the government doing its job, the 
Prime Minister wants to call an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has taken election positions on economic 
issues before.  He opposed free trade and he broke his word.  He 
promised to kill the GST and he broke his word.  On the cold, 
hard record, this is not a government Canadians can trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is an election platform, not an economic plan. 
Its tax measures will be debated in the weeks to come.  The real 
message is that this is a short term, get through the day 
government.  It has no sense of purpose, no sense of compassion 
and certainly no plan to respect and assert Canadian values. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the right hon. member for 
Kings—Hants for a very compelling speech.  He has proven time 
and time again, since his return to the House of Commons, that he 
is a great Canadian who understands the difficulties and hardships 
faced by many in this country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal from the government in the past days 
and, of course, we have come to expect that most of the 
information that comes out in a budget has been leaked to the 
press prior to hearing from the Minister of Finance or any 
government official here in the House of Commons.  That lack of 
respect is something, sadly, that has come to be expected by 
members of the opposition and further marginalizes parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this budget is not about has become quite obvious.  What 
the budget is not about is helping farmers.  What the budget is 
not about is focusing in on the issue of student debt and the 
crisis that many students face when they emerge at a time in 
their lives when they should be filled with optimism, with hope 
and with some sense of purpose.  The first thing they have to 
face is the government knocking at their door, coming to collect 
on a student debt. This is the type of situation that leads our 
best, our brightest and our most ambitious young people to leave 
the country or to leave regions of the country where 
opportunities are not as great, as we see in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that this budget does not deal with, in fact it is 
a shell game, a facade, is the issue of a rebate on the cost of 
heating oil.  What it does is it raises expectations.  It is so 
pathetic it is like holding a little chocolate bar out to a child 
and then pulling it back.  The indication is that people will be 
given a small rebate on the cost of heating oil.  Yet that 
cheque, if it ever does arrive, will not get to these needy 
people until January.  There are a lot of cold months between now 
and January.  I do not know what people in Ecum Secum or Canso 
will do if they need to fill their oil tanks or if they need 
gasoline to get into town so they can get such luxuries as food. 
What this government has chosen to do is to give money back. 
Of course there is this insidious little promise that perhaps 
they should vote for the government if they really want that 
cheque to arrive on time.  This is the crass type of 
electioneering we have seen engineered by the government in the 
lead-up to this campaign.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With some of those inadequacies which members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party and other members in the opposition have 
pointed out, my question to the right hon. member for 
Kings—Hants is, what should we be doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government in waiting, the Progressive Conservative 
Party, going to do for the poorest of the poor with respect to 
those who are still making as little as $10,000 annually?  What 
should we be doing in terms of changing our tax laws to address 
that situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, there are several 
things that can be done.  Let me list them quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should be changing the basic personal exemption. It is 
simply unacceptable in a country like ours that low income 
Canadians earning around $7,000 a year have to pay tax.  We 
propose to take them and others like them completely off the tax 
rolls in a staged process of raising the basic exemption to 
$12,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot just help the rich, as the Liberal Party always does. 
We need to have concern for low income Canadians who are trying 
to make their way and trying to improve their communities where 
they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the issue of agriculture.  I have just 
come back from western Canada, a region that has been doubly 
devastated.  It has been devastated by nature, but it has also 
been devastated by the absolute refusal of either the government 
or the party now in official opposition to take any serious 
interest in the plight of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a statistic last year from my native region showing that 
some 22,000 farmers have stopped farming in the last year and 
have moved off the land.  That is a 10% drop in the number of 
people taking part in one of the basic industries in western 
Canada.  That is a terrible thing to have happen. If it had 
happened in Ontario, the Liberal government would have responded 
very quickly, but it did not.  It happened in the west so it gets 
ignored.  However, it cuts into our capacity to be a competitive 
country, building upon the multiple strengths that agriculture 
can bring us if agriculture had the kind of support today that it 
had when a Progressive Conservative government was in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let me speak to the question of students.  There is a 
tiny little measure in this budget for students now in school. 
This budget does nothing at all to help students who are leaving 
school with a massive debt, a debt averaging $25,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government does in the name of Liberal values is say 
that education in Canada is for the rich, and if one is smart and 
able but not rich then one cannot get into our education system. 
That is not the kind of Canada we believe in.  That is not a 
value worthy of the name. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is very difficult, almost impossible, to follow my leader, the 
right hon. member for Kings—Hants, being the statesman that he 
obviously is and the passion with which he speaks to issues 
affecting this country and Canadians as a whole.  However, I will 
attempt, in my fashion, to speak to the economic statement that 
has been put forward by the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it must be said that if this were after the writ was 
dropped, the government would have to claim this as an election 
expense.  This in effect is an election platform, an election 
ploy that was placed before the House in the Chamber. It is no 
more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Canadians are becoming terribly cynical of politics and 
politicians.  Canadians see through the transparency and the 
cynical politics that were played in the House yesterday by the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned earlier, this financial statement will not be 
implemented before the writ is dropped by the Prime Minister to 
go to the next election, an election that is totally unnecessary. 
Should the finance minister and the Prime Minister wish, as they 
were meant to do, to govern the country, they can do so for 
another 20 months based on the economic largesse they have 
identified within this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to Canadians now to not go out and spend the money that 
has been promised.  Promises that have been placed before the 
House and Canadians have been broken time and time again.  This 
is a post-dated cheque, make no mistake about it.  It is like the 
post-dated cheque of “We will scrap the GST”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1040

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did you spend your money, Madam Speaker, when the GST was going 
to be taken off?  It did not materialize.  It is like the 
post-dated cheque when the Liberals said they would scrap the 
NAFTA agreement.  By the way, the best thing they did not do was 
to scrap NAFTA because today, as we stand with the surpluses that 
are before the House, it is because of those initiatives taken by 
a government prior to 1993.  This government today should be 
thankful that it has surpluses because of what we put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should spend that post-dated cheque because I remember 
the promise of pharmacare.  Does anyone remember that promise, 
that post-dated cheque?  It has not been cashed and in fact will 
not be cashed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the post-dated cheque given to Canadians with respect 
to child care and day care?  No one should cash that cheque 
because it was a promise that was again broken by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  What about the helicopters?  That 
cheque bounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  The helicopter deal, as my colleague 
from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has just indicated, there 
was a promise.  It was a post-dated cheque that unfortunately was 
implemented.  That cheque was not cashed but it bounced.  The 
problem with that particular cheque is that people's lives were 
put into the balance.  To this day we still do not have the 
proper equipment so that our servicemen can go out into the world 
and defend the peacekeeping requirements that we have as 
Canadians because this government does not accept the fact that 
our defence department requires those dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about this particular post-dated cheque.  The 
finance minister said, and I quote, on page 12 that these things 
will be achieved by “legislating—not promising”.  Canadians 
recognize that in order to put legislation forward, the House has 
to sit.  We now hear that the reason the Prime Minister and the 
government is going to drop the writ is that everybody else is 
campaigning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just had an opportunity to speak with a couple of Liberal 
members on a radio talk show.  Their spin to this was that 
everybody else is running for the election, so they might as well 
call one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been declaring this election campaign 
ever since he has been trying to entice Brian Tobin back into the 
cabinet.  That was successful, so he is now going to call the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the finance minister say that it would be 
legislated, which is not in fact correct, but he also has a 
caveat not only on debt repayment but on the tax reductions as 
well.  This depends wholly and solely upon what the economy is 
going to do over the next number of months and years. It is a 
positive caveat but, nonetheless, it gives him a real opportunity 
to backtrack on a lot of those post-dated cheques and promises 
that have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about this particular document itself, this economic 
statement.  It has listed a number of areas, the first one being 
health.  I want Canadians to recognize right now that there is 
nothing different with health today than there was yesterday. 
There are no new initiatives.  The initiative there has been 
announced ad nauseam.  It has been announced many times.  Even 
with the previous agreement that was negotiated with the 
provinces, we still do not come up to 1994-95 levels for health 
care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about health.  The Liberal government arbitrarily 
took out of the health care system billions and billions of 
dollars without consultation with the provinces.  Now, all of a 
sudden, it consults with the provinces to put back in the money 
it took out, which destroyed the system.  That money is not yet 
into the system.  That money will not be into the system for 
years to come.  No one should think that Canadians are going to 
have the opportunity to take advantage of these health care 
dollars in the very near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the environment.  The only new spending 
initiative in this statement was the environment.  I want to 
congratulate the Minister of the Environment for having the 
ability to influence the cabinet and the finance minister.  I say 
that somewhat tongue in cheek because there is a huge hole that 
was left in this economic statement, and that was respect to 
agriculture.  The environment minister had the initiative and the 
influence.  The minister of agriculture had none.  There is not 
one word in this document about agriculture.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agricultural industry right now is suffering through the 
worst crisis it has ever had to suffer through.  We have lost 
25,000 farmers in the last year.  What do we have from the 
Liberals?  They shrug and say “Well, that is the way it is.  We 
put our best foot forward to try to protect the industry”.  It 
is not enough.  This document speaks to the fact that agriculture 
has absolutely no priority for this government.  That has to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On debt reduction, the government suggested that $10 billion 
will come forward this year in debt reduction.  There was a $12.3 
billion reduction last year.  It took this government until last 
month, almost six months after the year end, to discover it had 
this wonderful surplus.  All of sudden, three or four days before 
an election, it has come to the good understanding that it now 
has a surplus it can put forward for debt reduction.  It is nice 
to see that the finance department can finally come up with 
numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders why it happens today.  Is it manipulative?  Is it 
manufactured?  Is it an election ploy?  Of course it is, and 
Canadians know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government has not done is to put into place a plan for 
debt reduction.  It holds out the carrot that in this budget year 
the government will reduce the debt, but nowhere in this 
statement does it speak to a well thought out, logical line item 
that is going to reduce the deficit for Canadians.  Liberals do 
not like to do that.  They like to take the money and use it to 
their best advantage.  Canadians believe the best advantage is to 
reduce the debt in a well thought out, systematic plan, and that 
is where we should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Not an election plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Not an election plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts?  Absolutely.  They are heading in the right direction. 
The Liberals took our plan.  What a great idea.  Reduce tax 
rates?  What a great idea.  Reduce the inclusion rate for capital 
gains?  Not to 50%, but to zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they are on the right track, and given the right 
opportunity we will accelerate that.  As a matter of fact, the 
finance minister said the reason this is so important today is so 
that the government can accelerate the cuts proposed in the 
February budget.  If the government was serious, why did it not 
put these cuts in the February budget in the first place?  The 
reason is that there was not an election call in March, but there 
is one this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more time because there is much more opportunity to 
make sure Canadians recognize that what this government is doing 
is wrong.  I am sure we will speak to it later. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I sat here and listened to the 
Progressive Conservative Party love-in over in the corner.  Not 
only did it rewrite economic history in Canada over the last 
decade or so, it rewrote the economic update and economic 
statement presented in the House yesterday by the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over a few points.  First, the Conservatives 
talk about there being nothing new on health care.  Is that not 
staggering that they can actually stand up and say that in this 
House when the Prime Minister negotiated and did a deal with the 
premiers and the territorial leaders just a couple of months ago 
for $23.5 billion more for health care?  That is largest single 
investment put into health care by any federal government.  If we 
add that to the $14 billion that was invested in health care in 
the last two budgets, that is a reinvestment of $37 billion. 
Those members know that is not even close to the cuts in the 
transfers to the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about how the Tories are responsible for all economic 
growth.  I will tell the House what the Tories are responsible 
for.  In 1993 they left this government saddled with a deficit of 
$42 billion.  In three years this government eliminated the 
deficit. Canadians understand that before we can pay any money on 
the debt we have to eliminate the deficit, which we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, there was a 5% surtax introduced by the Tories, 
which we have now completely eliminated as of yesterday.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite should reflect upon what they are saying 
because the facts do not support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the fuel taxes.  What they proposed was a 
reduction in the excise tax on fuel which absolutely would have 
gone straight to the oil producers in Canada.  It would not have 
gone to the consumers.  It would not have hit the pockets of 
Canadians.  Our tax measure will go straight to the pockets of 
low income Canadians to compensate them for increased heating 
costs and the increased cost of gasoline at the pumps.  Low 
income individuals will receive $125 per individual and double 
that for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Brandon—Souris if he would 
like a copy of the economic update that was presented in the 
House yesterday.  I would gladly provide him with one, because 
obviously he has not read it, and perhaps with an economic 
history of Canada in the last couple of decades.  He would be 
wise to read that.  Would he accept such a gift?  I would be glad 
to give it him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have probably read 
more of this particular document than the hon. member has because 
I certainly understand it a lot better than he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to respond to two issues, one of them being health care. 
I fail to understand how in 1993 this government could gut the 
health care system unilaterally without any consultation with the 
provinces at all, take those dollars out of the system so that 
the provinces are basically demanded to supply services with no 
support from this government, and then all of a sudden replace 
those dollars today, before an election, with the provinces' 
consultation.  Why could that not happen in both? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the provinces will agree now that there is something 
on the table when there has been nothing on the table before.  If 
that is the spin this government is going to do in an election it 
had better come up with a much better opportunity to debate why 
it destroyed health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the Liberals talked about was the $42 billion 
in 1993.  It is time that Canadians recognized and that this 
House be given the opportunity to know that the Trudeau years 
left $200 billion of debt.  That is where it started.  Of that 
$42 billion, $32 billion was debt servicing that was put forward 
by that government and not this government.  They can take that 
one to the election and let citizens make their decision as to 
who are the best managers of the economy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I was walking to the office this 
morning I passed by some newspaper boxes.  A headline caught my 
eye on the newspaper box of the <I>National Post</I>.  The 
headline said “Liberals Deliver Alliance Budget”.  That 
headline just cut to the quick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please.  The 
member who is addressing the House is next to me and I cannot 
hear him.  Please take your conversations to the lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I realize that the 
Alliance has come to the House to try to bring a better aura of 
decorum here, but the members really ought to give lessons to the 
Conservatives, who seem to have a little difficulty with that 
problem.  Thank you for your intervention, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, as I walked in to work a headline caught my eye 
in the newspaper box of the <I>National Post</I>.  The headline 
basically said “Liberals Deliver Alliance Budget”.  Of anything 
that any one of us feels about this budget, the one thing it is 
not is an Alliance budget.  The difference between what the party 
on the other side does in terms of economic philosophy and 
economic proposals and platforms and what we on this side do—and 
even the Conservatives, in all fairness—is that we do not 
represent the kind of economic policy of basic selfishness that 
is reflected in the Alliance's economic platforms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the flat tax.  What we see in almost all the 
themes of the Canadian Alliance is that it believes that the 
fundamental thing that drives Canadians is the desire to keep 
their own money at all costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes us different on this side, I would suggest—and I 
will compliment the Conservatives over there who are busy engaged 
in a conversation and not paying any attention—is that they, 
like us, believe that government is in the business of providing 
services to Canadians that Canadians cannot otherwise get.  The 
issue is not to reduce taxes to an absolute minimum so that all 
the people can selfishly get everything they have.  What it is 
really all about is to try to give opportunities to all Canadians 
by using taxpayers' funds in a responsible manner so that all 
Canadians share in equal opportunities in this great land of 
ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  It is the Canadian way, as my colleague 
says.  It is certainly the Liberal way, but it is not the 
Canadian Alliance way.  I am a little uncomfortable with them 
having the term “Canadian” because it really is not very 
consistent in these politics of economic selfishness.  I really 
do not believe in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually had an example just recently in Ontario with the 
Walkerton crisis with respect to the water.  There is an inquiry 
going on right now.  This is a classic case in which a provincial 
government withdrew from providing services, in this case the 
guarantee that water quality would be first class.  What we have, 
because it essentially privatized and downloaded the 
responsibility of the provincial government to ensure pure water, 
is that people actually died in that event there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect of this budget is that the Canadian Alliance is 
very fond of saying it reflects the grassroots and the Liberals 
somehow pull economic policy out of some vacuum that looks only 
toward gaining votes in the next election.  I can say that in 
this economic statement, which is not a budget but an extension 
of the February budget of this current year, what one will see 
are features that reflect the efforts of backbench MPs on this 
side of the House who have listened to their constituents and 
have lobbied and pressured the finance minister.  He has 
listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to be a little careful because there are several other 
members of cabinet here, but I can tell the House that of all the 
members of cabinet here the finance minister has one of the most 
admirable records of listening to his backbench MPs and actually 
implementing their suggestions and policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a couple of examples.  One of the things in this 
economic statement that absolutely delights me is the fact that 
finally, after some years of lobbying, particularly by the member 
for Mississauga South, who was the real champion of this issue of 
supporting the nuclear family in our society, is the proposal 
that gives tax breaks to a family that has a stay at home parent. 
What we find for a family earning $40,000 a year with one parent 
working and the other parent staying at home with two children is 
a one-third break in their taxes.  They will save $1,000 as a 
result of this initiative that the finance minister brought in 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that this is long overdue, but the reality is that 
on this side of the House we have all kinds of points of view 
represented.  The member for Mississauga South championed the 
whole idea of supporting the ability of people to look after 
their children directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The traditional family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Yes, the traditional family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the equation is that there is a lot of concern 
on this side of the House about looking after families where 
there is only a single parent.  There is no doubt that for a long 
time a lot of the financial policy on this side of the House was 
directed toward helping single parent families.  That is a very 
good thing, but now we finally have the balance.  That is because 
of the efforts of the member for Mississauga South and others of 
us.  I will count my colleague next to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We all work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Yes, we all work together.  We made 
progress.  That is a very important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are other things, such as debt reduction. 
The Canadian Alliance would have us believe that they are the 
ones who invented debt reduction as some sort of good thing that 
governments ought to be doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that prior to 1997 for three years running 
I ran an opinion poll at the fall fairs in my riding in central 
Ontario.  I had four jars and people would be given four beans, 
each one representing $1 billion.  I would ask them if they were 
the finance minister how they would spend a $4 billion surplus. 
They had a choice of GST reduction, increased social spending, 
personal income tax cuts or debt reduction.  For three years 
running the people who put the beans in the jars chose, first and 
foremost, debt reduction.  About 45% of the opinion poll chose 
debt reduction as their number one priority. I presented those 
results every year to the finance minister and I told him that 
this was what people were saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise to me to see in this economic statement that 
not only have we reduced the debt already by some $18.7 billion, 
but in this statement we are also undertaking to reduce the debt 
by another $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker really amused me.  I can be amused 
occasionally in the House by some of the statements coming from 
the other side, Madam Speaker.  The member complained that the 
government had no plan for debt reduction.  What is amusing about 
that is of course any time when we have unspent surplus, the debt 
is reduced.  That is all we have to do.  We have to limit 
spending, control our spending, and automatically the debt is 
reduced.  We have a government that is not only able to reinvest 
in the economy, reinvest in Canadians, but also has a sufficient 
surplus to bring down the debt by another $10 billion.  The 
members on the other side ought to be applauding that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the House is adversarial and it needs to be 
adversarial.  That is only right and proper.  Sometimes I really 
do think that praise from the other side is warranted when the 
finance minister really does what is in the interests of all 
Canadians.  The leader of the Canadian Alliance is always 
demanding forgiveness from this side, but I would suggest that 
what he really ought to do is stand in the House and give praise 
and congratulations where it is due.  I realize that may be a bit 
too much to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point just in passing.  There are two other areas in the 
economic statement that reflect pressure coming from this side 
and to some degree from the other side and that is the rebate on 
fuel costs.  It is quite scary, Madam Speaker, when we see what 
is happening with regard to fuel costs and how Canadians are 
worried. Quite rightly, on the other side there has been pressure 
to somehow relieve the burden, particularly on low income home 
owners facing substantial hikes in fuel costs. That concern is 
being acted on by this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the economic statement that the finance minister is 
listening. That is an important point in the life of this 
parliament. The finance minister not only listens to the 
backbenchers here, but he also listens to the opposition when 
they do carry valid arguments and valid concerns.  We are all 
concerned about what is going to happen to Canadians with the 
high cost of home heating fuel and the finance minister has 
replied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly impressed by the fact that the finance 
minister provided for an increase in the educational tax credit 
for students. This is a very small thing in some respects, but a 
very large thing in others. There is absolutely no doubt that the 
investment for tomorrow is the investment of this government and 
this parliament in young people.  I am very pleased that the 
economic statement reflects that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is actually precisely the point in many respects 
because what does make us different on this side and what makes 
us so different from the philosophy that we see, particularly 
from the Canadian Alliance, is that we believe as Liberals, and I 
think I can speak for the majority of us, that the role of the 
government is to provide services and encouragement in the 
country.  Our role is to increase the equality of opportunity of 
all Canadians.  That is a proper use of government money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore what I see in Ontario with the Harris government.  I 
am uncomfortable with what I see in Alberta with the Alberta 
government.  I am extremely uncomfortable with what I hear from 
the Canadian Alliance with this whole idea that you should 
retreat from government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the point.  What you really need to do with 
government spending is when you do invest in the country, when 
you do invest in social services, when you do invest in 
helicopters or whatever it is the government is buying, you must 
invest well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is to make sure that spending is as 
efficient as possible.  That brings me to the more recent debate 
over the last few days about the auditor general's report and 
indeed the information commissioner's report about the need to 
reform the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key point that the auditor general said which is so important 
is that even though there are all kinds of problems in 
effectiveness of spending and mismanagement in HRDC, he said 
there was no evidence of malfeasance.  He said there was no 
evidence that any bureaucrat profited by any of the 
inefficiencies or mistakes that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so important about that?  That means that our job as a 
government, as politicians, is to build on the honesty of our 
bureaucrats.  We have to give them the tools to more efficiently 
manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe one of them is to modernize the privacy legislation 
and the access to information legislation.  I have to say in the 
context of a point of privilege that the Speaker ruled on today 
that there were problems that led to the government making an 
incorrect decision with respect to its opportunity to support 
reforms to the access to information bill that was proposed in my 
Private Members' Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not fault the government.  I do fault messages that were 
received by the government, but that is another story.  I do not 
dispute the Speaker's ruling, but I do stress it is important to 
all of us here to reform this kind of legislation so that the 
bureaucrats in HRDC and every other government department can 
operate with a better degree of transparency.  When you have 
transparency, you have accountability.  This is where we are 
headed with respect to HRDC and with respect to every government 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will recall that the member for Mississauga West, again a 
member on this side, chaired a committee in 1995 on grants and 
contributions.  What she and the members who supported her did 
was they came out with a number of recommendations on how to 
improve the way government handled grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an excellent report and the government did act on it. The 
problem in a modern society and a huge government department 
spending billions of dollars is that we have to modernize.  The 
member for Mississauga West in the report called on the 
government to implement better controls, to be more targeted in 
what organizations should receive money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most interesting suggestions in that particular 
report was that governments should always choose contributions 
rather than grants because the system of contributions requires 
accountability and performance review whereas grants tend to go 
out with no accountability whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell you that some departments reacted very strongly to 
the report, at least as far as I can gather.  Industry Canada and 
foreign affairs both implemented a number of reforms of the way 
they put out grants and contributions. 
I know this because I have all kinds of representations from 
organizations that were suddenly being asked, in 1995-1996, to 
give better explanations and better accounting of how they were 
going to use the money.  Many of these organizations ceased to 
get support from both Industry Canada and Foreign Affairs because 
they could not live up to this.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made progress at that time.  That progress came from the 
backbench.  We really have to take the next step.  I look to the 
other side to set aside partisan politics and work together on 
improving the way our bureaucracy operates, always allowing for 
the fact of wanting to do a good job, wanting to do the best job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should harness the Internet.  We should put as much 
government online as possible so that when that middle level 
manager in any government department is considering a contract, 
considering making a contribution or executing some kind of 
program involving grants and contributions, we can see en route 
who it is that is receiving the money, what they are proposing, 
how the government is checking that it is actually delivering the 
services that it proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can all go on the Internet.  This is crucial because this 
is what will make Canada more efficient than any other country in 
the world.  In fact there is a race between Canada and the United 
States to implement this kind of bureaucratic efficiency because 
not only does it make more efficient government but it is a model 
for corporations.  To come back to the original point, that is 
why, with some urgency, government has to review and modernize 
the Access to Information Act, the Freedom of Information Act and 
the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take a great deal of satisfaction in realizing and learning 
that even though my private member's bill to reform the Access to 
Information Act failed, the government has since undertaken a 
major co-operative endeavour between the justice department and 
treasury board to examine the whole issue of how to make 
government more open.  I believe the government is going to 
report in the fall of next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would prefer an open process that would have resulted had my 
private member's bill gone through and it had gone through 
committee stage debate.  Nevertheless, this is a clear indication 
that this government is very much on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we must bear in mind that all government is like a huge 
vessel.  I hate to think of it, but it is like the <I>Titanic</I>. 
We do not want it to hit an iceberg.  We want it to continue to 
sail.  If we are going to make sure that the ship of states sails 
on successfully, we have to make sure that it has the modern 
tools of transparency and accountability in order to achieve that 
target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, on this side of the House I can assure you that 
we already have the heart. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened intently to my colleague's speech.  I 
know he is a member who sincerely expresses what is on his mind 
and is well intentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to take issue with a few things he mentioned.  I do 
believe this upcoming election is going to be all about trust, 
about who to believe and actions speaking louder than words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need to take a look at what my colleague said about debt. 
First of all, understand that it is the government and the legacy 
of the Liberals that have brought us to the point of an item 
mentioned in the economic statement.  I would like to direct the 
member to that on page 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It clearly states that our debt level right now is $564.5 
billion.  That is the level of our national debt, our national 
mortgage.  That was brought to us by the government over years 
and years of governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals are asking Canadians to trust them to be the 
ones to eliminate that.  Their plan for doing that is mentioned 
on page 13.  They have put a contingency reserve fund in place of 
$3 billion.  It is a good idea and we congratulate them for that. 
It is not enough. 
That contingency fund is to pay down the debt only if money is 
left after Liberal spending has taken place at the end of the 
year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the new item about debt reduction 
introduced yesterday in the economic statement made it into the 
document.  However each fall from now on we will announce whether 
a greater amount should be dedicated to that year's debt paydown. 
They will make an announcement on whether or not to pay some more 
debt down, rather than any kind of legislated paydown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned that debt paydown would happen with 
surpluses that were left over, that when they control spending 
and surpluses are left over it goes to the debt.  New spending of 
$50 billion was mentioned in the document presented to this place 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in the world could Canadians believe the Liberals are 
committed to legislated debt paydown when it is not here? They 
are the ones who introduced the debt.  They are the ones who 
continued to spend.  Whenever the member uses reinvest, we should 
read in the words a new spending initiative of taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague about the issues he raised.  I also 
want to ask him about the point he made about a Liberal committee 
that looked into HRD and other grants and contributions in 1995. 
If that were such a good plan, how in the world did we get to the 
$1 billion boondoggle, with billions of dollars not being used 
appropriately?  How is that possible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That indicates to me that the report was put on a shelf and 
nothing happened.  I would like my colleague to address those 
issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.): </B>Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There have been consultations among the parties and I think you 
would find agreement for the following motion which has been agreed 
to by all House leaders House: 
<A NAME="LINK64">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at 1.45 p.m. the present debate shall be adjourned; that 
Bill C-45 shall be withdrawn from the Standing Committee on 
Finance and referred immediately to committee of the whole, which 
shall consider the said bill and amendments to be proposed 
thereto; and that the bill shall be reported, concurred in at 
report stage and read a third time no later than 1.59 p.m. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose this particular item for the consideration of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also there is a matter that we want to bring to the attention of 
the House.  It has to do with the private members business for 
today.  The Chair will recognize that instead of having private 
members' hour this evening we had the private members' hour from 
9 to 10 this morning.  That did not assume we would have an hour 
more of sitting.  I would like it, but I recognize that was not 
the agreement I made with other House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, to be totally consistent with the agreement that we 
negotiated, the House would in fact end at 5.30.  If we wanted to 
extend the time beyond that, we would have to ask for consent 
because it was not part of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it was indicated that way on today's documentation 
issued to members, in fact that was not the agreement among House 
leaders.  The agreement was that we would take the hour at the 
end of the day and put it at the beginning.  Therefore government 
orders would end at 5.30 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. House 
leader have consent of the House to put the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The House has heard 
the terms of the motion.  Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ECONOMIC POLICY 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK66">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion, of the amendment 
and of the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
question which was a little bit elaborate.  I will try to answer 
it in reverse order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I did not make it very clear, and it is my fault, in my 
presentation.  The report in 1995 on the grants and contributions 
was an excellent effort, but one of the difficulties is when we 
are dealing with large corporations, whether it is in industry or 
in government, it is very difficult to police what the average 
manager is doing, the rank and file manager. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intentions of the report were very good, and some of 
the recommendations were implemented, the reality in a large 
corporation is that there is no effective means, or has not been 
up until now, for the senior management, whether it is the deputy 
minister or the chief executive officer of a corporation, to have 
a really good sense of what is actually happening down in the 
offices and cubicles of government or the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why the Internet is so important is that it offers a 
unique opportunity that never existed before, whereby by putting 
the daily operations of the rank and file managers online, all 
the public become the auditors.  Then we would be able to see, as 
members of parliament or as ordinary citizens, who is getting 
money in a riding as they get the money.  We would be able to 
assess the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our great problems with respect to grants and 
contributions which has been debated on all sides of the House 
was that in the old days, under a previous political party's 
government, grants and contributions were primarily controlled by 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great innovations that came in 1993 was that was 
basically taken away from the politicians on all sides of the 
House.  While there was some input there was not very much input. 
It was primarily left to the bureaucrats to dispense the program 
funding in the various ridings.  It applies to my riding and it 
applies to ridings of the opposition.  That is, shall we say, a 
more honest process, but the problem is that it put the onus on 
the bureaucrats to make decisions that often they were not 
competent to make.  So we have the dilemma of HRDC that we have 
right now where we have mismanagement; we have the awarding of 
program funds improperly; and we have poor tracking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is to put it online.  If money is coming into my 
riding, your riding or whoever's riding, Madam Speaker, if the 
public can see who is receiving that money and how it is being 
tracked, how the services are being provided, then we will reach 
an enormous level of efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hesitate to criticize my government on this point 
because I believe that my own political government is moving far 
too slowly in making the necessary changes in legislation to 
enable the bureaucrats to bring in this type of legislation.  I 
believe the civil service wants to do it.  I believe there is a 
very active effort out there to bring government online.  It is 
we, perhaps, who are slow to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say, though, that I have not had a lot of support from 
the opposition benches on this.  I have very much had to rely on 
the support of my backbench colleagues, but I think it is in all 
our interests to pressure government to make the appropriate 
changes to legislation to bring government online, which would 
increase transparency and accountability everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of the debt, what I have to say with respect to 
that is that there is a fundamental difference between the 
Canadian Alliance and the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put it to the member this way.  If one were to legislate 
debt reduction and require every year that the debt be reduced 
by, let us say, $5 billion—$3 billion is peanuts when we have a 
$560 billion debt—what happens if a recession strikes?  What 
happens if there is an Asian flu and suddenly the markets just 
fall apart? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have that legislation in place then we destroy the options 
government must have, the finance minister must have in the event 
of an emergency.  This is again perhaps a difference between the 
two sides.  I really believe as an individual, and I think we 
believe mostly as Liberals, that our responsibility as a 
government is to provide essential services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just about reducing taxes.  It is not just about even 
reducing debt.  The most important thing is that we have to 
provide services when Canadians need. If we put government 
into a straitjacket of legislated debt reduction we have that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the opposite side of the coin.  If we say, as the 
Alliance Party has said, that debt reduction has to be at $6 
billion a year, what do we do when we have the opportunity of a 
surplus, as we have now, where we can reduce the debt by $10 
billion and where we reduced the debt by $12 billion just 
recently? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an interesting figure on that reduction of $12 billion. 
That saves us $700 million in interest charges, I think it is. We 
are all on side here.  We want to get that debt down but do not 
put us in a straitjacket.  That does not help Canada.

much time, but I do find that the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot has a colossal nerve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that there were even some deaths in Walkerton because of 
bad drinking water treatment. Could he at least have the courage 
to admit that in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada it is in part, 
perhaps in large part, the federal cuts that have made it 
impossible for the provinces to respond to their people's needs 
in the health field? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let him at least have the honesty to admit that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, what happened in Ontario 
is that instead of settling its obligations the Ontario 
government cut personal income taxes.  It made the choice, which 
is proposed now by the Canadian Alliance, to set cutting taxes 
above public safety and the cost has been in lives in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and the Liberals are very much on side on 
this.  We all believe that we must invest in the environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am honoured to rise in the House today to persuade all 
those Liberals over there that what they are doing today with 
this so-called itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny mini-budget is totally 
inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I will not have a great deal of time because I am 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley.  Therefore in my limited time I will address just a few 
of the issues.  First, I would like to talk about debt.  If we 
wanted to congratulate the Liberals for anything, I guess we 
should congratulate them for their excellent ability to spin an 
itsy-bitsy thing into something big. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things they are bragging about is their debt 
reduction.  When the Liberals came into power in 1993 the total 
debt was $508 billion.  Of course they had that record over $40 
billion deficit which was left by the Conservatives.  For about 
eight years the Liberals were riding on the fact that the 
Conservatives gave them that $40 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much mileage have they spun out of the fact that the deficit 
is now gone?  I am amazed they even attempt to take credit for 
it.  The deficit would have been gone if they had done nothing, 
which I guess is pretty well what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a very strong economy with our neighbours to the 
south.  We have had a very excellent balance of payments 
internationally.  Consequently our economy has done very well. 
Lo and behold the deficit is gone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been on the backs of the taxpayers.  It has been on the 
backs of the employers and employees in the country from whom the 
government incorrectly, illegally, unlawfully has taken billions 
of dollars out of the EI fund.  It has no justification 
legislatively to do that.  In more gentler terms we would call it 
theft when one takes something from someone to which one is not 
entitled.  I am not accusing any individual member of that. It is 
the whole government that has simply stolen money, the billions 
it is not entitled to, from employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please.  I know the 
hon. member for Elk Island was being very careful with his 
suggestions because the hon. member knows that he must be very 
careful.  I thought I would interject because it is very clearly 
understood that the word stolen, even in connection in a broad 
term with the government, is plainly inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not use that term again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took money it was not entitled to legislatively. 
The EI fund is specifically set up to look after people who are 
temporarily out of jobs.  The government has rolled billions of 
dollars from that fund into the general revenues in the 
consolidated revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk more about the debt.  Under the present government 
the debt grew from $508 billion in the 1993 budget.  Let us say 
$546 billion; we will concede that it was not responsible for the 
deficit in the first year.  Now the debt is around $565 billion. 
The debt has grown and it has grown substantially under the 
present government.  Yet the Liberals are spinning it in such a 
way that literally thousands of Canadians think that hey, the 
debt is gone.  They keep talking about eliminating the deficit 
and they do not communicate clearly with Canadians that the 
deficit is simply the amount one borrows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of borrowing, we now have surpluses, that is true, but 
it is with no thanks to the government.  It would have happened 
anyway. The fact of the matter is that our total debt, the amount 
against our national credit card, is considerably greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, I taught at the Northern Alberta Institute 
of Technology. One of the courses I taught was the math of 
finance.  I did a little calculation.  Just using round numbers, 
with a debt of roughly $580 billion, which I admit is now a 
little less, in order to retire a mortgage of $580 billion in 25 
years would require posting a surplus toward it of $50 billion a 
year for 25 years. Those people are doing that. We are paying $40 
billion in interest thanks to this government, the one preceding 
it and the Liberals preceding it. We got that huge debt and now 
we are paying $40 billion a year in interest. The government is 
paying it with taxpayers' money and it is paying another $10 
billion against the principal.  Lo and behold, that adds up to 
$50 billion a year. At that rate we will be rid of our debt in 25 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is great.  As long as I can do anything about it, we will 
do everything we can to pressure the government into resisting 
the additional spending it is prone to do.  The only thing not 
mini about the mini-budget is the new spending programs. Added up 
over the next five years the Liberals are looking at spending an 
additional $50 billion.  A lot of it is for straight political 
purposes as we have seen particularly over the last year.  It is 
totally atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address the question of tax cuts.  The 
finance minister loves to stand in his place and say they are not 
only going to do da-di-da, but they are reducing the tax rate to 
16%, from 17% to 16%.  It is a crime that the Liberals are taking 
any tax money at all from the people whom they are taxing.  They 
suck $6 billion a year from families whose income is less than 
$20,000 a year.  That is absolutely atrocious. 
The Liberals are crowing that they are not going to take 17% of 
our taxable income anymore, but they are now going to take 16%.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what those numbers mean.  This is approximate; I did not 
do an actual tax return. I just did some rough calculations based 
on a family making $26,000, a mom and a dad and two kids. The 
Liberals tax them around $2,000; actually $2,147 is the number I 
got.  If that is reduced to 16%, their tax is reduced by $126. 
This is a family that makes a scant $26,000, a mom and a dad 
trying to raise two kids, and the government is asking us to jump 
up and click our heels, which I find difficult to do for two 
reasons and members will them figure out.  That family will keep 
$126, $10 a month, and the Liberals say that is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our tax plan the same family would get a tax cut of 100%. 
We would cut that family's taxes entirely.  They would not be 
required to pay because they are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider people with a little more.  The Liberals are 
trying to spin it that all we want to do is give a tax break to 
the rich and not to the poor.  They are the ones who are taxing 
the poor.  We are the ones who are ready to relieve the poor of 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Tell us about the flat tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have time.  The member 
can ask that in a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if there were an Alliance government, we would 
begin to relieve the tax burden of Canadians in a substantial 
way.  It is a fact that reducing the tax rates for families who 
are poor provides much more money for them than do the grants and 
the administration costs and all of the other boondoggles that we 
get from a government that believes in taking money from 
taxpayers and then having the bureaucrats or politicians decide 
who gets it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to announce that when the Alliance forms the 
government, it will be the end of hotels being subsidized in 
Shawinigan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I read an article this morning 
in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, a newspaper that often is not too 
kind to the Liberal Party.  The article was by Hugh Winsor.  He 
talked about the Alliance tax plan.  Here is what he had to say 
about the Alliance tax plan: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance plan is totally predicated on a presumption of tax 
greed:  that everybody wants lower taxes, even if it means fewer 
services from the government.  It is a plan clearly skewed toward 
higher incomes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really captures the essence of the Alliance's tax plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House this morning the member for Elk Island and others 
have talked about low income Canadians.  I would like to acquaint 
Canadians and the House with the impact yesterday's economic 
statement will have on some Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a one earner family with two children with an 
income of $40,000 a year paid about $3,325 in federal tax last 
year.  The Alliance has not said when its tax measures would come 
into play but as of January 1, 2001, and not some unknown 
timeframe out there in never-never land, the taxes for this 
family of four will fall by $1,100.  That is a 32% saving in 
federal income taxes.  That is not all.  I have just begun.  By 
the year 2004 their taxes will fall by 59%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about a single parent with one child earning $33,000.  As of 
January 1, and not 2004 or 2005 or some other time in the distant 
future, but as of January 1 a single parent earning $33,000 will 
pay no net tax at all.  Zero, zip; in English that is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell us under his tax plan what programs his 
party will cut?  It will have to cut $25 billion in programs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is really an interesting 
debate.  I do not think it was a year ago when we were pushing 
for tax cuts that the Prime Minister said publicly in the 
newspapers that he was not cutting taxes as that was not the 
Canadian way.  Now all of a sudden the Liberals are bragging that 
apparently they think their tax cuts are bigger than ours.  That 
is not true of course, but they are trying to spin it.  What an 
amazing transformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the member's question, first of all, on the reduction in 
taxes for those who are in the $30,000 bracket, which is not a 
rich bracket, our tax plan is going to give them some real relief 
because we are reducing the exemption.  There is a big 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $20,000 income being taxed at 16% is $3,200.  At 17% there is 
the same amount of tax revenue from an income of $18,000.  In 
other words, reducing the exemption by $1,176 gives an individual 
a 1% reduction. We are reducing the basic exemption by about 
twice that, by $2,500 approximately. As a result, even though the 
remaining part will be taxed at the end of our plan at 17% 
instead of 16%, it still means the taxpayer will be paying less 
tax because it is only 1% higher but it is on $2,500 less money. 
Under our plan the person pays no tax at all on that much more 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a problem in communication and the Liberals are really 
good at that.  People look at 16% and 17%.  Somehow the Liberals 
are able to separate Canadians from their money so efficiently 
and make them feel good about it.  In a way we have to admire 
that skill in communication.  We have to admire that, but it is 
being dishonest to Canadian people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must have known that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance was going to 
ask the question about what programs we would cut because I 
brought a list of them with me this morning which I would like to 
present to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute of Technology and Economic Commerce 
received about $3.5 million.  We are going to cut that program. 
This group was established in the Prime Minister's own riding and 
incidentally, its two principals were charged with fraud and 
theft in August 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wiarton, Ontario where groundhog day is held every year just 
received $50,000 from HRDC to help with its groundhog day 
program.  We are going to cut that program.  Incidentally, the 
people of Wiarton are going to receive that money in the form of 
funding for health care and post-secondary education rather than 
for their groundhog day.  We think those two things are more of a 
priority to them contrary to what the Liberals are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American based RMH Teleservices was enticed to the HRDC 
minister's riding with a $1.6 million HRDC grant over the 
protests of one of the neighbouring Liberal MPs.  The principal 
of RMH Teleservices said that one way or another it would have 
been in Brantford anyway, with or without the $1.6 million from 
the Minister of Human Resources Development.  I just realized 
that is the riding of the HRDC minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Liberal government's interest, there is another program 
we are going to cut.  Canadian Aerospace Group in Nipissing, 
Ontario received $917,000 of a $1.3 million transitional jobs 
fund grant before going bankrupt without building any aircraft. 
There is a bright side.  This bankrupt company then moved to 
Saint-Hubert, Quebec and was approved for another $1.6 million 
from the Canadian economic development for Quebec regions.  There 
was a little vote gathering going on there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the Parliamentary Secretary to the Finance Minister, 
those are the programs we will be cutting.  That is how an 
Alliance government would be able to fund important things like 
health care and post-secondary education, programs that keep our 
best and brightest here in Canada instead of seeing them go 
south.  I think Canadians would agree that those other programs 
are far less important than health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to the election plan of the Liberal government that 
was brought down yesterday.  It is important to first establish a 
real truth about the government.  The real truth about the 
government is that it cannot give to the people that which it has 
not first taken from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance stood in the House and brought down this 
mini-budget.  He has, in a magnanimous jester, which just happens 
to coincide with the calling of an election, tried to out do the 
tax relief of the Canadian Alliance Party.  I am pretty flattered 
that I have been part of a political party sitting in opposition 
in the House that has been so effective in our calls for tax 
relief in the last seven years that we have been able to 
influence a Liberal government that throughout history tax relief 
has been the furthest thing from any of its policies or 
philosophies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just show me a book on Liberal governments going back to 1867 
where a Liberal government came up with an idea all on its own, 
where it would give Canadian taxpayers some tax relief. I would 
love to see that book but it is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The finance minister and this government came 
to this mini-budget last night kicking and screaming.  They were 
in fact dragged, drugged to that point over the last seven years 
by the Canadian Alliance Party and the Reform Party before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He doesn't know how to use the past tense 
of dragged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  He sort of drug that one up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  You need to drag it again, that's 
gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member from 
Nipissing unfortunately has been drug around by a horse a little 
too long.  It is starting to affect his thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I commented on once before, if one focuses on something too 
long one tends to take on the characteristics of it.  It is 
obvious in his case he has by riding in that little cart behind 
the horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing about the Liberals, and let us be fair, they 
may be devious, they may be deceitful— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Devious we can get 
away with but we cannot have him in a sulky if we are using 
deceitful.  So we would ask you to please withdraw the word 
deceitful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Certainly, Mr. Speaker.  They may 
be at times seen—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals may be at times, in addition to being devious, seen 
to be lacking in integrity.  They may seem to be at times, by 
some people, lacking in moral fibre.  However, one thing they are 
not is stupid when it comes to using the book of election 
trickery.  They know that book very well and they have read that 
book very well.  We saw an example here yesterday of just how 
much they have been able to embrace that book of political 
trickery over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been stripping Canadian taxpayers of their hard earned 
money for seven long years.  They have put in about 40 tax 
increases over the last seven years.  They have taken over $50 
billion of new tax increases over the last seven years.  Now, on 
the eve of another election, they are going to give them all 
their money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a gimmick.  What a gift.  They are going to give Canadians 
back their own money.  This is amazing.  They think they are 
doing something wonderful.  It is like when my children were 
small.  When they misbehaved I would take away their toys.  When 
I would give them a few back and they thought they were getting 
something new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have failed miserably in their attempt to out tax relief 
the Canadian Alliance Party.  Their program simply is not 
believable.  One only has to read the recent auditor general's 
report on HRDC and on budget program 2000 and see the language 
that is contained in that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the evidence of the mismanagement of HRDC, the billion 
dollar or so boondoggle, given the wording of the AG's report on 
the budget 2000 that the minister has presented, a financial 
document that is misleading, Canadian voters will be asking 
themselves one question:  Can we trust the Liberals?  The answer 
will be a resounding no on November 27 when they elect a Canadian 
Alliance government to run this country properly.

going to tell the parliamentary secretary of finance where his

more horses' asses than most people, so I know them when I see 
them.  I am looking upon them now because if that party expects

Let me state exactly where it is because hidden in this 
magnanimous gesture of tax relief, in this mini-budget, is $52 
billion in new spending.  Twenty-three dollars billion goes to 
health care, which it has ripped out of it since 1993, but that 
still leaves about $25 billion in new spending programs that the 
government is trying to hide in this mini-budget by talking about 
all the tax relief; $25 billion in new spending.  Just to make 
sure that it got spent, just to make sure that no Liberal forgot 
how to spend money, they brought in the ex-premier of 
Newfoundland to remind them all how to spend money.  We are going 
to see that person in action if this Liberal government, my 
goodness, I shudder to think, should ever win the next election. 
I pity the people in the government, and there are two or three 
who have some fiscal sense, because they are going to be crying 
themselves to sleep every night as they watch the ex-premier of

spend money how to do it once again.

correct, but look at the spending programs.  The spending is on 
the environment, on alternative fuels and on making our air and 
our water safe.  These are the things that the reform alliance 
has no interest in.  It also has spending to enhance our granting 
councils, to put more money into research and development, to 
invest in the brain power and the knowledge power of the people of 
this country, to make this country a better place and to make us 
more innovative in the world of global economy.  These are the 
things of course that the Alliance is not particularly interested 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the members from across the way laughing and carrying on 
as if this was some kind of funny game.  This is not a game.  It 
is very serious to the people of Canada. The debate is about 
public versus private spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition would have us believe that somehow by stripping 
out public expenditures they would simply go away.  The reality 
is that if we take money out of certain programs it will simply 
have to be replaced by the private sector.  I know the reform 
alliance would just love to see this in the area of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that the other day one of their own speakers 
was telling us about the access to health care in the province of 
Alberta where in fact people have to pay their own premiums and 
that there was a whole list of people in the province of Alberta 
who, for whatever reason, were unable to make the premium 
payments and, as a consequence, did not get health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of society the former treasurer of the province 
of Alberta would have us live in.  Canadians are not fooled by 
those kinds of choices.  Canadians do not want that kind of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the whole area of taxation. Certainly 
the economic plan of the Minister of Finance was very forward 
looking with its concept of reducing personal taxes. Across 
progressive income tax rates we really have four income tax 
brackets if we count the first one as being zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk to some of the people out there today about 
progressivity in the income tax system and the so-called vision 
of taxation our members across the way would have us believe in. 
Progressivity simply means that as people earn more money they 
have the propensity and the ability to pay proportionately more 
tax.  In other words, they are not paying proportionately more 
tax on all the money they have earned but only on that portion of 
higher income they have earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have long accepted the concept of progressivity.  If 
one is wealthy, if one has been so generously endowed to earn 
well, one will pay proportionately more in income tax.  We are 
not talking about rates.  We can see today that our government 
has reduced rates.  The two different issues here are rates and 
progressivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would question all this business about exemptions, deductions 
and so forth.  They really mean nothing to the average taxpayer. 
The only thing that means anything to anyone is total tax bite in 
relation to total income.  Subtract the two and what is left is 
the disposable income with which one can actually go to the 
supermarket or department store and physically buy something. 
That is the only thing that is important to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that people start thinking about all the taxes 
they pay in their lives.  We talk about municipal taxes, about 
sales taxes, and about excise taxes.  The one thing they have in 
common is that they are all flat taxes.  They do not go up as 
one's income goes up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we took all of those taxes, included income taxes and looked 
over the broad spectrum of people's earnings, guess what?  Canada 
has a flat tax system today.  As incomes go up, in other words, 
total taxes do not.  I have statistics here from numerous 
professors that will bear out this equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go into the reform alliance members' dream world, or I 
should say nightmare, of a flat tax system that would take the 
income tax system and also flatten it.  They have backed away a 
little from that.  They have said they will not do that right 
away.  Maybe they will just wait awhile or sneak it by the door 
and then stick it to people.  The reality is that people are not 
going to be fooled by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, no countries in the western world have a flat tax. 
No peoples in the western world have sat down and said it is a 
fair and reasonable thing to flatten the income tax system.  I 
know the province of Alberta thinks it has one but it is not a 
country yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact the income tax system was flattened, what would 
happen?  Looking across the perspective of people's incomes we 
would actually see the wealthiest people paying less 
proportionate tax than the middle class.  Let us think about 
that.  We would actually see a line on a graph.  As people start 
hitting $100,00 a year and over, their proportionate tax bite 
would actually go down.  I can think of nothing more perverse or 
immoral from a party that talks about morality and values. 
I can think of no situation that can justify such an immoral 
position as transferring taxation from the wealthy to the middle 
class.  This is a fundamental issue as we go into this election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the privilege to go to countries that actually have 
this type of taxation system.  They have it not by choice but 
through corruption an an inadequate way of collecting taxes. Many 
of the countries in South America often have a similar system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There one finds a small group of wealthy people who pay very 
little tax.  They have their money hidden in foreign accounts and 
so forth and do not contribute to the economy.  Then one finds a 
massive group of poor people who have no ability to participate 
in that economy.  It is not good for either the wealthy or the 
poor.  The wealthy cannot sell goods because there is nobody to 
sell them to and the poor cannot consume them because they do not 
have the money to buy them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this vision of reform alliance on flat tax would 
drive us into a two income groups: one for the wealthy and one 
for the poor.  Few people in the existing middle class would have 
the ability to catapult or make that astronomic jump from being 
middle class to wealthy.  That is the vision that party would 
bring a vision where the wealthy get wealthier and the poor are 
destined to be poorer and poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker talked about some of the wasteful spending 
of the federal government.  It makes the assumption that if 
governments spend the money it is terrible, but if somebody in 
the private sector spends the money it is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a list of HRDC programs.  I look at the Alliance formula 
here.  They talk about all the stuff they would reduce to make 
their little world work.  They talk about reducing HRDC grants 
and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about some of the things that have occurred in my 
riding of Durham.  I look at the first one on the list of people 
who received grants from HRDC:  Independent Deaf Services. 
Archibald Orchards and Estate Winery is a small business that is 
trying to establish a winery in my riding, and very successfully. 
They taught some young students skills they probably would not 
otherwise have received because nobody would hire them.  They 
hired those kids to work in that business.  The business is 
successful, creating jobs in my riding and bringing in wealth. 
The winery is also exporting product across the border, bringing 
export dollars into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another organization I presume the opposition does not like is 
the Bowmanville Memorial Hospital.  HRDC gave money to allow 
people to work in the summer months at the local memorial 
hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bowmanville Zoological Park is another one.  This is private 
sector.  They own a park.  They are doing films.  I cannot 
remember the classic film about the elephants in Africa, but 
those elephants came from Bowmanville.  They train elephants for 
movie productions.  They created a school to do that.  People are 
coming from all over Canada to get this training, and we are 
exporting that to the movie industry all over the world.  This is 
a success story that the reform alliance would have nothing to do 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to another so-called terrible expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
usually let members misuse our name three times before I rise. It 
is now three times that this member has not called us by the 
proper name as ruled by the Speaker.  It is Canadian Alliance.  I 
would ask you to remind the hon. member of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Elk Island is quite correct.  The name of the Reform Party has 
been changed to the Canadian Alliance.  It has been clearly 
understood that this is the name by which the party will be 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>   Mr. Speaker, we can dress them up but 
we still cannot take them anywhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Central Seven Association in my riding received $10,000. 
What does Central Seven do?  It deals with the mentally 
handicapped in my riding.  This is a program the opposition would 
be happy to stomp out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tyrone Mills is a privately owned historical site in my riding 
that is having a very difficult time maintaining itself.  It is 
one of those areas where if it was not privately owned it would 
have to be government funded and cost us twice as much to 
maintain.  We gave the historical site the terrible sum of around 
$13,000 back in 1998 to help with some of their summer student 
employment programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>White Feather Farms is a very successful farming operation in my 
community.  It received $6,000 to assist in summer employment on 
the farm.  Young people got work experience in the agricultural 
sector.  These things would not have happened without these 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on:  the municipality of Clarington; the Durham 
region community care association, which helps people with home 
care; and other things the opposition, whatever their name is, 
would do away with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the people of Durham it is not funny.  The people of Durham 
take this very seriously.  They do not find it particularly 
humorous to be told that these things are a waste or boondoggles. 
They can see right through it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move on to the so-called health care agenda of 
the Alliance.  It is interesting to read the letter the 
Alliance's illustrious leader sent to the premiers on the 
discussion of the health care formula.  Essentially he talks 
about the transfer of tax points to the provinces in support of 
health care.  This is the same party that refuses to acknowledge 
the fact that back in 1997 the federal government entered into an 
agreement with the provinces to transfer tax points in support of 
health care.  In its little booklet it shows a wonderful graph of 
how the Liberals stopped spending on health care.  What is 
missing?  The transfer of tax points, which is the very thing 
they want to do.  Its whole platform is not only ridiculous but 
also unethical, frankly.  It is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That program of transferring tax points to the provinces would 
simply mean the federal government would have nothing to say in 
health care.  Indeed, the provinces are arguing about that now. 
In my own province the government refuses to acknowledge the fact 
that it was transferred tax points back in 1997, as if it never 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people who do not fully understand tax points, and 
many of us do not, the federal government has a federal income 
tax on which the provinces usually piggyback their taxes.  With 
tax points, rather than simply taking money in and sending 
provinces a cheque once a year, the federal government would just 
reduce its amount of federal tax and allow the provinces to 
occupy the taxation room.  The provinces would then collect 
directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, once the government does this it is almost like giving 
candy to a baby:  provinces consume the candy and want more. They 
seem to forget the fact that they received these tax points and 
have been enjoying the benefits since 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of regime this party would impose on us in the 
area of health care.  In other words, rather than money being 
sent from the federal government to the provinces, it would all 
go through the position of tax points.  That essentially means 
the provinces would go their own route to creating a health care 
regime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will forget about the federal government which essentially 
ends up in the creation of 10 provincial health care systems and 
also systems in the territories, none of which make any sense to 
each other, none of which would be portable, transferable or 
accessible.  The reality is Canada's health care spending is the 
fourth highest per capita in the world and yet when it comes to 
service delivery, we rank about 18th.  The federal government did 
not create those statistics, the provinces did because they are 
responsible for the administration of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It begs the question then why would we transfer more power to 
the provinces that already created this inefficiency, this 
inadequacy?  Does this issue of commitment to health care by the 
so-called Alliance help to get down to the root problems of the 
health care system?  No, it does not.  It simply means that we 
would transfer power from the federal government to the provinces 
and there would be no uniformity of health care in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note in their little platform document that the Alliance says 
it is interested in Canadian unity, yet when we ask people what 
unites us as a nation we often talk about our social programs. 
The fact that we have a universally accessible health care system 
is one of the things that we see as defining us as Canadians. 
This is the very central issue that the Alliance would do away 
with, a universal health care system, and in fact it would allow 
for the experimentation of privately funded health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note in its documents the Alliance talks about needing more 
doctors and nurses.  I had a health care forum in my riding and I 
brought in the people who run Durham Lakeridge Health 
Corporation.  I brought representatives from the physicians and 
nurses.  It was a funny thing; after discussion that night the 
conclusion was that it has nothing to do with money.  Sure, we 
would like a little more money for our MRIs and for machinery, 
but the reality was that the problems were fundamental.  We had 
too many doctors pushing paper, working on computers and not 
delivering health care.  We had an administrative system in our 
provinces that mitigated against the delivery of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance members celebrate that.  They want to give more 
money.  They keep pouring money into the top of this thing but it 
is not coming out at the bottom.  That is why when we sat down 
with the provinces we demanded there be an accountability 
framework.  We demanded that there be accountability on how we 
are spending the money, on how waiting lists are being made 
better, how the delivery of health care to average individuals is 
being made better.  We believe that there is a fundamental role 
for the federal government in health care, of the lives of the 
people of this country.  That is a fundamental difference between 
us and the party over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about some of the other elements that were 
in the economic statement, not the least of which were some 
interesting elements in reducing corporate taxes and also capital 
gains taxes.  I note that with our capital gains tax reductions, 
capital gains tax in real terms relative to the American tax is 
actually lower now.  This gives Canadians a great opportunity to 
invest in themselves and in the country.  It has always been one 
of our sore points that Canadians have often not invested in 
themselves.  We have allowed for greater rollovers of capital 
gains.  If we buy stock in small companies and then buy another 
one, we can keep rolling over that money in Canada tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on that happy note.  This is a great economic 
statement.  The party over there is in lots of trouble. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rather enjoy listening to the member because he has a 
logical mind but sometimes he tends to distort things.  It is 
just the way it comes out, but I thank him for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct one misconception.  It is in fact true 
that individuals in Alberta and British Columbia pay a premium to 
have access to the health care system. 
That is how those provinces happen to set it up. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the member and everyone else who heard 
him that people who do not have money do not go without health 
care in Alberta.  As a matter of fact, there is a means tested 
system.  If people do not have the means to pay the premium then 
they are exempted from paying it, which is the way it ought to 
be.  I do not think the member raised a valid point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like also to talk a bit about the health care system.  I 
noticed that the member wears glasses.  I am sure he has been to 
a dentist.  It occurred to me that neither optometric services 
nor dental services are covered under the Canada Health Act and 
yet it seems that our Canadian population is well served by 
private enterprise in those areas.  We also have general 
practitioners and hospitals and so on that are publicly funded. 
That seems to work reasonably well most of the time except when 
there are some severe glitches in the system as we have 
experienced in Canada in the last seven, eight or ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be disingenuous of us to simply say that we will never 
discuss whether or not there is a role for private practitioners. 
I think there is.  As I have already said, there are a number of 
different medical areas which are certainly essential.  I would 
be really lost, literally, if I did not have my glasses and yet I 
do not expect anybody else to pay for them. We should have in 
place a system whereby those who do not have the means to pay 
should be able to get their glasses covered.  I think they do 
through our social welfare system.  We are not against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as health care is concerned, the member really does 
misrepresent our stand.  We have always had, reflecting the 
wishes of Canadians as a grassroots party, the health care system 
as our highest priority.  It has been a concentrated effort on 
the part of our, shall I call them our political adversaries, to 
try to distort our image on health care.  I am getting very tired 
of it.  I am one who fully supports an adequate health care 
system.  I believe very strongly in and voted for our policy that 
says no Canadian shall be denied needed health care because of a 
lack of ability to pay.  That is our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to stop his concentrated effort of 
distorting what we believe in so that his party can somehow come 
out as the defenders of health care when in fact it has been 
under their watch that health care has seemingly suffered so very 
much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for Elk 
Island said that I was distorting his party's position.  This was 
concerning the list of people, possibly in Alberta and British 
Columbia, who are required to pay their own premiums and if they 
did not, it was possible they would not get access to the health 
care system.  I am only repeating what I heard the member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley say yesterday.  We can go back 
and look at her speech where she said those very things.  She is 
stating presumably the position of the Alliance.  I would not say 
she was misleading the House.  I presume she was telling the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of other private sector provided health care, I 
think members will find that in the area of dental care where 
people do not have some kind of coverage whatsoever with their 
employer they get poor dental care.  We could go to the dental 
association and others who will confirm that.  Reality is where 
the service is not readily available people do make economic 
choices.  If they have less money, they get less health care.  That 
is all there is to it and that is the kind of system the member 
is promoting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the member's final point he said that I was distorting the 
position of his party regarding the facts or the 
balkanization of the health care system.  I would like to mention 
some statements from his own leader who sent a letter to the 
premiers.  In the letter he talked about allowing for, more or 
less, a system of tax points being transferred to the provinces. 
This will allow any province to opt out of cost shared programs 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction with full compensation. 
Opting out.  Have we ever heard of opting out?  That was Quebec's 
thing years ago, “Opt out of this.  Opt out of that.  We will 
create our own program”.  That is exactly the health care system 
that this party wants to promote, an opted out system where 
everybody is going off on their own little bailiwick with no 
accountability, with no commitment to the people of Canada and 
certainly no harmoniousness across this country that we could all 
share and respect as our health care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I reject what the member is saying about our policy.  We 
believe that it is the role of the federal government to work 
very closely with the provinces and come to an agreement with 
them with respect to the funding of health care across the 
country.  Certainly there has to be accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather amazing that a member from the government side, 
after the gross mismanagement in HRDC and in native 
affairs, that the auditor 
general just decried—it is not us saying it—that he would 
somehow imply that the Liberals are the masters of accountability 
and there would be none under our programs.  It is really just 
the opposite.  I need to rebut that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask the member about tax credits.  During 
his speech he indicated that the view in our graph is somehow 
distorted.  He actually held it up even though props do not 
usually appear in the House.  I often wish we could.  As a math 
teacher I would love to show those graphs to help communicate. He 
actually did it and got away with it.  He showed that dip in 
health care spending by the federal government which was indeed 
cash transfers.  I understand tax points.  At the same time we 
never noticed that our federal tax load actually went down.  In 
other words, the tax room was vacated but we were still being 
taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is that aspect to it.  The other part that rather confused 
me is that he said “We are not acknowledging that they 
transferred tax points and that this is good”.  Then he also 
said almost in the same sentence, and I may not be able to quote 
it exactly, something along the line that when transferring tax 
points, the federal government's ability to have a say in it is 
removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with that.  I think that tax points is a valid way of 
arranging with the provinces for financing.  I would like to ask 
him if we propose tax points it is bad, if it is done by them and 
we are not acknowledging it, it is good.  I think he is 
inconsistent and I would like him to clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, quite frankly the decision to engage 
in the tax point exercise was in 1977, certainly a long time ago. 
I was not around.  I believe that the government confronted with 
the same choice would not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It simply has not worked out.  In the province of Ontario, the 
premier continually ignores tax points.  In fact he delights in 
spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money showing how 
little the federal government is contributing to health care, 
totally and erroneously misrepresenting the position of the 
province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says that this is a fair and equitable 
arrangement if we give tax points, it is not in reality in the 
day to day push and shove of politics.  Provinces will not come 
clean.  They will not stand up and say “We honestly understand 
what happened.  We honestly understand that tax points were given 
to us.  We will give you credit for it”.  They just say “You 
are not doing your share.  You are only giving us 13 cents on the 
dollar and therefore you have nothing to say in the area of 
health care”. That is not true.  We are not willing to accept 
that.  We are not going to accept it in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, on a point of order.  I 
wonder if I could find unanimous consent of the House to just ask 
the member one more quick 30 second question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there consent to 
continue questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will begin by saying that it is obvious to everyone that the 
government had one thing and one thing alone in mind when it 
brought down this mini-budget, and that was the upcoming 
election.  All economists and editorial writers today would 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the staggering, not to say exploding, surpluses at the 
disposal of the Minister of Finance, we were expecting that he 
would do something for those who were really responsible for 
helping put the fiscal house in order, those whose efforts have 
made the last three years of zero deficits possible and are 
still being gouged by the federal tax system, those who are the 
reason the Minister of Finance can stand here today and boast 
about surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought that the main beneficiaries of these tax cuts would 
be low and middle income families, not families at the top end 
of the scale who can take advantage of tax loopholes not those 
earning $250,000 and up, not millionaires and friends of the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year he dares to say that the surplus will reach $6 billion 
only, whereas close to $12 billion is already sitting in the 
federal government's coffers. This is more than double his 
forecasts for this year. He could have done twice what he is 
doing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could have helped the most disadvantaged, low and middle 
income earners, the folks who pay EI premiums, and the small and 
medium size businesses which are now footing the bill for tax 
cuts for the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could also have helped the unemployed men and women who are 
not receiving any EI benefits because of the drastic cuts made 
in the system and because of the tighter eligibility criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the families in rural areas, young people, women and 
seniors who are paying for the income tax cuts of the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wanted to upstage the Canadian Alliance before 
the election call and woo its voters. The government seized on 
the idea of the flat rate proposed by the Canadian Alliance, 
which was strongly criticized because it favours the 
millionaires, and incorporated it into its mini-budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took the $100 billion in surpluses from the pockets of low 
and middle income taxpayers, off the backs of the unemployed, 
women, young people, the sick and the disadvantaged.  It is 
totally indecent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get too excited about the tax cuts because we are not 
going to get them right away—only in a year and a half. 
It could have presented the same budget in February, but the 
wealthiest in society will not really feel the effect of this 
mini-budget for a year and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the information in the Minister of Finance's 
economic statement and budget update, a single parent family 
with an income of $250,000 or more will enjoy a tax cut 40 times 
greater than a family with one dependent earning $30,000.  In 
the case of an income of $250,000 the reduction represents 
$20,000 net in income tax, and in the case of an income of 
$35,000, it represents a mere $500, when there is one dependent 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is giving millionaires a $20,000 cut in income 
tax and middle income and disadvantaged families a $500 cut. 
What is even more disgusting is that the government will give 
the most disadvantaged families a government cheque for $125 
because of the current oil crisis.  This is really disgusting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister kept telling us that people earning $35,000 did not 
pay taxes. We questioned him on several occasions, because we 
knew that these people were in fact paying taxes, but he kept 
telling us that they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, now he admits that they do pay taxes, since he 
just told us that they would be paying less. If this is not 
trying to fool people, I do not know what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also shows that the government continues to 
accumulate surpluses shamelessly because, as I said earlier, the 
tax cuts will occur in one and a half year. Once again, the 
government continues to fiddle with the figures by using tax 
deductions as tax cuts. 
This has to be seen. Members should take a look at page 97 of 
the minister's economic statement, where a chart shows that the 
employment insurance fund is being used as a form of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is dipping into the surpluses of the EI fund to 
grant tax cuts to high income earners. Moreover, it is fiddling 
with the figures and using the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST, a tax that should not exist when a government is 
enjoying such surpluses, is part of the tax relief scheme. Even 
the auditor general condemned this dubious practice and told the 
government not to resort to it again. The government then 
brought down a mini-budget and again fiddled with the figures to 
create a smokescreen. It hid the real figures because it was 
afraid to have a real debate on the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I currently am a member of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
I was at the in-camera presentation of this mini budget, before 
the Minister delivered his speech in the House. Out of 
curiosity, I immediately checked where was the support promised 
to women's associations that met with the Prime Minister last 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women had 13 basic claims. They met with the Prime 
Minister who told them to wait and see what would be in the 
mini budget. That was the first thing I did. Believe it or not 
there was nothing and even less than nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing for low income single mothers who should pay 
no income tax, nothing for social housing and nothing for the 
former older workers of the Celanese plant in our region, which 
has closed down. 
These people contributed to employment insurance for 30 and 40 
years. They were given a severance cheque, which they were told 
was a gift that they should use, and later we would see if they 
were entitled to employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people, aged between 55 and 57, will have a hard time 
finding a job because, as we know, entrepreneurs and employers 
do not hire people of that age, whom they no longer trust. This 
government had a duty to establish a program like the modified 
former older workers program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in there for the former workers in 
Drummondville, Jonquière or other areas who suffer the hardship 
of plant closures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing for employment insurance, parental leave, 
foreign aid or for ordinary people who paid for those surpluses. 
Nor is there any basic financing provided for associations 
working with women.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut all forms of assistance and core funding to 
these women's groups when it asked them to submit projects. It 
assesses the merits of each project and then tells the women that 
it will be sending a cheque with a maple leaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The women who work in these organizations put in between 70 and 
80 hours a week to come to the rescue of other women faced with 
some very basic needs. Instead of spending their time helping 
other women, they now have to develop projects to find the money 
they need. 
They would not always have to look for money if the government 
had taken its responsibilities and extended core funding to help 
these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that these groups that help women in 
need are the keepers of the fundamental values of our society. 
When a government has been able to generate a surplus on the 
backs of low and middle income taxpayers, as this one has, one 
of its priorities should be to meet the demands of women's 
groups; it has a duty to do so. I imagine the government will 
pay for this on November 27, the night of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister laughed at them. Women's groups got slapped 
in the face by the government. The Prime Minister knew full well 
that women would get nothing from the budget update. He does not 
care at all about the demands of women. 
This government is laughing. Women's groups are of no interest 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it is the women who raise children and support society, but 
that is not of any interest to the Liberals.  They prefer the 
people earning $250,000, those who have easy lives, those who 
have no trouble getting around the taxation system in order to 
pay less tax, and those who have no trouble keeping a roof over 
their heads.  They prefer to give presents to these people 
instead of going with the real priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indecent to present a budget like this one.  There is 
nothing for the provinces as far as health is concerned.  A 
transfer has been made, $21 billion put back in the Canada 
social transfer, and now they are patting themselves on the back 
for that.  Yet this is just the money that had been cut from the 
provinces.  It is not even the government's money. 
Ottawa's money is the taxpayers' money and it must be returned 
to them via the provinces for health and education.  Brutal 
cuts were made and now the $21 billion is being given back to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in spite of the accumulated surplus, they cannot even 
index the Canada social transfer.  The provinces still have a 
great deal of difficulty delivering services in the health 
sector because of the aging population, the high costs of the 
new technologies and the high cost of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are still having serious difficulties and there is 
not an ounce of compassion being shown toward them. They are 
being given back the $21 billion that had been cut and ought not 
to have been.  With the surplus, as we can see, the provinces 
are being dragged down, are being strangled. 
The provinces are being made to bear the brunt of the burden; 
they cannot deliver all of the health services they would like 
because they cannot afford to, while the federal government is 
busy congratulating itself.  This is disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reference in this budget either to the indexing of 
funding to universities for post-secondary education.  This is at 
a thirty year low.  Nothing is said about that.  They are 
patting themselves on the back about their $100 billion surplus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no indexation of the Canada social transfer 
for health and the youth. The budget provides a one-time 
allocation for heating costs. What a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, a single elderly woman who has only her pension 
cheque to get by on is living under the poverty level. A recent 
study has shown that 47% of single elderly women are living under 
the poverty level. Those who have an oil furnace will get a small 
$125 cheque, with the all important maple leaf to boot, when 
their bill has in fact doubled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the bill was between $500 and $600. This 
year it will be over $1,000, $1,100, or $1,200. In colder areas, 
bills will be even higher. Yet the government claims to be giving 
a generous gift, a $125 cheque. That is absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget, senior citizens living under the poverty level 
are also ignored. There is nothing in this budget for these 
elderly men and women who have a made a contribution to our 
society. The government should make them one of its priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will low income single mothers who spend 30% of their 
income on housing do when their heating bill doubles? Will they 
deprive themselves of food toward the end of the month or freeze 
in their homes? The $125 cheque from the government will not be a 
big help. 
One hundred and twenty five dollars does not even cover one 
grocery bill for a single parent family with two children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has reduced the income tax for the rich 
and the friends of the party. It has done just like the minister 
who cannot understand that, because he has his ships built 
somewhere else. He could not care less. That is also the reason 
why there is nothing in this budget for shipbuilding yards; 
nothing for the one in Quebec City and nothing for the other 
yards across the country. He does not care. He has his ships 
built elsewhere, just like he pays his income tax elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These surpluses do not come out of his pockets. It comes from 
the taxpayers, from the unemployed and from the workers who 
contribute to the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right wing budget is an insult to all Canadians. It is a 
budget that ignores the least advantaged members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister could have done a lot more. We have been putting 
forward the figures he is proposing now for a long time. We have 
been doing so for years. We have been telling him for at least 
four years that he will have all those billions in his coffers. 
He has always laughed at us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While our figures match now, we in the Bloc Quebecois do not 
have the same priorities. If I had more time, I would give you a 
list of our priorities. With $147.5 billion, our priorities would 
target women, the disadvantaged and the low and middle income 
earners. For the government, it is the opposite. While we 
concentrate on those with an income of up to $80,000, for the 
government that is the level at which tax reductions start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also invest in tax reductions, and we will discuss our 
true priorities during the electoral campaign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
making a comment and asking a question to my colleague from 
Drummond, I would like, as a preamble, to indicate to the House 
that last week I informed my colleagues of the Bloc Quebecois 
that I will not be seeking a third mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to say to all my 
colleagues in the House how I appreciated working with all of 
them. It is indeed a privilege to represent our fellow citizens 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that as a member of parliamentary 
committees and associations I had the opportunity to get to 
know some of my colleagues better, to develop a 
friendship with them based on mutual respect and consideration and to 
recognize their competence and their involvement in issues which 
we all wanted to see properly dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My only regret would be that it is still necessary to have 
members from Quebec sit in the House. I would have hoped to be 
the last federal member from Portneuf. I know that my colleagues 
had the same hope because if Quebec were sovereign there would 
be no need for us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the will of the people of Quebec has been different, 
but the presence of the Bloc Quebecois in the House, as we can 
see in today's debate and in those we have every day, is 
essential for the protection and the advancement of Quebec's 
interests. I might even add that it is more than ever essential. 
Thank goodness the Bloc Quebecois is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to ask a question to my hon. colleague from 
Drummond with regard to the mini-budget the finance minister 
delivered yesterday. Here I will digress to say that while I 
thought Christmas was on December 25, apparently it was 
yesterday. However make no mistake, the minister is not a real Santa 
Claus. He is a phoney Santa Claus because he is not delivering 
real gifts. I want to talk about the particular issue of the subsidy granted 
to individuals for heating oil. That is very nice, but not 
everybody heats their home with oil; others use other sources of 
heat. What about them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that taxpayers will have a little more money in their 
pockets to pay their heating oil bill, what is stopping oil 
companies from raising oil prices? The law of supply and demand 
is well known. Market forces are at play, and it is not because 
the minister is offering that kind of fiscal measure that this 
will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since consumers will have more money available, it will be a 
strong incentive for oil companies to raise heating oil prices 
in order to pocket that money. Besides, is that not precisely 
what oil companies have been doing for some time now, pocketing 
our money at the pump or at the time one buys heating oil in 
order to generate profits unheard of in many years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government is not dealing with the basic problem, 
which is the fact that oil companies are now abusing a situation 
I would describe as quasi-monopolistic and the consumers have to 
pay for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Drummond not think that with this 
fiscal measure of the finance minister there is a huge risk for 
the people she talked about, women in particular, to get 
swindled by the oil companies trying to put their hands on this 
little amount of money, which is not even enough to cover the 
additional costs they will be faced with this coming winter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, before answering my 
colleague's question, I would like to tell him that we are sorry 
he is leaving the Bloc Quebecois, but this is his decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has worked with us for seven years. I can tell the House that 
I have worked with him on some issues and that he is very 
professional, he wants to get things done, he is a hard worker 
and he has integrity. I think his constituents will miss him. 
All the Bloc Quebecois team will miss him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank him for everything he has done during 
these seven years for his constituents, for his riding and for 
Quebec's interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have much to add to my colleague's question because he 
has answered it himself. Yes, there might be a suspicion that 
some people will be cheated. Perhaps the question I could ask—I 
do not know who could answer it—is, when the government sends a 
$125 cheque to help people with their heating bill, why will 
everyone get a cheque? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that a single person lives with his or her mother, 
for instance, or with a student or a roommate who is  working 
and that the person who signed the lease receives the $125 
cheque to help with the heating bill, will the roommate also 
receive $125? This second person does not pay the heating bill. 
We are totally confused. All those who get a GST tax credit, 
whether they have an oil heating system or an electric heating 
system, will get $125, while this cheque is supposed to help 
those whose heating bill actually doubled. This is all very 
confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same holds true with the figures, which can be fiddled with. 
This is really confusing. As my colleague said, we can assume 
that there will be some slightly shady characters who will try 
to collect this cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something must be done, and the government must think twice 
before doing this. 
I think that if this cheque is going to be given to people to 
help pay their oil heating bills and if the government is going 
to refuse to take steps to lower fuel prices in Canada, the 
government should look into who will get a cheque to ensure that 
it really goes to pay the oil heating bills, as these bills have 
doubled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to note at the outset that I will be splitting my 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to Ottawa I made a point of meeting with the 
Minister of Finance, in part to get to know him better and in 
part because I had run on a platform that emphasized debt 
reduction and tax cuts.  We shared a coffee and exchanged views 
on the current issues of the day.  Over the past number of years 
we have shared quite a number of other coffees, had a few meals 
and played some pretty lousy golf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always appreciated the Minister of Finance's candour with 
caucus members, his intellectual grasp of the current issues of 
the day and his ability to reflect in the budget the issues he is 
hearing and give them force and effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also appreciated the support that the Prime Minister has 
given over the past number of years in fashioning a variety of 
budgets.  Those budgets are in fact attuned to my set of values 
and beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran in the last election I said that our debt was way too 
high and that we were becoming uncompetitive, with the United 
States in particular and the G-7 in general, in terms of our 
overall tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I potentially face my constituents once again, I think I have 
a pretty good story to tell.  I will be able to say to them that 
over the past three and a half years in the course of our mandate 
the debt to GDP ratio has gone down from 71% to about 58%.  I 
will be able to tell them about the absolute reduction in our net 
national debt of $28 billion.  I will be able to say that the 
reduction in market debt is even greater, at last figure $32 
billion, possibly higher. 
I will be able to say that the Government of Canada has run 
fiscal surpluses for the last three years.  They can reasonably 
anticipate that debt servicing costs will be down by $1.7 billion 
and that the debt to GDP ratio will come down to about 40% by 
2005.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reflect on my conversation with the minister some three 
years ago, never in my wildest dreams would I have believed I 
would be able to go back to my constituents and tell them that 
debt story.  I am amazed at the accomplishments of the Minister 
of Finance and the Prime Minister in directing the resources of 
the Government of Canada in dealing with its debt burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of our conversation had to do with tax relief for 
Canadians.  Frankly I was quite vague about it.  I did not really 
understand what was meant by a $100 reduction, a change in a 
threshold, or a percentage change. For me, it has been a steep 
learning curve as the minister has fashioned three budgets and a 
number of economic updates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own instincts have been to start where the impact would be 
greatest, namely among low and middle income Canadians and then 
work to upper income Canadians recognizing that when one gives 
tax relief to low income Canadians, it does filter up our 
progressive tax system.  The system in some respects is 
relatively simple but to think back three years ago and realize 
that brackets have gone up substantially and that rates have been 
going in the other direction is really quite a significant 
accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to earn $8,000 of taxable income before one gets taxed. 
From $8,000 to $35,000 the rate has been reduced from 17% to 16%. 
From $35,000 to $60,000 the rate has gone down from 26% to 22%. 
From $60,000 to $100,000 the rate is at 26%.  For over $100,000 
it is at 29%.  Every one of those percentage points literally 
represents billions of dollars. Cumulatively the impact is $100 
billion.  These are very significant changes.  These are 
substantive tax reductions which frankly I never would have 
believed based upon my conversation three years ago with the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be candid, I was not overly enthusiastic about the Canada 
child tax benefit.  However, I have come around to the view that 
if we really want to benefit low income Canadians, we have to do 
it through a combination of measures. Otherwise if we simply cut 
taxes, it becomes terribly expensive to the treasury and it does 
not necessarily benefit the people whom we want to benefit the 
most.  I was therefore more than pleased that effective July 1, 
2001 the Canada child tax benefit will be raised with the maximum 
benefit for the first child going up to $2,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar vein, giving tax relief to Canadians who have 
disabilities or Canadians who are caregivers, I am pleased to see 
that the minister has raised the disability tax credit up to 
$6,000 and the caregiver tax credit up to $3,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an enduring myth in the House that somehow or another 
we should ignore Canadians with higher incomes or businesses, 
notwithstanding the fact that we know that businesses generate 
income and jobs.  We somehow or another believe that they should 
be ignored and taxed to the max. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the Minister of Finance does not buy into that 
myth and that Bay Street, to coin a phrase, needs to be 
recognized for the contribution it does make to the Canadian 
economy and to the general well-being of Canadians.  His 
commitment is to lower corporate tax rates from 28% down to 21%. 
He has already implemented a 1% cut and there is a commitment to 
cut 2% for the next three years legislatively.  In my view this 
brings certainty to the tax structure which is something all 
businesses can appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing the capital gains inclusion rate from 75% to 66% to 50% 
is an accomplishment that all entrepreneurs should welcome.  That 
puts us below comparable American rates.  Tax-free rollovers will 
be expanded and made available to more businesses.  The size of 
an eligible investment will be increased from $500,000 to $2 
million and the companies themselves from $10 million to $50 
million.  This should be of great assistance to those who find 
the tax structure somewhat restrictive in their entrepreneurial 
activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on the tax side of things, I want to congratulate the 
minister and the Prime Minister for the deindexation of the 
system.  This was an item which was argued loud and long in 
caucus.  One of the members who argued it loudest and longest was 
the hon. member for Durham.  I congratulate him for his 
persistence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister pointed out in his speech yesterday that government 
is more than simply balancing books.  He, the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Health stood firm in their resolve that the 
Canada Health Act be respected, that the provinces recognize that 
we are more than 10 little independent principalities, that this 
country has certain health care principles and that those 
principles are enshrined in the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is clear.  We are not above using cash to make sure 
that all provinces give consistent quality health care across the 
country.  Health care should not be dependent upon the size of 
one's wallet, or the various governments' budgets, or wacky 
right-wing philosophies.  People should not have to have a wallet 
biopsy just to get treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the pathetic whining by the province of Ontario, 
the Prime Minister saw fit to increase the cash component of the 
Canada health and social transfer by $21.2 billion over five 
years. Members will recall that prior to the February budget, the 
province of Ontario was taking out ads insisting that the 
Government of Canada cut taxes, cut taxes, cut taxes.  One minute 
after the delivery of the budget the province of Ontario shifted 
its focus on more money to the province of Ontario by way of CHST 
transfer with no strings attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inconsistency and hypocrisy of the province of Ontario is 
obvious for anyone to observe.  Even at the worst of times, the 
province of Ontario had its transfers reduced by something less 
than 2% of its overall budget which was restored immediately as 
soon as funds were available. That was done last year. 
Misinformation is a modus operandi for the Government of Ontario. 
A little history is in order here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the CHST was created. The agreement was that the 
Government of Canada would reduce its tax room and the provinces 
would take its place. As Ontario's economy has grown, so also has 
its tax revenues. Therefore, the tax component has grown which 
has more than made up for the modest reduction in cash.  With 
this new money the cash component of CHST is increased by 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has hedged its bets though with the 
mere certainty that the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Alberta 
will stretch the notions of affordability, universality and 
accessibility to the maximum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am returning to my constituency this weekend.  I will have a 
pretty good story to tell.  I can go back to my constituents and 
say we reduced taxes substantially, over $100 billion, that we 
reduced debt substantially, $28 billion, and that we restored 
Canada's health care system to the tune of $21 billion.

mini-budget not as an honest attempt to solve the economic 
problems of our country, but rather as a cynical attempt to buy 
the voters in the coming election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three things have happened over the last little while which I am 
going to ask my colleague about, bombs the government has let 
explode in its own lap.  One is the access to information debacle 
in that the government is vigorously trying to hide information 
to which members of the public have every right of access. The 
second is the mini-budget. The third is the auditor general's 
report, which not only is a scathing attack on the government's 
failure to spend the public's money wisely, but also is an 
indication of its flagrant abuse of the public purse not only in 
HRDC, but also in aboriginal affairs and many other areas. Last 
is the government's frequent spending of the taxpayers' money all 
over the country in a vain and failing attempt to try to curry 
favour with the voters.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending is taking place to put back the money the government 
has taken out in health care, which was over $22 billion. 
Incidentally, the money it will put in will only get us back to 
1995 levels for health care and education in spite of the fact 
that when this comes into play we will be 10 years behind the 
eight ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can my hon. colleague justify the government's spending an 
additional $29 billion of the taxpayers' money beyond the money 
that has already been allocated for health care?  How can he 
justify to his constituents that putting in $22 billion as of the 
year 2006 which will get us back to 1995 levels is going to fix 
our health care woes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know what figures 
the hon. member is reading. 
My recollection of the budget numbers is that spending absent 
debt has basically been flatlined for the past two or three 
years. The management by this government has resulted in the 
ability of the government to significantly reduce debt. I would 
have thought that the hon. member's party would have been more 
than supportive of the notion that the nation's debt should be 
reduced.  I do not see how the hon. member thinks he can have it 
both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot quite get my head around how the hon. member and his 
party in particular can criticize the mini-budget.  Reducing 
taxes with cuts, which I understand to be the most significant 
part of the hon. member's party platform, by accumulatively $100 
billion, is a pretty significant cut for Canadians across the 
board, both at the upper and lower ends.  I cannot quite see how 
that can be criticized.  I cannot quite see how putting back $21 
billion over five years into the health care system can be 
criticized as a terrible thing.  Over that period of time $21 
billion is a significant sum of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also put money into technology research. We are in the 
bizarre situation of spending 9% or 10% of our gross domestic 
product on health care and having absolutely no idea how it is 
spent, where it is spent or by whom it is spent and of having to 
beat the provinces over the head just to have a reporting system. 
I support the position taken by the government on this for the 
simple reason that I would not want to continue to send money 
down a sinkhole until we knew exactly where the money was going 
and how it was to be spent.  I would think I would have the 
support of the hon. member for the initiatives taken by the 
Government of Canada on that issue alone. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to deal with a few specifics but I would rather 
talk a little about the philosophy of what the mini-budget is and 
what it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me deal with what it is not.  It is not a document 
that mirrors in any way whatsoever the philosophies or the 
attitudes of the Conservative government in the province of 
Ontario.  I want to respond directly to my good friend the 
treasurer, the minister of finance for Ontario, Ernie Eves, who 
is quoted in the paper as saying “Give credit where credit is 
due.  I think finance minister Martin is moving in the right 
direction.  We have been preaching a lot of the stuff that Mr. 
Martin seems to have picked up on since 1995”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  One thing we did not do which Mr. Eves and the 
Ontario government did do, is we did not borrow money to give a 
tax cut back to the wealthiest people in the country.  How does 
one give a tax cut while continuing to run a deficit?  That is 
absolutely crass politics at its worst.  While we appreciate the 
fact that my hon. friend in Ontario congratulates the minister 
and the government for bringing in a budget that he seems to 
like, we do not need any lessons on how to balance our books, how 
to reduce the tax load, or how to pay down the debt.  In fact, 
this government has shown true leadership in all of those 
regards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been interested to hear some of the responses.  I am sure 
the members opposite were busy with all the spin doctors 
yesterday trying to figure out how in the world they were going 
to criticize this without looking like they want to take back 
things that the government is giving to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a socialist budget, I can assure members.  It is 
absolutely not.  I heard the leader of the NDP stand in her 
place, and in a scrum, say that the government has clearly 
decided that its agenda is based on tax reductions. That is 
absolutely correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it do in terms of helping families?  Let us take a 
look at some of the examples.  This is what is so puzzling when I 
hear the socialists stand up and say that the government did not 
do enough here, that it did not do enough there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A two-earner family of four with a combined income of $60,000 
last year paid about $5,700 in federal tax.  Next year their 
taxes will fall by over $1,000, a first year cut of 18%.  A cut 
of $1,000 for a family of four, a husband, a wife and two kids, 
means that they have $1,000 more that they can use perhaps for 
their children's education, for a family vacation or to pay some 
bills they are behind on.  Is that not all good social policy? It 
makes a lot of sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single mother with one child earning $25,000 a year received a 
net benefit of just $1,400 last year.  Next year she will receive 
an additional $800, for a total benefit of $2,200.  Maybe the 
silk stocking socialists that inhabit the chairs in this place 
just do not think that $800 is a lot of money.  Let me tell them 
that to a single mom in Mississauga $800 is a heck of a lot of 
money.  She can use that money to benefit her children, to pay 
for something she needs, to help pay for their education or to 
help pay for their clothing.  Of course it is a social benefit. 
Would the NDP take it away?  Would it suggest that we not give 
that tax break? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A one-earner family with two children making $40,000 last year 
paid about $3,325 in federal tax.  Next year they will pay about 
$1,100 less, a reduction of 32%.  This is a family in which one 
spouse goes to work and the other stays home as a caregiver, with 
two children.  They are saving $1,100.  This is real money.  This 
is real money back in the pockets of Canadians who need that 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We absolutely have the financial house in order in Canada and we 
have turned around and given back that money to where it belongs, 
in the hands and the pockets of the hardworking taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say what it also is not.  It is not a Bloc budget.  Why? 
It actually strengthens Canada, which is clearly not on its 
agenda, not in its interests and not in its party platform. It 
would rather continue to drive wedges.  Not only does this budget 
strengthen Canada, it benefits Quebecers, because a lot of the 
people I referred to, the two-earner family, the single mom, the 
one-earner family with two kids, live in Quebec.  They are going 
to see that money coming back.  Going into an election—let us 
admit that is what is going to happen—the people of Quebec are 
going to look at this and ask the Bloc why it is criticizing the 
fact that the Government of Canada is giving them back some of 
their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House what this is also not.  This is not a 
federal Conservative budget.  We had a number of years of federal 
Conservative budgets under Brian Mulroney and, I might add, with 
the assistance of the current leader of the Conservative Party in 
this place who was a member of the Mulroney cabinet.  With his 
assistance they managed to drive this country to the state where 
people were saying, in New York and other places around the 
world, that Canada was bordering on being a third world country, 
that Canada had run up a deficit, an overdraft, of $42 billion 
with no idea of how to pay it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people had an idea.  While we stand here and take 
credit for it, the true credit for eliminating the deficit, and 
for this budget, belongs to the Canadian people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a conservative budget.  It is far-reaching.  It is 
visionary.  It sends a message to all Canadians that says the 
government knows they have suffered through years of cutbacks and 
years of turmoil, and it is time because we do have a surplus, 
not because there is an election.  If there is an election in 
November or in April, what is the difference?  There is a fall 
mini-budget or economic update that is done every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members know this.  For them to suggest that the Alliance 
should be able to put out its policy book and tell everybody that 
it will do some of the nonsensical stuff it is talking about and 
that we should just sit back and do nothing, excuse me?  We have a 
constituency in the country, a very large constituency. We are 
the only party with representatives from sea to sea to sea, 
everywhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mini-budget is not an Alliance budget, I can tell hon. 
members that.  The Alliance claims that we have somehow stolen 
its ideas.  What nonsense.  It wants to put in a flat tax.  I 
will be making a statement later about what that really is, a 
three-hump camel, so I will not go into it at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just tell the House that the Alliance wants to bring in a 
flat tax.  Do hon. members know why?  Because it is simple for 
that party to understand.  It can ask Canadians how they would 
like to pay 17% or maybe 25%.  It thinks that is simple to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the result of that?  Add up the Alliance numbers.  If the 
Alliance was putting out a budget of this nature it would turn 
the federal government into nothing more than a head waiter for 
the provincial governments right across the country.  It would 
put the situation in such a disastrous state that all we would 
need would be annual meetings of first ministers who would meet 
somewhere, who knows, maybe in Charlottetown, or likely in Edmonton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Maybe Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Yes, Mississauga.  They would get 
together, ask how much the pie is and then say “Here is your 
share based on per capita”.  They would eliminate regional 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that party has attempted to do to decimate the HRDC plans 
is a national disgrace, because the people it is hurting are 
the people who need the most help.  We have heard members from 
that party say that they consider people in the maritimes lazy. 
We have heard them denigrate all the different groups in the 
country that we support and believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in economic regional development because it creates 
jobs.  It creates pride.  It creates self-respect for Canadians 
wherever they live in the country.  Just because people happen to 
live in oil-rich Alberta does not give them the right to have a 
better standard of living than somebody who lives in Newfoundland 
or New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to go to the Canadian people, put our two visions on 
the table and let the people decide.

Madam Speaker, I must say that natural gas emission rivals the 
massive Sable gas offshore project in my province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, when I speak of gas, this mini-budget with its 
mini vision is really not going to offer the people very much 
other than more postdated promises until after the election. What 
we see happening is this approach by the government to come trick 
or treating to the Canadian public, just on the eve of an 
election, dangling these goodies out in front of the public only 
to pull them back unless it gets the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is, with this so-called 
mini-budget, where is the vision?  Where is the long term plan to 
tackle the deficit and the debt?  Where is the long term agenda 
to try to pay down this national debt that we have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this do for students?  What about students who are 
wrestling with huge debts coming out of university and with no 
hope of getting on their feet or even a kick-start into the 
economy?  Right now their choices are either to go bankrupt or to 
go to the United States.  That is unfortunate and that is the 
environment they are facing right now based on what the 
government has set up.  What are we going to do for students? 
What is the long term plan to deal with the debt situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is really

that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The benefit of that amounts to $1.7

billion that can be used to invest in students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Talk about the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  If the member would stop chirping, I 
will talk about students.  Do not take my word for it.  Take the 
media's word which talks about a $3,200 tax credit going to 
students to help them with their rent and their textbooks. I do 
not think the member has even taken the time to read the document 
if he actually has to stand in this place and ask what this does 
for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the most progressive documents, which will assist 
students right across Canada with research and investment, and R

help students pay their rent.  It is visionary both in terms of 
eliminating the debt, with $28 billion gone now, and a commitment 
to reduce the debt every single year that we are in office.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
quite pathetic to listen to the member opposite trying to justify 
that this vote buying budget is anything other than that, and 
trying to put it in the realm of a budget that deals with social 
ills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that a budget is usually something that puts 
forth the goals and objectives of a government and should be 
addressing the major issues in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major issue that has been dominating the news for the last 
number of months, which has slowed down a bit because the fishing 
season has closed, is the dispute involving the aboriginal people 
in Burnt Church and St. Mary's Bay.  That is just the tip of the 
iceberg, illustrating that there is a need to deal with the 
problems confronting aboriginal peoples across Canada.  This 
budget does nothing whatsoever to deal with any of those 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A big part of the problem relates to the residential schools and 
the fact that the Anglican Church is now almost being forced into 
bankruptcy because the government has failed to take a leadership 
role in dealing with the residential school problem and has 
failed to bear its responsibility in that matter.  The budget 
does not address that issue and it does not address many other 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, what in this mini-budget does anything at 
all to deal with the very important issue around aboriginal 
peoples on reserve and off reserve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, clearly this is not a 
budget.  It is an economic statement.  It says so right on the 
document.  It is something that the finance minister does each 
and every fall as he sees how the economy is performing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We committed during budget 2000 that we would go faster if 
finances allowed us to do so.  This is the appropriate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry if the hon. member's party is not ready with its 
platform.  However, very clearly the government has an obligation 
to say to Canadians “Here is where we believe we should be going 
with your economic future and we want to put exactly what we are 
prepared to do on the table”.  That has been done with this 
document and it clearly shows the vision for the country.

very pleased to follow that fan of Mike Harris who spoke on the 
budget a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ghosts of Liberals past must be rolling over in their graves 
when they think of the sharp turn to the political right, this 
very conservative budget, this mini-budget we had delivered in 
the House yesterday by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen many budgets over the years but this is the most 
conservative, right wing budget I have seen in the last 25 years 
in the House of Commons.  It is more conservative than Brian 
Mulroney, more conservative than the former Prime Minister who is 
now the leader of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a millionaire's budget.  It is a Bay Street budget, with 
$100 billion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and the rich.  If 
someone is making $300,000 or $400,000 a year, if someone is a 
millionaire or a golf partner and buddy of the Prime Minister 
making $400,000 or $500,000 a year, he will get anywhere from 
$20,000 to $50,000 in tax cuts depending on capital gains. 
A single person making $30,000 in Pembroke receives a tax cut of 
only $521 a year.  Compare this to the millionaires who are going 
to receive $40,000 to $80,000 a year on tax breaks.  That is a 
sharp turn to the right by the Liberal Party which has been 
influenced by the Canadian Alliance and by the politics of Mike 
Harris.  The ghosts of Liberals past, leaders like Lester 
Pearson, Pierre Trudeau and Allan McEachern must be pretty 
disgusted with the government they see across the way.

the GDP.  They now amount to about 13% of the GDP. The

is a majority government that lasts four or five years, will be 
under 11% of the GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking money out of health care and education. 
It is providing less money for the environment.  It is doing 
nothing about our farm crisis.  This is a government leading a 
country, one of the few countries in the world without a national 
highways program, that has decided not to put money into 
highways.  This is a government that is devising a tax system 
that is not as equitable as it is giving big breaks to wealthy 
people.  This goes in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at results of polls and surveys we find that most 
people in Canada want more money put into health care.  If we had 
a poll and asked people what to do with a surplus, whether it 
should be spent on massive tax cuts that favour wealthy people or 
put into health care and education, about 75% of the people would 
say that we should put more money into health care, education and 
the environment. That is the direction in which the Canadian 
people want to go.  Those are the values Canadians want pursued. 
The Liberal Party, like the Canadian Alliance, wants to give more 
tax cuts to wealthy people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this done?  The Liberal Party has been drafting a very 
cagey election program and strategy.  What we saw yesterday was a 
move to the political right to capture votes from the Alliance 
and the Conservative Party in the 905 belt around Toronto, the 
wealthy areas around Toronto, the Mike Harris belt around 
Toronto.  The big issue there is tax cuts so the Liberals are 
going to cater to that and they have taken the Canadian Alliance 
program.  The Liberals left the Leader of the Opposition without 
a plank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to see the election announced on Sunday.  The 
Liberals will come out with another red book and then they will 
shuffle to the left. They will talk about investing in education, 
in the environment, in people's programs and things of that sort. 
That is what the Liberal Party is doing with this particular 
economic statement before the House today. This is like the steak 
and the sizzle.  This mini statement is giving a lot of steak to 
the wealthy and the privileged and only the sizzle to the poor 
and ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many programs that should have been enhanced.  Health 
care is the very best example of that.  In 1995 we had the 
biggest cutback in our history in health funding than we have 
ever seen.  That came from a party that at one time initiated a 
national health care system where the federal government paid 50% 
of health care.  Before some of the money is reinstated, through 
the agreement of the first ministers' about a month ago, the cash 
funding for health care had fallen from 50% to 13 cents or 14 
cents on the dollar. 
Even with the $21 billion in social transfers, the cash into 
health care only goes up to 1994 levels.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the priorities? The Canadian people fought to get rid 
of the deficit.  It is the Canadian people, through their hard 
work and their energy, who have created a surplus in this 
country.  I argue that the majority of that surplus should be 
spent on the social deficit that was created by the cutbacks of 
the Liberal government from 1995 on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that if the minister of financial institutions across 
the way had his way he would agree with me that more money should 
be spent in the social pocket rather than on wealthy tax cuts for 
his big powerful friends on Bay Street.  However, that is the way 
the government has gone and that is not the right way to go. That 
is not the vision of a new Canada.  That is not a vision of 
equality, a vision of justice or a vision of sharing.  Those are 
the values that the Canadian people stand for and the Canadian 
people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look through the mini statement from yesterday there are 
many things not mentioned at all.  I think of my own province of 
Saskatchewan.  I have already talked about health care. Health 
care was started in Saskatchewan by the CCF, by Tommy Douglas and 
by James Shaver Woodsworth many, many years ago.  After fighting 
against the Liberals year and year out, health care became a 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party promised health care in 1919, the year that 
the minister for financial institutions was born.  It was 
promised in 1919 but it did not become a reality until the 
mid-1960s, 40-odd years after promising it to the Canadian 
people.  It is only there because it was pushed and prodded by 
the CCF and the NDP who started health care in Saskatchewan back 
in 1961. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1961 when health care became a very volatile issue in our 
province, when there were organizations led by the doctors and 
others to stop medicare—they called it socialized medicine in 
those days—the Leader of the Opposition was Liberal Ross 
Thatcher.  He was one of the leaders in the fight against health 
care in this country.  He went into the legislative assembly with 
a photo op, and he kicked the door of the legislative assembly in 
opposition to health care in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care was so popular with the people that public opinion 
was mobilized.  Through the mobilization of public opinion it was 
forced on the Liberal government in 1965 or 1966 and the 
government of Lester Pearson brought it in across the country. 
The Liberal government had been forced by the CCF and the NDP, 
which shows the influence of a social democratic party as setting 
a popular agenda of equality for the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That whole agenda has now been highjacked because of a paranoiac 
fear of the Canadian Alliance.  What the Liberals are doing is 
adopting the Alliance policy and moving sharply to the political 
right through $100 billion tax cut.  Even the Minister of Finance 
himself a while back was ridiculing the then Reform Party for 
talking about a $50 billion or $60 billion cut in taxes.  What 
does he do?  He betters that with some $100 billion at the 
expense of the ordinary Canadian people and the programs that 
make this country so definitely unique from the United States of 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the CA and the Liberal Party catering to the wealthy and 
to the privileged.  We saw that last night at a dinner in Toronto 
where the corporate elite gathered.  Tables were sold for this 
dinner.  I watched the television last night to see how many 
ordinary grassroots Reformers there were from Wymark, Moose Jaw, 
or Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Brandon, Manitoba.  I watched to 
see how many faces I would recognize of the ordinary people from 
Yorkton.  Does anyone know how many I saw?  I did not see any. I 
wondered why.   Does anyone know why?  It was because the cost of 
a table was $25,000.  Some grassroots party, catering to the 
business arenas on Bay Street, to the big banks and the big 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old Reform Party is dead and gone, the so-called grassroots 
party that protested against this kind of elite gathering.  We 
now have a new Bay Street party in the Reform Party;  $25,000 a 
table. 
They were sipping champagne.  They were pigging out on caviar. 
The party of the so-called grassroots people that rebelled 
against Brian Mulroney, rebelled against Bay Street, rebelled 
against this kind of imperial power, rebelled against these back 
room deals, has changed its skin.  Now it represents the party of 
the wealthy, the rich and the privileged.  That is the new 
Canadian Alliance, the old Reform Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Liberal Party do?  It gets scared.  It is afraid. 
It is afraid of this new party that is rising so it moves sharply 
to the right.   The member from British Columbia over there is 
crying in his seat.  He is afraid as he weeps in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in this budget?  What is in this budget, for example, 
for the farmers of western Canada?   I can see the headline 
“Farmers:  An Endangered Species Survey”.  A report from 
Statistics Canada says that there are 22,100 fewer farmers in the 
prairies this fall than last fall.  The reaction it said was jaw 
dropping from economists across the prairies.  Yet we had a 
surplus of $100 billion over five years to work with.  What is 
there for the prairie farmer?  There are 40,000 fewer farm 
workers in the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers came to Ottawa last year asking for some help.  The 
Europeans massively support their farmers.  The Americans 
massively support their farmers.  The government does 
diddly-squat.  There is nothing in the budget at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a big deficit.  The Canadian people won the deficit 
battle and now there is a big surplus.  Where does the surplus 
go?  It goes to $100 billion on tax cuts.  Where does the surplus 
go?  It goes toward cutting capital gains for speculators and 
wealthy bankers.  The surtax on the rich is gone.  The tax 
bracket was dropped in terms of what the rich pay in taxes in 
this country.  All kinds of tax breaks have been given to the 
banks and we have 22,000 fewer farmers on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised at the government across the way, but we have the 
Canadian Alliance going one step further.  It does not like any 
support for farmers.  The Alliance leader was in Regina back in 
August.  Does anyone know what he said about the Canadian Wheat 
Board?  He said that it should be voluntary.  He said that if the 
Canadian Wheat Board was not a single best seller then it would 
eventually be eliminated and eliminated very quickly.  That is 
exactly what the Canadian Alliance wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the member from Interlake who was saying a few days 
ago that the big drop in farmers is really a structural 
readjustment.  That is the sensitivity we have from the official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It makes no response.  There is 
nothing there to help our farmers in a time of need.  These are 
things that were missing in the mini statement made by the 
Minister of Finance in the House of Commons yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look again across my riding and across my province.  I see a 
highway system that is collapsing because the government across 
the way has allowed the rail lines to be abandoned forcing 
farmers to take their grain to market in large trucks.  The 
highways are being destroyed and yet there is no money for a 
national highways program to help rebuild the infrastructure of 
rural Canada and rural Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is that money?  That money has gone to Bay Street and to 
the wealthy.  It has gone to pay down the national debt very 
rapidly and to pay off the bond holders on Bay Street.  Where is 
the money for the ordinary people in Cupar, Dysart, Wynyard, 
Elfros, Raymore, Qu'Appelle and all those other places across 
Saskatchewan to make sure the highways are rebuilt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a question of choices and a question of priorities. The 
Liberals made their choice and their choice does not synchronize 
at all with the preference of the Canadian people, which is to 
reinvest in people's programs and in a new deal for people.

am attempting to plug a big hole in this legislation.  I propose

</I></B></P><P align=left>That clause 6 on page 3 be amended at line 18 by striking out

<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, I suppose this is 
interesting, however it is a charge against the public treasury 
and it does not have a royal recommendation, as Your Honour will 
know.  It advances a contribution from subsequent years to a 
present calendar year, present expenditure of the government and 
a charge against this year's treasury. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Chairman, 
on that point, the House and certainly the country knows that the 
agreement in principle that was met by the first ministers was an 
agreement that would restore all of the funding back to 1993 
levels.  This bill does not do that and so it behooves the House 
to find a way in which the words of the first ministers can be 
kept and in which we can avoid cheating provinces and territories 
out of $2 billion to $3 billion that they would otherwise receive 
as a result of the agreement in principle to go to full 
restoration of the 1993 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has found a technical point.  There is no doubt 
that it would be possible for the government, if it chose, to 
find some means to rearrange existing expenditures, to front-end 
load the contribution by the Government of Canada so the word of 
the Prime Minister of Canada could be kept and so all of the 
funds that should go back to health and social transfers in the 
country will go back now rather than two years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  The question before the 
Chair is very clear.  It has to do with infringement on a royal 
recommendation and therefore I rule that it is not receivable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Chairman, I would also like to propose an amendment that 
Bill C-45 in clause 6 be amended by replacing lines 12 to 15 on 
page 3 with the following: “a cash contribution of $20.4 billion 
for the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2004, and $21 billion 
for the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2005”; that lines 23 
to 26 at page 3 be deleted; and that line 20 at page 3 in the english 
version be replaced with the following: “ning on April 1, 2002, 
and”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could speak to that very briefly.  It should be noted 
there are many amendments that we would have liked to have 
proposed in the Chamber today that I am sure would have been 
ruled out of order and required a royal recommendation. This 
proposal does not add any new money to the bill, much as we would 
have liked to do that.  It simply ensures that at the end of the 
five year period around which this first ministers' deal has been 
struck, the base would have moved from $15.5 billion to $21 
billion.  I move that constructive suggestion to the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, as much as I 
appreciate the intentions of the hon. member I would have to say 
that, first, the bill respects to the letter the agreement 
reached among the 14 first ministers and, second, as the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance have indicated, if in future 
years budgetary conditions permit, issues about increasing the 
amounts can always be considered at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Chairman, I was very 
interested that the amendment moved by the New Democratic Party 
was one that was designed to be within the limits with respect to 
the authority of parliament over expenditure.  I would like to 
take advantage of the presence on the floor of officials to ask 
them whether in fact the amendment that was proposed is one that 
meets the requirements with regard to the role of parliament and 
spending.  If it does, obviously there would be a desire on all 
parts of the House to support an amendment that would ensure that 
more money went into the system more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the officials here for clarification as to whether 
this is a receivable amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Chairman, the right hon. member 
knows parliamentary rules better than I and he knows perfectly 
well that officials do not speak in the House of Commons; members 
of parliament do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Chairman, I appreciate the 
correction by my hon. friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. friend consent to speak to his officials and to 
convey through his voice their responses to the questions that I 
have raised? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Chairman, the right hon. member 
knows the rules as well as we all do and my hon. colleague, the 
secretary of state, has indicated the bill totally respects the 
agreement made with the provinces so I think it is the end of the 
discussion to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right hon. member does raise, as he usually does, 
interesting issues nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Chairman, the question is not 
whether the government believes that the provision reflects the 
agreement among the first ministers.  The question is whether the 
amendment presented by the New Democratic Party is one that is 
consistent with the rules of parliament.  It is on that question 
that I would like the hon. minister to consult the officials who 
are here on the floor of the House of Commons so that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  It is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  I am advised from his seat, by the 
minister, that this amendment is in order.   That means it 
would— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  I am afraid I have to 
interrupt since it is 1.59 p.m.

to statements by members and hear the point of order after

the hon. member one minute, which means 60 seconds, to make his 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  An amendment was introduced at the 
plenary stage that was deemed to be in order.  The Chair did not 
have the opportunity to call for a vote on that amendment.  The 
report was made before a vote had been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently the process was not completed, and through no ill 
will.  The House would certainly want to have the committee of 
the whole, in either committee of the whole forum or forum of the 
whole House, to be able to vote upon a motion properly put, 
accepted as being within the rules of parliament, and overlooked 
simply because of the fluctuation in time.

agreement prior to this time that the bill shall be reported,

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the time I presided over the debates of the House of

in Canada.  Even when they kept me home, I thought, well, there

the representatives of the people of Canada.  When they send us

would have preferred to leave unsaid, but we get through that one 
way or another.

approach you have taken has been very well noticed, remarked on

we know that from time to time most of us have tried to sneak a

On behalf of my colleagues I want to say that we appreciate your 
allowing us some latitude in speaking to this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been well understood and much appreciated by all the 
members of the House of Commons how much you love this place and 
what it means to you to preside over parliament.  No matter what 
our differences, it has been very much your view and the tone 
that you have set for debate in the Chamber that we are here as 
the representatives of Canadians to try to make Canada a better 
place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank you on behalf of my colleagues.  During this

the rules and traditions.  You were always helpful. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure I also speak on behalf of the five veteran members of 
the NDP caucus.  We appreciate the fact that you have always been 
fair.  From time to time, even though you have a very good ear 
and a very quick eye, you have overlooked the odd transgression, 
muttering under our breath words that might not be entirely in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party I extend our warmest good 
wishes and our heartfelt thanks for your generosity of spirit and 
for the role model you have been in terms of expressing the love 
for the Canada we are all here to work together to improve.

wonder if, as one of the newer members of the House, I might be 
permitted to extend my great appreciation to you for your service 
to the country and more particularly to the Chamber in a way that 
has enhanced the reputation of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have only served occasionally under your guidance as 
Speaker, I fondly recall the years in which we served together in 
the House before you took that post.  We tend to have a slightly 
different evaluation of the election in which your constituents 
kept you home.  You will not take this at all personally, but 
Sir, I rather wish there had been more of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House know that the office of Speaker is not an 
easy one.  This is a House that can often edge to the borders of 
being out of control.  It requires not only firmness in the chair 
but the kind of geniality in the chair you have demonstrated and 
the kind of respect that everyone in the House knows that you 
hold for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, Sir, that you are a hockey fan.  You have seen a little 
bit of high sticking here.  You have called a few misconducts or 
certainly a few offsides.  You have maintained the capacity to 
maintain the order and respect of the House and the respect for 
the rules and the game that make it essential. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I might add one thing, it is that part of your success as 
Speaker of this House is, I believe, because you are more than 
just an MP.  You are also a teacher, someone with a background in 
education.  I believe it has always been important to you to 
communicate to our fellow citizens the essence, the very nature, 
of this House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The skills you brought as a communicator, as a lover of the 
institutions of Canada, as someone who wanted to ensure that our 
institutions are well known in the country, have added to the 
high regard in which you are held by all members of the House. 
Thank you for your service et bon chance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just a few moments ago I was down the 
street at a coffee shop getting a cup of coffee.  The woman who 
was working there asked if I was upset that the government was 
making a weak attempt to steal the Canadian Alliance tax plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more profound question I was asked came from the gentleman 
who was working behind the till.  His question in this cynical 
attempt before an election to capture votes was “Does the 
government really think Canadians are this dumb?”  Will the 
Prime Minister please address that question? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we returned in September the first question raised 
in the House was about having a mini-budget.  They wanted the 
Minister of Finance to say what he would do with the great 
results he was having in terms of surpluses and so on.  We 
obliged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We told the Canadian people that because of the good management 
we have provided to the country over the last seven years there 
was some money available.  We were delighted to return some of it 
in the form of tax reductions and at the same time investments in 
education, research, medicare, and so on.  I am sure the people 
of Canada will recognize that they have been extremely well 
served in the last seven years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the Prime Minister would 
be willing to test that sense of confidence.  I know he has a 
busy schedule, but would he be willing to accompany me down to 
the coffee shop just a few blocks down and try that answer on the 
people who asked me the question?  Would you like to try that on 
with real Canadians?  Do you want to try that one on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask hon. members to direct their questions 
to the Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I might be visiting a lot of coffee shops in the next 
few weeks.  I am very confident.  We are going into an election 
and members of parliament on this side are inviting me, the 
Minister of Finance and other ministers of the government to 
visit their ridings.  We will visit a lot of coffee shops.  When 
we come back perhaps we will find the Leader of the Opposition in 
another coffee shop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the confidence of Canadians has been 
shaken by the most scathing auditor general's report possibly in 
our history, by the most scathing information commissioner's 
report possibly in our history talking about a government 
undermining democracy, and by one after another of RCMP 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be remembering a previous tax commitment where the 
Prime Minister said he would abolish, kill and eliminate the GST. 
How are these tiny tax cut commitments any different than the big 
commitment you made and that you have never—

<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition makes all sorts of 
accusations.  I just want to say that in public administration we 
always have some problems and we have to cure them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the wire a minute ago there was an item.  I just learned this 
morning that the company that owns and operates the Swan Hills 
waste treatment facility in Alberta announced that it would no 
longer operate the plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition is aware of this 
project as his former government subsidized it to the tune of 
$440 million, a figure confirmed by the auditor general. 
Apparently the word for a situation like that, I have a problem 
with this word in English, is boondoggle in Alberta.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, seeing that there are at least four police 
investigations in the Prime Minister's riding about misuse of 
funds, perhaps the Prime Minister should keep those kind of 
comments to himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to reality for a minute, the auditor general has 
graded the government's fiscal management.  The auditor general 
gave it an <I>f</I> for a grade.  In fact he said that they have 
placed little emphasis on the importance of maintaining financial 
controls.  Perhaps that is why its own budget estimates for last 
year were overspent by a few billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to open the floodgates even more on the 
spending.  Why should the voters of Canada give the Prime 
Minister another— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The right hon. Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have explained, and I repeat, that there are problems 
in public administration anywhere in Canada.  Sometimes even in 
the private sector they have problems and they have to correct 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the premier of Ontario admitted that all governments have 
administrative problems which need correcting.  As he put it, “I 
do not want to be casting stones at glass houses”.  It is a 
lesson for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I have to show the hon. Leader of the Opposition 
that it was only one project of $440 million that went belly-up. 
I do not say they made a mistake.  I just say that it is not a 
success.  They probably did it in good faith. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberals seem to think that there is a connection 
between massive spending and electoral success.  They are right. 
After seven years of boondoggle spending and widespread 
mismanagement, the Liberals will find the more they spend, the 
less they will succeed at the polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want their governments to manage their money carefully 
and the government has failed them.  Why should Canadians trust 
the government with more of their tax money when that trust has 
been so badly broken over the past seven years? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general has reported.  He said there were 
some problems and we admitted that there were problems.  The 
minister put in place a program of six points that he approved 
and said was working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing and a great compliment to the Minister of Finance 
that they do not dare ask a question on the budget.

the Minister of Finance's budget is a budget for the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those earning $250,000 and up a year will get tax breaks of 
$19,000, while those earning $35,000 will get only $550.  So much 
for compassion and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that the main purpose of his budget is 
to woo voters away from the Canadian Alliance, rather than to 
promote the supposed Liberal values he claims to espouse? 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bulk of the tax cuts in our statement yesterday are for Canadians 
earning under $60,000.  There is a fundamental difference between 
our budget and the Canadian Alliance's position, which would see 
most cuts going to those earning more than $60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commentators in Quebec, such as Alain Dubuc, and the great

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister has not read all the newspapers.  I also read that 
the money he has used to give big tax breaks to the rich is 
coming out of the EI fund.  This means that he has used the money 
he took from the pockets of unemployed workers to pay for tax 
breaks for the rich.  That is what has happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday's budget is a great victory for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we had surpluses is because of Canada's economic 
activity, which drove unemployment down from 11.5% to 6.8%. This 
was because of the creation of 360,000 new jobs this year. This 
was because of the efforts of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday's mini-budget neglected many: the victims of the major 
oil companies were left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, we learned that Imperial Oil has reported profits 
of $1 billion, in the first nine months of this year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Minister of Finance going to say to taxi drivers, 
who find nothing for them in the budget, to the truckers choking 
on the price of gasoline, to the farmers whose profits are 
disappearing into the pockets of the major oil companies?  What 
will he say to them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first off, when companies such as Imperial Oil, Esso, or any 
company earns profits, we take our share and return it to 
Canadians. That is one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we know full well that Mr. Landry, the Quebec minister, 
shares the opinion that there is no point in lowering the tax on 
gasoline, as it would disappear into the pockets of the oil 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we lowered personal income tax for the middle and 
low income groups and this is why we put $1.3 billion into the 
pockets of Canada's taxpayers, in order to help them with heating 
oil costs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the Minister of Finance claim that truckers, farmers and 
taxi drivers are going to benefit from lower personal income tax? 
They are penniless, in the red because of the price of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is he going to explain to taxi drivers, truckers and farmers 
that he has given the amount they should have had to Canada's 
richest taxpayers, by cutting the income tax of his millionaire

<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for early January, we gave $2 billion to low income Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP government in B.C., the NDP government in Saskatchewan

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, seven 
years later and there is not one ounce of leadership from the

elected because it promised a national plan for home care.  It 
did not promise corporate tax cuts for high rollers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Prime Minister.  Why did he choose tax 
breaks for high rollers and no breaks for Canadians struggling to 
take care of their loved ones, struggling to take care of the 
sick and the elderly in their own homes?

year a single parent with one child earning $25,000 will see the 
net federal tax benefit rise by $800 to $2,200.  The member only 
has to read what is in the budget. I would like to quote Roy 
Romanow, the premier of Saskatchewan, who said “This budget is 
headed in the proper direction and is in the best interests of 
Saskatchewan and Canadians”.  I could go on and on like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.  It relates to the secret 
deal at Downsview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will know that crown corporations established 
by this parliament are subject to the access to information law. 
Crown corporations established as Downsview was are not subject 
to the access to information law.  Is that the reason the Prime 
Minister set up Downsview in a way that has been criticized by 
the auditor general?  Did he set it up deliberately to avoid 
scrutiny by the access to information law? 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell the leader of the Conservative Party that 
this was done under a law passed by this parliament.  The Canada 
lands organization has been set by this government.  It has to 
produce an annual report to the House of Commons.  In the case of 
the Downsview land that belongs to national defence, all of it is 
reported through the estimates of the Minister of National 
Defence for the participation of the Department of National 
Defence.  The annual report will be tabled in due course in the 
House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister is talking about the Canada lands corporation 
which is required to report.  The Downsview corporation is not. 
It is protected by the way the government set it up.  The Prime 
Minister can change that.  He and the governor in council have 
the power under the access to information law to designate crown 
corporations that would be subject to the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple.  Will the Prime Minister right now today 
give us a commitment that he will later this day have an order in 
council processed that would make the Downsview corporation 
subject to the access to information law so these secrets will be 
in the public domain so the public will know what is going on? 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

audit, the board spent an average of $200,000 a year in travel, 
but last year that soared to almost $1 million.  That is on top 
of the airplane tickets that were paid out of another budget.

do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am having trouble understanding something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with the Minister of Finance's budget statement, 
the Chair accepted an amendment by the official opposition and an 
amendment to the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois.  Yet we have 
just had a vote without taking into consideration the debate on 
the amendment to the amendment and the debate on the amendment, 
which ought normally to have been adopted or rejected before a 
vote on the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why we are not voting today when the 
amendment and the amendment to the amendment were accepted and a 
day and one-half of debate on them was tolerated. We are voting 
on the main motion only, not the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the main motion was not open to amendment, the Chair ought 
not to have accepted amendments.  Since it did accept them, they 
ought to be voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker: </B>I am told that it is not the same vote.  The one 
the hon. member is referring to concerns Motion No. 13, under the 
rubric of government business, while the other concerns ways and 
means.  These are two totally different things and that is why 
we were able to proceed in this fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the information the Clerk has given me.  Perhaps if you 
come forward, the Clerk will be able to provide you with further 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, on this final day—we can 
forget about tomorrow, because the government will not be 
here—I would like to share our wisdom with 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under parliamentary law, how is it possible for us to vote on a 
ways and means motion to implement a budget statement which has 
not itself been approved, since the Chair has allowed an 
amendment to an amendment and an amendment from the official 
opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot vote on the implementation of something that has been 
officially amended, debated in the House and not voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to upset anyone, but you 
are going to have a serious legal problem if you allow everyone 
to leave like this and we do not vote on the amendment to the 
amendment, the amendment and the main motion. This poses a very 
serious legal problem.  Think twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter to me, but it is the government's budget and 
it should 
perhaps be looking after its own affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I have made my ruling.  We will see what happens.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ROBERT MARLEAU 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My apologies for taking so long 
in getting to the business of the House.  The business of the 
House right now is to pay tribute to one of our colleagues who 
has served parliament for some 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is here with us today in our gallery.  I refer to Robert 
“Bob” Marleau, Clerk of the House of Commons and Special 
Adviser to the Speaker.  He is here with his wife, Ann, his sons 
and his dear friends and colleagues who worked with him for so 
many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you permit me a few words to begin, I will 
call you Bob throughout this because we dropped the terms 
“Gilbert” and “Robert” a long time ago.  Almost from the 
beginning of my mandate as Speaker of the House, I did refer to 
Bob Marleau not as “the clerk” but as “my clerk”.  This 
possessive was used with the greatest respect to publicly 
indicate my complete trust and confidence in the man who was to 
be, for the next seven years, my closest and most trusted 
adviser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, Bob Marleau stepped down as Clerk of the House 
last July.  I did not then have the opportunity to stand before 
you, my colleagues, to thank him on your behalf for his many 
years of service to the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob has been a part of the House of Commons for 30 years, more 
than a generation: committee clerk, treasurer of the Canadian 
section of the Association internationale des parlementaires de 
langue française, principal clerk, committees and legislation, 
clerk assistant and, in 1983, Clerk of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much knowledge and experience and all of it available to the 
clerks at the table, the members of the House and the Chair.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Bob has been a key member of the Canadian Study of 
Parliament group, a member of the Association of 
Clerks-at-the-Table in Canada, a founding member of the 
Association des secrétaires généraux des parlements membres de 
l'AIPLF, and is frequently consulted for his parliamentary 
expertise by his colleagues in other parliaments around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob, I thank you for many things, for your wisdom, your 
judgment, your discretion, your humour, your golf game, even your 
scolding because even Speakers need straightening out once in a 
while and few people are brave enough to take on the task.  In 
your time on the Hill you have in your own quiet way greatly 
influenced those around you.  The members of Parliament and the 
House of Commons, be they security guards, maintenance staff or 
procedural clerks, all hold you in the highest esteem and speak 
of you with genuine fondness.  Not many people are so well 
respected. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am relieved to know that you will remain with me a few months 
longer as special adviser.  I know that your wife Ann and your 
sons Kristian and Stéphane will enjoy having you around more 
once you finally leave parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Try to use some of that extra time to improve your golf, but not 
too much. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob, I thank you on behalf of all the members and staff for your 
years of service to the House of Commons and by extension to 
parliament and the people of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who served alongside you, whether in the Chamber or 
within the parliamentary precinct, will not soon forget your 
contribution to this country, both here and abroad.  Both 
yourself and Camille Montpetit, who is with you today, and 
others, are responsible for a book of rules that we will be using 
in this parliament, if it follows practice, for the next 40 or 50 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the things that I have said to you, Bob, I think in my 
heart the most important thing that I treasure is your friendship 
and your unflagging loyalty to this institution.  Whenever I lost 
sight, you were always there to point out that there are other 
ways to look at things, which were better than the ones I was 
looking at at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So thank you, my friend, for what you have done for me 
personally, for these members, for the House of Commons of 
Canada.  You are a great asset to the House.  Thank you, Bob.

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I 
join you and all our colleagues today in paying tribute to a 
remarkable man who has had an equally remarkable career here, in 
parliament, Robert Marleau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first met him, he was a young man from Cornwall, in the 
riding of Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, represented by the 
chief government whip. I remember this ambitious young man from 
eastern Ontario who was just beginning his career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself had just arrived here, in the parliamentary restaurant, 
as I often say. As for Mr. Marleau, he was starting out with the 
committees. At the time, his hair was not as grey. As for me, I 
still had some. This was the beginning of a brilliant career 
that lasted over 30 years and culminated with his appointment to 
the position of Clerk of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout his career, Robert Marleau has displayed 
extraordinary professionalism and professional ethics, which he 
has been able to pass on to his colleagues and successors. It 
was great to work with Robert Marleau over the years. While we 
were somewhat surprised to learn that he was retiring, something 
which no one wanted him to do, he definitely deserves it. I 
would like to wish Mr. Marleau—Robert, if I may call him that—all 
the best and offer him my heartfelt congratulations on a 
brilliant and successful career.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit jealous that some people will miss Mr. Marleau's golf 
game because I know no one will ever miss mine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure also to rise to pay tribute to 
someone who was the first man that I met when I was elected here 
in 1993.  He helped me sign in.  In that parliament, you will 
remember, Mr. Speaker, there were over 200 new people.  We did 
not know where our seats were, we did not know how to sign and we 
did not know anything.  Bob Marleau helped us to do that and 
helped us to do much more as we learned the rules and learned the 
ropes here in the House of Commons and I think learned to respect 
the House of Commons in part because he respected this place so 
much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think too of the procedural book that he co-authored with Mr. 
Montpetit.  I turned to it today.  I thought that I would look in 
it to see what it is that the clerk is supposed to do.  There are 
three full pages of work and duties of the Clerk of the House of 
Commons.  I switched right away over to the House leaders and 
there is one line in there about the House leaders.  Therefore, 
there is more work to be done on the procedural book yet, I am 
sure.  That procedure book I think will become a standard not 
only here in the House of Commons but increasingly as democracies 
around the world look to Canada and look to this House of 
Commons.  They will pick up the book co-authored by Mr. Marleau 
and say this is a way that democracy can be enhanced and be 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think overall that the biggest tribute perhaps to Mr. Marleau 
is that although all members of the House of Commons are equal, 
we all know that while that is traditionally true many members in 
the House have much more power than others.  That is just a fact. 
Some are far more aggressive than others.  Some are far more 
demanding than others.  However, through it all I have never seen 
Mr. Marleau blink as far as being absolutely fair, absolutely 
impartial, absolutely act with dignity and absolutely bring grace 
and sort of a calmness to this place in everything he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, if I could, I think Bob would permit me to talk about our 
coffee together that we had just by coincidence the other morning 
in the cafeteria.  I asked him “What are you going to do when 
you retire”, because he has not really retired yet; he is 
heading that way.  He mentioned a few things that he had on his 
mind but even in retirement the things that he is considering 
have to do with helping charities, helping developing countries, 
helping people in need, helping out Canadian organizations and 
lending the organizational expertise that we have come to admire 
so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it is a great tribute to the man.  The organizations 
will be lucky people and we have been very fortunate to have him 
in our midst. Thank you, Bob. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House to add my words to those of my 
colleagues who have spoken before me, all of them reflecting, I 
believe, what we all feel toward Mr. Marleau, who has left us, 
or will soon be doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to say, in order to be fair to Mr. 
Marleau and Mr. Montpetit, who were directly attacked a few 
moments ago, that I feel otherwise: the work they have produced 
shows the full importance of the chief whip in that there is 
more reference to that position than to that of the House 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that position may not have all the visibility and all the 
deference owing to it, at least in the joint work of Mr. Marleau 
and Mr. Montpetit we see the full importance, the full essence 
of the position of chief whip of the various parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joking aside, I wish to express here the great admiration I 
personally and my fellow Bloc Quebecois members have for the 
work that has been done by Mr. Marleau, not just as Clerk of the 
House of Commons, because the Speaker also mentioned his long 
parliamentary career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started here in 1969 as clerk of committee.  He then joined 
the parliamentary relations secretariat.  He served as 
principal clerk, director of committees and private legislation, 
clerk assistant and, finally, in 1987, was appointed Clerk of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He therefore has very broad experience, which he has shared with 
all of us here in the House. 
We are all indebted to him for his contribution to this Chamber, 
for what he has done for us individually and as a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the Speaker was saying that he will soon be leaving the 
House of Commons. On that score, I can say that he will never 
really leave it, that there will always be a seat for him here, 
because we have unanimously agreed to reserve for him the 
distinction of honorary clerk of the House of Commons.  He will 
thus be able to join us and take part in the work of the House 
when the mood strikes him. I invite him to do so as often as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is particularly sad is knowing that this House will lose a 
part of its corporate memory.  There is no denying that there 
have been a number of inroads on that memory in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to Mr. Marleau, some very capable individuals have 
left us. 
There is Mary Anne Griffith, Camille Montpetit and Diane 
Davidson, who, through a chance administrative reorganization, 
has moved on to the Department of Justice and is now with the 
Chief Electoral Officer.  She also shared with us her vast 
experience and considerable professionalism, as did Ms. Griffith 
and Mr. Montpetit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have much of our corporate memory leaving us, and we 
will have to make up for this loss one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that I myself and my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois 
have given Mr. Marleau, young retiree that he is, a few white 
hairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, since 1987, although the Bloc Quebecois was not 
around then, Mr. Marleau has weathered some rather stormy 
situations. However, being a fine helmsman, he always maintained 
a steady course and captained his ship exceptionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we in fact did give him a few white hairs on occasion, I must 
say right off that it was not our intention and that we had the 
highest respect for his person, his duties and his contribution 
to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People move on and the institution remains, I think.  However, 
the memory of these people remains and does so for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for your contribution to the House of Commons.  I 
think your presence here and your contribution will long remain 
within these walls.  Thank you very much and congratulations. May 
your well deserved retirement be a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend, the House leader of the official opposition put 
it, I know full well that you are retiring, but you are not 
retiring, because you have also told me what you plan to do in 
your retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish you good luck.  I have not had the good fortune to 
golf with you, but you have had the good fortune not to golf with 
me. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today seems to be the time for goodbyes and of course those who 
have the good fortune to choose the time of their retirement or 
resignation have the blessing of an opportunity for colleagues to 
express themselves about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that there are at least some in this place who will 
not have that opportunity.  They will just go reluctantly into that 
good night on November 27.  I say to Mr. Marleau that I am 
glad we have had this opportunity before parliament ended.  He 
resigned in the summer and we did not have a chance to do this. 
I was certainly anxious that we would have an opportunity to put 
our thoughts on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One always feels a bit more melancholy about people retiring 
when they are kind of close to your age and when one has been 
here almost as long as they were. 
I feel almost that this clerk is someone of my own generation. 
Certainly we have served in the House together for 21 and 
a half years.  He has been a part of our collective lives here, 
part of my life here, and certainly part of that life I will 
always recall with great affection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated his sense of humour.  I appreciated the care he 
often demonstrated for this institution and the integrity with 
which he carried out his duties.  I appreciated the work he and 
Mr. Montpetit did to put together the procedural book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope against hope he will not write a memoir, gathering 
together the most eccentric behaviour he witnessed on the part of 
members of parliament over the 30 years.  However it might be a 
best seller, one never knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will write a book on parliamentary reform.  I notice 
he has already authored an article or two in some journals about 
this.  Free of the constraints of the Table, and I say this with 
all due appreciation for the Chair and the Table, he might be 
able to offer us even better advice on how we might improve this 
place than he was able to do as Clerk of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Report stage is just what I had written 
down here.  Maybe that was the reason he retired; he could not 
face another marathon vote.  In his retirement, if he could crack 
that nut for us, that would be a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clerk is obviously a party to many of the rulings.  You also 
are leaving, Mr. Speaker.  I will tell both of you, given that 
you probably conspired together on this, that only once did I 
profoundly disagree with both of you.  That was with respect to 
the treatment of independent members and the whole question of 
party status in the previous parliament.  Even though I did not 
agree with you, I never once doubted that you were acting as you 
saw best and out of a sense of integrity and commitment to your 
own view of what was appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish Bob and the members of his family, who have much to be 
proud of, all the best in the future.  Future clerks, including 
our new clerk, have big shoes to fill.  Bob has left a legacy of 
service we will always cherish.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is also a great pleasure for me, a young member of 
parliament, to join my colleagues in paying tribute to Mr. 
Marleau. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was perhaps one of the first people I met when I arrived 
here, completely confused and overwhelmed by the tasks that lay 
before me.  Parliament and parliamentary procedure can sometimes 
be described as navigating an incredible labyrinth and untying a 
Gordian knot at the same time.  Mr. Marleau was very quick to 
come forward and offer advice and calm support.  He was always 
very deliberate and supportive any time I had the pleasure to 
meet with him or request assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Marleau offered that help on a very non-partisan level, as 
has been alluded to.  There was never a nod or a wink or any 
indication that any member of any party of the House, regardless 
of title or personal connection, received anything other than an 
impartial and straightforward word of advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Marleau has also distinguished himself as an author.  He has 
made a very lasting contribution to this place through his 
writings.  He and his co-author, Mr. Montpetit, have left with us 
a legacy that will serve this parliament and perhaps all 
parliaments in the land for many years to come.  The House of 
Commons will no doubt miss his wisdom and his steady hand, but 
through his writings he will be with us for many years to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would describe Mr. Marleau as the consummate impeccable, 
professional clerk.  His approach as viewed from a distance was 
always very steadying in its influence on this place.  Most would 
be quick to agree that sometimes this place borders on the 
raucous and out of control atmosphere we have come to accept. 
Through it all Mr. Marleau was there, very much at the wheel, 
very much guiding us through the important work done in this 
Chamber.  The old adage that quiet, calm deliberation 
disentangles any knot comes to mind when I think of Mr. Marleau 
and his stewardship in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his years of public service to the House of Commons we are 
very thankful.  As well, we must pay tribute to those who were 
with him at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to mix the tributes, but it has been my distinct 
pleasure to have been in a parliament over which you have 
presided, Mr. Speaker.  I have had the honour to work with Mr. 
Marleau.  I hope it will serve me regardless of what happens in 
the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal level, it has been my great honour to say that I 
know the man.  I admire the diligence and patience he has shown 
with new House members, including me, and with the many others 
who have expressed an interest in our parliamentary procedure.  I 
believe he went above and beyond his service and the strict 
professional definition of clerk when it came to inquiries from 
outside this parliamentary precinct.  He was always there, and 
for that we can be very thankful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know his family is present.  His family was always near, 
always close to him.  I remember being in his office and hearing 
him speak with beaming pride of his sons.  He also has great love 
for and admiration of his wife and her support.  I wish Bob, his 
wife Ann, their two sons and their whole family many years of 
happy retirement.  I certainly hope we will cross paths again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am hosting a reception in honour of Bob, 
his wife and his two sons in my chambers, 220 North.  I invite 
all of you to join me.  We can continue this conversation there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob, on behalf of all of us here we thank you for your great 
service to the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know what the business will be for the rest of 
the day, for tomorrow and for the weeks to come.  The government 
made a lot important claims.  It claimed it wanted to change 
financial administration.  It claimed it wanted changes to 
immigration and citizenship.  It claimed it wanted to change the 
Young Offenders Act.  It claimed a lot of things that are not 
getting done.

with the business question, which I will do.

believe, since the last election.  Perhaps there will be more to 
come in the next few days and weeks.  Who knows?  We succeeded in 
having parliament function well, given the five party system and 
so on, largely because of the excellent work and leadership 
provided by the people I have just named.  I thank them for their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  I take the point the government 
House leader makes that the so-called pizza parliament has worked 
out better.  I would not say it went from being a pizza 
parliament to a peaceful parliament but somewhere in between the 
dire predictions that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the business of the House for this week continues 
unabated.  I wonder if the House leader could explain to me why 
there were no Liberals present a few minutes ago when the auditor 
general appeared before the public accounts committee, which 
meant that the auditor general, who has made a report that 
everyone is interested in, could not be questioned by opposition 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me this has to do with government business.  It has 
to do with a matter of parliamentary business.  It is very 
shameful that no government members were there and the committee 
could not meet.  Perhaps the government House leader could 
explain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is difficult for 
me, as a relatively junior member compared with the hon. member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona, to intervene in this regard.  However, I 
am aware of the fact that committees are creatures of their own 
invention.  I do not know it is appropriate that this is part of 
the Thursday question or a point of order associated with the 
Thursday question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government House leader would care to respond I am sure 
there would be no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would seem to me that 
only God is a creature of his own invention.  Committees are 
creatures of the House, and therefore somebody has to be 
answerable when the government is behaving in this very peculiar 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Perhaps the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 5 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-44, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question?   Are hon. members rising on debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On debate, the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I appreciate that you had already started to put the 
question and that you are now recognizing an hon. member.  That 
is fine.  I am sure we are all accommodating in order to allow 
enough time for people to come into the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I wonder if, for the benefit of Canadians 
receiving the funds for which they will be eligible under Bill 
C-44, the House would agree that at 5.30 p.m. the bill will be 
passed in second reading, be deemed to have been passed in 
committee of the whole, read the third time and referred to the 
Senate for its consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the hon. 
government House leader have unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If I could just have the indulgence of the Chamber to go back to 
the point of order raised by my friend and colleague from 
Winnipeg—Transcona, because it is through our office and the 
government whip's office that we co-ordinate committee work, 
attendance, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just had the benefit of speaking to some of my staff, and 
we in fact had people who were going to the meeting.  My 
understanding is that regrettably there was a change in the 
location of the meeting, and while they were in transit or 
getting from one place to another, the meeting was adjourned.  I 
can understand that, but believe me there was no intention on the 
part of the government members to avoid attending that meeting. 
It is regrettable that it did happen, but there was certainly no 
intention at any time to avoid that meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That point is now 
finished.  We have had the question and an explanation.  If we 
want to do more, we can do it behind the curtains.  We are now 
going to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to inform the House that the public accounts 
committee waited for over 20 minutes and nobody showed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That was not a new 
point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rose on a point of order, not 
to continue the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply wanted to tell the Chair that some speakers were 
scheduled to speak and that we should not proceed with the vote 
immediately. This is what I wanted to point out. But since you

in this fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today it is indeed a pleasure to 
speak to Bill C-44, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the events of the last couple of weeks, I must say that 
those of us on this side watching the actions of the government 
are deeply disappointed in its failure to truly address 
unemployment in the country in a meaningful fashion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was truly interested in a long term, effective 
plan to deal with the underpinnings of unemployment and 
underemployment in our country today, it would have had a more 
thoughtful approach rather than suddenly trying to pull out a 
mini-budget because the official opposition has decided to put 
forth a thoughtful way of lowering taxes and improving the 
economy.  Instead the government has chosen, in a haphazard 
fashion, to merely lift many of the things from our platform and 
say to the public that after this election it will implement 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is, the public is going to see through 
this.  If the government truly wanted to get people off EI rolls, 
to get people off welfare, to improve the lives of people who are 
underemployed in our country and to improve the lack of 
competitiveness in our nation, then it would address such things 
as how we are going to improve our education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should pull the first ministers together and ask 
how we can have national standards for education in this country 
today, how we can have public and private partnerships on 
improving the education system so that our young people will be 
able to learn the skills necessary in the real world, in real 
time, in order to be able to be employed in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should ask how we can start addressing the 
interprovincial trade barriers which, I might add, are greater 
east-west than they are north-south.  Is it not remarkable that 
there are more barriers to trade between my province of British 
Columbia and the province of Ontario than there are between 
British Columbia and Washington state?  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was truly interested in improving the economy 
of this country, it would have sat down with the first ministers 
and said “We are going to lock ourselves in this room.  We are 
will sit in front of this table and come to an agreement that is 
going to remove the egregious rules and regulations that have 
been choking off the private sector in this country for far too 
long”.  That is what the government should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only should the government have been looking at lowering the 
tax rates and taking a leaf out of our book, a little leaf, it 
should have taken a large chunk of our book instead of only 
asking how it could lower personal taxes and business taxes.  I 
compliment the government on the fact that this has been done to 
some extent in this budget, but it should have been done a few 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should also be dealing with ways of equilibrating 
the tax structure between high tech and manufacturing companies. 
High tech companies pay a higher taxes than those in 
manufacturing.  Why is that so?  There is not even any discussion 
about it, but there is no lack of ideas, not only within the 
House but also more importantly outside the House, from people 
across the country, people in business, in the public and in 
academia.  Many of them have brilliant ideas on what we can do to 
improve our economy and the health and welfare of Canadians, 
which they have offered to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an illusion going around that has been stuck in the 
House for far too long, which is that somehow if one is into 
lowering taxes, improving the economy and being fiscally 
responsible, one is being socially irresponsible.  The illusion 
is that lowering taxes will somehow harm the poor and the middle 
class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that whether we are looking at 
northern Europe, Sweden, Ireland, the British Isles, the U.S. or 
southeast Asia, those countries that have taken it upon 
themselves to lower taxes, rules and regulations and make labour 
laws more flexible have improved dramatically.  The health and 
welfare of the people, particularly of those who were the most 
impoverished in our society, has improved.  Just as important, it 
has given us the money to pay for the social programs that we 
have come to rely on so much and that are so important in helping 
those who cannot help themselves in time of need, be it with 
health care, education, pensions or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government should be looking at, for to be 
fiscally responsible is to be socially responsible.  They are two 
halves of the same whole.  If one is fiscally irresponsible, as 
some NDP governments have been in the past, particularly in my 
province of British Columbia, that fiscal irresponsibility of 
spending more than is taken in, of spending the taxpayers' money 
unwisely, crushes our ability to pay for our social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician, I work in a hospital where it takes three and a 
half years just to see an orthopedic surgeon, where I cannot find 
a pillow in my emergency department for somebody with congestive 
heart failure.  The reason that is so, the reason we do not have 
nurses for our emergency departments and hospital beds, is that 
there is not enough money in the system.  There is not enough 
money in the system because our economy has not expanded so that 
we can tax that money wisely and fairly and have it available to 
pay for those programs that we are endeared to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also not taking into consideration a brick wall that we 
will slam into.  A lot of people will be hurt.  That brick wall 
is our demographics.  In the next 20 years our population over 
the age of 65 will double.  As our population ages so too do our 
demands increase on programs such as pensions, health care and 
other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there is no debate.  There is only deafening silence on what 
we should be doing to prepare for the future and to deal with our 
needs in health care and the demographic changes that are going 
to be imposed upon our pension system.  How will we do this?  If 
we do not, those who are going to be hurt are seniors, fixed 
income people and those who will live lives of quiet desperation 
unless we deal with the problems now.  We cannot manufacture 
these solutions overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed for a long time that the Government of Canada, 
the Liberal Party in this case, take upon itself to deal with 
these problems now.  We will work with them, as we will with the 
public, to bring forth effective solutions to deal with that 
demographic bubble that will hit our social programs with full 
force, causing them to crumble and causing the most vulnerable in 
our society to be hurt.  This is something the government has 
failed to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I would 
like some clarification. Are we not supposed to be talking about 
Bill C-44 on the employment insurance reform? Is this not the 
issue that we should be discussing? If so, could you tell me and 
our viewers about the relevance of the hon. member's presentation 
on demographics and health problems? I suppose that people are 
more likely to get sick if they cannot get employment insurance 
benefits, but I am trying to see how this is relevant to today's 
topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Chair indicate whether we are indeed dealing with 
the Employment Insurance Act? If so, could the Chair call on the 
hon. member to share his views and those of his party on the 
appropriateness of the changes that are being considered and 
indicate if his party wants more changes or less changes? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I was amazed to hear 
the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok refer to himself 
as my humble servant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he is quite right that this is Bill C-44 and I was 
remiss, because we have been going a little astray from 
relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca would care to be a 
touch more relevant or to at least touch base every once in a 
while, it would be deeply appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for being a foil to this speech because he has just come into the 
most exciting part of the speech, linking EI premiums and what 
the government has done by removing, for the member's 
information, $100 billion in EI premiums from the taxpayer, from 
hardworking people.  Our party has said for years that the 
government should be lowering those premiums because in effect 
they are using the EI premiums as a tax on business.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hon. member's riding in the province of Quebec I am sure 
many of his business colleagues are telling him that the EI 
premiums are too high, that the government has been taxing them 
through EI premiums, pocketing the money and spending it as it 
sees fit.  It is not on the basis of need and not on the basis of 
putting people back to work, but saying to the public “We can 
live with EI. EI is an important program”.  What the government 
is not telling the public is that it is using $100 billion of 
that money as a form of tax.  Under those circumstances it hurts 
the business people who would love to have money to reinvest in 
their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many small and medium size businesses, and most small businesses 
have fewer than five employees, have said to many of us that if 
they had more money, they could hire more people.  If they had 
more money they could reinvest in their business and be more 
competitive, but the government is taking all that money from 
them through payroll taxes and EI is one of those payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point on my hon. colleague's excellent question is that the 
EI premiums are too high. That is the bottom line.  They are far 
too high.  Rather than being a help to the unemployed the EI 
premiums are a hindrance to the unemployed and the underemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have done for some seven years, we beg and implore that 
the government lower the EI premium to make it far more 
reasonable.  If the government wants to know by how much it can 
ask us because we have been asking for a substantial reduction 
for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to make concerns people such as single 
mothers and people on welfare who would like to return to the 
workforce. They are actually penalized for trying to return to 
the workforce.  We should reward those people who want to get the 
skills.  Through the EI program, and in working with the 
provinces on welfare, we should make sure that money will be 
there to help them get a leg up.  We should support them when 
they say they want to learn the skills to get back into the 
workforce but that they need daycare for their children.  That is 
something we could do.  We could help them by providing the 
resources so that in the long term they will get the skills 
necessary to return to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently those people who try to return to the workforce, who 
are perhaps single moms, who are on welfare, who are in difficult 
circumstances find it very difficult to return. The system 
penalizes those who try to help themselves.  Unfortunately many 
of them say it is not worth their while to get off welfare, that 
it is worth their while to stay on it, but they do not want to. 
The government should look at reasonable ways to reform the EI 
system rather than tinker around the edges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a point of criticizing us on the issue 
of seasonal workers.  It believes that raising the EI amounts 
that can be earned is somehow beneficial in some cases or that 
lowering the bar on how much one has to work is somehow 
beneficial.  I wonder how often the government asks those 
seasonal workers, be they in the maritimes or elsewhere, whether 
they want to be seasonal workers or whether they want to work 
full time.  I have never met a seasonal worker who did not want 
to work full time.  I would venture to say that virtually all of 
the people the government spoke to would say that they want to 
work full time, that they want to work all year long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not use the taxpayers' money wisely to 
provide people with the skills necessary to be employed all year 
long, and not just 10 weeks or 12 weeks a year but all year long? 
In my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca many people in the 
fishery have been displaced. Instead of providing moneys to 
enable these people to be employed and to learn other skills, 
much money has gone into wasted programs that have not enabled 
them to be employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, as there could be on the east coast, there are great 
opportunities in aquaculture if they are done properly.  If we 
look at how the Norwegians and the Chileans do aquaculture and 
not how the Indonesians have done it, it would provide people who 
have been displaced by the changes in commercial fishing with 
jobs in areas similar to what they did before.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that as a country we can get back in aquaculture 
what we had before.  We can take the initiative so it is a 
vibrant, sustainable and environmentally safe practice and that 
many people in the fishery rather than hanging on by their 
fingernails will be employed all year long in a different type of 
fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the innovations we need to explore.  We do not see 
very much of that coming from the government and I would say 
mostly from the Prime Minister's office.  I know some of the 
backbench MPs have tried to give the ministers at the front good 
suggestions and we have as well but they have not listened. That 
speaks to the fact that we do not live in a democracy. The single 
greatest problem, the reason our EI system and so many other 
things have not been fixed is that we do not live in a democracy. 
We live in a four year dictatorship.  The public has a chance to 
vote only once every four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>   The member across the way who is 
saying rubbish should bite her tongue.  She knows full well that 
the Prime Minister does what he wants.  This country is ruled by 
12 people.  It is not ruled by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Example number one is Mount Logan.  The Prime Minister decided 
to rename Mount Logan, so there it goes.  The Prime Minister 
decided to use HRD as his own little basket of Santa Claus 
goodies.  This is the situation.  In spite of the fact that good 
suggestions have come from all members across party lines, the 
system is controlled by the Prime Minister's office and a couple 
of cabinet ministers.  Most of cabinet does not have much of a 
say in what goes on in the country, sadly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a tragedy that we do not have a system that allows members 
to do what the public, their constituents, the people who voted 
for them want them to do.  The central problem in Canada today, 
despite the importance of health care, EI, pensions and 
education, is that we do not live in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing we need to do and I hope the public holds all 
our feet to the fire on it.  We need to ensure that the House 
becomes a democracy again and that individual members of 
parliament are beholden to the public who elected them and not 
the leader of their party. We need to ensure that individual 
members of parliament can vote freely in the House.  They should 
not be subjected to the ruthless and brutal tyranny of leaders in 
the House who use their power as a carrot and stick approach to 
reward or punish MPs who do not do their bidding as opposed to 
the bidding of the public who elected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the central problem in our country today.  If we 
liberated this House, all other problems could be solved. We 
would be able to get ideas from the public and bring them to bear 
on the House in a meaningful fashion.  It would involve 
liberating the committees so that the committee structure would 
be relevant, so that we could have free votes in the committees, 
so that parliamentary secretaries could be removed from 
committees, so that there is input on government bills, be it the 
EI bill or others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-44 should have been sent in a draft form to the relevant 
committee.  Then the committee and the public would have had 
effective input on the bill. That is what is done in Britain and 
in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to liberate committees, hard earned and innovative 
ideas put forth by the public would be listened to.  This could 
happen if bills came forward from the ministry in draft form and 
we removed the parliamentary secretaries from those committees, 
cutting the umbilical cord to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need free votes in the House.  We need fixed election dates 
so that the Prime Minister cannot unilaterally decide to call an 
election, not because it is better for the Canadian public but 
for his own political gain. That is why the election will be 
called on Sunday.  It will be called for the government's 
political gain, not because there is an effective plan or reason 
for calling it. The public is a lot smarter than we are. They are 
going to wonder why an election has been called.  They are going 
to ask tough questions of all of us so we had better have 
answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the bill presents a great opportunity to articulate 
some of the great problems this country has.  There is the lack 
of democracy.  We need to be more competitive as an economy.  We 
need to lower taxes.  We need to remove useless rules and 
regulations.  We need to increase interprovincial trade and 
remove the barriers to trade.  We need to make our labour laws 
more flexible.  We need to invest in our education system and 
ensure that we have an effective student loans system so that 
students across the socioeconomic strata get the education they 
want.  We need to save our health care system not only by 
investing in it but by restructuring it to address the 
demographic changes that are going to hit us smack in the face. 
We need to ensure that the CPP is sustainable because that too 
is going to be unsustainable given the demographic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many challenges, but we are lucky that this country 
has a great deal of talent.  We only need to use it and 
this place will finally become a place that will work for the 
people and by the people rather than for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
I wonder if there would be unanimous consent for the following 
order: That at 5:30 p.m. this day, Bill C-44 shall be deemed to 
have been read a second time, referred to a committee of the 
whole and reported to the House without amendment, concurred in 
at the report stage, read a third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent for the hon. member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore to present 
the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier 
(Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have heard my colleague from the Canadian 
Alliance speak to Bill C-44 on employment insurance.  I have 
two questions for him. He himself has said that we are likely 
headed for an election call this weekend.  I trust that there 
will be an Alliance candidate in my riding of 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok.  It appears that 
2,800 new members of that party have been turned up in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore imagine that there will be a candidate and I 
would like that candidate to find out from someone involved in 
the leadership race where they found these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Under tombstones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> I would really like to meet one member of 
their party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the seasonal workers I would like the hon. member to 
gives us a clear and precise commitment on, if his 
party were to form government, 
the fisheries problem in eastern Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In January he sea is iced over.  We cannot fish, the same 
way that we cannot pick strawberries, and, in the lower St. 
Lawrence, we cannot harvest peat either.  This then is what raw 
material harvesting is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the members of the Alliance Party agree with the 
definition of seasonal work which 
follows the course of nature?  If biological rhythms require it 
to take place over a period of 10 weeks as, for example, in the 
case of lobster fishing, are they prepared to guarantee they 
will give lobster fishers employment insurance, unemployment 
insurance, since they need to eat 52 weeks a year?  I would like 
a clear answer on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would invite the candidate and member present to 
explain why he said in his speech that aquaculture should not be 
developed.  Some things could be done in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come from the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. 
We travelled last spring to the west coast of Canada, and I 
came to realize that a number of Reform members of the committee 
more or less supported the development of aquaculture along the 
west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the members of the Alliance to tell me in no 
uncertain terms if they are in favour of the development of 
aquaculture and would take fiscal action to develop this 
industry, instead of simply making empty promises, because it 
takes more than prayers.  I await their response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two questions here.  The first one deals with seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see the community we have in my province of 
British Columbia and la belle province du Quebec.  We too have 
seasonal workers.  We will always have seasonal workers, but 
there is one thing we can do.  Some people who do not have full 
time work develop other skills that enable them to do not only 
their primary work but other jobs as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one place where EI has failed.  It can be using that 
money to ensure people have other skills they could perhaps use 
when the waters are frozen.  Many people have more than one skill 
that enables them to do more than one job.  This is an area of 
innovation that the government ought to be looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of aquaculture, we can use models which would work 
from Norway and Chile.  Norway and Chile were actually quite far 
behind us in terms of our aquaculture capability.  However what 
has happened, because of a lack of innovation and the inability 
of companies to have money to invest, is that both Norway and 
Chile have acquired the innovation to take aquaculture far 
forward.  It is quite a booming industry for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to learn from that, learn how it works well there, and 
employ it in areas such as the east coast and on the west coast. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, I will try 
to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is unfortunate that today, while we could have voted 
unanimously on Bill C-44—although I do not think the bill goes 
far enough—to ensure that people benefit from the amendments to 
the Employment Insurance Act, the Canadian Alliance voted 
against.  It blocked a unanimous vote in the House of Commons. 
I want this to be duly noted for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Canadian Alliance member. 
I would like him to rise in this House and tell Canadians once 
and for all what his leader's position is when he says, in 
Windsor, Ontario, that he is going to cut EI in the west, but 
when he visits Acadie—Bathurst, he says that he is going to save 
EI and that he is in agreement with people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to rise in his place today and finally tell us 
the truth.  Where is his leader headed exactly?  He says one 
thing out west and another down east.  Their intention is really 
to cut EI.  That is what the leader of the Canadian Alliance has 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Canadian Alliance member to finally tell 
Canadians the truth and stop trying to hedge his bets in 
anticipation of an election.  They cannot have it both ways.  It 
is abundantly clear that, in the west, he said that he was going to 
cut EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the Canadian Alliance member indicated that in some 
areas EI was not required because jobs needed to be created.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in my riding the Canadian Alliance leader said “We 
will save the employment insurance program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Canadian Alliance candidate is listening to my speech 
this evening and that he will clearly understand what the 
Canadian Alliance is all about. It is a party that is against 
Atlantic Canada because it supports cuts to subsidies, to ACOA, 
to employment insurance. It is an anti-Atlantic party. Just that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is news coming out of the 
other place that I  think I should share with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the leaders of both parties in the other House have 
indicated as recently as about five minutes ago that if this 
House was disposed to send Bill C-44 to them this afternoon 
before we adjourn, they will commit themselves to pass the bill 
before the end of the day tomorrow.  That has just come to our 
attention now and it comes from the leaders in both parties in 
the other place.  Having knowledge of that now, which I want to 
share with the House, I want to know if the House would now be 
favourably disposed to adopting that which was suggested a little 
while ago, and I have a copy of it here.  I will try it again, 
because this is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to hon. members, if they will just take a moment to 
hear it, that they might have thought that by passing this bill 
it would die on the order paper or not go anywhere.  But this 
information is verifiable.  It is in the <I>Hansard</I> of the 
other House and the hon. Senators I understand are prepared to 
repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having that information, I would now seek permission of the 
House to propose this motion without debate.  I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at 5.30 p.m. this day, Bill C-44 shall be deemed to have 
been read a second time, referred to a committee of the whole and 
reported to the House without amendment, concurred in at report 
stage, read a third time and passed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. government House leader 
have the unanimous consent of the House to propose this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is 
sad that the Liberal government, which knew that it had made a 
mistake over the past four years, did not deal with this bill 
last spring and did not ensure its passage, instead of coming up 
with Bill C-44 at the very last minute, ensuring that it will not 
be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will have to go through another harsh winter and it is 
the government's fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not think this is a point of order, 
but  part of the debate. We cannot have a debate on a point of 
order. We are in a debate right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst asked a question to the 
hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. I believe we should hear 
the reply to that question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In reference to the House leader's recent pronouncement 
to the House, we are pleased to hear that the other place is 
predisposed to acting quickly on the bill that he mentioned.  We 
are glad to hear that.  We do not have an official call yet of 
any election.  If this was to follow its normal course of 
business, the House would be able to deal with it normally and it 
would proceed into the other place.  It is reassuring to hear 
that they would deal with it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point, we are quite open to dealing with that bill in 
the normal fashion next week if he should wish to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I don't think the hon. member has 
raised a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just remind my hon. 
colleague that the reason we are in favour of EI is because EI is 
a program for temporary, unexpected job loss.  That is what EI is 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Give us a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I draw attention to what 
my colleague said.  He should understand this because he is 
dealing with some people who are quite impoverished.  Under Bill 
C-44, people who are making between $48,000 and $115,000 a year 
can still collect EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Why not?  Because what is happening is 
that the government is getting money from all workers, from 
people who are making $25,000 and people who are making $125,000 
a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think it is fair to give EI benefits to somebody 
making $48,000 a year, $60,000 a year or $100,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are in favour of is for those people who have 
unexpected, unavoidable job loss that this EI program provide 
income supplementation so that they can be taken care of when 
they are unemployed until such time as they can get their job 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to any colleague in the House who can stand and look face 
to face with somebody making $18,000 a year and tell them that 
they are paying money for somebody that is making $100,000 a 
year, good luck to you because I do not think that is moral in 
any way, shape or form. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what is interesting here with the Reform Party is that they 
keep calling it a temporary unexpected job loss.  He is saying 
they want something there for someone that has an unexpected 
temporary job loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A seasonal worker knows every year they are getting laid off, so 
what he is really saying is that his government would not have an 
EI program for seasonal workers because it is an expected job 
loss.  It is a seasonal job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is very clear.  They would destroy the EI 
program.  He can go to Acadie—Bathurst and he can come to 
Beausejour—Petitcodiac with his leader and it is clear he would 
destroy the EI program and have those people suffer every winter. 
Can he answer that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I challenge the hon. 
member to go back to her riding and speak to some fisherman who 
is making $20,000 a year with dirt under his fingernails, who is 
trying to put food on the table for his children, macaroni and 
cheese, and say to him “No, we are going to allow you to pay 
money to give to somebody who is making $48,000 a year.”  I 
challenge the member to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all in favour of helping those who cannot help 
themselves.  We are in favour of an EI program that works to help 
those people who have become unemployed.  Yes, we are in favour 
of those people who are seasonal workers receiving EI money, but 
we believe they can do better.  We want to work with them to not 
only give them seasonal employment, but employment 365 days of 
the year if they want it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like you to know that I will be splitting my time with the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak today with great regrets and much animosity 
toward this government. After four years of harsh cuts to the 
employment insurance program, which I still call unemployment 
insurance, the government has finally decided to soften its 
policy and hand out some goodies.  Yesterday, with its 
mini-budget, it has handed out some goodies: caviar to those with 
more than $250,000, peanuts to the middle class.  To the least 
advantaged it has said “Come back another time, we're all out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is about to call an election, it seems, because 
everybody is saying “So long, see you later”.  I presume the 
people across the way are in the know.  With Bill C-44, the 
Liberals have proposed some timid measures that are not in line 
with what workers need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, thousands of people 
have protested against the cruel policies of this government's 
system of wealth distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, moreover, convinced that the Minister of National Revenue 
could testify to that. When he came to our area last week, he did 
not stay two minutes in the Saguenay.  He had to pack up his bags 
and head back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can see what this government is up to at the 
present time with funds that do not belong to it, since it is not 
the one making the contributions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does nothing, but takes the kitty and then creates laws that 
say “You there will have some; but you will not have any under 
certain conditions”.  The people at home are too proud.  They 
have said this to the Minister of National Revenue, who will be 
coming back tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I warn the people of the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region that he 
will be with us tomorrow. Do not forget to repeat to him what you 
told him last week.  What they are doing with your money is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money in the employment insurance fund—I still call it 
unemployment insurance—belongs to the workers of the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, of Quebec, of all the provinces 
of Canada.  I think it is theirs. Why does this government ignore 
that?  Contrary to what the Bloc wants it to do, it does not 
acknowledge that there should be an independent fund administered 
by workers and employers.  These people know what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, let us imagine that you have taken out fire 
insurance and car insurance.  Imagine what would happen if your 
insurer said to you after an accident “It is too bad, I am 
changing the conditions.  You have signed this, but today 
conditions have changed”.  You would not accept that.  This is 
exactly what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says everyone agreed to pay into a plan in the event they 
lost their job, but it says “No, you may well have paid, but I 
am going to do what I like with it”.  I say they are stealing 
it, I am sorry, that may be a bad word, but it is the fact of the 
matter. 
It is helping itself to this huge fund. Even for the next fiscal 
year, there will be a $7 billion surplus in the fund. And the 
government will again take that surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-44, the government had the nerve to make a minor 
amendment, which I want to tell you about. In one clause, the 
government wants to divert and use for its own benefit the 
surpluses in the employment insurance fund, even though they do 
not belong to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, it was the employment insurance commission that set 
the conditions. The act used to state that, for each year, the 
commission sets, with the approval of the governor in council, 
on the recommendation of the minister and the Minister of 
Finance, the rate which, in its opinion, is best suited to 
ensure an adequate income during an economic cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will no longer be the case. Now, the government will set all 
the selection criteria. It will decide which rate to apply and 
it will not be accountable to anyone. 
When Cabinet is involved, everything is always confidential. 
This is what the government wants to do with the employment 
insurance fund. No, we will not let them do that. People will 
never agree to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, there are seasonal workers. What we are asking 
for, and what I would have appreciated, is for a clear 
definition to be included in the Employment Insurance Act of 
what a seasonal worker is, with a degree of flexibility. But 
this does not bother them at all. They do not pay employment 
insurance with their big salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand. Surely they must have seasonal workers in 
their ridings, just as you do, Mr. Speaker. You do not have 
problems with seasonal workers? Perhaps the climate is different 
from what we have in eastern and central Canada. You may have 
better weather than we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will always be seasonal workers who have to contend with 
what nature sends them.  I would like a definition of seasonal 
worker.  That would help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally have never known anyone receiving EI who wanted to. 
People want to work, but when they have no job and there is no 
training to help them find other work, they have no choice. 
That is what is wrong with this system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For three and a half years now, I have been listening to lofty 
speeches about Canadian principles and values, about great 
Liberal values.  Strangely enough, these speeches never bear any 
connection with the everyday reality of ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months from now, 250 older workers in my riding are going 
to lose their jobs.  How many years have we been asking this 
government to restore passive measures to help these workers? 
And what does the government say?  It says that they will have 
to be retrained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people have worked hard in a factory for 35 or 40 years, at 
the expense of their health, and are reaching 55 or 60, they do 
not have enough money to retire. 
These people would like to leave and make way for young people 
but they cannot.  Their health is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking this government to have some compassion.  But what 
does it say?  It tells us to retrain these workers and stick 
them somewhere else.  Where, I do not know.  Or it says that 
they should be mobile and go elsewhere in Canada.  That is easy 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard senior officials who appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities.  I think they have a direct line to 
the values that drive the Liberals.  They have no compassion. 
They do not know what ordinary people are really going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a region where people are proud, and we have had 
enough of this nonsense.  It will no longer wash with us. 
Let the Liberal and Canadian Alliance candidates in the ridings 
in our area take note: they will never again pull the wool over 
the eyes of people who have taken steps to improve their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is painful to see what is happening in Canada at this time. 
We saw it in yesterday's mini-budget; we see it in this bill.  We 
must put a stop to it; we must think about the people.  The real 
people are the people who vote for us, not big businesses, not 
lobbyists. The real people are the workers, the ones who have 
family responsibilities, the ones with hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that women are the ones with precarious jobs. 
This government has the nerve to pass a motion in support of 
women's demands.  Then yesterday there was nothing in the 
Minister of Finance's mini-budget for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not recognize the value of women.  We know that 52% of 
voters are female.  Being a woman, I am proud to say that the 
demands the women made were very much a reflection of today's 
reality and that we must move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But government members did not get it, just as they did not get 
this matter of employment insurance.  These goodies they want to 
give us have no relationship to reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to them to go back to their books.  When they have done 
their homework, and when they have let people tell them what they 
really want, then we will talk.

Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on her speech to the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know she is very passionate and understands this issue very 
well.  Unfortunately there are many who do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform alliance speak very often about those who make a 
great deal of money, more than a healthy income, who then access 
employment insurance.  If those members read the rules and 
understood the dynamics they would understand that there was a 
clawback that did not create this anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is on two fronts.  With respect 
to what the government has done, this cynical attempt to change 
the system that it broke, to somehow try to fix the harm that it 
created when these changes were made and these arbitrary rules 
came into effect that affected seasonal workers in such a 
terrible way, it created a black hole.  Seasonal workers do not 
have a choice.  They do not put themselves in the position of 
being in an industry that does not give them employment 12 months 
of the year.  Given the opportunity, any seasonal worker that I 
have come across would like to work for a full year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that the system has changed.  It has 
created a black hole.  When workers run out of work and run out 
of EI they are left with no way to feed their families.

We know they are fish out of water when it comes to understanding 
issues in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now in the cynical position where it is trying 
to rush this bill through.  This is the last minute piece of 
legislation that it wants to get through.  It is dangling it in 
front of seasonal workers who have been affected by the EI 
changes.  It is holding it in from of them like an ice cream 
cone, pulling it away and saying that somehow the opposition is 
to blame for this.  The government had ample time to get this 
bill through if it was a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member think the government would do such a 
thing?  Why is it that this is such a low priority for the 
government?  Does it have anything to do with the pending

this, to buy back voters with their own money?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat to all hon. colleagues, because I know some

the Senate has officially indicated on the record in

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am certainly pleased to rise on this question again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 15 I asked about a program that the government invented 
to provide $175 million for rural roads in the west.  My question 
was simple.  Will the government provide a similar program for 
the east? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the east we have an inconsistent hodgepodge of programs.  I 
point out the inconsistency and the unfairness in the way the 
federal government provides highway dollars in Atlantic Canada. 
Newfoundland will get $105 million for highway money this year 
and next year alone.  New Brunswick will get $102 million this 
year and next year alone.  Nova Scotia will get zero, not a penny 
in highway money under a federal-provincial agreement.  It points 
out how unfair the government's policy is toward the provinces 
and how it distributes the highway money so unfairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result Nova Scotia ends up by having the only toll highway 
on the Trans-Canada Highway in the entire country.  It is forced 
to do this because highway money is not distributed fairly or 
equally.  If we had some of the $175 million for rural highways 
that the government just announced for the west, or if Nova 
Scotia had some of the money that Newfoundland received or some 
of the money that New Brunswick received, we would not have a 
toll highway.  Because the federal government is so inconsistent 
with their money, Nova Scotia ends up with zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia we have damaged highways and dangerous highways 
now.  The Tatamagouche to Truro highway needs to be completely 
rebuilt and upgraded.  Amherst to Parrsboro is a mess.  Ecum 
Secum to Guysborough is another important one, but the Amherst to 
Parrsboro highway is a rough road.  We are trying to generate 
tourism business and they will not even come any more.  When we 
look at the numbers they show such a terrible inconsistency, a 
terrible imbalance, a terrible unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Transport change his mind and be a little 
more fair?  I am not even asking for $175 million for Nova Scotia 
but I am asking for fairer treatment.  The minister has given 
$175 million to the rest.  He should give Nova Scotia a fair 
amount, something like Newfoundland received or something like 
New Brunswick received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Transport treat Nova Scotia fairly and 
allow us some highway money this year and next year in the same 
way as he did for Newfoundland and New Brunswick?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government appreciates the opportunity to correct the 
impression left by the hon. member's question, namely, the 
Atlantic provinces are not receiving their fair share of federal 
highway funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that the $175 million referred to was 
for improvements to the grain roads in the four western provinces 
as part of the grain handling and transportation reform announced 
on May 10.  To suggest that the Atlantic provinces need an equal 
program ignores the numerous programs that we have put in place 
for Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government established the Atlantic freight transition 
program which provided the four Atlantic provinces and Quebec 
highway funding of $326 million between 1995 and 1996 and 2000 
and 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the auspices of the highway improvement program the 
federal government committed to allocate $462.8 million to New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia to fund highway projects.  A balance of 
approximately $100 million remains to be spent in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also contributed $43 million to New Brunswick and 
P.E.I. to assist with the additional highway contribution 
associated with increased traffic due to the construction of a 
fixed link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Newfoundland and Labrador continues to benefit. 
The Newfoundland transportation initiative provides $640 million 
over five years from 1997-98 to 2002-03 for major improvements to 
the Trans-Canada Highway and to regional truck roads following 
the termination of the Newfoundland railway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces also receive funding for the strategic highway 
improvement program.  It allowed the federal government to invest 
$515 million between 1993-94 and 1999-2000 in highway projects 
all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2000 budget speech the Minister of Finance announced over 
$2 billion for municipal infrastructure and $600 million for 
highways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on June 14 I asked a question in the 
House and the government has still failed to answer it.  It was a 
simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the justice minister promised the Liberal gun registry 
would run a deficit of only $2.2 million over five years.  In the 
year 2000 the current justice minister delivered a deficit of at 
least $308 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are available in black and white, written in the 
justice department documents tabled in the House in 1995, written 
in financial spreadsheets provided to me under access to 
information earlier this year and in a letter written by the 
Minister of Justice published in the Toronto <I>Star</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of only two justice ministers is responsible for making this 
$300 million mistake.  Canadian taxpayers want to know who is 
responsible.  Why did the government ignore our party's warnings 
about its low ball cost estimates?  How did the government allow 
this waste of hundreds of millions of dollars to occur? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago in the House the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice only added to the confusion with a totally 
inaccurate statement about the costs of the gun registration 
scheme.  On October 5 the parliamentary secretary stated that 
“The benefits of this program represent an investment of $2 per 
Canadian for the past five years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have known grade 4 math students who are better at arithmetic. 
How did the justice minister's parliamentary secretary arrive at 
this bogus number?  Before he answers, I will give him the real 
numbers so he can do the arithmetic himself rather than rely on 
the crooked calculators in the minister's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spreadsheets from the justice department show gun registration 
costs for the first five years at $324.7 million.  If we divide 
that amount by 30.5 million Canadians, Statistics Canada 
population estimates for 1999, it equals $10.65 for every 
Canadian, not $2 per Canadian.  That is more than five times the 
untrue figure the parliamentary secretary told the House on 
October 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the justice minister mislead parliament about the true 
costs in 1995?  Why did the parliamentary secretary mislead the 
House only two weeks ago?  Why did the current justice minister 
mislead Canadians when she wrote the Toronto <I>Star</I> on July 
19, 1999, saying “User fees would cover the entire cost of the 
gun registry program?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 11 the Department of Justice sent me a response to 
one of my access to information requests which said that as of 
August 11, 2000, “ the total amount of revenue received by the 
receiver general in respect of fees imposed under the Firearms 
Act is $17,139,993”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same access to information request the department 
estimated that the Liberal gun registry project owed $1.2 million 
in refunds to firearms owners.  No wonder the minister and her PR 
staff have quit saying that user fees will cover the entire cost 
of the program.  She came up more than $308 million short over 
the first five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much is the gun registration scheme costing taxpayers this 
year?  So far the officials in the justice minister's office have 
refused to respond to my access to information request.  They 
have even refused to provide their proposed budget allocation as 
they have in previous years.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's officials are even stonewalling the investigator 
from the Office of the Information Commissioner.  The 
investigator informed my office last week that when he examined 
the department's firearm registry project files there was no—

much appreciate that.  I rose on a point of order to bring that 
to your attention.  He also referred to the minister's crooked 
calculator.  I think he should withdraw that as well.  However I 
will respond and you, Mr. Speaker, can deal with that 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been clear about the cost of the firearms program.  I 
said publicly that we have spent a cumulative total of $327 
million on the program between 1995 and March 31, 2000.  The 
government of Canada is responsible for this program and is proud 
not to have been shirking any of its responsibility concerning 
this major public safety initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is accepting its responsibilities, including its 
financial accountability.  It would be refreshing if the members 
opposing this valuable legislation would accept their 
responsibility for playing a positive role respecting the public 
safety of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of October 14, we have more than 1.3 million Canadians who 
hold or have applied for licences under the legislation.  More 
than 1.6 million firearms are registered.  Since December 1, 1998 
more than 959 licence applications have been refused for public 
safety concerns and 1,207 licences have been revoked from 
individuals deemed not to be eligible to hold a licence because 
they pose a safety risk. The number of revocations are over 20 
times higher than the total of the previous five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems that I acknowledged with our start-up in the spring 
are now well in hand.  We have an aggressive program in place to 
deal with providing enhanced service to Canadian firearms owners. 
Elements of this include the following.  We have been providing 
face to face assistance to help people to complete their 
applications for licensing.  We have drastically simplified our 
forms.  We have implemented processing and system efficiencies 
throughout to provide better service to Canadians more quickly. 
We have enhanced our call centre services to provide better and 
faster individualized assistance.  At the same time as we are 
providing better service to firearms owners, we are providing 
better public safety to all Canadians.  We are now able to 
background checks before any legitimate firearm sales can 
proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had good results from these initiatives.  Our outreach 
programs have contributed to over 528,000 applications and the 
numbers continue to increase.  Our advertising program has been 
appearing on prime time and specialty TV, in national and ethnic 
press and on radio consistently reminding owners of their—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, on 
September 19 I asked the Minister of Industry whether the 
competition bureau would investigate recent media mergers.  At 
the time the minister replied that these mergers were reviewable 
under section 92 of the Competition Act but he did not indicate 
he would request an investigation be launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These media mergers are becoming a matter of concern to 
Canadians and let me explain.  In July CanWest-Global 
Communications Corp. of Winnipeg acquired more than 200 Canadian 
publications as well as half of the <I>National Post</I> from 
Toronto based Hollinger Inc., combining them with its Global 
Television Network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement came just a month after CanWest had bought the 
television assets of WIC, Western International Communications 
Ltd.  Then in September Montreal based publisher Quebecor 
acquired Quebec's largest cable company, Groupe Vidéotron Ltée, 
also of Montreal, for $4.9 billion.  On September 15 BCE Inc., 
the Thompson Corporation and the Woodbridge Company announced the 
creation of a multimedia company that would combine CTV, the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>, Globe Interactive, an Internet content 
provider, and Sympatico, an Internet portal. The result is the 
boundaries between print media, broadcasting, the Internet and 
telecommunications companies have been blurred so much that the 
industries are now virtually indistinguishable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC held hearings on September 18 on BCE's change of 
ownership application. The decision is still pending. The CRTC's 
mandate is to regulate broadcasting and telecommunications in the 
best interest of the Canadian public.  It is trying to deal with 
these multiple mergers and the rapidly changing technology.  But 
while the CRTC regulates broadcasting and telecommunications, it 
does not have a say about newspapers or the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three media mergers include both newspapers and Internet 
services as well as broadcasting.  The CRTC in reviewing the 
BCE-CTV transaction asks broad questions about its impact on the 
broadcasting system and on Canadian content, but it does not 
address whether these transactions result in convergence in the 
Canadian market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these mergers, we can define convergence as 
cross-ownership of newspapers, television stations and Internet 
assets, plus possibly a giant phone or cable company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is the competition bureau's responsibility to 
maintain and encourage fair competition in Canada.  It can 
determine whether these mergers result in lessening or prevention 
of competition in the marketplace.  It is clear also that such 
massive concentration of power in the media is detrimental to the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I would like to ask the minister through his 
parliamentary secretary whether he would launch a comprehensive 
investigation in the public interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me thank the hon. member, 
my good friend from Davenport, for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as the hon. member, a number of members in this House 
have received expressions of concern from the public about recent 
proposals outlined for mergers that could lead to increased media 
concentration in Canada.  I am referring in particular to the 
recently announced proposal of CanWest to acquire control of 
Hollinger Corporation as well as the proposed BCE/Thomson and 
Quebecor/Vidéotron transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to mention to the member 
and to the House that the competition bureau has primary 
responsibility to review mergers in order to determine whether 
they will have an anti-competitive impact in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure this House and the member that if serious 
competition concerns dealing with matters such as price or other 
economic issues are identified, the bureau will not hesitate, and 
I emphasize that, to immediately take appropriate action under 
the Competition Act to remedy these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition bureau is an independent law enforcement agency. 
As part of its analysis it will rely upon factual information 
brought to its attention by market participants as well as the 
input of industry and economic experts.  These matters are 
assessed on a case by case basis and it is impossible to make any 
generalizations about the possible outcome of the bureau's 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fair, efficient and competitive marketplace indeed provides 
consumers with lower prices and greater product choices and it of 
course encourages companies to innovate and to offer new 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously many mergers also have a positive impact on the 
marketplace.  However, there have been a number of 
well-publicized mergers in recent months, as the member very 
eloquently stated, where the competition bureau has found it 
necessary to intervene in order to remedy these issues that have 
come before us.  These have involved major industries such as 
groceries, waste, propane, tobacco and cement— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to interrupt the hon. 
member, but the time has expired and, as he knows, the rules in 
this regard are very strict. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 5.48 p.m.)
