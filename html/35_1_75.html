	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. When Bill C-18 was reported to this 
House from the Senate the note in <I>Votes and Proceedings</I> for that 
day, I believe it was a week ago Wednesday, indicated that the 
message had been received from the Senate informing this 
House that the Senate had passed Bill C-18 with amendments. 
The amendments were not printed as part of the text of <I>Votes and 
Proceedings</I> and I am concerned that it is very difficult for 
members to have to order a sessional paper in order to see the 
text of these amendments.
<P>
	In our own House when there are amendments moved at the 
report stage of a bill the text of the amendments, of course, 
appears in <I>Votes and Proceedings</I> as part of the minutes of the 
day. I suggest that while many may regard the proceedings in the 
Senate as irrelevant and unimportant, in this particular case they 
have some importance for this House and it would be convenient 
if members were able to read the text of the amendments in <I>Votes 
and Proceedings</I>. Otherwise members have to go through some 
difficulty to obtain copies.
<P>
	My own committee has approved changes in the way that 
<I>Votes and Proceedings</I> is prepared, designed to save money and 
eliminate duplication of printing. The Senate amendments are 
not printed in any other House documentation and I do not know 
whether Your Honour has ever tried to get minutes of the Senate. 
I have tried to subscribe for the five or six years that I have been 
in this place, and I cannot get them delivered on a regular basis.
<P>
	They are very difficult to obtain and I could send a staff 
member to the distribution office to get a copy but that seems 
needless trouble every day. That is what I am expected now to 
do; at least that is the only way I seem to be able to obtain the 
minutes of the Senate.
<P>
	In the absence of a printed record I suggest that it would be 
entirely appropriate to have Senate amendments printed in the 
<I>Votes and Proceedings</I> and I would ask Your Honour to direct the 
amendments to Bill C-18 be printed as a correction to the <I>Votes 
and Proceedings</I> for the day on which the matter was reported so 
that they will be recorded then and for the future in our 
proceedings so we can see what amendments the Senate makes 
to Commons bills when it decides in its wisdom to make 
changes.
<P>
	I know there are many members who feel it inappropriate for 
the Senate to make changes to Commons bills, but the fact is that 
it does happen from time to time and we do have to tolerate this 
inconvenience. I do think it ought to be brought to our attention 
in our <I>Votes and Proceedings</I> when a message is received from 
the Senate indicating that there is such a change.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member's point is, of course, well 
taken and your Speaker will look into the matter and come back

<P>
	These petitioners request that abuse, be it physical, regarding 
language or otherwise, be controlled. They believe that it is not 
necessary to have different forms of abuse of television, radio or 
written media in order to entertain or to inform.
<P>
	The abuse depicted is often counteracting their efforts to raise 
their families as they feel they ought to be raised. Therefore they 
ask that the government intervene.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 22, 1994, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the chance to urge 
members to support Bill C-17, the 1994 budget implementation 
act.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying that Bill C-17 which revamps 
the unemployment insurance entitlements taken in isolation 
would be considered a very tough bill because during a very 
difficult period of our economy when people are unemployed, 
when one takes an unemployment insurance act and reviews and 
revamps it, there could be people exposed to added suffering. 
This bill also deals with restraining parliamentary wages, public 
service wages and cutbacks in transportation costs. If the bill is 
taken in light of an overall budget strategy I believe sincerely 
that Canadians would understand exactly where we are coming 
from.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Our number one priority in meeting the objective of putting 
Canadians back to work is to ensure the fiscal framework of the 
country is restored to a healthy position. The very difficult 
deficit and debt the country is burdened with today put an 
incredible strain on our tax burden. They affect our ability to 
raise capital in the country. This means governments compete 
for capital with small and medium sized entrepreneurs.
<P>
	In order to create a total environment for business recovery 
we have to deal with very tough legislation like revamping our 
unemployment insurance system. I am proud to be part of a 
government that had the courage in the budget to meet the 
problem head on.
<P>
	We also heard the reduction in the unemployment insurance 
premium cost would be a very important benefit to small and 
medium sized business persons. Many of them have said a 
reduction in that cost would spur them on to making decisions 
that would put people back to work.
<P>
	In a survey that was announced last night-and it was on 
``Canada AM'' this morning-of about 1,000 businesses across 
Canada, two out of three said that in the near future they would 
be hiring again or employing people again. This certainly gives 
the government side a feeling of hope that the strategic plan of 
the Minister of Finance to revitalize the economy is working.
<P>
	I repeat that Bill C-17 in isolation is something that is very 
tough in itself, but we must look at the other factors in the 
strategy the Minister of Finance has put forward. We have all 
been working on the strategy for the last few months. It is 
important for Canadians to hear about some of the things we 
have been doing on all sides of the House.
<P>
	Another piece of the strategy was access to capital for small 
and medium sized businesses. I have repeated this message 
many times in the House, but I believe as a member of 
Parliament that one of the single most important factors is 
giving hope to small and medium sized entrepreneurs. The men 
and women who have the energy and the creativity to spark the 
economy need access to capital. They told us that over the last 
two or three years banks had been very tough in accessing credit 
to them.
<P>
	Yesterday the Minister of Industry dismissed the study that 
was somehow leaked from some department and indicated that 
the banks were not being difficult in accessing capital to small 
business. The Minister of Industry said yesterday in question 
period that the study did not reflect what he or other members of 
Parliament had been hearing.
<P>
	For two and a half months in the industry committee members 
of the Bloc Quebecois, members of the Reform Party and 
government members have been hearing witness after witness 
from the small business community talking about their 
experiences with banks. We have also heard from the bank 
leadership and other financial leadership. They actually 
admitted that there was room for improvement in their bank 
policy direction.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	It is important for all Canadians to realize that is another 
factor in the overall budget strategy we are debating today. It is 
an important component as well. To take a bill like Bill C-17 and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4622"> 4622 </A></B>
<P>
revamp the unemployment insurance entitlements without 
considering the other component pieces is not right.
<P>
	All members have been working very hard on the report on 
access to capital. Hopefully it will be presented to Parliament by 
the end of June and some of the recommendations will find their 
way into a revised approach to regulating the financial 
institutions and the way they deal with small and medium sized 
businesses.
<P>
	While I am on the specific area of access to capital, it is 
interesting that we are discovering in committee many new 
opportunities to access capital for small businesses that will 
become apparent to the 900,000 entrepreneurs that are trying to 
re-spark the economy across Canada.
<P>
	The insurance companies, the mutual funds, the stock 
exchanges and all other financial instruments have suddenly 
discovered in the last six to nine months that the real future or 
the real action in terms of the new economy, especially the 
knowledge based economy, will be with the small and medium 
sized business sectors.
<P>
	I am optimistic that all kinds of capital will be available in the 
not too distant future for people with good business plans and 
good ideas who have the courage to take risks and achieve.
<P>
	Another aspect of the budget strategy linked to the Bill C-17 
review or revamping of the unemployment insurance 
entitlement is that we have reviewed in committee what has 
been going on with the goods and services tax. The issue of the 
GST has not gone away. As the government we are not running 
away from that issue. We know what Canadians think about the 
GST. It is a complex, inefficient tax, especially for the business 
community across Canada. It has added to the cost of doing 
business or the paper burden, an issue we cannot run away from.
<P>
	The whole tax review issue is part of the budget strategy. It is 
being handled in the finance committee. That is something we 
are coming to terms with. It is a lot more difficult actually than 
the access to capital issue. We can put our fingers on access to 
capital in an easier way but dealing with reform of a tax act is 
very tough, very difficult. We are meeting that challenge. 
Hopefully by the fall we will have some recommendations in 
that area.
<P>
	Another area also linked to the budget strategy concerns the 
reduction of paper burden. Committees in the Department of 
Industry and the Department of Finance are dealing with ways in 
which we can reduce the paper burden of business in the country.
<P>
	When we put together all factors in the equation Bill C-17 
starts to make some sense. As I said, in isolation it is a very 
tough bill. I recognize members of the Bloc Quebecois are 
nodding that it is a tough bill. We recognize we cannot look at 
revamping unemployment insurance entitlement in isolation. If 
we dealt with the bill in isolation obviously the criticism would 
be well founded. It is very difficult in a time when people are 
unemployed to put pressure on unemployment insurance 
benefits. We have to look at it in the context of a total strategy. 
We have to look at it in the context of trying to put the fiscal 
framework of the country in order. When  Canadians see it in the 
context of an overall plan they will be a bit more understanding 
of what we are trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	During this very difficult time of reviewing the fiscal 
framework of the country and trying to regain some stability and 
confidence we have also had to deal with the Bloc Quebecois. 
We as members of Parliament came to the nation's boardroom. 
We were elected to Parliament to build the country, to make the 
environment of Canada better. I have been an elected member of 
Parliament for six years but I have worked on the Hill since 
1980. I had the privilege of working for someone who I believe 
was one of the greatest prime ministers the country ever had, 
Prime Minister Trudeau.
<P>
	I see Bloc members getting excited already. They recognize 
that if Trudeau were here they would not even exist. He would 
not even give them the time of day because he would not 
stomach the fact that people would be in the nation's boardroom 
trying to destroy it. It is very difficult to sit down with people, 
whether they are business people or educators, who do not 
understand the country. The people in this room are supposed to 
be building Canada, yet they are here trying to destroy it.
<P>
	It is a real mystery for us to try to comprehend why they would 
want to become part of an organization. Usually when one joins 
an organization, whether it is a community group, a hockey 
team, a school or some other kind of a club, one comes to that 
group of men and women to try to make it better. The logic of 
having an organization where people sign on to destroy it is 
difficult for me to comprehend. It is nothing personal. In my 
mind it is very difficult to understand.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make is that we are dealing with an 
economic strategy aimed at putting people back to work in every 
riding of the country: in all the ridings of Quebec and all the 
ridings of Alberta. It is very difficult to do so when saddled with 
a group of men and women sowing seeds of dissension and doing 
their level best to destroy economic confidence in the country.
<P>
	They stand in the House of Commons to criticize revamping 
the unemployment insurance system. It is the role of the 
opposition to constructively criticize what we are doing on this 
side of the House. We welcome it. I have been a member of the 
opposition. I believe in its right and the responsibility to stand to 
criticize the flaws in a particular piece of legislation being put 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	It is totally disgusting that there is a group which is not really 
constructively criticizing. If those members were constructively 
criticizing for the benefit of all Canadians they would stop 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4623"> 4623 </A></B>
<P>
trying to dismember and dismantle the country. That is a very 
difficult thing for me to cope with.
<P>
	I can accept an amendment or a recommendation to improve a 
bill but if they were really sincere about building this country 
then why not put away this destructive anti-Canada action 
which has been going on. As the Prime Minister said in Montreal 
last night, it is starting to affect in a profound way the markets 
and their attitude toward Canada.
<P>
	Maybe I am being a little too strong when I say profound. 
Canada is a very strong country in its own right, but it does have 
a psychological effect on investors. When there is a group which 
is trying to dismember Quebec why would anyone from the 
private sector want to invest billions of dollars in the Quebec 
marketplace? They would have to think twice. I am not saying 
that people will not do it, but I am saying it is a very tough 
decision. The Bloc Quebecois is making it very tough to 
rekindle the whole country.
<P>
	This is nothing personal, but members opposite would have to 
agree it is a highly unusual approach to come to an organization 
for the purpose of destroying and dismantling it. What they 
cannot seem to get through their thought process is that they are 
hurting their own constituents. Speaking as one member of 
Parliament, this ultimately has to affect not just my 
constituents, but all constituents, the men and women right 
across Canada.
<P>
	Getting back to Bill C-17, we as a government are taking a 
very difficult step in revamping the unemployment insurance 
system. We are asking parliamentarians to cut back. We are 
freezing the public service wages. Those are tough steps, 
especially on unemployment insurance.
<P>
	We have to look at it in the context of an overall strategy. I 
have mentioned access to capital. I have mentioned the tax 
review situation. I also have to mention what the minister of 
human resources is doing beyond his reviewing the 
unemployment insurance system.
<P>
	The minister is putting so much emphasis on retraining, with 
very special sensitivity toward young men and women with the 
youth corps. That is a tremendous first step for helping people 
who are finishing school. Even though it is not a large number of 
young people, it is a tremendous pilot project. If we can figure 
out a way to help young people who do not have any experience, 
and help them during that bridge period between graduation and 
getting into the workforce, that in itself is a very important first 
step.
<P>
	If we can refine that youth corps it could be the model project 
not only for a national government effort but also a more 
extensive one at the provincial and municipal levels in the 
future. That in itself is a very useful, important and positive 
initiative which has happened in the last six months.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Another thing we have to remember is that we only took over 
the government seven months ago. Quite frankly we have done 
an awful lot in a very short time. Turning around the fiscal 
framework mess which we inherited is not an easy task. It takes 
a concerted effort by all members of Parliament and we need a 
very tight focus but I am beginning to sense that the market is 
coming back.
<P>
	Another initiative I want to talk about is linked to this whole 
budget strategy and putting Canadians back to work. It has to do 
with our effort of encouraging young business men and women 
to get into the export field. I would like to talk for just a couple 
of minutes about an experience I had during the last 
parliamentary recess.
<P>
	I had the privilege of working with the private sector group 
Inter Canada Far East Trade Centre in Markham, Ontario. They 
are experts in helping small and medium sized businesses get 
access to China. Last January I met with this group and they 
asked me if I would join them in taking a group of young 
business men and women to Beijing in May.
<P>
	As members know, during the campaign we said we were 
going to put a very special emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region, 
that we were going to make sure we gave very special support to 
the small and medium sized business sector in helping them 
trade in that market.
<P>
	Therefore I obliged and took up the offer to co-chair a 
mission to Beijing which left on May 17. I had the support of the 
member of Parliament from North Bay, the member of 
Parliament for Vaudreuil, the member of Parliament for 
Vancouver East, and also the member of Parliament for Durham. 
We went with the Inter-Canada group and 100 men and women 
from small and medium sized businesses. We were there for 10 
days.
<P>
	About 80 per cent of those men and women had never had any 
export experience; they had never gone abroad on a mission. 
North America is the natural market for Canadian business men 
and women. But they had the courage to go and they spent their 
own money on the trip. About 80 per cent of those young men 
and women came back with either signed deals or signed letters 
of intent.
<P>
	I say this in the context of our national budget strategy 
because, I would venture to say there are 100,000 to 200,000 
jobs in China for Canadians. There are jobs in China for every 
sector of our economy. I have been on many missions around the 
world since 1980. I went on missions in the private sector when I 
worked with Magna, in the auto parts business. I have never seen 
anything like what is happening in China right now. The 
opportunities to put Canadians back to work are beyond the 
imagination.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4624"> 4624 </A></B>
<P>
	I know I cannot display it, but I am holding in my hands the 
book <I>Co-operation Projects for Foreign Investment in the 
Liaoning Province</I>. It is one of the smaller provinces in China, 
40 million people in the one province. We went up to Shen Yang 
City which is the economic capital of Liaoning province. They 
invited us to come back in October with a second group from 
small and medium sized businesses. There are 1,000 
opportunities for joint ventures with Canadian companies in this 
book alone. If we do not get out there these opportunities are 
going to go to our American, German and French friends 
because they are all over there.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister's strategy on China was right on. They 
love Canadians. We have a great reputation because of Dr. 
Bethune and former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau whose name 
is gold over there. If we went over there and as members of 
Parliament encouraged small and medium sized businesses to go 
to China we would have all kinds of opportunity to put our 
people back to work.
<P>
	Some members might ask: ``What about human rights?'' That 
is a fair question when talking about China because of its 
history. Interestingly enough they are very sensitive to that issue 
and we talked about human rights. I know some members might 
dismiss it but I learned something on my trip to China. If you 
have not been there you should not criticize until you know what 
is going on.
<P>
	This was the first time I had been there. The 140 men and 
women on our mission were approachable because of their value 
system and caring style. We were asked questions about our 
country, about our educational system, our social service 
system, how we look after the disadvantaged in our community. 
Not only were they businessmen and women, they were also 
educators and social workers who explained what goes on in our 
country. That might represent the best way for us to make 
change in the value system of that country.
<P>
	I chatted with Premier Rae when he was over there and he 
shared my view. I have to get a little dig in at the premier. He was 
over there with the multinationals, the large Canadian 
corporations whereas our contingent was the small and medium 
sized businesses. It is interesting that Premier Rae was with 
eight or ten of them-and I am not putting them down; they are 
very important to our economy. However, when this government 
made a commitment to help small and medium sized businesses 
during the last campaign as is well stated in the red book, our 
trip to China was further concrete testimony that we are not 
going to walk away from that.
<P>
	In closing I encourage all members of Parliament to look at 
the opportunities which exist in China to help put those 
unemployed men and women in their ridings back to work or to 
help small businesses expand.
<P>
	I notice the Bloc members once again with their sarcastic 
smiles. It is interesting. I have listened in this House for five 
months now and I have not heard one constructive idea from the 
finance critic of the opposition party. Not one constructive idea. 
Not once did I hear him say anything good about what we have 
done in this budget as an overall strategy. Not once have I heard 
him stand up and say: ``I love Canada''.
<P>
	This is the nation's boardroom; it is not the Quebec legislative 
assembly. This is Canada and this is what you should be doing 
here. You should be building Canada. Constituents not just in 
my city but right across the country are fed up with you people 
coming to this Parliament of Canada and doing nothing. Then 
when we put forward constructive ideas to help put your 
constituents back to work and not just ours, you sit there with 
your smug, sarcastic smiles.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The ostensible point of order is the 
question about addressing remarks to the Speaker precisely to 
avoid the kind of thing that is going on right now. Second, I 
would remind the hon. parliamentary secretary that his 
comments at the moment do not appear to me to relate very 
closely to the bill at hand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
your point. Every now and again I become so emotional about 
my country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Don't apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> When I have to sit in 
the nation's boardroom with people who are trying to destroy it, 
from time to time my emotion gets the better of me. I find this 
hypocrisy distasteful at times. At any rate, I want to get back to 
the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-17 was a tough decision made by the government to 
revamp unemployment insurance. It was not done in isolation. It 
was done in the context of a very good strategy put forward by 
the Minister of Finance and the minister of state for finance who 
I have the privilege of sitting next to in this Parliament.
<P>
	When we look at the work we are doing on access to capital, 
the work we are doing on tax reform, pushing small business to 
go abroad, and when we see the opportunities that are out there, 
if we all work together, then within very short order we could 
really get Canadians feeling good about themselves again. The 
best way to get them to feel good about themselves is putting 
them back to work.
<P>
	I believe that we as a government are on the right path.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, the day Bill 
C-17 is passed will be a sad day in Canadian history. Let me say 
to my hon. colleague who just spoke that it will be a sad day 
because of this bill which has the support of his government and, 
for the most part, of the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4625"> 4625 </A></B>
<P>
	Unlike my hon. colleague who spoke before me, I would hope 
that my comments will be guided by intelligence rather than 
emotion. You will understand, however, if occasionally I do get 
emotional. It seems to be much easier to attempt to discredit 
members of the Bloc Quebecois who were democratically 
elected by Quebecers than it is to rationalize Bill C-17, an 
outrage for this party and for this government, which calls itself 
liberal but will soon have to find a new name, much like the 
Progressives became the Progressive Conservatives.
<P>
	Before moving on to the heart of my presentation, I would like 
to focus on one point that has been troubling me ever since my 
hon. colleagues began talking about the instability that the Bloc 
Quebecois is creating with its sovereignty plans. Those 
responsible for the demise of Meech are sitting on the other side 
of this House. They are the ones responsible for the movement 
that has grown in Quebec, although neither I nor many of my 
colleagues felt that Meech would be the agreement to settle 
Canada's fate once and for all and to clearly satisfy Quebecers. 
It is a certainty.
<P>
	However, Meech was an attempt, an open door, and that is 
why even sovereigntists could not reject it. Those responsible 
for the death of Meech and for creating permanent instability are 
not sitting on this side of the House, but rather on the other side.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Instability was a problem during all those years when French 
Canadian Quebecers were withdrawn, docile and poor.
<P>
	Getting back to my prepared text-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me, Madam, there is a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, would you 
please call the hon. member to order. If he wants to comment, he 
should be polite enough to listen and comment after the hon. 
member has finished her speech. Good manners also apply here 
in the House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are as well-mannered as you.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Let me say that there was a motion 
from a member in the previous Parliament on a subject which I 
think affected members more than any other, namely the lack of 
public respect because we did some things here that the public 
found awful. I see your point and I hope that your colleagues 
opposite will respect your point as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
you have addressed most of this. The member knows that it is 
not uncommon for members from time to time after they have 
given a long speech to walk out into the lobby. As Canadians 
should know, we have a television monitor there so I was 
listening to the hon. member's remarks. I was not being rude to 
the member.
<P>
	The record would show that I have listened to many speeches 
of members of the Bloc Quebecois in an effort to understand 
where they are coming from as they try to destroy the country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will say this in English. If I 
understood the point, and I was speaking momentarily with 
counsel at the table, the member was not criticizing the 
parliamentary secretary. He was criticizing another member in 
the House for interrupting the speech of the member who had the 
floor. I do not think the parliamentary secretary was in 
anybody's mind to be criticized.
<P>
	We have had this discussion before. The parliamentary 
secretary, with respect, will remember the low repute that 
Parliament went into in the last Parliament. He and I were both 
here. As I said in French, the reason they did is because our 
constituents thought we behaved improperly in this place.
<P>
	Therefore, I hope that all new members in this Parliament will 
give each other more respect than we gave each other in the last 
Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I repeat that the day Bill C-17 passes will be a sad day in 
Canadian history. Of course, it is much easier for the party in 
power to talk about anything but this bill, because this bill shows 
a bias to attack the unemployed, welfare recipients and public 
servants and carefully avoids touching the wealthy, family trusts 
and tax shelters.
<P>
	We agree that something absolutely must be done about the 
deficit, but we disagree when those opposite attack only the 
unemployed, the poor and public servants, as we see in this bill. 
It attacks unemployment insurance and social assistance at a 
time when unemployment is extremely high, when few 
Canadians feel their jobs are safe, even and I might say 
especially small and medium-sized business owners because of 
recent incidents that have come to my knowledge, incidents that 
happened not in faraway places but in my own riding, where 
small businesses have gone bankrupt. I know that a great many 
small businesses are having a very hard time right now. I will 
address this issue as well.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government decision to cut as much as it has in 
the unemployment insurance program is an historic one on the 
part of people who cloak themselves in the Canadian unity flag 
and claim to be promoting national unity. If they have done their 
homework and taken a good look at what they are doing, then 
they should know how much of an impact these cuts to unem-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4626"> 4626 </A></B>
<P>
ployment insurance will have on the various regions of Quebec 
and Canada over the next two years.
<P>
	I have quoted these statistics on several occasions in this 
House, Mr. Speaker, but they are at the heart of this bill. In fiscal 
years 1995-96 and 1996-97, cuts in that area alone will total 
$630 million in Atlantic Canada and $735 million in Quebec. Is 
that what Canadians have to hope for?
<P>
	This means that together Atlantic Canada and Quebec will 
bear 60 per cent of the cuts, while only one third of the total 
population of Canada lives in these two regions. The situation is 
even worse in the case of Atlantic Canada. That region alone 
bears 26 per cent of the cuts, with only 8.5 per cent of the 
population.
<P>
	Besides the Bloc Quebecois, who has risen in this House and 
denounced loudly the fact that the Maritime or Atlantic 
provinces are made to pay the largest share? The other side may 
refuse to hear, but we did point this out. We have not heard the 
hon. members from Western Canada complain about how hard 
Maritime workers were hit either. We, from the Bloc Quebecois, 
are the ones who have made this regional disparity public. It was 
no big secret and it should not be, but the information had to be 
leaked out just the same. Then, the government was forced to 
provide explanations.
<P>
	I am pointing out for the first time in this House the extent to 
which the Maritimes and Quebec are indeed targeted by these 
cuts. Why is that? Just because they raise UI eligibility 
requirements from 10 to 12 weeks. Is the effect achieved a 
surprise? No, Mr. Speaker. If we in this House could show the 
very nice charts compiled by Employment and Immigration 
Canada, the people watching us would see that the great 
majority of UI recipients with short periods of employment are 
in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. It is known fact.
<P>
	More surprisingly, it is even a known fact that the number of 
recipients with 8 to 19 weeks of insurable employment fell from 
610,000 in 1975 to 250,000 in 1990.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	This means that when we ``improved'' unemployment 
insurance, recipients generally had a short period of 
employment behind them. Since that time, however, the number 
of unemployed people with a long history of employment has 
increased. That is no reason to reduce benefits for those unable 
to find longer-term jobs in their local economy, as I will 
demonstrate.
<P>
	In a document based on the data available, Employment and 
Immigration Canada tried to predict how many people would be 
affected by the fact that, in these regions where seasonal 
employment is very important, the minimum number of weeks 
of work required to qualify for UI will be increased from 10 to 
12. So how many Canadians will be affected by this provision, 
according to Employment and Immigration Canada's forecasts 
which are likely very conservative. Forty-four thousand people. 
Where are these 44,000 people? Newfoundland, 16,000; Prince 
Edward Island,  2,960; Nova Scotia, 3,575; New Brunswick, 
11,535; Quebec, 8,000.
<P>
	Of course, some may find it strange that people cannot find 
longer-term jobs. It may be strange that the East has a different 
economic structure but history explains it. However, so far, 
Canada's unemployment insurance has taken these different 
economic structures into account. And I could go on, Mr. 
Speaker. How many will be affected in Ontario? In all of 
Ontario, how many will be affected? That is an interesting 
question. We could hold a lottery with that. According to 
Employment and Immigration Canada's estimates, 305.
<P>
	How many will be affected in Manitoba? Two hundred and 
five. This is 205 too many. In Saskatchewan? Zero. Alberta is 
also a winner: zero. In British Columbia? Eight hundred and 
fifteen.
<P>
	These figures are telling. Why have UI cuts been made in this 
fashion? The government wilfully targeted those who live in an 
economy based on seasonal employment and who try to survive 
by doing odd jobs. These are economies where, unlike in 
Ontario, there are fewer good jobs, that is permanent jobs. This 
is the truth. Perhaps those who drafted this legislation do not 
realize that it is not out of laziness, carelessness or contempt 
that a very large number of Canadians have short-term jobs 
which, from time to time, force them to rely on UI benefits, 
never knowing if they will be able to find another job the 
following year. Well, now these people know; they know that 
they will not be able to work next year.
<P>
	According to this very interesting study, the number of those 
people who will eventually have to go on welfare is not known. 
Yet, social assistance estimates for provinces are established on 
that basis.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	There are two other types of cuts which will particularly 
affect people who use up their UI benefits. Again, the big losers 
will be those living in eastern provinces.
<P>
	Some, including members of this House, may laugh. Let me 
tell them what Alain Dubuc wrote. Mr. Dubuc is an editorial 
writer in <I>La Presse</I>, an economist by training, and he is certainly 
not a spokesperson for community groups. He wrote: 
``Axworthy is making a mistake-'', the expression hon. 
minister is missing because this is a quote, ``-because he is 
cutting before helping. I too deplore the fact that so many 
people, in Quebec and in Canada, have to rely on that program. 
But it is a mistake to think that we will succeed by depriving 
them of UI benefits, without programs and a policy to give them 
hope of finding work-''. We can talk about hope but in reality 
there is more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4627"> 4627 </A></B>
<P>
despair than hope for these people, and this is something which 
can also trigger instability.
<P>
	This morning we were told that the UN is starting to make a 
parallel between the resurgence of trouble in the world and the 
rise of poverty. Those who enjoy job security for five years or 
who, in some cases, are sheltered from financial setbacks 
forever cannot imagine, from the comfort of their homes, that 
there are people who depend solely on UI benefits or welfare, 
whose lives are in the hands of a civil servant who will decide if 
they are entitled to UI benefits and for how long, people who 
keep submitting their resumes and hoping for training programs 
that are not available.
<P>
	The truth is not what we are hearing here today, that 
Parliament should ensure that all Canadians have access to 
training. The truth is that there are a great many people waiting 
to take part in training programs which are not accessible to 
them. That is the truth. We are in the middle of a psychodrama 
here with, on one side, all of the lazy people who do not want 
training and, on the other side, the Liberal government acting 
like a saviour and saying: ``First, we will reduce you to poverty 
and then we will urge you to get some training and go back to 
work''.
<P>
	To think like that, you cannot be living in the real world. You 
must, however, have a vision of what development and hope 
should be. As far as I am concerned, this bill deals a severe blow 
to the Atlantic provinces. The vast majority of the people in 
Atlantic Canada voted for the Liberals. And with no warning 
whatsoever, from what we can tell, they will now end up with an 
economy in worse shape than ever, because the infrastructure 
programs also included in the budget will not begin to offset the 
economic impact of cuts to the unemployment insurance 
program.
<P>
	The Atlantic provinces stand to lose $630 million. This 
shortfall of $630 million will not be offset by the Groundfish 
Adjustment Program. This is a very sad day indeed, because it 
seems to me that ideology is taking precedence over the real 
needs of ordinary people. The government is proceeding with 
cuts without having a real employment policy.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	An hon. member opposite said the Bloc Quebecois never 
made a single constructive proposal. Well, from the very 
beginning, in committee and in the House, we mentioned the 
need for a genuine job creation policy. In Quebec, we call that a 
full employment policy, a pro-active employment policy.
<P>
	In the committee on which I sit, I had to make a big fuss before 
they would invite someone who is an expert, not on 
mini-measures, mini-reforms and mini-programs but on the 
kind of pro-active employment policy that involves a large 
number of components and instruments and whose chief 
characteristic is the basic and abiding concern of the 
government for job creation; not employment created at the cost 
of productivity but an employment policy that would require 
taking a closer  look at all the measures taken by the 
government, in the light of the need to deal with unemployment.
<P>
	Last night I read a very interesting document by one of the 
advisors on the task force of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. It started by stating that, in Canada, governments 
have not been concerned about employment. Incidentally, the 
same advisor was deputy minister at Employment and 
Immigration Canada for a number of years. I think that is an 
interesting point. And I think he underestimates an aspect that 
we in Quebec have developed, perhaps because we were hit 
harder by the first recession, and I am referring to the need for 
consultation between companies, workers represented by their 
labour organizations, regional interest groups and governments. 
Consultation has to be learned, and let me tell you, from what I 
have seen of the government opposite, it has yet to realize that 
consultation is necessary.
<P>
	I wish, and I consider this another constructive proposal, that 
the government in its search for a job creation policy would 
realize that consultation is essential. What does Bill C-17 do? It 
starts by destroying the trust that is a necessary part of the 
consultation process. The government starts by saying: Cut 
unemployment insurance, and cut in the Maritimes and Quebec, 
before our social reform and before we consult people, and 
freeze public service compensation before starting a genuine 
discussion but do not touch corporations, the tax treatment of 
the rich, tax shelters or trusts. And then they say: Let us consult!
<P>
	There are words to describe this, but they would be 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	Oh, and another thing, Mr. Speaker, I want to say I am very 
disappointed that we did not have an opportunity to discuss the 
amendments one by one in the House. And I also want to 
mention a point that is very important, and I am referring to the 
negative impact on the economy. I will be brief, since my 
colleagues will get back to this later on.
<P>
	I wanted to say that the money that will not go to the provinces 
is money that was used to pay for basic necessities, including the 
rent. This means small landlords will be affected because it will 
be harder to collect the rent. The money was used to pay for food 
and for all those basic necessities that are often produced locally 
and are in fact part of the economy of each community, of my 
riding, of your riding and of the regions. It is money that will not 
go into the economy. It affects the most vulnerable members of 
our society. It affects those who already have no security in their 
lives. It affects those who often make seemingly irrational 
decisions. It affects people on welfare who, once a month, 
receive a cheque many members here would spend in less than a 
week-end, and people who depend on their unemployment 
insurance cheque, but do not know how long they will keep on 
getting it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4628"> 4628 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The number of people who may have to rely on unemployment 
insurance is growing. I met one of them this week, he is not 
young, although many young people are affected too. He is a 
teacher with 20 years of experience, who has never enjoyed job 
security and is now unemployed in spite of having 23 years of 
schooling. He is extremely angry because when you are 
unemployed you feel as if society has no respect for human 
beings.
<P>
	Right now, how many people are in the same situation? Do not 
tell me that the budget as a whole gives Canadians hope for the 
future. In what way, may I ask? First they cut, and them they ask 
us to believe them.
<P>
	My colleague opposite who, a while ago, mentioned 
instability, reminds me of a pyromaniac who starts a fire and 
then bemoans the fact that it is burning. With its measures, this 
government is not rekindling hope for all those who live in a 
precarious situation, a situation many know nothing about, a 
situation so precarious that they end up with no self-respect, 
that they cannot have a family of their own, and that they do not 
dare look at people straight in the eyes. Unemployment 
insurance is a lifeline, and when it is taken away, you drop quite 
a few notches.
<P>
	People come to my riding office, in a panic, because their UI 
benefits are about to end and they may have to go on welfare. 
They feel as if they were falling into a big black hole. Obviously, 
we try to encourage them, but what is there to tell them except 
that the situation is extremely tough and that there are few 
opportunities?
<P>
	One wonders what kind of social and economic model forms 
the basis of this bill. By reducing the payments from 57 to 55 per 
cent for 85 per cent of the unemployed, and by reducing the 
number of weeks ever closer to half a year, we are moving 
towards the American model. Whether we like or not, this is a 
fact. The truth is that the Canadian unemployment insurance 
program resembles more and more the American one.
<P>
	A few days ago, a member from the opposite side was saying: 
``Even with today's globalization, a country remains the master 
of its social and economic organization''. In reality, the Liberals 
are pursuing the policies of the Conservatives. Or, putting it 
another way, the Conservatives, while in power, followed a 
Liberal policy. Everybody is following the policy of the 
McDonald report.
<P>
	I remind members that the McDonald report was produced by 
a commission chaired by Mr. McDonald who was appointed by 
Mr. Trudeau. The Conservatives implemented its 
recommendations and now the Liberals are implementing the 
last part, the one concerning income security.
<P>
	We cannot ignore the facts and keep on saying that the new 
Canadian jobs will be provided by China.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The pretext, heard several times in this Chamber, was that we 
have to give small and medium-sized businesses a chance. On 
that point I would like to say to my colleagues opposite that they 
are stretching the truth a bit. First, I should point out that we 
were the first, before January, to say that UI premiums should 
not increase. They were at $3 and they should have stayed at $3. 
We had proposed to freeze premiums. The government did not 
listen to us. It increased them. Now, it is bragging about the fact 
that it will lower them to $3 next January. And it adds-again 
stretching the truth-that this will create 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that by raising premiums to $3.07, the 
government has made it more difficult to create jobs this year. 
With Bill C-17, it should at least have had the decency to reduce 
the UI premium rate to $3 immediately, if this move could have 
created jobs.
<P>
	There are other ways to continue funding unemployment 
insurance without reducing the benefits of the least fortunate 
and creating in the process social and economic problems for 
those regions hardest hit. There are countries that have found 
alternative solutions. For example, why will the government not 
consider increasing the average industrial wage through 
contributions? Such a move would help to fund UI by getting 
large companies, even those with few blue-collar workers, to 
contribute without the government having to resort once again 
to lowering the benefits of the least fortunate and, in the process, 
creating additional social burdens.
<P>
	When a government drives people onto welfare and then is 
forced to invest money supposedly to convince them to leave it 
behind, then its policies are illogical. Such policies cannot, 
ultimately, create jobs.
<P>
	This bill which unfortunately will be adopted shortly is a total 
disaster. I would like to think that my hon. colleagues will be 
convinced by our comments directed to all of Canada and to all 
Canadians of the importance of equity and job creation in 
Canada.
<P>
	The government claims to be concerned about child poverty. 
However, child poverty begins with poverty in the home. 
Thousands of people are being forced into poverty and, later on, 
the government will shed crocodile tears regarding their sad 
fate.
<P>
	Before concluding my remarks, I would like to point out that 
one of the many provisions in this bill has not been given a 
sufficiently high profile-not that we have not tried to focus on 
it-is the total discretion enjoyed by the minister as far as pilot 
projects are concerned. Allow me to explain myself.
<P>
	Pursuant to this bill, when the minister designates a region to 
be the focus of a pilot project, he alone can decide whether the 
provisions will not apply to a particular group of citizens, to 
whom no recourse is available.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4629"> 4629 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	One could even wonder if that is not ``unconstitutional'' 
under the Charter. The minister selects pilot projects and, 
because of this, legislation, the application of which is usually 
general, no longer applies to a prescribed group.
<P>
	Of course, we can argue that the idea is always to improve on 
the existing legislation. But the fact of the matter is that it is not 
the case. It is not. Various conditions may be added that do not 
apply to other employees, as was recently the case in the 
adjustment program for ground fishermen.
<P>
	So, this measure in itself would have required that we take a 
closer look at it and ask ourselves if Canada really wanted to 
introduce such a discretionary measure, and give a 
minister-incidentally, a minister whose department is so large 
that one cannot help but wonder if, as in the case of the British 
Empire, the sun never sets on it, and how the minister can keep 
up his fences-that much power, without any possibility for 
ordinary citizens, except perhaps through constitutional 
remedies not provided for by the act, to protect otherwise 
recognized rights.
<P>
	As you know, in the context of unemployment insurance, 
there is always a tribunal where, among other parties, workers 
are represented. I would have much more to say, from the 
bottom of my heart, on this bill which affects all Canadians, a 
bill that divides Canada, a bill that abandons Atlantic provinces. 
We will discuss the adjustment program for groundfisheries, but 
you are not going to come and tell me that this program alone 
will revitalize the economy of that region. As I said earlier, 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec are hard hit, savagely hit, while this 
government blows its own trumpet, boasts, brags about being a 
national unity government.
<P>
	Yet, among the political parties represented in this House, 
only the Bloc called attention to this problem. I am pointing this 
out because I noticed it and I would like the hon. members 
opposite to notice it as well. They are of course bound by 
ministerial discretion. The Reform Party failed to do its job as 
the national party that it claims to be. Let me assure you 
however that our vision in the Bloc is not to destroy Canada.
<P>
	We have tried to find our place within this Canada and the 
response we got was ``no''. So, yes, we want to leave this 
confederation, but not destroy Canada, quite the contrary. All 
our action in this place, whether on cultural, social and even 
economic issues, is fundamentally constructive. Yes, we want to 
leave Canada, but we want our future friendly neighbour to be a 
strong one as well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to speak on Bill C-17, the budget 
implementation act. In my remarks I will attempt to give an 
overview of the Reform Party's position or, more accurately, 
positions on the assortment of measures that constitute Bill 
C-17 and explain why we will be voting against the bill on third 
reading.
<P>
	I will comment on the objections Reform has with certain 
aspects of the bill, but I will also give praise where praise is due. 
In fact, many of the measures contained in Bill C-17 are 
supported by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Before getting into Bill C-17 I would like to take this one last 
opportunity to speak of the government's budget and to the 
concerns my party has repeatedly expressed in the weeks and 
months since the budget was presented to this House of 
Commons. Those ideas we feel have not been heard as they 
should and have fallen somewhat on deaf ears.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make four points with regard to the budget as I 
see what has happened in this assembly since February 22. First 
of all, it is very clear that the government does not have a 
concrete deficit reduction plan. We find that most of the cuts 
were done in a haphazard way. There is no an over-arching 
direction given to those cuts. Most of the cuts are merely a 
combination of what we call Conservative policies and were a 
continuation of thrusts that were set prior to the government 
taking over in the fall of 1993.
<P>
	Cuts to such programs as unemployment insurance which 
were so eloquently talked about a few moments ago and the 
defence policy were taken before any comprehensive foreign 
policy review or a social policy review were put in place. It was 
ad hoc in nature at best.
<P>
	The target that the government has set for itself, what is called 
the 3 per cent solution, which is supposed to be based on the 
Maastricht treaty is an aberration of that treaty and not an 
accurate reflection. It does not measure what is called the net 
debt as it is in the Maastricht treaty. The Maastricht treaty talks 
about all of the net debt of a country. In the formula presented 
here by the government, provincial and municipal debts are not 
taken into consideration in seeing the difficulties we face as a 
country in terms of expending money and revenue sources that 
are available to us.
<P>
	The actions of the government are not a true reflection of what 
I would call a meaningful Maastricht treaty 3 per cent policy. I 
feel there is a gap between what should be done and what is 
being done by the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4630"> 4630 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, we feel the economic assumptions that were placed 
before us have already been thrown off course. As the Prime 
Minister noted yesterday, the Quebec situation is creating 
uncertainty and the higher rates of interest in the budget have 
not been factored in. Interest rates have climbed significantly 
higher than projected with no end in sight. Certainly the 
prospects for interest rate declines are out of the question given 
recent bond downgrades and the Quebec question that is before 
us in the months ahead.
<P>
	Most reputable economic firms have downgraded their 
growth projections after noting the interest rate increases. The 
growth in revenues that are so necessary to the Liberal plan are 
in jeopardy. Unemployment is staying stubbornly high and with 
downgrades in growth projections this key projection also 
appears to be in jeopardy. The Liberals seem to be making as 
little progress in job creation as they have made with deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	We raise the question, as we have done over and over again as 
the Reform Party: When will the Liberals realize that in our 
current situation only meaningful deficit reduction will lead to 
long term job creation in our nation? That message is clear and 
becoming more clear each day.
<P>
	The third point I wish to make is that the second phase of the 
deficit reduction plan is in jeopardy as it will be overridden by 
larger political concerns. With the looming Quebec election and 
the possibility-we hope not-of a victory of the PQ, the 
political environment for further cuts and serious deficit 
reduction is seriously in doubt.
<P>
	The active work of the Bloc in the House and out on the 
hustings to major changes in the UI system is a bad omen for 
future deficit reduction. How will the federal government be 
able to achieve significant savings when every move to do so 
will be used by the separatists, as they have done in the House 
already, as further fuel for their fire?
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	The apparent refusal of the government to clearly lay the 
groundwork for the separatist debate now can only mean that 
significant resources that are needed for deficit reduction may 
be diverted to fight battles with Quebec separatists. That is 
unfortunate.
<P>
	If I may make a comment on what the previous speaker from 
the Bloc said, when the separatists say they are not here to break 
up the country, the inferences and the actions of that party have 
already started a turmoil within our economic community. They 
are reflected in the future lives of not only businesses but 
individuals, and certainly in the overall public responsibility 
that we have in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Reformers have a plan. We are currently developing a 
comprehensive deficit reduction plan which looks at each 
department of government with a view to comprehensive cuts 
and reductions that we know will result in economic confidence 
and growth. What actions  are contemplated and what will we do 
in the months ahead? First of all, we will have a department by 
department review to determine expenditure excesses and the 
elimination of certain functions that government can no longer 
afford.
<P>
	Second, the comprehensive plan will be further developed 
over the summer and will play an integral role in the Reform 
legislative agenda for this fall. Third, the comprehensive plan 
will be presented in detail to the Minister of Finance during the 
pre-budget consultations also scheduled for the fall. I give full 
credit to the minister and the government for setting up those 
consultations. They are a first and the government deserves 
accolades for taking such action.
<P>
	Fifth, this plan will be ready for any crisis that may take place 
in our national finances. It will also function as the Reform 
platform for suggestions of future government reductions and 
future government initiatives that lie ahead as a responsibility in 
this House.
<P>
	With those few comments about the budget, I would like to 
turn back to Bill C-17, the budget implementation act. The bill 
contains many measures which, as I have said, the Reform Party 
supports. A number of the principles that underlay changes 
contained in Bill C-17 are compatible with Reform policy, yet 
we cannot support the bill and will vote against it at the 
conclusion of the third reading debate.
<P>
	Let me explain why Reform is voting against Bill C-17 
despite supporting much of its content. There are two reasons: 
the omnibus nature of the bill and the lack of an overall plan or 
vision of where these changes will lead. Let me first talk about 
the omnibus bill.
<P>
	The Oxford dictionary defines omnibus as follows: ``serving 
several objects at once; comprising of several items''. What we 
have before us today is an omnibus bill composed of five 
distinct pieces of legislation which bear little relationship to one 
another. This approach is not new and I am sure members have 
witnessed it many times in the House. Certainly I have in the 
provincial legislature of Alberta.
<P>
	Today I am reminded of an event that is somewhat similar as 
this. Some 12 or 13 years ago the government of the day of 
which the Prime Minister and a number of his colleagues were 
members tried to pass another omnibus bill. The loyal 
opposition fought back the only way it could, by refusing to 
report for the vote. As a result, the bells rang for days until the 
government finally agreed to break the bill up to allow members 
the opportunity to represent their constituents.
<P>
	The problem with omnibus legislation is that there is no way 
for an individual member to sort out the wheat from the chaff. 
One must either hold one's nose and vote in favour, which I 
suspect a good many of my colleagues on the opposite side will 
do when we come to the voting stage, particularly those from the 
east, or members will vote no, thereby risking the defeat of some 
of the  measures that they believe are good, sensible, 
progressive pieces of legislation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4631"> 4631 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Of course that is the purpose of omnibus legislation, to allow 
a government to hide a number of lemons among the Cadillacs. 
It is a procedural tactic employed to prevent members of 
Parliament from effectively representing their constituents, a 
tactic that deprives them of the opportunity to exercise their 
direction in choosing which policies they support and which 
policies they oppose.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-17, the use of this tactic forced the 
Reform Party to play politics somewhat, to engage in procedural 
games in order to represent its constituency. The only way we 
could express our support for some of the clauses in Bill C-17 
while simultaneously expressing our opposition to other parts of 
the bill, notably the clause granting borrowing authority to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, was to table a series of 
report stage amendments.
<P>
	This allowed us to break up the bill for the purposes of debate. 
It also produced a situation in which members of the Reform 
Party were forced to vote against their own amendments. I know 
a lot of members were concerned about it and raised that 
question. However, it was the only way we were able to set up a 
circumstance where we could vote on individual items in the bill 
and then be able to express our constituents' will.
<P>
	The second point I wish to make is with regard to lack of a 
plan. That is the second reason the Reform Party opposes Bill 
C-17. While we view many of the measures contained within as 
a good first step and while we support the general principle and 
the direction of some of these changes, we are troubled by the 
absence of any overall vision in Bill C-17. It is similar to the 
vision we witnessed in the budget as a whole where there was not 
a vision that was seeking some kind of a plan or a future or an 
identifiable objective for the country as a whole.
<P>
	I would like to look at the parts of Bill C-17. It consists of five 
parts as the House well knows. First, public sector 
compensation; second, reductions in the Canada assistance plan 
and the public utility income tax transfers; third, the reduction 
in transportation subsidies; fourth, CBC borrowing authority; 
and fifth, the item that is being well aired and vented in this 
assembly, unemployment insurance and the actions taken 
thereon.
<P>
	Let me deal with each one. The first one is public sector 
compensation. The Reform Party supports the government's 
move to extend public sector wage freezes for an additional two 
years. While we are troubled by some of the inequities that arise 
from the freezing of pay increments within salary grades, we are 
prepared to support this in recognition of the government's 
difficult fiscal situation.
<P>
	Some people have tried to portray the Reform Party as public 
servant bashers. This is absolutely unfair. The reason we support 
the continuation of the public sector wage freeze is because of 
the recognition that in difficult times, and these are difficult 
times, everyone must make sacrifices. While it is true that many 
in the public service have not had a raise in a number of years, 
the fairness of the wage freeze becomes apparent when we 
compare what has occurred in the private sector in this last 
recession.
<P>
	We need only ask the tens of thousands of private sector 
employees who have been victimized by corporate downsizing, 
those who have been laid off as businesses struggled to meet the 
demands of globalization. We should ask these people if they 
would have accepted a salary freeze in return for job security. I 
am sure the answer would have been: ``Yes, I am prepared to do 
that''.
<P>
	However, most of those people were laid off and are out 
looking for other ways to support their families, their mortgages 
and their responsibilities. In fact, a considerable number of 
private sector workers have gone even beyond just salary 
freezes. They have gone to salary rollbacks in order to save their 
jobs.
<P>
	This is not to be seen as a positive development but rather as 
an acknowledgement that if Canadians are to meet the 
increasing demands of the global markets then everybody, 
employer and employee, must be prepared to sacrifice in this 
partnership that is a responsibility of all of us.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	With an equally formidable problem facing the government in 
the form of our massive debt, Reformers do not see it as too 
much to ask that the public servants, who according to a recent 
study conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Businesses are paid 14 per cent more than those people in the 
private sector with comparable jobs, accept the extension of a 
salary freeze.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party, in acknowledgement of this difficult 
fiscal situation, have tried as well within our own party and our 
own caucus to demonstrate some leadership in this area by 
taking a voluntary 10 per cent to 15 per cent salary reduction. 
We are not asking the public service to do anything that we are 
not prepared by example to do ourselves.
<P>
	However, while we support the government's action in this 
area, we also believe that this alone will do very little to bring 
the government's deficit under control. It is my guess that the 
government had no idea where to cut or how to deal with the 
priorities, and it saw the salary freeze of the public service as an 
easy target and that target was placed before us in the budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4632"> 4632 </A></B>
<P>
	The next areas I would like to deal with concern the 
reductions in the Canada assistance plan and the public utilities 
income tax transfers.
<P>
	First of all, while we support reductions to the Canada 
assistance plan, transfers to the provincial governments, we 
believe that the corollary of this is that the federal government 
where it has a responsibility must give the provinces more 
freedom in adjusting to the lower level of funding. They cannot 
make ground rules that cannot be lived with within their 
economic means. If we cut funds from the provinces, then we 
must also change the level of responsibility in order that 
adjustments can be made at the local provincial level.
<P>
	If we look back when the Canada assistance plan was created, 
the federal government used its fiscal powers to intrude into an 
area that was exclusively provincial jurisdiction. It agreed at 
that time to pay 50 per cent of costs if in return the provinces 
agreed to certain national standards. That was the deal. Since 
both levels of government were happy with this cost shared 
agreement there was no problem. What we have to do is look 
ahead and see what happened.
<P>
	However, after continuous cutbacks of Canada assistance 
program transfers the federal contribution, for example, in 
Ontario today is just 29 per cent, about half of what it was in the 
first commitment that the federal government made. Yet the 
federal government at the same time insists on the provinces 
maintaining certain national standards. The government cannot 
have it both ways. There must be a change in planning, policy 
and attitude.
<P>
	If the federal government wants to continue to have the say in 
the field of welfare, a field exclusive to provincial jurisdiction, 
then it on the other hand must be prepared to pay its full share. 
That is not what I am talking about here today, but that is the 
option that should be open to the government.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party recognize that the federal government 
simply cannot afford to maintain such a level of funding. That is 
why we support a cap on the Canada assistance program. 
However, as the quid pro quo we are prepared to allow the 
provinces the freedom which I have talked about that they need 
to experiment in creating sustainable and efficient income 
support programs.
<P>
	My concern with the government's cuts to the Canada 
assistance program is that they have been made in isolation, 
with no consideration of the consequences that these measures 
will have on other aspects of Canada's income security system. 
This measure does not move the country closer to a permanent 
solution to our financial crisis; it only offloads the debt from one 
level of government to the other. We cannot afford to do that in 
our nation. It is unfair.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	As a senior government we have to take a parental 
responsibility and understand that we cannot unload the debt on 
our children, that we have to deal with the circumstance here in 
this assembly as adult, parental, responsible persons in charge 
of the program across this nation.
<P>
	We must remember in doing this that there is only one 
taxpayer and if we keep loading it down from one government 
level to another that taxpayer is going to be suffocated in this 
transfer of funding responsibility.
<P>
	I would like to now talk about the reductions in the 
transportation subsidies. The Reform supports the principle of 
reducing transportation subsidies but we question the wisdom of 
making these cuts in isolation from other measures which would 
address the various serious transportation problems facing the 
country.
<P>
	Supporting reductions in the grain transportation subsidies is 
not an easy thing for me to do. I am a grain farmer and many of 
the voters who sent the Reform Party to Ottawa have benefited 
from the Crow rates. However, we must be realists. I realize that 
the federal government simply cannot afford to continue 
subsidizing western and Atlantic transportation costs at their 
current level. Last year alone federal subsidies for the Crow 
benefit totalled $720 million.
<P>
	Unlike the government the Reform Party does have a plan. 
The Reform approach is to eliminate transportation subsidies 
and redirect the funds to the Reform Party's proposed 
comprehensive safety net programs which will defend Canada's 
food producers against matters over which they have very little 
control.
<P>
	In order to create a genuinely competitive transportation 
environment we will deregulate the rail transportation system 
and will consider privatizing the Canadian national rolling 
stock.
<P>
	Unlike the Liberal government's insensitive, across the board 
approach to reducing transportation subsidies, the Reform 
policy is a balanced one which provides support to those who 
truly need it while laying the foundations for an efficient and 
market driven transportation system that will carry Canadians 
into the 21st century.
<P>
	The next subject I would like to deal with is CBC borrowing, 
the borrowing authority that is given in this bill. It is the first 
borrowing authority to be provided to that crown corporation by 
the government through legislation.
<P>
	I want to say very clearly that the Reform Party is strongly 
opposed to the provisions in Bill C-17 that would amend the 
Broadcasting Act to allow borrowing by the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation. CBC representatives have told us 
that this $25 million would be used for a purpose that would 
provide a more business like flexibility to the organization. We 
in the Reform Party see this as nothing more than a back door 
way of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4633"> 4633 </A></B>
<P>
providing the CBC with additional funding. Rather than  coming 
through the front door as a subsidy or a grant from government it 
is another way it can access funds outside of the purview of the 
House of Commons. That is not correct.
<P>
	On a more fundamental basis, Reform feels it is time to 
re-examine the purpose and the mandate of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation. First, in this new age of satellite 
dishes and information highways, of cable TV and pay per view, 
is it realistic to expect the CBC to retain a sizeable viewing 
audience? By the CBC's own admission this audience has 
already declined to just 13.3 per cent of viewing share. It has 
diminished significantly.
<P>
	Second, is it fair to allow the CBC to straddle the line between 
market player and crown corporation? While some have called 
on the CBC to act like any other private sector business, this is 
not possible. In the private sector you have to earn a profit or you 
die.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	The CBC does not have to confront this discipline of the 
marketplace. It does not matter if it loses staggering sums of 
money. At the present time as Canadians we are subsidizing it. 
Many Canadians do not realize that $1.1 billion is going directly 
out of the public purse to subsidize the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. That is the way it is. The government has always 
been there to bail it out when necessary.
<P>
	We are in a period of time when this is a legitimate question. 
How can a private network like CTV be expected to compete 
against a company which has billions of dollars of government 
money behind it? This question must be addressed.
<P>
	Communication and technology are so different today than 
ever before. People who did not have access to television or 
radio at one time in our history today have that access. 
Anywhere in the world you can project television, anywhere in 
the world you can project radio or communication systems. We 
do not require a subsidized organization to meet that 
communication demand that was there at one time.
<P>
	I recall my stint at the University of Alberta where one of my 
colleagues, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, and other colleagues I 
spent time with debated this issue. At that time I supported the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on the basis that there were 
places in Canada unable to receive this communication of 
television or radio and we needed the corporation for that 
purpose. I supported it at that time. That reason is gone today. 
We have to look at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
running on its own two feet on a non-subsidized basis from the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The last item I would like to deal with is the unemployment 
insurance question which has been discussed in this assembly. 
The Reform Party supports the direction the Liberal government 
has taken in the principles it has embraced in the changes to the 
unemployment insurance plan.
<P>
	First, Reform congratulates the Liberal government for 
reducing the unemployment insurance premium rates. It has 
long been the Reform Party's position that the most effective job 
creation tool available to government is to reduce the tax burden 
of individuals and of businesses.
<P>
	Second, Reform fully supports changes designed to improve 
the link between work history and unemployment insurance 
benefits. These changes move the unemployment insurance plan 
back toward a true insurance program, as it was intended to be in 
the first place. As I will argue later, many of the other policy 
goals UI is currently serving would be better accomplished 
through other government programs.
<P>
	Third, Reform supports changes to the qualifying period, the 
benefit rate and the benefit period, all of which reduce some of 
the program's disincentives to work. While we have some 
concern about changes making it easier to allow voluntary quits 
to collect benefits, the general direction of the changes is to 
encourage people to find employment, whether it is 
self-employment or employment with another individual or 
another business firm.
<P>
	In another area, while Reform is glad to see the Liberals 
abandon the principle of universality by moving to a two tier 
benefit structure which targets those most in need, we believe 
that such means tested criteria are not suitable for an insurance 
program. Such goals should be met through other government 
programs.
<P>
	While we in the Reform Party support these actions in and of 
themselves we are disappointed that they were not part of a 
comprehensive review program, the comprehensive social 
review program that is currently going on. We feel that as with 
the rest of Bill C-17, the changes proposed in the bill are 
indiscriminate, ad hoc measures taken with little or no 
consideration as to the impact these changes will have on the 
broader network of Canadian social programs.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The government seems to have forgotten that the income 
security system of our country is not a crazy quilt of piecemeal 
programs, all existing independent of the other. Rather it is an 
intricate series of interdependent programs consciously 
designed to complement and strengthen one another to meet a 
broad range of needs faced by Canadians in their daily lives.
<P>
	In the last portion of my speech I will address the vision of the 
Reform Party of the unemployment insurance program and its 
proper place within the broader family of programs that 
constitute Canada's social safety net. It is instructive to look at 
the government's approach to UI reform, for it is representative 
of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4634"> 4634 </A></B>
<P>
the government's overall approach to the budget: ill planned, 
disjointed and demonstrating little sense of an overall objective 
or goal.
<P>
	I was struck during the finance subcommittee hearings on Bill 
C-17 by the confusion and the concern of witnesses surrounding 
one small provision of the bill, that dealing with allowing the 
government to experiment with pilot projects. Group after group 
denounced the provision.
<P>
	Some union briefs portrayed it as a back door thought to 
institute workfare or to supply business with cheaper labour. 
Others asked what criteria were being used to monitor the 
success of the pilots or even whether there were any guidelines 
on what qualified for consideration as a pilot project. A number 
asked what right the government had to appropriate moneys 
from the UI fund, moneys paid 100 per cent by employers and 
employees to develop programs that seemingly had little to do 
with providing insurance to those who had lost their jobs and 
were needing support on a temporary basis.
<P>
	The confusion became so persuasive that the hon. 
parliamentary secretary for finance felt it necessary to have a 
clarification of the criteria for pilot projects and how they would 
be funded read into the record of our meetings.
<P>
	While I am not completely satisfied with the government's 
assurances, the principle of the pilot project does not trouble me 
very greatly. Reform has always supported the idea of 
experimenting with new and innovative ways of updating and 
improving our social programs. What troubles me is the reason 
for all of the confusion in the first place.
<P>
	There was no consultation into these provisions and we 
witnessed that very clearly in each committee meeting. Where 
was the input of the people who were to be directly affected by 
these somewhat innovative measures? There was none. None of 
the business or labour organizations appearing before the 
subcommittee had been consulted on what the experimental 
initiatives should be.
<P>
	It was a top down exercise controlled by bureaucrats and 
departmental officials rather than from the bottom up involving 
the program's true stakeholders, the employers and the 
employees who fund the UI program. That was a major neglect 
of government in this process.
<P>
	What were all the witnesses appearing before the 
subcommittee really saying to us? They asked whose program it 
is. The question from them was a good one. After all, 
unemployment insurance is completely self-financing. The 
government theoretically contributes nothing to UI, neither 
toward the payment of benefits nor toward the cost of 
administration. Yet it still controls the program.
<P>
	Much of what ails the UI program, the $6 billion debt, the 
inefficiencies and the allegations of abuse, stems from the 
simple fact that the original purpose of UI has been 
compromised by politicians and by bureaucrats who distorted 
the program to perform a number of functions for which the UI 
program was never intended and which it is relatively 
ineffective in performing.
<P>
	Let us look back to the 1930s and 1940s, which is far in one 
sense but not so far in another sense depending how old one is, 
when the concept of unemployment insurance was first 
originated. In those years people had in mind that it should be a 
pure insurance program, one that would provide temporary 
income support to unemployed individuals and would entitle 
contributors to benefits commensurate with their contributions.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Unemployment insurance, if we look at it today, is far from 
that ideal. Over time changes have been introduced which 
created inequities based on where one lived and caused a 
disproportionate share of benefits to flow to workers engaged in 
seasonal industries, to those who live in high unemployment 
regions and to those who live in areas with a relatively weak 
attachment to the workforce.
<P>
	I look back at the Forget commission 1985 report. In the 
report it was argued that the program's provisions for regionally 
extended benefits amounted to an income supplemental 
program rather than an insurance program. It was noted that in 
1985, nine years ago, the program's original objectives were off 
track. What has led to this drift of first principles? A conclusion 
was reached in the Forget commission report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The innumerable modifications to the program over the years were political 
compromises. A review of the history of the unemployment insurance program 
reveals that the major influences on this policy since 1940 have been the result 
not of negotiations between the employer and the employee interest but rather 
of political and bureaucratic interventions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is government that caused the distortions, not those really 
paying the bills.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party believe that ownership of the 
unemployment insurance program must be given back to the 
people who founded it and are the stakeholders in that plan: the 
employers and the employees. The case of the unemployment 
insurance is the extreme example of the phenomenon alluded to 
earlier of the federal government continually trying to have its 
cake and eat it at the same time.
<P>
	We have seen this in other areas of social assistance where the 
government freezes its contributions to the Canada assistance 
plan yet insists on continuing to have a say in how the program is 
being run. We have seen this in the area of health where the 
federal component of health care funding has eroded to the point 
where it is now in the neighbourhood of or on average 22 per 
cent of health care spending. Yet the federal government insists 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4635"> 4635 </A></B>
<P>
at the same time it has the right to tell the provinces how 
medicare should be run.
<P>
	We have said in the House in question period and through 
other mediums that the whole format should be changed so that 
the provinces can react to their own individual needs and 
circumstances under the economic situation that may prevail in 
their respective areas of the country.
<P>
	In the case of unemployment insurance the government does 
not pay a full share of the cost. It pays none of the costs. Yet it 
legislates changes which amount to expropriating moneys paid 
to the contributors, arbitrarily transferring them into certain 
categories of contributors at the expense of other categories of 
workers, or to experimental pilot projects as I mentioned a few 
moments ago.
<P>
	It is unfair. It is inefficient. It certainly should not continue. 
This program needs review like every other social program that 
is the responsibility of this assembly.
<P>
	The federal government must decide whether it is in or 
whether it is out. If it wants to continue controlling the 
principles and the administration of UI programs, and if it wants 
to continue using UI to perform other social policy objectives, it 
has a moral obligation to become a full partner in terms of 
funding the programs.
<P>
	If the federal government is not willing to assume its share of 
financing it should relinquish ownership of the programs to 
employers and employees, the stakeholders who are paying for 
and should be benefiting from unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the Reform Party's position is that government 
should return UI to its original function as a true insurance 
program and allow employer and employee groups to administer 
the program. This is not a new idea. Nor is it a radical idea, as I 
listened to the variety of groups that made presentations to us. It 
is an approach which both employer and employee groups 
appearing before the finance committee supported. These 
grassroots groups supported the concept the Forget commission 
recommended to the government of that day.
<P>
	We should listen to those representations and to what is being 
said by the private sector. It is time for government to trust 
others in terms of responsibility, to trust the provinces in terms 
of meeting some of our economic goals, and to work in 
partnership. We cannot do it alone. Nor can we take away the 
funds from those who carry out legislated responsibilities for us, 
such as provinces, such as municipalities, such as the 
unemployment commission, and so on. We have a grave 
responsibility.
<P>
	I appreciate the time I have had to spend on Bill C-17. As I 
said earlier even though the Reform Party supports a number of 
initiatives, because of the omnibus nature of the bill and because 
we feel the bill and the budget have not presented to us as 
Canadians and as legislators a good vision we have an obligation 
to vote against Bill C-17 at third reading.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We will now revert to 20-minute 
speeches.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
be able to say a few words today on this important legislative 
measure.
<P>
	When this government came to office late last year, the 
economy was stagnant and the public purse was burdened by a 
deficit exceeding $40 billion. The government reacted, 
especially in the recent budget, by opting for a balanced solution 
to turn the economy around, reduce the deficit and introduce 
social reform.
<P>
	Our goal is to substantially reduce the deficit in the current 
fiscal year while promoting an economic recovery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill we are discussing today, the budget implementation 
act, 1994, represents some measures the government believes it 
must take if we are to remain optimistic about the economic 
future of Canada.
<P>
	We believe immediate measures are necessary to reduce the 
deficit. It imposes severe constraints on economic recovery and 
growth. It imposes severe threats to programs that are important 
to all of us as Canadians: unemployment insurance, social 
programs and health services among others.
<P>
	It is fair to say that all Canadians realize we cannot blindly 
spend our way out of the financial problems facing us but rather 
we must do better with what we have. They and we realize that 
government leadership to create the climate for job generation is 
an important factor in balancing our books.
<P>
	With that in mind, I would like to focus particularly on 
measures affecting Canadians who work for the Public Service 
of Canada, the RCMP or the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	Bill C-17 extends the public service wage freeze currently in 
effect for a further two years. It suspends pay increment 
increases for a two-year period and enables payments to be 
made to full time employees of national defence who are retiring 
under a civilian reduction program.
<P>
	Solving our fiscal problem required taking more restraint 
measures in operating budgets. Public service salaries account 
for a major portion of federal expenditures. The total 
compensation cost of the government including the military and 
the RCMP amounts to some $19 billion. Any measure to control 
the deficit must therefore take these costs into account. Freezing 
salaries and pay increments will contribute $1.5 billion in 
savings over the next three years.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4636"> 4636 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We know the debt and deficit problem will not be solved only 
by cuts to the public service. The entire cost of operating the 
Government of Canada is $20 billion out of total government 
expenditures of approximately $168 billion. The compensation 
cost of the public service employees who run that government is 
$12 billion, considerably less than 10 per cent of the budget of 
Canada.
<P>
	Given this morning's clippings, I would like to comment on 
the report of the C.D. Howe Institute. It has identified further 
cuts to public service wages and government operating costs as a 
major candidate for government reductions. I must admit I am 
confused. Not long ago the Conference Board of Canada was 
telling Canadians that a freeze on public sector wages at the 
federal level would have a dampening effect of 1.5 per cent on 
economic recovery that would be even further intensified if the 
example was followed by provincial governments and the 
sectors at other levels.
<P>
	As I said, we realize the debt and deficit problem cannot be 
resolved only by cuts to the public service. Therefore we have 
implemented many other cuts in an attempt to achieve the deficit 
target we have set for ourselves.
<P>
	Many have questioned why pay increments were suspended in 
addition to the wage freeze. The answer quite simply is fairness. 
Increments were frozen because it is important that all public 
service employees be treated equally in this difficult time. It did 
not seem to us to be fair that some people working for the public 
service were seeing their salaries rise while others were not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I know very well that some consider these measures to be 
severe, but it is important to place them in their proper context. 
The government is committedto maintaining job security for its 
employees. In its opinion, extending the salary freeze and 
suspending pay increments are better ways to control public 
spending that forced leave, wage reductions and layoffs. In 
addition, this approach will minimize the impact on our ability 
to offer quality services to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I recognize there is concern over potential job losses. While 
there have been layoffs and wage rollbacks in the private sector 
and in other public areas, our government is committed to 
maintaining a high level of job security in the public service. 
Despite these measures, our government is taking a number of 
steps to rebuild a positive and constructive relationship with the 
public service.
<P>
	We believe that our best allies in controlling government 
expenditures while maintaining the delivery of quality services 
to the people of Canada are the people who work for the 
Government of Canada. That is why in the budget we committed 
to undertake an efficiency  review in co-operation with the 
unions. Any efficiency savings in government operations 
identified through this process will be used to shorten the period 
of the wage and increment freeze.
<P>
	These discussions have begun and are addressing 
longstanding concerns of our employees, such as contracting for 
service and the use of temporary employees from outside the 
government. Already we have been able to show that under the 
previous government while departments were being downsized, 
while Canadians were being told that costs were being reduced 
in this manner, the cost of contracting actually increased at a 
rate 43 per cent higher than other government expenditures.
<P>
	The efficiency review is not limited to these two areas, 
although they are certainly a prime concern to our employees. 
We are prepared to consider any area of government spending 
that the unions, our employees, our managers, or indeed 
members of this House of Commons believe should be looked at 
in terms of their efficiency in delivering quality services to 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a new process and naturally enough, there is some 
apprehension on both sides as to how successful it will be. A 
great deal of time and effort is needed on both sides to ensure 
that a relationship of trust is built up so that we can work 
together on this.
<P>
	In addition to a close examination of contracting as part of the 
efficiency review, the President of the Treasury Board has asked 
a committee of Parliament to undertake a full review of 
contracting and to prepare a report to the House. Throughout 
government as well, deputy ministers have been asked to work 
closely with the unions representing their employees and indeed 
with their employees at all levels to find the necessary means of 
meeting their operating cost reductions.
<P>
	I believe that by working together we will be able to identify 
those savings that will not affect the delivery of services to 
Canadians but will allow the period of the wage and increment 
freeze to be shortened. It will allow us to assure Canadians that 
we are working to get the best possible value for the dollars they 
pay in taxes.
<P>
	This is the first opportunity employee representatives have 
had to work with the government, to work with their employer, 
to help manage the difficult economic situation we face and the 
changes it necessarily entails.
<P>
	The unions have correctly made the point that the pay 
increment freeze will affect proportionately more women than 
men employees. At the same time I should indicate that for our 
lowest paid employees earning under $30,000 proportionately 
more women than men have benefited from reclassifications and 
promotions which have improved their earnings, even during 
the period of the wage freeze. Nonetheless it is the case that 
approximately two-thirds of employees at the lowest salary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4637"> 4637 </A></B>
<P>
levels are women. It is of course at these levels that a wage 
freeze has the greatest impact.
<P>
	That is one reason I am proud to say the President of the 
Treasury Board has already initiated discussions with the two 
largest unions representing those employees in female 
dominated categories of work to explore ways of resolving the 
pay equity issue. For many years outstanding pay equity 
complaints have been making only slow and painful progress 
through the human rights tribunal process. We would like, if at 
all possible, to work with the representatives of the employees 
to settle these complaints by negotiation, thereby improving the 
economic status of more than 60,000 employees in female 
dominated groups in the public service.
<P>
	For the first time, public service unions were involved in 
prebudget consultations, as were many other Canadians. We 
realize the period of time for these consultations was short. We 
realize the amount of impact they could have on the budget was 
limited because of that. We will in fact be conducting those 
consultations much earlier in the process for the 1995-96 
budget.
<P>
	Many proposals made to us in these consultations by the 
public service unions and by others were implemented in this 
budget or are being reviewed for possible implementation in the 
1995-96 budget. It is worth mentioning a few.
<P>
	Corporate profits transferred out of Canada that were not 
previously subject to taxation will now be subject to taxation in 
Canada. The capital gains tax exemption is being removed. Tax 
deductions for business meals and entertainment have been cut 
to 50 per cent. Operating budgets were reduced to reflect our 
government's red book commitment to reduce spending on 
contracting for professional services.
<P>
	As far as items proposed by our unions and by others to be 
reviewed for possible inclusion in the next budget, among them 
I include such things as RRSPs and their role in providing for the 
future of Canadians, and the taxation of family trusts.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	The other message we got very loudly and clearly from the 
unions representing government employees was do not roll back 
wages, do not enforce unpaid leave, do not lay off. That is why 
this government has renewed its commitment to the workforce 
adjustment policy.
<P>
	This policy was negotiated with the unions and has been in 
effect. The previous government threatened to legislate this 
policy out of existence. We have said quite clearly that we are 
committed to the workforce adjustment policy. Changes we 
might want and changes the unions might want are now being 
negotiated. Any changes will be subject to agreement at the 
bargaining table.
<P>
	This government recognizes and values the important role 
members of the public service play in the governance of the 
nation. Without them, no law, no policy, no program we approve 
in this Parliament can be implemented. They keep our food, our 
skies and our borders safe. They perform needed research, 
provide rescue operations at sea and deliver pension cheques to 
millions of Canadian seniors.
<P>
	Our government intends to restore the relationship of mutual 
trust with the public service. Both unions and managers will be 
involved in the broadest possible dialogue on matters of concern 
to them as our employees and as our partners in delivering 
quality, efficient and cost-effective services to Canadians.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to emphasize that this government 
recognizes these measures are difficult but are necessary as part 
of a number of measures to control public spending. They are 
necessary to maintain both employment security for our 
employees and quality service for Canadians.
<P>
	Recovery must start somewhere and these measures are only 
part of that recovery. If we are to meet our objective of a deficit 
which is no more than 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 then all 
Canadians, public service employees and ourselves included 
will have to realize that our future prosperity depends on the 
action we take today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
surprised to hear the hon. member who just spoke touting the 
benefits of such a direct, sneaky attack in one of its first pieces 
of legislation; it is sneaky because the Liberal Party never talked 
about it or discussed it in the election campaign.
<P>
	She is taking a completely different line than the Liberal 
members took when they were here in the opposition and the 
Conservative government attacked federal public servants and 
the whole federal policy and administrative machine through 
legislation.
<P>
	Suddenly, they only see benefits in a measure announced by 
the Minister of Finance. That measure is devoid of content or 
any long-term vision; it just sets up 22 committees to study this 
and that, but when it comes to public servants, they are hit hard. 
Their salaries are frozen much more drastically than under the 
Conservatives, because pay increments are also frozen. This 
means that someone who works at a certain level, gains 
experience, wins a competition and advances to a new position 
keeps the same salary, even if the level changes. That is 
incredible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4638"> 4638 </A></B>
<P>
	So what does this mean for the lowest-paid people who enter 
the public service? They want to rise in the public service. They 
apply for new positions, but if they obtain one, their salary is 
frozen. That was not the case when the previous government 
froze public servants' salaries.
<P>
	So the lowest-paid people in the public service are penalized. 
I am surprised to hear the hon. member praise such dictatorial 
action taken against public servants.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member who just spoke if it was one of your 
election promises. During the election campaign, you never 
talked about attacking the public service. But it is typical of the 
Liberal Party to do the opposite when it takes power.
<P>
	We will remember the wage freeze in the Trudeau years, 
against Stanfield. He promised that he would never freeze 
salaries, but Stanfield, during the election campaign, wanted to 
freeze them. Six months later, the Liberals froze salaries.
<P>
	What is really going on? The Conservative and Liberal 
policies are exactly the same. In fact, the Liberal policy is even 
worse in this case, in terms of thrust and dictatorship over the 
public service with the salary freeze, the total lack of 
negotiations and the denial of the right to strike. What good is 
the right to negotiate if it is denied before even beginning and if 
new rules are imposed by orders in council?
<P>
	You referred to possible discussions concerning women in the 
public service, because they are the most discriminated against 
by this measure, but you are prepared to discuss after the fact. 
You allude to consultations after saying: ``This is it: salaries are 
frozen and programs are cut. Do your share''. I ask the hon. 
member: Why is the sacrifice which you are asking from civil 
servants and unemployed people so great-we are talking 
billions of dollars, here-when you do not ask the rich to make a 
sacrifice too?
<P>
	You are considering looking into tax havens. We all know that 
16 billion dollars are hidden in tax havens every year; this 
represents hundreds and hundreds of millions! But no! You 
would rather protect the rich, who finance your party as well as 
the Conservative Party. You should have denounced this 
situation as soon as you took office; you should have told these 
people that they would have to pay taxes like everyone else. 
Why do you not go after these people? Make them do their share, 
with their hundreds of millions!
<P>
	They are not doing it! It is easy to force the unemployed, the 
poor and the civil servants to do their share. This is what is not 
logical in the hon. member's argument. What is her government 
doing about tax havens, family trusts, and rich families who 
resort to lobbying? It was mentioned in an article that Prime 
Minister Mulroney had been the victim of the lobby 
representing rich families. The same is true in the case of the 
current Prime Minister: He is a victim of the same lobbying by 
rich families.
<P>
	Why do these people have the right to carry over their family 
trusts, right down to the youngest survivor? In 1972, the act 
provided that 21 years later, in 1991, an evaluation would be 
made of family trusts, so that the rich were going to pay taxes 
like everyone else. Yet, this review is now being postponed and 
you are responsible for that situation.
<P>
	I remember that, when you formed the opposition, you 
questioned that for a long time. So, I ask the hon. member: Was 
the salary freeze in the public service, including the pay 
increments, an election promise you made after denouncing 
such a measure when you were in the opposition?
<P>
	Is this a permanent denial of the right to negotiate, and when 
will you also make the rich pay?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not at all surprised that the 
hon. member remembers so well what happened during the last 
Parliament and especially the salary freeze introduced in this 
House by the government he, his leader and many several other 
members of his party were part of. At that time, I would have 
liked to hear the hon. member say what he just said.
<P>
	I would like to correct some of the statements the hon. 
member made. I am sure it was a mistake and that he did not 
intend to misinform public servants, but he did say that public 
servants would not get a salary increase even if they accepted a 
new position. That is not true.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I do not mind if the hon. member takes part in this debate, but 
I want him to stick to the truth. I want to remind him that it was 
the government which he, his leader and many members of the 
Bloc were part of that maintained the tax exemption for family 
trusts for another generation. It was not a decision made by this 
government, but we are trying to find a way to right the wrongs 
for which the previous government is responsible.
<P>
	Of course, my government and I are not happy about the tough 
measures we have to take, but these decisions have to be made if 
we want to give our employees the assurance that they will not 
lose their job or see their salary decrease. We know this is a 
tough measure for civil servants to accept, but it is also 
necessary for their job security.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-17.
<P>
	This bill is almost symbolic, because in it the government 
turns its back systematically on its political commitments, a 
government that was elected on a promise that it would put 
Canada back to work and that has now reversed its position. It 
decided that it is was back to the old routine, that nothing had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4639"> 4639 </A></B>
<P>
changed, although it promised something quite different during 
the election campaign.
<P>
	Instead of proposing a strategy to promote employment, it has 
proposed the very opposite. Let me explain.
<P>
	First of all, the number of weeks worked to be entitled to 
unemployment insurance has been increased. Instead of ten 
weeks of work to be eligible for employment insurance, people 
now need twelve weeks. In the Magdalen Islands, for instance, 
43 per cent of the people who are on unemployment insurance 
cannot find work for more than 10 weeks. Today, I imagine the 
voters who elected the Liberal candidate in 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine must feel betrayed, 
because the 43 per cent who worked only the minimum number 
of weeks will now have to go on welfare.
<P>
	There was no consideration for the seasonal aspect of the 
economy in the Maritimes and especially in the Magdalen 
Islands. Even worse, the government is doing the exact opposite 
of what it promised during the election campaign, so it is also a 
matter of political ethics, and perhaps that is the worst aspect of 
Bill C-17. The bill could be seen as a symbol of the 
ineffectiveness of this government and of the way it has started 
to mislead the people during its first mandate and its first six 
months in Parliament.
<P>
	And the same holds true for the reduction in weeks of 
benefits. Speaking on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. 
member for Mercier explained how this bill would have a 
negative impact on all parts of the Maritimes, not only on the 
people affected by unemployment insurance cuts who will now 
have to go on welfare, but also on the small businesses that 
depend on the money these people spend.
<P>
	I find it very hard to understand why members from the 
Maritimes who were elected by their constituents to provide a 
different kind of government have chosen to remain silent today 
and are not rising in the House to call their government to order 
and to say this does not make sense and it cannot send this kind 
of message. The unemployed are getting the following signal: 
the government is first going to make it harder to be eligible for 
unemployment insurance benefits, and then they will introduce 
social reform.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	This could explain in part the comment by Wood Gundy in an 
investor's guide which says that in the defence sector the 
government has finally decided to use restraint, but that the 
measures announced so far impact only on a small part of the 
economy. This means that instead of a real employment strategy 
we are given a series of smaller decisions taken to respond to 
fiscal pressures, to soothe lenders. The original solutions that 
voters expected to put Canada and Quebec back to work have not 
been forthcoming.
<P>
	Another thing which was clear and simple, and that we 
proposed in an amendment rejected by the Liberal government, 
was a lowering of premiums paid by employers. In the fall of 
1993, immediately after the election, the government pulled one 
over on us and increased the premiums to $3.07. Then, for Bill 
C-17, it made a wonderful announcement. In a press release 
dated March 16 the minister says: ``One of the measures is the 
lowering of unemployment insurance premiums, which will 
decrease the cost of job creation''.
<P>
	This lowering to $3 is scheduled for 1995. Tell me, do you 
know any unemployed who have long term jobs? I would like to 
know them. We must create jobs now, not just next year. It is not 
next year, or the year after or just before the next elections. The 
economy needs to be revived now. Wood Gundy said something 
I find very apt about the budget: ``The government is hoping for 
a cyclical recovery of the economy to revive job creation''. 
What it means is that the government machine is on automatic. 
What the government said is: ``We do not have the means, we do 
not have the guts to make fundamental changes, and we do not 
have any clear idea of what we want in terms of job creation''. 
So we have a piecemeal approach, we have measures that allow 
us to wait for a recovery. I am sure that every day, every month 
end, the ministers wonder whether the unemployment rate will 
finally go down a little, so they can use it as an argument. None 
of their actions has any impact. The automatic pilot is on, and we 
are waiting to see if the economy will recover somewhere.
<P>
	Moreover, they are killing consumer confidence for those 
who could help the economy recover, namely UI 
recipients-who are also consumers-and civil servants whose 
wages are frozen.
<P>
	Only a few months after being elected, this government told 
people: ``We do not trust you. We will not enter into bargaining 
with you on behalf of others, since we would not be able to 
agree, anyway''. It said that, just after the elections, to the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada which had told its members 
to vote for the Liberal Party in order to bring about changes. 
This government is devoid of political honesty and sends the 
message that, once elected, it does not have to honour its 
commitments. It is pure rubbish, of course. The way the Liberal 
government betrayed its campaign promises, especially with 
Bill C-17, will come back to haunt it.
<P>
	Allow me to give you a little inkling of what this government 
is really like. During the election campaign, we were told that it 
would cut waste, tighten up the public purse, and manage 
everything as best as possible.
<P>
	And then, it tries to put one over on us with this bill, giving 
borrowing authority to the CBC, a corporation which, in the 
past, has not always been the best of managers, and in fact, has 
often spent money unwisely and is still doing so. As we know, it 
offered $28 million for the TV rights to the next Olympic 
Games, whereas TVA had offered $10 million, while claiming 
that it had  made no profit. Can you imagine the taxpayers' 
money being used to broadcast a world event for three weeks? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4640"> 4640 </A></B>
<P>
People in my riding find it totally unacceptable to spend $28 
million that way, when the entire network of CBC regional 
stations has been closed down, and to see that the Liberal 
government has never said a word to reverse that decision. This 
kind of attitude is a slap in the face of people who are entitled to 
regional services. The government is taking advantage of an 
omnibus bill to put one over on us quickly as far as borrowing 
authority is concerned, without requiring the corporation to 
account in any way for the use of these funds.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Even when I give my children an allowance, I ask them to tell 
me a little how they plan to use the money. In some cases the 
government lends money and asks for an accounting, while in 
this instance, it is giving the corporation a $25 million margin to 
manoeuvre, without asking it for any king of accounting. This is 
another example of how this government behaves: as if it had 
been in power for eight years and was totally incapable of 
coming up with any fresh ideas or solutions to problems. The 
fact is that this government is only beginning its mandate. In its 
first few months in office, it has introduced a bill which 
systematically reneges on the commitments made during the 
election campaign.
<P>
	I want to come back briefly to the issue of employer 
premiums. On the one hand, the government creates a nice, 
politically correct program such as the Infrastructure Program 
which allows it to announce in various locations available 
seasonal, temporary jobs. On the other hand, it introduces a 
measure which is not as glamorous as the Infrastructure 
Program, but which would allow those who create the most jobs, 
namely small and medium-sized businesses, to be active and 
give some confidence back to people. So what does the 
government do? It tells businesses to wait until 1995 for the 
premium level to be brought back to $3 per $100. In other words, 
it is sending out a message that job creation is not such a priority 
after all, that the machinery of government will lumber on, that 
the unemployment rate will fall one day and that jobs will 
ultimately be created.
<P>
	Basically, this is typical of a government that has decided not 
to honour the promise it has made during the election campaign 
to give priority to job creation, to put the people of Quebec and 
Canada back to work, especially young people. Take for 
example the 4,000 engineers in Quebec who are out of work. 
Would it not be possible to develop some aggressive 
job-creation programs to provide work for these people?
<P>
	I would say that, as far as job creation is concerned, this 
government does not make the grade. It is a failure. During the 
summer holiday just a few weeks away, wherever we go, if we 
visit campgrounds or attend any number of functions, people are 
going to tell us: ``You politicians are all the same. You make 
election promises you never keep''. That about sums up what 
this  government, a government that wanted to give people hope, 
has accomplished.
<P>
	I derive great pride from the fact that, for various reasons, the 
people of Quebec have decided that this government did not 
have what it took in terms of commitment, I mean the necessary 
level of credibility to honour its commitments. In that respect, 
we can be pretty proud of ourselves in Quebec. The people have 
voted for a party capable of representing them in the opposition, 
to make itself heard and state clearly what commitments have to 
be fulfilled in Quebec. There is nothing in Bill C-17 to give 
people hope.
<P>
	When you tell people in need of a job: ``The first thing we are 
going to do for you is to require that you work more weeks to 
qualify'', you kill their confidence in the economy and 
contribute to maintaining the negative dynamics by which fear 
is fostered.
<P>
	Bill C-17 was a golden opportunity for the government to put 
its cards on the table. Such a bill could have been used to address 
problems like tax havens and family trusts. Where in this bill are 
there measures affecting well-off people who could make a 
significant difference in terms of creating jobs? They have not 
be called on to help create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In fact, this bill is somewhat reminiscent of the budget as a 
whole. The Liberal government prepared a budget that was a 
little lazy. It could have taken advantage of the momentum 
created by its election to bring together all segments of 
Canadian society, including employers, unions and social 
groups, and ask them in December 1993: ``What shall we do to 
stimulate employment?'', to clearly show we must join forces 
on this.
<P>
	Their budget consultation process was a bit of a sham because 
they did the opposite of what the people told them to do. They 
decided to throw out the old files prepared by the bureaucrats 
and to recycle the Campbell material into the Martin material. 
They continued to act like before without really stimulating 
employment.
<P>
	I think this government relies way too much on the four-year 
mandate that lies ahead, telling itself: ``We will hand out the 
usual goodies at the end of our mandate to ensure that we get 
re-elected''. But they forget that their mandate is not to win the 
election but to offer good government, to ensure that Canadians 
have jobs that they like and that they can do something with it.
<P>
	I would also like to let you know that some people asked this 
morning: ``How can the people opposite-that is, Bloc 
members-criticize such a bill when what they want is to break 
up Canada?''
<P>
	Instead of scaremongering, I can tell you that in proposing our 
amendments to Bill C-17, we tried to defend the interests of 
Quebecers. When we say that increasing the number of weeks of 
work required to qualify for UI goes against common sense, you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4641"> 4641 </A></B>
<P>
can be sure that in my region, in the Lower St. Lawrence, the  
Gaspé and the islands, everyone understands what it means.
<P>
	This bill does not bring into question Canada's structure but 
rather the efficiency of this government. It offers a number of 
little recipes, of mini-measures, that did not convey to anybody 
the message that the first budget of the Liberal government 
would really emphasize job creation. They decided to give a 
little to everyone and tried to get by on a traditional economic 
recovery.
<P>
	Although these people call themselves experts and say they 
are concerned about the economy, I think there is a lack of 
vision. They did not see that North America and the entire 
Western world are currently undergoing deep structural changes 
and that such measures will not provide Quebec and Canada 
with the tools they need to hold their own in the new global 
economy.
<P>
	I think that Bill C-17 is unacceptable. I am thinking 
especially of members who represent ridings in eastern Canada. 
Personally, if I were a member from the Maritimes and I voted 
for this bill, I think that I would find the coming summer, fall 
and winter very long, because after the summer when a few 
seasonal jobs are available, people will face the fall and winter 
and, if they did not work the minimum number of weeks, they 
will end up on welfare. They will have less to spend on consumer 
goods and this will affect the whole economy of eastern Canada.
<P>
	If this had been presented by a Conservative government, we 
would have said that they were keeping their commitments, 
people elected them for that, we may agree or not, but they 
would be doing what was expected of them. But this is presented 
by a government that said it would be different, a different kind 
of government that would change things and take a different 
approach to the economy and make job creation a priority. And 
nowhere do we find any of these things there.
<P>
	All we find, and I think that I will conclude with this, is a 
budget whose only purpose is to make some lenders feel secure 
and it does not even achieve this result.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The people who lend money to Canada now did not applaud 
this budget; they just said that they thought the real Liberal 
budget would come next year. There was no Liberal budget, it is 
the same as the Conservatives'. The message given to the senior 
federal public service is that things are all right and that we will 
continue as before; with this government, we will continue to 
pass on our good figures, our good results, and our vision of 
development, whereas the people who were elected, especially 
the 200 or so new members, whatever their party, certainly came 
here to manage Canada differently from the way it was run in the 
past and to make Canadians feel that changes were being made.
<P>
	If they said that they would tackle unemployment head on, it 
would have had a small effect on inflation, but I think that the 
people would have been prepared to accept it because they have 
suffered so much from the negative consequences of 
unemployment. A whole generation was sacrificed. When you 
look at the résumé of someone who is 25, 30 or 35 years old, you 
see that they worked on a project for three months, then were 
unemployed for six months, worked on another small project for 
two months and then were jobless for a year. That generation 
will not have the skills needed to take over when the time comes.
<P>
	Bill C-17 is important for the government, because it will be 
judged by it. The people in our communities will not say that 
Bill C-17 is a bad piece of legislation. Instead, they will say that 
the Liberal government does not keep its promises or its 
commitments and that it has absolutely no credibility. The 
people will easily come to those conclusions, because they can 
expect nothing concrete to come out of these measures, nothing 
that would prove that economic recovery is on the way.
<P>
	We will eventually achieve economic recovery if the 
government decides to launch initiatives that bring all 
stakeholders to focus clearly on one priority, job creation. By 
telling small employers that, in 1994, they will get $3.07 for 
every $100, the government is sending them the message that 
they need not put so much emphasis on job creation, because it is 
not giving them the flexibility they need to create more jobs.
<P>
	All of the provisions included in Bill C-17, whether it is the 
increase in the number of insurable weeks to become eligible for 
UI benefits, the reduction in the weeks of benefit, the salary 
freeze for civil servants, or the unaccountable borrowing 
authority given to the CBC, send out a very clear message to 
Canadians, which is that the current government has decided not 
to honour its commitments, but instead to watch the economy 
from the sidelines rather than play an active role in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
very much appreciated the remarks of my colleague opposite 
and I listened to them with great attention. I certainly appreciate 
the sincerity with which he made many of his points and I think 
all of us on all sides of the House are very conscious of the fact 
that any changes to unemployment insurance have to be done 
with great care and forethought. Certainly to extend the number 
of weeks of eligibility for unemployment insurance is to bring a 
certain amount of hardship to some people.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he feels that 
unemployment insurance as a concept is something sacrosanct, 
that can never be touched, that can never be reformed. We really 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4642"> 4642 </A></B>
<P>
do have to look broadly across the social services in Canada 
which I think he will acknowledge we are having difficulty as a 
country affording.
<P>
	In that context, if he is going to answer yes to that would he 
then take the concept of unemployment insurance and go the 
other way? Would he reduce the number of work weeks in his 
area for eligibility and if so how can we pay for that?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I thank the hon. member for the relevance of his 
question. It is indeed a timely one.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I think that unemployment insurance is a tool which 
Canadians devised to avoid a repetition of a crisis such as the 
Depression in the thirties. At the time, there was no social safety 
net and people were no longer able to consume goods. 
Consequently, the whole economy came tumbling down. In a 
sense, the scenario is the same with Bill C-17. The government 
has decided to limit the spending power of UI recipients and the 
consequences of this decision will be similar, albeit less severe, 
to those in the thirties, during the Depression. There will be 
reduced consumption which, in turn, will mean even less jobs, 
thereby adversely affecting economic recovery.
<P>
	Generally speaking, I think that the unemployment insurance 
issue must be considered in the context of an active employment 
policy. First, the government should announce that employment 
will be a priority. Second, it should develop an appropriate 
strategy. An important aspect of such an initiative-and 
something which we have been doing in Quebec for 20 years 
now-is to consult the various stakeholders to make 
employment a priority.
<P>
	I believe it is very important, in such an exercise, to respect 
the effectiveness of local officials. In other words, if we try to 
implement the same employment policy right across Canada, we 
will experience the same problems as we did with the Bank of 
Canada trying to control the value of our dollar. Indeed, the 
Bank of Canada controlled the dollar based on the overheating 
economy of Ontario, while other parts of the country were not 
experiencing that activity. This had the effect, in those regions, 
of killing economic recovery.
<P>
	The same thing will happen with employment if we think we 
can develop an employment policy applicable throughout the 
country. Because of the issues of mobility and of different types 
of workers, I think that, at least in each of the main regions, and 
possibly in most provinces-and that has long been one of 
Quebec's claims-the whole issue of employment should be 
managed in an integrated fashion, from the training provided to 
people to the way that we deal with people who are unemployed 
and who are looking for jobs. We should to able to bring all these 
aspects together, and also avoid spending money, as we are 
doing at the manpower level, where governments are wasting 
$250 million each year only because of the double structure.
<P>
	If this decentralization were to occur in all parts of Canada, 
we would have annual savings of $1 billion which, instead of 
being spent on the structure, would be directly spent on 
providing training activities through programs allowing people 
to find jobs.
<P>
	So, concerning the question of whether unemployment 
insurance is something that can never be touched, I believe it is a 
tool. In my mind, unemployment insurance should instead be an 
employment insurance allowing people who have the ability to 
work to effectively do so and, if they worked for 15 or 20 weeks 
before their employment came to an end, they would be able to 
earn money with, for example, social, community or 
government employers, but they should not be exploited. If 
these people were trained as technicians, for example, and 
would deserve a salary of $10 an hour, we should be able to offer 
them something through the insurance which they would earn 
and which would correspond to that amount, even if it were only 
be a part-time job.
<P>
	So, some changes are possible in that area. I think that 
unemployment insurance is a tool, but it should be integrated 
into a structure, into an active employment policy so as to make 
it work. Countries where this works have given a very clear 
direction to these things.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in support of Bill C-17, the budget 
implementation act, because the bill seeks to legislate a number 
of measures announced by the minister in his budget in 
February. The bill reflects the widely shared conclusions 
reached by many Canadians from all walks of life who 
participated in the prebudget conferences. They agreed at that 
time and I believe we agree in this House that action is needed on 
three major, closely linked challenges.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	First, Canadians want the government to create job 
opportunities and to take action to restore the country's 
economic viability. Second, Canadians have called on 
government to address the deficit problem. Third, they point 
out, as they did in those prebudget conferences, the urgent need 
to reform Canada's social security programs, including 
unemployment insurance, so that these programs better serve 
those who are in need while remaining affordable for a nation 
with a growing debt. These are three important challenges: job 
creation, deficit reduction and the reform of social programs so 
that they can better serve the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	On that last point, when we gave the enabling legislation in 
this House with respect to the reform of social programs, I said 
at that particular time when this issue was under debate at least 
that reforming social programs ought not to be a code word for 
dismantling, for gutting social programs. I am careful to say at 
all times when I talk about this that it must be an effort which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4643"> 4643 </A></B>
<P>
improves, better tailors those programs for a new time, not an 
excuse for gutting those programs.
<P>
	There are people in need. There are people who depend on 
those programs. That is why I am proud to live in Canada. We 
were told this week once again that we live by internationally 
accepted criteria in the best country in the world. That comes as 
no surprise to us; even those who are working hard to leave the 
country must grudgingly acknowledge that.
<P>
	The budget addresses all three of those important elements or 
areas. There are initiatives to create jobs, including the $6 
billion shared cost infrastructure program which is now well 
under way. In so far as Newfoundland is concerned, the first 
phase was announced a month or so ago. The second phase will 
be announced tomorrow, a number of other projects that will 
help stimulate the economy and some short and medium term 
job creation.
<P>
	The budget also contains important support for technological 
innovation and for the small business sector, a subject dear to 
the heart of my good friend from Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	There is also important action in this bill, in this budget, to 
reduce the deficit primarily through cuts in government 
spending. Gross fiscal savings including the savings announced 
in previous budget secured by this legislation total $28.6 billion 
over the next three fiscal years. Net savings in that period total 
$20.4 billion. These measures will help to shrink the deficit 
from $45.7 billion in the year just ending to $39.7 billion in 
1994-95, and to $32.7 billion the year after; $13 billion savings 
in two years.
<P>
	I say to my good friend from Yellowhead, whom I am always 
delighted to see in this Chamber, it is important that the choice is 
not seen as being between jobs and the deficit. It is not one or the 
other. We would be irresponsible as parliamentarians if we saw 
it as one or the other, as if we said put the whole job need on hold 
for five years until we get the deficit under control, or put the 
deficit issue under control for five years until we get the job 
situation properly addressed. It is not that simple. Life does not 
stand still for people who have to buy the groceries, nor does life 
stand still in terms of accruing interest on our indebtedness as a 
country.
<P>
	We have to juggle those two very difficult balls at one time. 
That is the challenge. The country is full of experts there who 
will tell you how to create jobs, who will tell you how to reduce 
the deficit. The crunch comes when you ask them to hold both 
balls in the air at the same time. Whatever the rhetoric of various 
members in this House, including mine, I do not believe there is 
a single soul in this chamber who believes that we can put one of 
those issues on hold while we solve the other. That would be 
irresponsible and I do not think Canadians sent us here to be 
irresponsible.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The measures announced in this budget last February will, of 
course, be supplemented with further initiatives next year as we 
reform major spending programs. We are taking some action 
now and will take some more in the future to ensure the deficit 
continues to decline steeply.
<P>
	The budget also takes some measures to provide stable, 
sustainable funding for Canada's social safety net. This funding 
will provide a secure and constructive environment for both 
individual Canadians and policy makers at all levels of 
government as we embark on the process of reform and renewal 
that is currently under way. This legislation, Bill C-17, 
addresses two areas of spending in this regard: transfers to the 
provinces and changes to the UI program. I want to spend a 
moment on each of those.
<P>
	First, the matter of unemployment insurance, a matter that is 
dear to my heart because it is dear to the hearts of my 
constituents who, through no fault of their own, have gone 
through the following traumatic situation in the last few years.
<P>
	I say to my friend from Okanagan-Shuswap that when I first 
came here in November, 1979 my riding had a rate of 
unemployment which was the same as that in Alberta, the 
province of my friend from Yellowhead. It was 3.8 per cent in 
November, 1979. The riding of Burin-St. George's with its 
deep sea and inshore year round fishery, unaffected by ice 
conditions which have an impact on other parts of the island of 
Newfoundland, has always had a basic 11.5 month fishery, never 
a 12 month fishery. We believe strongly in certain things in 
Newfoundland and one of the things we believe in is the 12 days 
of Christmas. We take that time off for a great celebration of a 
great Christian festival and for a great party. In Newfoundland 
these two issues are not mutually exclusive.
<P>
	It is an 11.5 month fishery. It never was a 12 month fishery. I 
would oppose it from ever becoming a 12 month fishery for the 
above reasons. It has degenerated, through no fault of the hard 
working people whose ancestors came to that coast 500 years 
ago. It is certainly not laziness or what we call in Newfoundland 
being a hangashore, one who stays ashore rather than go fishing. 
We have a very provocative and descriptive term for a lazy 
person in Newfoundland; he or she is called a hangashore and by 
definition that is somebody who will not go fishing. In 
Newfoundland work is fish, basically. That is why 17,000 
people in my riding, until the recent catastrophes in the fishery, 
have traditionally earned their living either in the fishing boat or 
in the fish plant.
<P>
	I was saying to my friends from Alberta and British Columbia 
across the aisle that in 1979 the rate of unemployment in my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4644"> 4644 </A></B>
<P>
riding was 3.8 per cent, the same as in Alberta, the province at 
that time with the fastest growing economy in Canada and the 
lowest unemployment rate in Canada. My riding was identical.
<P>
	Today I could not even put a figure on it. Is it 40, is it 50, is it 
60, is it 70 per cent? It depends on what you do with all those 
people who through no fault of their own are not in the boats 
today, not in the plants today, drawing a compensation package 
as a result of the moratorium.
<P>
	This UI issue is very dear to my heart because it does affect 
some of those people. Contrary to public popular opinion in 
Ontario, I would say to my friend from 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton, all the people down there are not on 
the the fisheries compensation package. Many people in 
Newfoundland ply their trade in terms of forestry and in terms of 
seasonal construction activity, in terms of mining, in terms of 
tourism, and so on. These are impacted by unemployment 
insurance changes as well.
<P>
	These changes being proposed through this bill are designed 
to achieve a couple of things. The first is to encourage the 
private sector to create jobs. We believe firmly in this party that 
government cannot be the employer of last resort. We believe 
that government can help create the climate, but it is private 
industry, including the small business sector, which must create 
the jobs. My hon. friend from Okanagan-Shuswap agrees. He 
and I agree on many things and this is one of them. It is the 
private sector. That is one of the objectives.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The second is to increase the fairness of the system by 
increasing benefits to low income recipients with dependents. 
To help create jobs, the bill rolls back the UI premium for 1995 
and 1996 to $3. We believe and we hope this payroll tax relief 
will encourage business to create jobs.
<P>
	By the end of 1996 the government expects that there will be 
40,000 more jobs in the economy than would be the case if 
premiums had been allowed to rise to the levels required by the 
previous legislation.
<P>
	Those rollbacks have to be accomplished in a way that 
supports deficit reduction. With this in mind, the legislation 
proposes measures to reduce UI expenditures by $725 million in 
this fiscal year and a further $2.4 billion annually thereafter.
<P>
	I submit that these rollbacks in expenditures are being done in 
a way that is fair so that persons in areas with high 
unemployment will still be eligible for more benefits with less 
work activity than people in other regions of the country.
<P>
	Our package of UI reforms promotes fairness in other 
respects. It increases the benefit for low income claimants with 
dependents. As well, the benefit of the doubt will be given to 
claimants who quit voluntarily. I have to say that this is an issue 
that I had a lot of difficulty with when the former administration 
brought in that change, about letting the axe fall when people 
quit or were fired because it put employees at the mercy of the 
employer in a way that they never should have been. This 
redresses that issue in a way with which I am comfortable.
<P>
	Let me come to the Canada assistance plan. To help create a 
positive, co-operative climate for social security reform, the 
government is providing a two-year period of predictability and 
modest growth in social security transfers under the Canada 
assistance plan and established programs financing.
<P>
	This means that in 1994-95 there will be no new restraint 
measures applied to either CAP or EPF transfers. The legislation 
before us today will place a ceiling on subsequent CAP transfers 
to the provinces, so they do not exceed the current year's levels. 
This ceiling will remain in place next year pending social 
security reform the following year.
<P>
	EPF financing is not affected by this legislation. However, the 
existing restraint will be maintained. The process of social 
security reform has a goal of central interest to all Canadians, no 
matter where they live, to renew and revitalize Canada's social 
security system over the next couple of years. We will preserve 
protection for those in need. We will improve incentives to work 
and we must ensure that the social safety net remains affordable.
<P>
	Bill C-17 is a key part of the government's agenda, an agenda 
that includes job creation, deficit reduction and renewal, and 
reform of our social safety net. Our mandate for this agenda 
comes from the people of Canada who entrusted us last October 
to set a new course. We, the Prime Minister and his team, are 
keeping faith with that trust by listening to what Canadians told 
us last year.
<P>
	The recent budget was an important step, an early step, a big 
step, but just one step in making our agenda a reality. That 
budget reflects clearly the input we received from Canadians as 
do the measures in this legislation. That is why I am hopeful that 
members on all sides of the House will see fit to want to identify 
with what I believe are a handful of good initiatives, not the 
whole nine yards. We are not there yet. If we, through the 
infrastructure program, the youth corps and otherwise can see 
the jobs generated that we have projected, we will create just a 
little less misery for people out there, including young people.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to achieve our goals in terms of deficit 
reduction to get it under $40 billion, to have these $13 billion in 
savings over the next couple of years, that will go a long way to 
reducing the drain on our capacity, the drain we are paying out in 
interest charges, and be able to take that and redirect it to more 
job creation, to more social program underwriting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4645"> 4645 </A></B>
<P>
	Third, if we can, over the next couple of years, reform the 
social safety net in a way that does it credit to Canadians, in a 
way that meets the needs of those who are in need, while at the 
same time crafting it in a way that is affordable for us as a 
country with severe financial restraint facing us everywhere we 
turn.
<P>
	Nobody in this Chamber, whatever their partisan platform 
during the election past, whatever their particular political 
ideology, can be against putting those young people back to 
work, putting people of all ages into productive labour activity. 
Nobody can argue with our goal of bringing down the deficit to 
free up dollars for use elsewhere. Nobody can disagree with 
what this party has said and stood by for many decades, that 
there is a group of people out there who have need for social 
programs through disability, through age, through other 
circumstance, through no fault of their own particularly, have 
need for those programs.
<P>
	There but for the grace of God go I, go you. Again I repeat I 
am proud to live in a country that has that kind of social safety 
net for people in those circumstances.
<P>
	For all of those reasons I hope members of the House would 
find it in their hearts to support with a heart and a half Bill C-17.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the member could assist us a little bit in 
understanding the relationship between these UI changes that 
are taking place in this bill and the plans that the government has 
for social security reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend 
from Windsor-St. Clair for her question.
<P>
	The important thing to keep in mind is that what we are doing 
here, and I wanted to emphasize this during my remarks, is but a 
first step, an important and integrated first step.
<P>
	I take my hat off to my friend the Minister of Finance. If 
anybody ever came well qualified for this job it has to be him, 
not only in terms of his paper credentials and his commitment to 
public life but in terms of the preparation that he did, the leg 
work he did across the country in the two or three years leading 
up to the election.
<P>
	He together with the Prime Minister have such an amazing 
grasp of the problem, it is no surprise that his first budget and 
Bill C-17 which flows from it give us the beginnings of a 
coherent, sensible is the term, approach to addressing some of 
the problems we face.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask my colleague who is more experienced in 
the House than I-he has been here at least one term 
longer-whether he could comment on some of the major points 
that the official opposition is making. Yesterday I indicated that 
in spite of the fact that they had condemned the omnibus bill, 
they had  concentrated almost specifically on unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, I wonder if he would be kind enough to give 
some commentary with respect to the major points that have 
been made by the Reform Party. I said yesterday, and I repeat it 
again today, that if Canadians believe some of the reductions 
that have taken place with regard to unemployment are severe, if 
the Reform Party had been initiating those they would have been 
Draconian and dramatic and hurt a great deal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend from St. Boniface is at 
his very best when he decides to put the cat among the pigeons.
<P>
	He did that so well at one point early in the election. I heard 
him one morning early as I was driving out to begin my 
campaign schedule for that particular day. It was just a week into 
the campaign I recall. I felt so good about what he said that I sent 
off to him a missile, which I am sure he will remember. I think I 
guaranteed I will be in his memoirs one day. It is not the first 
time he has put the cat among the pigeons.
<P>
	I have never been shy in telling my friends in the Reform 
Party on what points we disagree and on what points we agree. I 
wanted to have a moment ago a nice positive sounding speech 
because I wanted to appeal to the better judgment of people like 
my friends from Elk Island, Surrey North and Wetaskiwin and so 
on. I wanted to appeal to their better judgment that whatever the 
partisan differences here, this bill is a good bill.
<P>
	Now that my friend has put the cat among the pigeons, now 
that he has called my bluff as it were, I have to say directly what 
I said by inference. Those who think that you can put job 
creation aside until we solve the deficit problem are smoking 
something different than I am smoking. They are dreaming in 
Technicolor. You cannot put the country on hold. You cannot say 
to those people, as the former Prime Minister, the lady from 
Vancouver Centre at the time, said in the opening gaff of her 
campaign last October: ``We're going to wait until the year 2000 
to deal with job creation''. You remember that famous 
statement. We cannot do that.
<P>
	I say to my friends in the Reform Party and to the Bloc and any 
people in this party who happen to be of that particular view that 
we cannot, as a government, as a group of people's 
representative, say to people: ``Put your aspirations on hold, run 
up your grocery bill for 10 years until we get the deficit under 
control''.
<P>
	By the same token we cannot say: ``Let's have all jobs, jobs, 
jobs and ignore the deficit''. That is why I have said there has to 
be a balanced approach. Often I hear the simplistic rhetoric that 
says: ``What are you doing about the deficit today?'' The answer 
is: ``About the same as we are doing about the job creation 
today''. We are doing it hand in hand. The day you find us doing 
more about the deficit than job creation, more about the deficit 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4646"> 4646 </A></B>
<P>
than the social security net, is a day you have the formula out of 
balance.
<P>
	To answer my friend from St. Boniface, if I disagree with 
some of the people in the Reform Party, since he mentioned 
them, it is on that question of balance. I know the member does 
not want to hear this, but he is going to hear it anyway, and I am 
going to do it very quickly because my time is up. I say to them, 
if you talk to them as really free voters rather than as part of a 
monolithic host which they like to pretend sometimes, you will 
find that in their heart of hearts-yes, they all have hearts, Mr. 
Speaker, I can tell you that-they really like those people, those 
Canadians, to have some work. They are not really as 
Scrooge-like as they sound from time to time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House to offer a few comments on Bill C-17, confining my 
remarks mostly to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	My colleague from Lethbridge spoke eloquently on the 
measures we support in Bill C-17 and outlined the steps we 
would take to put our country's economic house in order.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	It has been said countless times in this House since January 
and it bears repeating, that Canada has a spending problem and 
not a revenue problem. Canada's debt is rising and will continue 
to rise at a significant rate as long as federal governments keep 
trying to push through omnibus bills like Bill C-17, the budget 
implementation act. By this time next year Canada's debt load 
will be approaching $550 billion. The debt is growing by $1,473 
per second. That means every man, woman and child in this 
country is in hock for over $20,000.
<P>
	The fact that this federal government is pushing through 
omnibus Bill C-17 which includes authorizing the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation to borrow money shows its lack of 
regard for the taxpayers of this country. I submit that the CBC is 
an ill-run crown corporation and should undergo a thorough 
review. It is a bottomless money pit. Taxpayers are sick and tired 
of having to support what seems to be a planned to lose failure.
<P>
	Bill C-17 will give the CBC the authority to borrow 
$25 million so it can operate with more businesslike flexibility. 
This is akin to not only letting the fox into the chicken house but 
also to locking the door and throwing away the key.
<P>
	I am very sceptical when the government assumes that 
borrowing $25 million would achieve more efficient 
management practices. Companies are in the business to offer 
services, sell products and to make money, not to borrow to go 
even deeper into the red. The Canadian taxpayer is already on 
the hook for $1.1 billion per year for the operation of the CBC. If 
this crown corporation cannot achieve more businesslike 
flexibility with $1.1  billion in appropriations from Canadian 
taxpayers, what possible good will come of another $25 million 
of borrowed money?
<P>
	The track record of crown corporations is not good. They are 
endless black holes where the money goes in rarely to be seen 
again. The federal government should not be competing with the 
private sector, especially when the private sector is doing the 
job. Recent history is littered with examples of defunct, broken 
down crown corporations.
<P>
	Peter Foster, who penned the book <I>Self-serve: How Petrocan 
Pumped Canadians Dry</I>, has followed the Petro-Canada fiasco 
very closely. He calculates that Petro-Canada has amassed a 
total debt of over $15 billion which of course is on the backs of 
the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Another debacle of the federal government is its involvement 
in the Hibernia project. Admittedly Hibernia was initiated by 
the former government, but it was a former Liberal government 
that caused the Petro-Canada fiasco. The government has an 8.5 
per cent stake in the Hibernia project which has cost taxpayers 
about $3 billion in loans and grants. Just last week it was 
confirmed that Hibernia has a cost overrun of $1 billion.
<P>
	When will the meddling stop? When will the federal 
government learn that crown corporations are generally a 
detriment to the Canadian taxpayer? It seems few lessons have 
been learned for the near future.
<P>
	Like most crown corporations the CBC is not like a private 
sector business and is incapable of acting as such. The CBC has 
no shareholders or customers in the normal sense to answer to. 
There is little will to strive for efficiency because there is no 
bottom line to meet. Bill C-17 will further ensure that the CBC 
will be able to operate without worrying about such minor things 
as turning a profit and generating revenue.
<P>
	Government members keep harping about their red book: 
``Read the red book. It is in the red book. We are keeping our 
promises''. That is often the type of rhetoric we hear from across 
the floor, but it appears the federal government has not quite 
been keeping its promises. The red book states that the Liberals 
will ``exercise unwavering discipline in controlling federal 
spending and will re-order current spending priorities to make 
sure that maximum return is obtained on each investment''.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-17 goes against what the Liberals promised to 
Canadians via the red book. There is no unwavering discipline in 
controlling federal spending. In fact, the portion of Bill C-17 
dealing with the CBC states that the CBC may be allowed to 
borrow an amount even greater than $25 million, with 
parliamentary approval. What is to stop the government 
allowing to lend $50 million, $150 million, or even more to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation? If the CBC is to become a 
viable enterprise it must stop trying to borrow its way to 
prosperity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4647"> 4647 </A></B>
<P>
	A recent estimate places the CBC at a $180 million shortfall 
over the next four years. The CBC currently has a $45 million 
deficit and an operating budget of over $1 billion. Any private 
business facing this kind of debt with the intent of borrowing 
more money would most certainly be out of business. However, 
it seems crown corporations act on a different philosophy, a 
philosophy of spending with no regard for how great the cost.
<P>
	Allowing a company to accumulate further indebtedness at 
public expense from the overburdened taxpayers' point of view 
is just not right. This type of action is not conducive to cost 
effectiveness and is taking us down an ill-fated road.
<P>
	Arguments have emanated from across the floor that the CBC 
is a tradition chock full of Canadian heritage and culture. That 
argument rings somewhat hollow, especially if we consider how 
many Canadians appear to be interested in tuning into the CBC.
<P>
	CRTC chairman Keith Spicer recently scolded CBC 
executives for ignoring viewers, politicians and pundits who 
feel the CBC has lost touch with its audience. Mr. Spicer told the 
CBC executives at a licence renewal hearing that: ``You're just 
going to batten down the hatches and bulldog forward and do 
what you damn well please''. Spicer continued: ``It's not just 
good enough to blindly defend every last brick, every single 
amplifier, every last job, or every last budget dollar for its own 
sake to refuse to admit that CBC can and must change''.
<P>
	Perhaps the change referred to is to begin privatizing the 
CBC. Fewer and fewer Canadians are tuning in to CBC 
programming which proves that the CBC must change. Only 15 
per cent of television viewers watched the CBC's English 
network for some part of the day in the 1990-91 season. Two 
years later only 13.5 per cent were tuning in. Between the hours 
of seven and eleven, known as prime time, which is any 
network's bread and butter, only 15.8 per cent of viewers were 
watching CBC in the 1990-91 season. The percentage dropped 
to 13.6 per cent two years later.
<P>
	These facts beg the question why are Canadian taxpayers 
forced to pay for something which is obviously of little interest 
to the majority of Canadians? The spend, spend, spend mentality 
of this government must stop.
<P>
	Last week during the debate of Bill C-17 a government 
member stated that the $25 million borrowing authority this bill 
would grant the CBC is a relatively small amount. Canadians are 
tired of hearing such rhetoric from their elected representatives.
<P>
	The reason our national debt will approach the $550 billion 
next year is because previous governments and now the present 
government continue to look at $25 million as a drop in the 
bucket. Well $25 million is not a drop in the bucket and until the 
government realizes this Canada's debt problem will in all 
eventuality continue to grow and grow at an alarming rate.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	The $1.1 billion subsidy to the CBC cannot continue. To begin 
allowing the CBC to borrow huge amounts of money is 
something we cannot support. We are supporting four of the five 
sections into which we have broken down Bill C-17, but we do 
not support the CBC borrowing authority.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my allotted time with another 
member from my caucus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of short comments and then a question for the hon. 
member.
<P>
	I listened to his comments quite closely with respect to the 
CBC. It brings a lot of things home to me because I spent many 
years at the corporation.
<P>
	Implicit in his remarks is the privatization of the CBC. In 
suggesting that, the hon. member really does not understand 
what public broadcasting is all about. The private networks are 
not interested in a lot of the things done by the CBC. The CBC 
carries programs like ``Man Alive'', ``Marketplace'', ``The 
Fifth Estate'' and ``Meeting Place'' which is the religious 
broadcast on television on Sundays. There is also its entire radio 
service.
<P>
	Private broadcasters are not interested in programs of that 
kind for two reasons. One is that they are not that cost effective 
for commercial organizations. They do not draw the kinds of 
audiences that programs with all the violence and sex do. It is 
not fair to public broadcasting or Canadians to lump public 
broadcasting in with commercial broadcasting. They are very, 
very different. It is like comparing a bakery with a farm 
machinery company; they just do not match.
<P>
	It is unfair to CBC employees when the hon. member suggests 
there is no bottom line at the CBC. If the hon. member had made 
those remarks in 1970, the year I joined the CBC, I think he 
would have been pretty well right. The CBC could be accused of 
some very serious profligate spending in 1970 but that is not the 
case now. Sure, you are going to find some fat, but there is no 
comparison to 20 or 25 years ago. Therefore, to suggest there is 
no bottom line is just not true.
<P>
	My question has to do with the borrowing aspect of Bill C-17. 
Maybe $25 million is a lot of money, maybe it is not. But as long 
as the borrowing is consistent with the means, that is the budget 
the CBC has, I do not see the concern, as long as it fits in with the 
budget. Why is that concern there? It is not adding to the budget; 
it is just one more expense item with respect to the budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4648"> 4648 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for his observations.
<P>
	It has to be a concern because even the projection down the 
road is that the CBC does not have the capacity to balance its 
budget. To lend it more money exacerbates the problem and 
certainly does nothing to resolve it.
<P>
	This country's private network runs pretty close to the 
taxpayer subsidized CBC. They both have newscasts, long 
newscasts. Both have public affairs programs. They both have 
Canadian content and all kinds of other content. There is not too 
much difference in how they are run, except one is on the backs 
of the taxpayers and the other is on the free enterprise system.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before my main comments, I would like to say to the 
absent hon. member for Yellowhead and members of his caucus 
that none of them were in Windsor, Ontario in December 1990 
when our CBC station went dark and 10,000 people went out 
onto the streets to protest this action by the CBC.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	The CBC is the only cultural instrument in Canada with the 
capability to unify us and to inform people from the great city of 
Windsor in southwestern Ontario, the greatest city in the 
southwest, about people from for instance Yellowhead, a place 
that I am sure many people had never heard of. Certainly I was 
not aware of it until I came to the House.
<P>
	In December 1990, 10,000 people streamed out on to the 
banks of the Detroit River and looked at a most incredible 
skyline, a skyline that imposed itself on us every day and 
reminded us of the American presence, a skyline that clearly 
reminded us that our specifically Canadian culture in Windsor 
was always in danger of being overshadowed by that tremendous 
country right there where we can almost touch it.
<P>
	That country is so close we can go there for lunch and still 
make it back in an hour. With that country standing there with all 
its cultural instruments ready to bring to bear upon us and with 
people in the House starting to talk about doing things that 
would devastate the CBC, the single greatest unifying cultural 
instrument in this country, I say there is something wrong.
<P>
	If members of the party opposite had been elected in Windsor 
and were talking in the House on behalf of the constituents of 
Windsor, they would have to go against their party line. The 
people of Windsor, Ontario, the people of southwestern Ontario 
in general, do not want to see the wings of the CBC clipped any 
more. They do not want to see any further erosion of our cultural 
institutions.
<P>
	I remind members of the House that there is a hidden agenda 
over there. That hidden agenda, in my view and in the view of 
many people on this side of the House, is that members opposite 
want to rid this country, by arguing the bottom line, of our 
wonderful cultural institutions, our arts, our great writers and 
things like CBC radio and television that unify us and make us 
different from the people over the river, as we say in Windsor.
<P>
	I am not here to talk about that today; I just felt the urge. I am 
actually here to talk about changes to the unemployment 
insurance scheme announced in the February 22, 1994 budget, 
specifically in contrast to unemployment insurance changes that 
were brought in under the previous government. I do not need to 
tell any of us here that the government's first priority is to get 
Canadians back to work. Changes to the unemployment 
insurance program are but one of our urgent pledges to create 
jobs.
<P>
	As a result of the unemployment insurance measures 
introduced under Bill C-17, the 1995 unemployment insurance 
premium rate will be lowered by 30 cents. This is 30 cents lower 
than would have been the case without these changes. In 1996 
the budget measures I am talking about will mean premium 
relief of at least 25 cents.
<P>
	In comparison, when the last major changes to the 
unemployment insurance program under Bill C-21 were put in 
place in 1990, the unemployment insurance premium rate had 
just been increased by 30 cents. That was not the last premium 
rate increase. Since 1989 premium payments by both employers 
and workers have doubled. For example, the maximum amount 
of employee contributions increased from $614 a year to $1,245. 
The maximum amount of employer contributions increased 
from $859 a year to over $1,700.
<P>
	The measures introduced in the budget were necessary to 
reverse the trend of continually escalating premium costs for 
both employers and workers. The premium rollback means that 
there will be 40,000 more jobs in the economy than would have 
existed if the premium had been allowed to rise, that is 40,000 
more Canadians contributing to the prosperity of our country 
and, incidentally, paying taxes.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	In terms of premium payers the rollback means an employer 
with 100 employees will see a reduction in payroll taxes of up to 
$30,000 over the next two years. Over the same period 
employees will benefit by saving up to $235. Since the reduction 
in payroll taxes will result in a lower cost to employers to 
employ people, it will have the added benefit of lowering 
Canadian production costs, encouraging exports and making 
domestic products more competitive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4649"> 4649 </A></B>
<P>
	Premium rollbacks will also create an environment for 
employment growth, but premium reduction alone is not enough 
to give us an effective UI program for the 1990s. That is why we 
are proposing other measures to create a new climate which 
gives greater recognition to long term work records.
<P>
	We know that almost half of the Canadians claiming benefits 
have worked for 40 weeks or longer before making a claim. We 
know that they have a long and a strong attachment to the 
economy through the workplace. In keeping with this reality the 
proposed changes strengthen the link between work history and 
unemployment insurance eligibility.
<P>
	The provisions call for raising the minimum length of time an 
employee would have to work to be eligible for unemployment 
insurance benefit only from 10 weeks to 12 weeks. We are also 
proposing a new formula to calculate benefits, a formula that 
takes greater account of the amount of weeks worked while still 
being sensitive to regional rates of unemployment.
<P>
	I am certain my hon. colleagues do not need to be reminded of 
the regional differences that persist in employment 
opportunities. With those differences in mind, we are proposing 
a formula that continues to link extra benefits to the level of 
unemployment in a claimant's particular region. The 
unemployed in high unemployment areas will be eligible for up 
to 20 more weeks of benefits than claimants with similar work 
histories in the most robust regional economies in Canada. In 
fact the Atlantic provinces as a whole will receive $970 in 
unemployment insurance per capita and Quebec will receive 
$730 per capita compared to $675 per capita for all of Canada.
<P>
	Another proposal would find greater unemployment 
insurance benefits to claimants who have low incomes and 
dependants. Under current rules people who claim 
unemployment insurancereceive a benefit rate of 57 per cent no 
matter what their circumstances. The proposed changes would 
mean that the benefit rate would be increased to 60 per cent for 
unemployed workers who had low incomes equal to or less than 
$390 per week and were supporting dependants: children, an 
aged parent or other dependant. The benefit rate for all 
claimants would be 55 per cent.
<P>
	This is an important change since Canada, one of the 
wealthiest industrialized nations, has about 1.2 million children 
living in poverty. The proposal for greater assistance to low 
income UI claimants with dependants will help these children, 
those most in need and their mothers, many of whom are raising 
children in poverty as single parents.
<P>
	Approximately 240,000 claimants will gain from the 
enhanced benefit rate. Most UI recipients go from 
unemployment insurance to a job. Two-thirds of all 
unemployment insurance recipients will not be affected by the 
reduction in the duration of benefits. Under the current schedule 
of benefits three-quarters of all  recipients do not use all the 
benefits to which they are entitled.
<P>
	We cannot overlook the fact that the proposed changes to the 
unemployment insurance system will have an impact on some 
Canadians. The government has taken that impact into account. 
It has been addressed through other job creation initiatives such 
as the infrastructure program, the youth services corps and the 
youth internship program. I hasten to point out that all these 
programs have been launched. They are already creating jobs 
not just in Windsor but elsewhere in the country.
<P>
	When people lose their jobs programs such as claimant 
re-employment services help unemployment insurance 
claimants to return to stable, long term work as soon as possible. 
Our department is currently preparing to provide assistance to 
those most affected by the changes in Bill C-17.
<P>
	The budget also included $18 million in new funds for 
strategic initiatives. While these are not unemployment 
insurance moneys, the funds coming from the consolidated 
revenue fund, the strategic initiatives will allow the government 
to work with provinces in dealing with some of the impacts of 
the unemployment insurance changes.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Joint strategic initiatives with provinces and territories and 
private and non-governmental organizations will be a key part 
of the social security reform process. These funds represent 
investments in people that will continue to pay off over the years 
to come. The strategic initiatives offer a means of finding more 
effective ways of dealing with some of the problems faced by the 
current system. Initiatives which assisted the unemployed will 
in turn help to reduce the deficit in the unemployment insurance 
account and to maintain its fiscal integrity.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, together with the 
human resources department, is assisting Atlantic Canadians to 
deal with the collapse of the groundfish industry through the 
$1.9 billion Atlantic groundfish strategy. We are offering help to 
those who want new careers outside the fishing industry.
<P>
	Instead of continuing passive income support, the groundfish 
strategy offers a broad range of career development programs 
and services to address adjustments facing fishers and fish plant 
workers. These include financial and employment counselling, 
education and training in trades for those under 25 years of age, 
assistance in relocating to a new job, self-employment 
incentives, employment training for workers 25 to 49 years of 
age, work experience in green projects, job creation and 
community 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4650"> 4650 </A></B>
<P>
service for those close to retirement as well as those who wish to 
accept early retirement options if they are over the age of 
55 years.
<P>
	It is estimated that about 30,000 persons in the Atlantic 
provinces and Quebec, 13,000 fisherpersons and 17,000 plant 
workers, will be initially eligible for assistance under the new 
strategy. All individuals meeting the criteria will be entitled to a 
minimum of two years of assistance. Depending on the 
individual's length of time in the fishery they could receive up to 
five years of assistance.
<P>
	Following the passage of Bill C-113 Canadians expressed 
concern about the fairness of some measures in the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. The government listened to 
those concerns, and the proposals in Bill C-17 correct the 
inequities of the voluntary quit and misconduct provisions. For 
example, we propose that a period of suspension not be treated 
as loss of employment due to misconduct. That means that time 
worked prior to a suspension would still count if the claimant 
applies for unemployment insurance benefits at some time 
following the suspension.
<P>
	Similarly, a leave of absence would no longer be considered a 
voluntary separation from work. A worker returning to work 
would not at some later date be penalized for the leave of 
absence and would still be eligible for unemployment insurance 
benefits.
<P>
	We are also proposing that eligibility rules be made more 
flexible for workers who leave a job that was about to be 
terminated anyway. When a claimant quits employment for just 
cause, the claimant will always receive the benefit of the doubt 
when the information from the employer and employee is 
balanced. We propose the legislation be amended to give the 
claimant the benefit of the doubt regarding just cause.
<P>
	Bill C-17 also enables the testing of new approaches to the 
operation of the unemployment insurance program to ease the 
administrative burdens currently imposed on employers, 
claimants and the government.
<P>
	An example of such a pilot project would be measures to 
reduce the information requirements of the record of 
employment for employers. The complexity of the record of 
employment has long been a bone of contention for employers. 
Changes to the procedure would lead to improved equity, 
increased accuracy in payments and better service.
<P>
	A second example of a potential administrative pilot project 
is electronic filing of claims by employers or claimants. The 
pilot project will examine the possible service and cost benefits 
of filing electronically.
<P>
	In summary, these proposed changes are an important first 
step in the overall reform of our system. The changes to the UI 
program are interim in the sense that UI is only one part of the 
process of comprehensive reform of the social security system 
already under way. In the meantime, however, these changes 
will move us toward revitalized programs to deal with the 
changing labour market, programs that help people to find 
sustainable employment while at the same time support those 
unable to work.

who approved all resolutions boosting ethanol production. It is 
great to see grassroot Liberals showing this leadership, but it 
should come as no surprise.
<P>
	In 1991 the leader of the opposition and now our Prime 
Minister called on the Conservative government to introduce 
legislation supporting ethanol.
<P>
	The historic ethanol plant announced for southern Ontario, 
the eighth largest in North America, will add $2.7 billion to 
Ontario's economy over 12 years. Even the city of Sarnia bid on 
the plant.
<P>
	The U.S. is already planning 49 new ethanol plants.
<P>
	Tens of thousands of area residents have signed petitions and 
written letters to our Prime Minister urging federal involvement 
in the Ontario plant.
<P>
	Grassroot Canadians and Liberal delegates alike know we 
have a government for the people, not for the bureaucrats. The 
people are for ethanol.

	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the last day of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness 
Month.
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 Canadians suffer from MS. It is the most 
common disease of the central nervous system affecting young 
adults in their prime. Twice as many women as men suffer from 
MS. It is usually progressive and leads to numbness, loss of 
balance, tremors and even paralysis.
<P>
	The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada was founded in 
1948 to help those affected by the disease. Today it has a 
Canada-wide membership of approximately 26,000. The 
society promotes and supports MS research and services for 
people with MS as well as their families. This is accomplished 
through charitable donations to the society and fund raising 
events such as the Carnation Campaign which took place this 
past month.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the volunteers and staff of the Multiple 
Sclerosis Society of Canada for a successful month and to 
encourage all Canadians to lend support to Multiple Sclerosis 
Month and to the Carnation Campaign.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a Canadian Press dispatch reports that a lobby group 
representing the interests of wealthy Canadian families, the 
Canadian Association for Family Enterprise, apparently 
persuaded the former government last year to extend family 
trusts, a form of tax shelter.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Having left family 
trusts untouched in his budget, can the minister tell us if he too 
caved in to the pressure from these same lobbyists, after having 
strongly condemned himself the Conservatives' decision in 
1993 to extend this form of abuse which allows wealthy families 
to shelter hundreds of millions of dollars from taxes each year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, we stated very clearly in 
our budget that the issue of family trusts was one of considerable 
concern to us and, in order for information to be made truly 
public, it was our intention-and it still is-to refer the matter to 
the finance committee, which is what we intend to do.
<P>
	Regarding this lobby group which put pressure on the 
government, I must admit that I know nothing about it because it 
did not put any pressure on us. Their target was the previous 
government, at a time when the Leader of the Opposition was a 
member of Cabinet.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just a technical reminder, but I resigned from the 
Conservative cabinet in May 1990 and this decision was made in 
1993.
<P>
	I get the feeling that many Canadian and Quebec taxpayers are 
fed up with the evasive answers of the minister, who seems 
content to refer the matter to a committee. While the committees 
sit, the wealthy line their pockets and the poor pay!
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance confirm if the figures published 
today by Canadian Press and showing that his decision to 
maintain these trusts allows a wealthy Canadian family to save 
an average of $10 million each year are indeed correct, and how 
can he allow them to continue enjoying this kind of perk when, 
at the same time, he is imposing heavy burdens on the 
unemployed and on the disadvantaged?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we took office, having opposed 
the previous government and the way it was treating family 
trusts, we found that the information we were being provided 
was inadequate.
<P>
	As a result of that and because we really wanted this to be a 
public debate we referred it to the finance committee in order 
that Canadians have an opportunity to have that debate.
<P>
	I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that in 1987 
he was a member of the previous cabinet. In 1987 the previous 
government was going to do something about it and that is when 
it began to react to lobbyists, when he was a member of that 
cabinet.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr.

that we have the Liberals to thank for this marvellous tax shelter 
which they introduced in 1972 for a period of 21 years. It was 
slated to expire in 1993 and it was the Conservatives who 
extended it. What the wealthy families wanted was time, and 
they got plenty of it thanks to the Minister of Finance who came 
to their defence.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance expect to be a credible 
defender of family trusts when on April 19, 1993, he rose in this 
House to vote against the Conservatives' decision to extend the 
perks enjoyed by wealthy families? What possible reason can 
the minister give for his complete about-face which will deprive 
the government of hundreds of millions of dollars each year in 
tax revenues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the best way to stop 
abuse is by being open. Why is the Leader of the Opposition 
afraid of a public debate before the finance committee on which 
his party will be represented? We are not afraid of a debate. We 
are not afraid of providing the Canadian public with information 
and I can only wonder why the Leader of the Opposition 
continues to say that we are dodging this issue. What about his

strategy is inadequate for reaching their goal of lowering the 
federal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How does the 
Minister of Finance react to this study, which totally calls into 
question his budgetary and fiscal objectives and again singles 
out his inability to properly control the government's finances?

Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, like the hon. member, I 
have not had time to read the report which just came out this 
morning. I have read summaries.
<P>
	It says that it is dangerous to let the deficit and debt go out of 
control and we agree. That is why our goal is to reduce it to 3 per 
cent of the gross domestic product in three years. It says that 
public-sector salaries must be controlled and we agree. That is 
why, under the leadership of the Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal, we are really examining all government 
spending. Although I have not read the report, I must say that we 
fully agree with the conclusions on the effects of the debt and the 
deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the institute's report indeed says that the measures in the finance 
minister's budget are all totally inadequate and totally 
ineffective for reducing the deficit.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance if, instead of taking a 
wait-and-see attitude to the disastrous situation of the Canadian 
government's finances, he does not agree that he must urgently 
eliminate duplication and inefficiency and immediately 
eliminate outrageous tax evasions such as family trusts. It is not 
social programs that should be attacked in the cowardly way you 
are attacking them.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, one reason we referred 
the whole issue of family trusts to the finance committee is that 
the Bloc Quebecois's finance critic suggested it. Unfortunately, 
we followed his advice.
<P>

Quebecois which claims to have some degree of compassion-it 
has not demonstrated it so far-cites the C.D. Howe report 
which came out this morning but has not cited the report that 
came out on the tremendous causes of the relationship between 
unemployment and the deficit that came out last week, the study 
by Diane Bellemare.

deficit but refuses to talk about unemployment?

uncertainty about the government's ability to manage the deficit 
and the debt, there is this increasing uncertainty caused by the 
debate over Quebec sovereignty.

they are giving me, but I will make up my mind. The question is

supplementary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the only way to ensure that any 
question on Quebec sovereignty is put to Quebec electors in the 
form that the Prime Minister desires is for a federalist 
government to put the question.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister therefore suggesting that his 
government or the current Quebec government should put the 
question, Canada or separation, to Quebecers in a referendum 
perhaps in conjunction with the next provincial election?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> I think, Mr. 
Speaker, this question is a bit more suitable than the previous 
one.
<P>
	The best way for Quebecers to have economic stability and to 
make sure that the rest of the country does not pay a price for 
political instability, is for the Quebec people to vote for the 
Liberal Party in the next provincial election so that we will 
dispose of the problem. This is the best option.

	As for Mr. Parizeau, I hope he will never form a government. 
However, if he were to form a government, he should take the

there is not within the allocations that have been made sufficient 
takeup to take all the money. I expect there will be other 
opportunities for reallocation. In that situation we certainly are 
committed to proceeding with the highway 416 project. It will 
be up to the province to bring forward a proposal within the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a

<P>
	The Canada-Ontario infrastructure program specifically 
states that all programs are to be initiated by the municipalities 
and, moreover, that all projects are to be financed equally by the 
municipality, the province and the federal government.
<P>
	Why has the minister committed funding to a project that is 
clearly outside the restrictions of his own program in the case of 
highway 416?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are different agreements in each province. There are many 
projects in different provinces initiated by the provinces. We did 
allow for that possibility, not entirely the municipalities.
<P>
	It would take an amendment to the agreement which the 
Ontario government would have to propose in order to provide 
this. It would be completely in accordance with the goals, the 
objectives and the criteria of the infrastructure works program 
which is quite successful right across the country. If the Ontario 
government wants to do it, we are prepared to be there with it.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister, who claimed that the 
National Forum on Health would give us the opportunity to 
discuss the precarious situation of the health-care system and 
enable us to find solutions to the existing problems. We have 
learned that the forum might be postponed.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister confirm that the National Forum on 
Health will be postponed as a result of the criticisms expressed 
by the provinces, which were excluded from this consultation 
process, although they are mainly responsible for health care?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we had many consultations. The Minister of Health had 
consultations with the provinces and, at one point, the ministers 
even established a committee of five ministers to make 
suggestions to her. She received these suggestions and included 
them in her proposal for next month.
<P>
	All of a sudden, the provinces came up with other 
suggestions. Since we are a very flexible government, we said 
that we would look at their other suggestions. If, unfortunately, 
a few extra weeks are needed before we hold the conference, we 
are ready to delay it because we were elected for five years and 
we will not complain about another five weeks.
<P>
	However, I would like to point out that the Minister of Health 
held consultations. She received a report prepared by five 
ministers. I think she accepted all of their requests, and they 
then asked for other things. Of course, we will look at what they 
want, but I am not ready to blame the Minister of Health. On the 
contrary, I wish to commend her for listening to the provinces 
and including their studies in her proposal. All of a sudden, they 
found her too flexible and asked for more concessions. I am 
certain that she will study their requests and, if they are 
reasonable, she will accept them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister confirm that the federal government, whose goal 
is to centralize, directly harms the provinces by trying to impose 
national standards while withdrawing financially?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
frankly, it is a word I have been hearing in this House since 
1963. Every time members want to speak against the federal 
government, they say it wants to centralize, when there has been 
such a major decentralization that Canada has become one of the 
most decentralized countries, like Switzerland. But we are still 
willing to look at suggestions. We have a national health act 
passed by this Parliament, which requires us to offer free, 
universal and publicly administered health-care services so that 
we do not have hospitals for the rich and other hospitals for the 
poor. That is the goal we will continue to pursue with the 
conference on health that I will chair.

<P>

Yet, a verification reveals that this dangerous toxic waste 
treatment site simply does not exist.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister endorse the statement made by the 
Deputy Prime Minister, who justified the decision of the

do not exist?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Kingston Roman Catholic Separate School Board 
unanimously supported the idea of building a school in an 
appropriate location, but the proposed site is deemed inadequate 
by the municipality.
<P>
	Based on the information I received, that location is used as a

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true!
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Listen. I am 
saying that the school board is in favour of building a 
French-language school. They want to find the best possible 
site. They are considering two or three locations. This is an issue 
which concerns Kingston city officials and the Department of 
Education in Toronto. It is not a federal issue.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that I asked if there was any objection to 
building a French-language school in Kingston. I was told: 
Absolutely not! We want such a school as soon as possible and in 
the best possible location.
<P>
	I was given the assurance that a site would be found very soon.

my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Over the weekend, the Alberta Chamber of Commerce held its 
annual meeting in Red Deer. One of the proposals put forward at 
that meeting was that the Alberta and federal governments 
should refrain from making any new grants or loan guarantees to 
business. This proposal should really come as no surprise to 
anyone who has followed the pathetic tales of Gainers or 
NovoTel, to name just two examples of public money gone bad 
in Alberta.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to accept the Alberta Chamber of 
Commerce's suggestion to refrain from making any new grants 
or loan guarantees to business?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development- 
Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member knows the entire question 
of grants and subsidies to business is under review. We have 
severely cut back already. A number of the regional agencies 
have gone to loans and no more grants.
<P>
	The member however will also recognize that the way the 
federal government carries its accounts a number of matters 
appear under grants or subsidies to business which of course 
involve agriculture and transportation or certain corporations 
having to do with access to foreign markets.
<P>
	The basic concept that the government should get out of the 
way and let business do its job, which is to create jobs, provided 
this country essentially has a structure that will let them do so is 
one we share.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the minister's answer.
<P>
	I would suggest that the minister grab on the suggestion from 
the Alberta Chamber of Commerce strongly. Chamber members 
themselves have stated they want a level playing field and 
government handouts often distort competition rather than help 
business. I would like the minister to guarantee that he will look 
at the suggestion from the Alberta Chamber of Commerce.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

We have already met. As the minister for western diversification 
can say, he has already brought in a great deal of that philosophy 
for example in terms of the way he is dealing with small 
business.
<P>
	I do share that philosophy. However I would simply ask the 
member to understand when he talks about a level playing field, 
that level playing field we have to establish is not one which 
simply exists within Canada but one which exists in Canada 
vis-à-vis the rest of the world. We want to make sure Canadian

markets in the rest of the world. We are going to make sure that

edge of a salmon war. We will not conduct a fishery as a free for 
all nor will we pursue a catch and kill policy. We will fish 
unilaterally and only because we are not able to make a bilateral 
arrangement with the United States.

	We do not doubt the will or the intent of the U.S. 
administration to make an arrangement with us, but we doubt the 
ability of the U.S. administration to pull Alaska, Washington, 
Oregon and California together around one sound game plan.

Washington run our fishery, or to stand up and be counted in the 
interest of Canadian fishermen and that is what we will do.

this action and where do we go from there? How will we advance 
Canada's position on this issue?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

the Criminal Code of Canada deals with gambling by providing

are allowed to be the operators of casinos with table games and

additional exceptions, such as the private operation of casinos as 
he suggests. In order to do such a thing at least two requirements

Act.
<P>
	The hon. member raised a valid point in explaining the 
difficulties in obtaining the text of these amendments from 
sources other than House of Commons publications.
<P>
	Procedural Services may have interpreted too broadly a recent 
decision of the Board of Internal Economy and the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to no longer print in 
<I>Votes and Proceedings</I> the text that daily appears in other 
parliamentary publications.
<P>
	While the reason behind this decision was to realize 
reductions in printing costs and eliminate the duplication of 
printing, after due consideration it would seem appropriate to 
return to the previous practice of printing the full text in <I>Votes 
and Proceedings</I> of Senate messages, including those 
concerning amendments to bills.

	I will listen to a point of order from the member for Frontenac.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday afternoon, around this time, the member for 
Davenport, who chairs the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development, tabled our report 
which contained a dissenting report by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I rose, pursuant to Standing Order 35(2), to present the Bloc's 
opinion, but the Deputy Chairman, who was busy doing 
something else, did not recognize me. Mr. Speaker, if you allow 
me, I would be very pleased to do so this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It seems to me that what the member is 
requesting is acceptable to the Speaker and the House. He may 
now make his point.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the past few 
weeks, I have heard numerous testimonies from various 
individuals and groups while serving as the vice-chairman of 
the committee on the environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	Following debate which was quite lively at times, it became 
apparent that the positions of the Bloc Quebecois and Liberal 
Party were irreconcilable. Opinions differed not on the wording 
or the terms and conditions, but rather on the very substance of 
the matter.
<P>
	The report which the committee tabled yesterday calls for the 
appointment of a new authority, whereas we advocate the use of 
a structure that is already in place and has proven its worth.
<P>
	In our view, it would be more appropriate to broaden the 
mandate of the Auditor General's Office and grant it the 
required resources to deal with environmental issues in a proper, 
thorough manner.
<P>
	To all those who would loudly denounce this alternative as 
reactive and not in keeping with sustainable development, our 
answer would be that the proposed solution is nothing but an 
attempt to impress.
<P>
	An appointed official has no business making policy. Our 
democratic system allows Canadians and Quebecers to elect 
representatives to govern the country and lead it ably on the path 
to sustainable development. It would be too easy to have an 
additional authority, a whipping boy, which would be made 
responsible for all decisions.
<P>
	In this instance, the mandate of the commissioner of the 
environment will in many ways overlap the mandates of other 
authorities, notably the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, certain Green Plan programs and even Environment 
Canada.
<P>
	We are not opposed to virtue and we acknowledge the 
importance of protecting the environment in any way possible. 
However, we felt the honest thing to do was to criticize this 
proposed new position which would merely provide another way 
out for a government unwilling to carry out the responsibilities 
entrusted to it by its citizens.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth 
time I rise in this House to speak on cuts to the unemployment 
insurance program. The first time was immediately following 
the budget speech. Then I spoke again at second reading and at 
report stage and finally, today, at third reading.
<P>
	By my count, Bloc Quebecois members have made 60 
speeches on UI cuts in this House, that is to say over half of all 
speeches made on the subject. How come?
<P>
	On the government side, efforts were made to wrap up these 
UI cuts in an omnibus bill, a catchall bill which contains 
interesting measures on the whole, but hides these cuts that 
signal further cuts to social programs affecting the less 
fortunate.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Mercier said this morning, this is a 
very sad day indeed, because the less fortunate segment of the 
population is being attacked. But what did we just hear during 
Question Period? Answers that were, for the most part, 
disturbing. The government, which has saved $1.3 billion in 
unemployment insurance, did not dare attack, in this budget, 
family trusts which benefit the wealthiest members of our 
society.
<P>
	This means that people who already enjoy the best lifestyle in 
this country will continue to do so while, in an effort to reduce 
the deficit, the government will ask the less affluent to make a 
$1.3 billion sacrifice. I would like to point out that $1.3 billion 
is $300 million over the projected cost of the infrastructure 
program which was announced by this government, is under way 
and involves the three levels of government.
<P>
	If the Bloc Quebecois members, the official opposition 
members, have spoken on this issue as often as they have, it was 
to show they had tried everything. Today is the last day. By 
moving amendments and having as many of our members as 
possible speak to this bill, we tried to make the government 
realize a change of attitude concerning the less affluent was in 
order. We have also recalled at every opportunity the positions 
government members had held when in opposition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4663"> 4663 </A></B>
<P>
	Just last year, the former Conservative government 
introduced two bills respecting unemployment insurance. The 
first one was Bill C-105, and you will remember that there was 
so much controversy about this bill tabled by the then minister 
of employment that he had to table an all new one, namely Bill 
C-113, in which the number of instances where the benefit of the 
doubt was given to the unemployed instead of the commission 
was reduced. It also provided for a reduction in unemployment 
insurance rates.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I will read, as it is worthwhile remembering, some of the 
statements that were made at the time by members of the current 
Liberal government, in particular the hon. member for York 
South who, coincidentally, is Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development. He had this to say 
about Bill C-113: ``Reaction has been so strong because the 
changes to the unemployment insurance program contained in 
Bill C-113 threaten every Canadian who has a job. By reducing 
the benefit rate from 60 per cent to 57 per cent of insurable 
earnings, the government is going to be taking money out of the 
pockets of some families. It may only be $80 a month, but for 
some households, that represents the hydro and phone bills or a 
weekly order of groceries''.
<P>
	For the vast majority of Canadians who live pay cheque to pay 
cheque, losing an extra $80 a month can be a major set-back. 
What about today? There is another 2 per cent reduction, which 
amounts to some $50 a month. We can now repeat the arguments 
that the parliamentary secretary put forward at the time and ask 
how come he cannot influence the minister he is so close to. 
What happened in the past year that caused the parliamentary 
secretary to do such an about-face on the benefit rate reduction? 
We wonder.
<P>
	He read a letter-I am certain that the situation has not 
changed-that had been sent to one of his colleagues. The letter 
was addressed to the Minister of Employment with a copy to his 
colleague. It was from an expectant mother who was distressed 
to learn that UI benefits she would receive during maternity 
leave were going to be reduced from 60 per cent to 57 per cent.
<P>
	And I could go on for several more pages because the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development has been, I must admit, one of the most 
prolific in this regard, especially when young people are 
concerned. He waxed indignant against the previous 
government's attempts to cut unemployment insurance, saying, 
among other things, that young people and women were perhaps 
the two social groups that were the most threatened by UI cuts 
because their jobs, as everyone knows, are the most precarious. 
Thirty per cent of precarious jobs are held by young people and 
even more, nearly 50 per cent, by women.
<P>
	I find it hard to understand. I am asking people whom I know 
have social convictions, who are now on the government side, 
why, now that they are in office, they continue to support a bill 
now at the last stage of the adoption process which will take, let 
me remind you, $1.3 billion out of the pockets of unemployed 
Canadians.
<P>
	I will now read an excerpt from a speech delivered on March 
24, 1993 by the current Chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development when he was a member of the 
opposition. He said: ``Once again the Tories have chosen to ask 
those that are the main victims of the recession, the 
unemployed, to bear the burden of expenditure restraint, while 
at the same time, they enact other measures that allow the 
wealthy to continue to escape paying their fair share of taxation 
and contributing to deficit reduction''.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Today our leader asked a question about family trusts. Why 
did you not stop them? Why did you not do something so that 
people who hold considerable fortunes in family trusts pay more 
tax? Despite a negative answer, the bill that will be passed in a 
few hours talks about cuts to unemployment insurance. Not just 
anyone is saying that; it comes from the current chairman of the 
human resources development committee, of which I am a 
member.
<P>
	What could have happened in a year to make this member, 
who was then in opposition, do an about-face, turn around 180 
degrees and agree to have his government pass a bill that will 
again cut payments to the poorest people.
<P>
	Now the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce made a 
long speech on it. He said: ``When more than a million 
Canadians are without work and struggling to feed their 
children, pay the rent and meet their families' basic needs, the 
government cuts their benefits from 60 to 57 per cent of their 
insurable earnings for two years, saying that it hopes to restore 
them to 60 per cent when the economy is better''. Listen to this: 
``This measure is unacceptable and we will continue to fight it''. 
He did not continue much longer. A year later, the same member 
is on the government side; his government is proposing not only 
to go back to the previous measure but to take off another 2 per 
cent for 85 per cent of those unemployed people.
<P>
	What has happened to this member in a year? Nevertheless, 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is very experienced and 
is surely used to the idea that an opposition member may one day 
quote what he said in <I>Hansard</I>. What has happened to make this 
member remain silent today?
<P>
	If it were only backbenchers! Now here is a question from the 
present Minister of Human Resources Development. It is 
vaguer, but we still see which way he was going then. He said: 
``Yesterday, the Minister of Employment made what we could 
call an outrageous  speech to the Empire Club in Toronto. Once 
again, he attacked the unemployed and unemployment 
insurance. He said that Canada's social programs were like a net 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4664"> 4664 </A></B>
<P>
catch fish. It is not a very flattering comparison for the 
thousands of Canadians who are without work''.
<P>
	This minister was a Liberal opposition member last year and I 
could quote many more who spoke out then against the 
Conservative government's desire to amend the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. It seemed to be the apple of his eye. What has 
happened? What is going on? That was a year ago. As far as I 
know, there was no indication in the red book that the 
government would be cutting UI. On the contrary, I heard hon. 
members and now government ministers repeat dozens of times 
to anyone willing to listen that they certainly would not cut 
social programs.
<P>
	And what are they doing now? Even before completing his 
consultation for a social program reform, as soon as the budget 
is passed, the minister will cut $1.3 billion from the UI. What 
happened to the minister during the year? He has some 
experience, having served as minister of employment in a 
previous Liberal government. He was familiar with the job. He 
cannot be blamed for improvising a position just like that.
<P>
	If it were only one minister, I would keep quiet, but I made a 
brief search, and here is a question asked by the current Prime 
Minister. At the time, he said the following: ``Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to know if the Conservative Prime Minister thinks 
that the approach used by the minister, which is to call all 
opponents of the bill separatists, is unacceptable to the people in 
Canada. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians throughout the 
country feel that some measures in that bill'', referring to Bill 
C-113, ``are totally unacceptable''.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	What happened a year later? The Prime Minister, who was 
then in opposition, now leads a government which, far from 
reversing the trend to cut UI, is reinforcing it. What happened? 
One has to wonder.
<P>
	I could quote other MPs, but people sometimes say: ``Ah, 
these Bloc Quebecois members and their opinions''. So, instead 
I will quote the opinion of journalists published in <I>La Presse</I>, 
last April 15, in an article under the following headline: 
``819,000 people will go on welfare and 44,000 will become 
ineligible for UI benefits following amendments proposed in 
Bill C-17''. The article referred to July 3. This is important, 
because people are not always aware of that date. Some are, 
because they were affected by measures which came into effect 
on April 3, but those who will only be affected on July 3 have not 
noticed the change, because that change is yet to come.
<P>
	The article went on to say: ``According to the February 22 
budget, as of July 3, people will need 12 weeks of insurable 
employment, instead of ten, to be eligible for UI benefits. It is 
estimated that 44,000  recipients will not be able to meet this 
requirement in 1994-95''.
<P>
	The article then dealt with another measure, this one in effect 
since April 3. It stated: ``The duration of benefits is reduced 
according to the regional unemployment rate. In some regions, 
it will only be 35 weeks''. In the good old days, back in 1989, 
that period could last up to 52 weeks. This is a major change. 
The article continued: ``Together, these changes will result in 
19,000 new welfare cases across Canada'', for a mere two extra 
weeks of insurable employment. In total, as I said earlier, 
819,000 people will have to go on welfare. What does that 
mean?
<P>
	It means that people will lose UI benefits sooner, but will still 
be without a job. This will result in additional costs to provincial 
governments. Even though the federal government finances half 
of the costs of social assistance, it is leaving the bill to 
provinces.
<P>
	In the case of an amount of $1.3 billion, this transfer 
represents a sum estimated at $735 million per year by 
economists from the Université du Québec à Montréal. That is a 
lot of money. Seven hundred and thirty five million dollars per 
year. This means, of course, that the federal government is 
amending the Unemployment Insurance Act to save money, but 
more than half of those savings, 60 per cent to be precise, are 
made by transferring this expenditure to the provinces. I wonder 
how people would react if a person unable to pay off his debts 
simply changed address and left his neighbour stuck with the 
bills. Nobody would put up with that. Yet, when the provinces 
complain about that situation, what does the federal government 
tell them? It tells them that it is a whim of theirs.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	But $735 million is a significant amount of money. In the end, 
there is only one taxpayer. The men and women who look into 
this situation must find this total lack of foresight from the 
government absolutely incredible.
<P>
	If there were, at least, some jobs available, but unemployment 
is high. With 1,000,622 jobless people in April, and 467,000 
Quebecers out of work, what we need is jobs.
<P>
	But what do these people get as an answer? That there are no 
jobs available, because it is not true that the infrastructure 
program will create enough jobs to put all of these people back 
to work. In conclusion, I know we are an hour and a half away 
from the passing of this bill, but I would once again ask 
members of the previous Parliament to refer to their notes and 
recall what was their former position about cuts to 
unemployment insurance. I urge them to maintain their previous 
position, to come back to their old policy and to let the 
underprivileged benefit from the current situation until the 
government has the guts to deal with the issue of family trusts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4665"> 4665 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member who just spoke mentioned the whole question of 
the family trust, something which also came up in question 
period today. It is the absence of anything dealing with that 
particular issue in the bill that is relevant to the debate before us.
<P>
	The member also spoke about advising people to stick by their 
initial positions. The member should be aware that the leader of 
his party, in spite of what he said earlier today, was a member of 
a government that was responsible for greatly increasing the 
unfairness of the tax system between the rich and the poor.
<P>
	I remember Michael Wilson in his first budget saying that the 
problem with the country was that we did not have enough rich 
people. He set out to create more rich people and he succeeded. 
One of the ways he succeeded was by being harder on the poor 
and by reducing the number of middle class Canadians that 
existed. He did so through the tax system after 1988, with the 
compliance of the now Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	Also on the same issue-and I invite the member to respond to 
this after I am finished-we saw the Liberal government of 
today claiming a certain innocence with respect to it. I was here. 
I remember that when I was attacking the extension of the 
exemption for the family trust at second reading the Liberal 
critic at that time, now the Minister of Health, got up and agreed 
with the Minister of Finance that I was on the wrong track. It was 
only after testimony in committee that the Liberals changed 
their minds. On second reading they were very much with the 
government on the particular issue.
<P>
	I want to ask the member a question. Perhaps he would want to 
reflect. It seems to me we have something that speaks volumes 
about the priorities of this government and previous 
governments. We have the lack of any action on the extended 
exemption, thanks to the Conservatives, for the family trust and 
at the same time an attack on the unemployed.
<P>
	The unemployed, people without any income, are being told 
that they will have to go longer and that they will have reduced 
benefits: a massive bill in order to do that to them. At the same 
time we have no action on the part of the government for people 
who have income, in fact billions of dollars of income from 
those assets, the deemed disposition on those assets and the 
capital gains. They have been able to plead with the previous 
government, and now it appears with this government, that it 
would be hard on them, that it would be oh so hard on them.
<P>
	We see from the release of letters that at one point there was 
correspondence between the Minister of Finance and the 
committee for family enterprise saying how difficult it would be 
if they would finally have to pay the tax on all the millions of 
dollars they have tied up in real estate and other assets that they 
were expecting to pay for 21 years.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Here we have, it seems to me, a perfect example of what is 
wrong with our value system. We can say to the unemployed: 
``You are unemployed. You do not have any income. Tough. We 
are going to make it tougher on you''.
<P>
	Yet at the same time and by the same governments, whether 
they be Conservative or now Liberal, we say to the very rich in 
the country that we understand it will be tough for them to have 
to pay that deemed disposition and those taxes that they have 
known since 1972 they were going to have to pay in 1993. 
Perhaps the member would like to comment on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Dubé, I thank my colleague for his comments 
because I think that is what they were. I agree with him, but I 
want to make a correction. He cannot attribute to the Leader of 
the Official Opposition actions in which he was not involved in 
any way. Let us not forget that he resigned from the 
Conservative government on May 22, 1990.
<P>
	When we talk about C-113 and C-105, those bills came after 
our leader's resignation. I can confirm, since I checked the date 
myself, that the present Leader of the Opposition left the 
Conservative Party on May 22, 1990.
<P>
	As for the other comments regarding family trusts, the hon. 
member gives me an opportunity to find the explanation that I 
was looking for earlier as to what may have happened over the 
last year for people to change their mind. We saw what happened 
in the case of Pearson airport. We can feel the influence of 
lobbyists or people who represent powerful financial interests, 
including the rich families, and there are not that many of them 
in Quebec nor in Canada. It is something worth looking into, but 
I will not draw that conclusion myself, giving the government 
the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
	However, regarding the hon. member's comments about the 
Leader of the Opposition and his involvement with Bill C-113 
or C-105, the member cannot accuse him of having supported 
these bills because, according to the information I have, he 
voted against these measures and was no longer a member of the 
Conservative government at the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
what the member for Lévis said on Bill C-17. I spoke on this 
subject myself and I would like to ask the member for Lévis a 
question.
<P>
	My first question is-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4666"> 4666 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I hate to 
sound like an old timer but I was around when we wrote the rules 
for the question and comment period.
<P>
	The idea written into the recommendation and accepted by the 
government was that the question and comment period was first 
and foremost for members of parties other than the party of the 
person who had just spoken. It was only in the absence of 
members of other parties that members of the same party were to 
be recognized on questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I go back to the 
conclusion of the intervention by the hon. member for Lévis, at 
the beginning of question and comment period both the member 
for Lotbinière and the member for Winnipeg Transcona rose at 
the same time.
<P>
	I gave the floor to the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona, 
and following the reply of the member I gave the floor to the 
hon. member for Lotbinière.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was getting ready to speak, I 
listened carefully to what the member for Lévis said about Bill 
C-17. I would like to ask him a question. Did he or his party do 
something about Bill C-17 with the government? Did they try to 
find a solution to this problem?
<P>
	Let us make no secret about it, some people, Canadians and 
Quebeckers, will be hurt by this law. Let us not forget that even 
those who are working today do not know if they will be out of a 
job tomorrow.
<P>
	It is very important and I would like the member for Lévis to 
tell us if the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, on which he sits, offered a concrete solution to 
this problem.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	My second question is: How will we announce these cuts to 
Canadians? Will the member invite all Canadians and 
Quebecers to rally against this law? What does he intend to do?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Lotbinière is acquiring some experience, as are all his 
colleagues from both sides of the House. Considering the short 
time that we have left, I hope that the hon. member for Lévis will 
be able to answer both questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé: </B>Mr. Speaker, what have we done and what do we 
intend to do? Well, in the Committee on Human Resources 
Development, of course, this project was not discussed as such, 
but the administration of the unemployment insurance fund was.
<P>
	We met the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
asked him some questions. We also approached officials who are 
implementing this system. I wish to tell those who are listening 
to us that the bill was tabled by the finance minister, so it was 
considered in the committee of finance. And the Official 
Opposition invited witnesses from all parts of the country to 
give  their opinions and would have liked to hear other people, 
because many wanted to be heard.
<P>
	What can we do to stir up public opinion? I think that it is not 
the role of a member of Parliament as such to do that. Anyway, 
that will not be necessary, since on May 1st, on Workers' Day, 
and the days that followed, you will recall that there were major 
demonstrations throughout Canada, and particularly in Quebec. 
And there are many people within organizations, action groups 
on unemployment and community groups who are concerned 
and asking for information. Our group of members of 
Parliament, of course, is trying to provide all the information 
available on that issue. Several members have taken the 
initiative to get together once a month, in public meetings, with 
their constituents. From the contacts that I had with my 
colleagues, this issue is the most often raised.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak in the House about 
the government's commitment to an unemployment insurance 
program that provides adequate and fair protection for 
Canadians who have lost their jobs and are seeking work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are living in unusual times with many upheavals to our 
economic and social systems. This is not a time when we can be 
complacent. That is why this government is committed to 
ensuring that our social security system is brought up-to-date 
so that it can meet the needs of Canadians now and in the future.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program is an integral part of 
this system. It will be a key element in our reform of the social 
safety net and in the development of an economic policy that 
will guide Canadians into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In introducing these changes to the unemployment insurance 
program we have carefully weighed the needs of business, of the 
unemployed and of working Canadians. We wanted a program 
that would create and protect jobs but also one that would ensure 
adequate resources for low income families with dependants.
<P>
	Let me for a moment examine these changes. Payroll taxes 
such as unemployment insurance premiums play an important 
role in job creation and, conversely, in discouraging the creation 
of new jobs. When businesses know that payroll taxes are going 
up they cannot stabilize their costs. Naturally they have 
concerns about future profitability. They may not be able to 
create new jobs or even sustain the jobs that already exist.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4667"> 4667 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government wants to create a climate of stability that will 
enable business to create and maintain jobs in this country. 
Therefore, we intend to rollback the statutory rise in the 
unemployment insurance premium rate and to finance the 
shortfall in revenues through the amendments to the 
unemployment insurance program being discussed in this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The large accumulated deficit in the UI account means that 
the UI premiums should be rising to $3.30 next year. It is now 
$3.07, and the economy cannot afford such a big hike in payroll 
taxes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore we propose to reduce the premium rate to $3 an 
hour for 1995 and 1996, and if possible in 1996 the rate could be 
lower if the financial and economic state of the country and the 
unemployment insurance program in particular permit such a 
reduction.
<P>
	Our second proposed change is to establish a stronger link 
between work history and UI benefits while remaining 
responsive to the needs of Canadians in different parts of the 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know working people face many different problems and 
challenges in different regions of the country. We want our 
unemployment insurance program to remain sensitive to the 
realities of seasonal work and the needs of people in areas of 
high unemployment. Therefore, our new proposal continues to 
include a formula that links extra benefits to the level of 
unemployment in a claimant's region of the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have had to make difficult trade-offs between creating 
jobs on the one hand and maintaining benefit levels for 
unemployed Canadians on the other.
<P>
	We believe that this proposal with its regional unemployment 
component is the fairest way possible to ensure that those people 
who need benefits actually get them. We know that most UI 
recipients go directly from UI to a job, and fully three-quarters 
of the people who receive unemployment insurance do not make 
full use of the maximum number of weeks of benefits to which 
they might be entitled.
<P>
	Canadians want to work and the government wants to make 
sure that as far as possible they can.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The third change we propose to the unemployment insurance 
program is to provide greater benefits to Canadians with modest 
incomes who support children, an aged parent or other 
dependants. This is not an unprecedented move.
<P>
	During the first 30 years of the unemployment insurance 
program's history, benefits were calculated based on family 
status and economic circumstances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many households today are under financial stress even though 
most families today have two wage earners. The reasons for this 
are many: increased part time employment which often pays less 
money than full time employment and provides fewer benefits; a 
higher general level of unemployment; an increase in one parent 
families; incomes have not grown in real terms since the 
mid-70s; and slow growth in individual earnings.
<P>
	These trends have been particularly difficult for Canadian 
women and children. Women now represent 45 per cent of the 
Canadian workforce but unfortunately most of these women are 
working for low wages. On average a Canadian woman working 
full time today earns approximately three-quarters of that of a 
Canadian male. Many of these women are single parents bearing 
the full responsibility for their children.
<P>
	Our proposal is to provide greater unemployment insurance 
assistance to those low income Canadians with dependants. This 
will have an immediate impact on women and children of our 
country who are most in need.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Under the current rules people who claim unemployment 
receive a benefit rate of 57 per cent no matter what their 
circumstances. Under our proposed changes there would be a 
two part benefit rate: 60 per cent for low income people with 
dependants and 55 per cent for others. With fewer 
unemployment insurance dollars to go around we believe it is 
only equitable and fair to ensure that the dollars we have go to 
those who have the greatest need.
<P>
	The government estimates that this would improve benefits 
for 15 per cent of unemployment insurance claimants or about a 
quarter of a million Canadians and their families.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For these reasons-reducing premiums to create jobs, 
ensuring responsiveness to regional needs, and protecting low 
income earners-this Government proposes these changes to UI 
and rejects the Hounourable members' motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4668"> 4668 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister was right when he said that Canadians want to work. 
This is quite true, and the same applies to Quebecers.
<P>
	In Matapédia-Matane, the rural riding which I represent, my 
constituents want to work, and there are no ifs or buts about it. 
They are prepared to work for hours and do anything at all to put 
bread and butter on the table for their children.
<P>
	I have a question for the minister. But first, an example. In our 
area farmers cannot start sowing because there is still snow in 
some places, although it is quite warm here. In the forestry 
industry, working 12 weeks instead of 10 is almost impossible in 
some places. That means these people will go on welfare.
<P>
	There is another point I would like to make. The BDCs which 
help small businesses create jobs seldom invest in venture 
capital. My question is this: Even if everybody wants to work, 
and I must say I agree with the minister, would it be possible to 
take a different approach in a rural riding like mine? Could we 
not give more power to the BDCs so they could help people in 
small businesses create jobs and provide work by investing 
more venture capital?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke 
mentioned the need for a strategy that goes beyond 
unemployment insurance to include other measures to promote 
small and medium-sized businesses and bigger companies as 
well. We must create jobs. This is very important, not only for 
Canadians who are out of work but also for other Canadians who 
are always in danger of becoming unemployed.
<P>
	It is also very important for the economy in general to have a 
lower unemployment rate and to get the unemployment rate 
down as soon as possible.
<P>
	I do not know at what level unemployment is acceptable, but it 
certainly is not at the level we have now, which is about 11 per 
cent. I hope that, in the years to come, we will manage to bring 
unemployment down to less than 5 per cent. I hope we can, but 
even that may not be enough. However, it is possible to reduce 
the unemployment rate.
<P>
	All I want to say right now in response to the hon. member's 
question, and I thank him for his question, is that there is a 
strategy with several components. Unemployment insurance 
certainly cannot create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	This bill contains some major changes in general strategy in 
order to get money from the government to support education, 
training and other ways to help people find jobs.
<P>
	In this debate we do not have all the other measures that are or 
will be before the House, but I can assure you that job creation is 
the cornerstone of the Liberal platform and the government's 
policy. Every day, in speech after speech, the Prime Minister 
keeps repeating  that the government's objective continues to be 
to create jobs in order to give Canadians the dignity of work so 
that they can put bread and butter on the table for their families.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the sentiments reflected in 
his speech will also be reflected in a number of other measures, 
and meanwhile, the government is pursuing a major goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
member's remarks and I have a very short question for him.
<P>
	During the election campaign, seven months and a few days 
ago, the Liberals told Canadians and Quebecers that they would 
not touch social programs. Could he explain why, after seven 
months and a few days, they have decided to cut those programs 
when they probably could have cut elsewhere and not harm the 
most vulnerable members of our society? I would like to know 
what he has to say about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is impossible for a responsible 
government and a responsible party to promise that there will be 
no changes to economic and social programs, or in other areas.
<P>
	In order to have a modern economy, you have to make 
changes. During the election campaign, the Liberal Party never 
said that it would not make changes to the social programs, the 
unemployment insurance system or elsewhere. It never 
campaigned on that.
<P>
	In the red book, there are several indications that the 
government was going to make changes. I can assure the hon. 
member that, if he reads the Liberal Party's holy book, he will 
see that the changes that are happening now had been planned 
during the election campaign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
spoke to Bill C-17 on April 14 during second reading and again 
in the report stage. I am pleased to be given so many 
opportunities to talk about the reforms to unemployment 
insurance and our income security programs.
<P>
	In my previous speeches I summarized the changes to the 
unemployment insurance program. Of the six major changes 
proposed by the government the Reform Party supports five.
<P>
	We used these previous occasions to encourage the 
government to go even further. I would like to use an illustration 
as to how we feel at this time.
<P>
	If I went out to buy a horse, looked at it and it looked fine, and 
I began to examine it, I would start with the mouth. I would 
check its teeth to see how old it is and I would walk around it and 
check its feet. If I came to the back and I found a leg missing I 
probably would not accept it. I would not want to buy that horse. 
That is how we feel about a lot of these changes to the 
unemployment insurance system. It looks good but there are 
some flaws in it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4669"> 4669 </A></B>
<P>
	I listened to the complaints about changes to the 
unemployment insurance by the Official Opposition. Its 
concerns show us just how off track the unemployment 
insurance program is. It proves that unemployment insurance is 
perceived as a way for social engineers to redistribute income. It 
proves that unemployment insurance is no longer a true 
insurance program but a glorified welfare program. The Reform 
Party would like to change all that.  The Reform Party wants to 
return unemployment insurance to a true insurance program, not 
a welfare program. We want to get this standing on all four feet, 
sound and well supported.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Reformers take great pride in getting the principles right 
before us, starting right at the beginning in reforming the 
program. The government has launched a two year process to 
reform our social programs and not once has the minister 
described the principles on which the government's reforms are 
based. We find this appalling that no principles have been put 
forth which this program would stand on. Canadians deserve 
better.
<P>
	I challenge the minister and the Official Opposition to ask 
their constituents some hard questions about the future of our 
social programs and the future of our unemployment insurance 
program. I did not describe unemployment insurance as a social 
program because it is not, it is an insurance program.
<P>
	If we are going to truly reform the system, then we have to 
start with two fundamental principles, two fundamental 
questions. First, why is the government in the unemployment 
insurance business? Second, why is unemployment insurance 
compulsory?
<P>
	Reformers do not think that the government is qualified to 
answer these questions, but know that the Canadian taxpayer 
and the workers and the employers who pay the bills are. 
Reformers have been asking Canadians what they think for years 
now and we believe it is time the government started asking the 
same people what should be done.
<P>
	If the government has the courage to ask ordinary Canadians 
what they think, it will be surprised by the answers. Here are 
some of the questions, and I want to spend most of my time 
outlining the questions that the government should be asking.
<P>
	First, would taxpayers like to have social programs designed 
so that they eliminate all duplication between the federal 
government and other levels of government? Would they like 
programs designed that way?
<P>
	Many Canadians see unemployment insurance and welfare as 
basically providing similar support for the same people. They 
see little reason for two large bureaucracies, one federal, one 
provincial, doing essentially the same thing.
<P>
	It is time to make clear distinctions between income 
supplements and income insurance and to clarify exactly which 
level of government is responsible for delivering those services.
<P>
	I also believe that the level of government that is closest to the 
people is most often in the best position to effectively 
administer these types of programs.
<P>
	Second, would taxpayers like to have social programs 
structured to lessen the dependency on the system and 
encourage clients to become economically productive? This is 
the question the government should be asking.
<P>
	Third, would taxpayers agree that our social programs should 
be designed in such a way as to encourage administrators to 
achieve the stated goals of the program, for example lower 
unemployment?
<P>
	Fourth, would taxpayers like to have social programs that are 
financially sustainable? In particular, should the unemployment 
insurance program be self-financing? I wonder what the answer 
would be if we asked taxpayers those questions.
<P>
	Fifth, if the government is going to initiate large scale reforms 
to our income security system and unemployment insurance 
programs, should the government hold a national referendum to 
ask for the approval of the majority of Canadians? If we make all 
these changes, should they not be given some say in the final 
outcome?
<P>
	Six, would taxpayers prefer to have the UI program operate 
like a true insurance program, meaning that workers who make 
repeated claims on the system and employers who repeatedly lay 
off workers would have to pay higher premiums for the higher 
risk that they represent?
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Seven, would taxpayers like to make our income security and 
unemployment insurance programs truly accountable? Would 
Canadians like to receive annual statements indicating how 
much they paid into each program and how much they received 
in benefits?
<P>
	Eight, do taxpayers think that income security programs 
should be targeted to those who need them most?
<P>
	Nine, would taxpayers prefer to have income security 
programs and the unemployment insurance program treat all 
Canadians equally regardless of the area in the country in which 
they reside? Should they be treated equal no matter where they 
are? While reformers believe that Canadians have a right to live 
anywhere they want in this great country we also believe that no 
one has a right to become a permanent ward of the state.
<P>
	The next question is would taxpayers agree that the goal of the 
unemployment insurance program be to minimize and if 
possible eliminate all abuse to the system? I am sure that people 
would agree.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4670"> 4670 </A></B>
<P>
	Eleven, do taxpayers think that the unemployment insurance 
program should be administered by the workers and the 
employers who pay the premiums? Further, let us ask if workers 
had a choice would they ask the government to administer the UI 
program for them? Would they hand over the reins? I think not.
<P>
	Twelve, do taxpayers, workers and employers think that the 
unemployment insurance program should be completely 
voluntary, or should it be compulsory as it is now? That would 
be a very interesting question to ask.
<P>
	Thirteen, would workers rather have a choice about where 
they invest their UI premiums? Would workers get a better 
return on their investment than the UI program offers them?
<P>
	Reformers asked the government how many jobs would be 
created if workers were investing their UI premiums for 
themselves rather than sending the $8.3 billion to the 
government to redistribute. If they had that money to invest I 
wonder if there would not be more jobs created in this country 
than at present.
<P>
	Fourteen, would unions not be able to provide unemployment 
insurance for their members if the workers they represent chose 
to contribute their premiums to the union rather than send them 
to the government? Would that not be a very interesting question 
to put to the workers and see what their answer would be?
<P>
	Fifteen, would employers like to have the choice about where 
they would invest the $11.7 billion in UI premiums? Would they 
like to have some choice as to where to put that money?
<P>
	Employers pay more UI premiums than their workers. This is 
a cost of labour for the employer and is really money coming out 
of the pockets of the workers. How many jobs would be created 
if employers were allowed to invest that $11.7 billion that is 
spent on UI premiums if they could invest them back in their 
company? What if they could put that money into training 
programs, into research, into development, into export and 
market development, capital improvements and expansion? The 
changes would be phenomenal if they had a choice as to what to 
do with that money.
<P>
	On February 23 the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said in this House that reducing UI premiums will 
create 40,000 new jobs in this country. The Canadian Labour 
Congress in a brief to the standing committee on human 
resources development stated if seven cents off UI premiums 
resulted in 40,000 jobs created then reducing premiums $2.80 
would create 1.6 million jobs, and we would have arrived at full 
employment.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	That is what I call a real job creation program. What would 
employment be in this country? It would be zero if we created 
1.6 million jobs. To be fair, the CLC is  sceptical that if we 
reduced premiums that far it would create that many jobs. 
Reformers are not that sceptical.
<P>
	Reformers believe that $1 left in the hands of workers or 
employers for them to invest is worth $5 in the hands of 
government, a ratio of one to five. Reformers have a much 
different vision about income security and income insurance 
programs. Reformers believe in asking Canadians what they 
think. Reformers believe in giving Canadians a choice. 
Reformers believe that changes as big as the ones proposed by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development should be 
ratified by the people in a binding national referendum.
<P>
	These are huge decisions that we are making. That department 
alone administers $69 billion. The people know better than the 
government what needs to be done, and we ought to give them 
that choice.
<P>
	For years now the polls show us that in many cases our 
government is doing the exact opposite to what the majority of 
Canadians want, whether it is on capital punishment, going easy 
on criminals, failing to cut government spending or on the 
unemployment insurance program. It is time to not only listen to 
the people but to act on what grassroots Canadians are telling us.
<P>
	Reformers trust the people to make the right choices for this 
country. Reformers believe that democracy is not something 
that we practice once every four or five years in the voting 
booth. Reformers believe that democracy is something that has 
to be worked at and each and every day we serve our constituents 
as members of Parliament.
<P>
	I have told the constituents of Yorkton-Melville that I am 
their voice in the House. I sincerely hope that each and every 
member has the courage to ask the tough questions and to 
represent their constituents' wishes in the House as Reformers 
do every day.
<P>
	Let us get our UI program on a solid foundation. We would not 
buy a horse with three legs. We would make sure that horse is 
solid and firm. That is what we have to do. We have to get 
principles in place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
earlier to the speech made by my colleague and there is one thing 
that I would like to add first, namely that the way they are going 
now, if they cut where they would like to, he would not even be 
able to afford an artificial leg for his three-legged horse.
<P>
	But the tenth point he made was about eliminating all abuses 
to the UI system and I would like to comment on that. You know, 
we all agree that people should not be abusing this program. 
However, I would like him to tell me first what percentage of 
claimants abuse the system and second, since unemployment 
insurance is financed by the men and women of Canada, of 
Quebec, are we going to penalize all the members of a family 
with ten children, let us say, when only one is guilty? I have a 
logical answer to that and I would like him to clarify the tenth 
point he made, when he said that we must put an  end to all 
abuses of the system. Does it mean that it is necessary to 
penalize all the people of Canada and Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4671"> 4671 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments but I cannot agree with the analysis 
here. If one had a horse missing one leg of course one would not 
buy a wooden leg or prosthesis for it. That is not going to fix it 
but that is what this government is trying to do. It is tinkering 
with the system.
<P>
	It is making little changes here and there. It is like putting a 
wooden leg on a horse. It is not going to win any races and that is 
the same with the programs that it is trying to tinker with, trying 
to change. It is just like putting a wooden leg on a horse. We 
cannot do it that way. We have to establish some sound 
principles. We have to decide what is important. Is this an 
insurance program or is it a welfare program? That is the basis 
on which we should put our UI program.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I do not believe in penalizing people and hurting them. We 
have a welfare system in place. It has a certain job to do. Let us 
make sure it is doing the job and let us make sure the UI 
insurance program is doing its job.
<P>
	I quoted the numbers. I do not see how anyone can argue with 
them. Employees contribute over $8 billion to this program. 
Employers contribute over $11 billion. Just think what we could 
do with that money if we left it in their hands and let them 
administer these things. We would not have the problems we 
have now. However, when government gets involved it takes 
$5 to do what someone in the private sector would only take $1 
to do. That is the key thing we have to remember in all this. We 
can argue all these fine little details but we need to make some 
wholesale changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me start by 
addressing the comments made by the previous speaker from the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Part of his comments were that municipal governments, local 
governments are closest to the people and they are best able to 
make choices in how we might run the country. The inference 
was to let them have more say in how federal government 
moneys are spent and let us try to do more to co-ordinate.
<P>
	I have absolutely no problem with having that take place. I 
think co-ordination of effort by all parts of government is 
something that would be very cost effective and it would serve 
the people and all local governments very well, as well as the 
provinces.
<P>
	Let me draw a little more on my municipal experience. I spent 
eight years with the regional municipality of Waterloo and the 
city of Waterloo. Somehow there was a better focus on debate. 
There was a better focus on trying to do what was best for the 
citizens of the community in a lot less partisan fashion that 
happens in this House.
<P>
	Being in the House today and listening to some of the debate 
on Bill C-17, as well as having been through question period, 
the amount of sanctimony coming from the opposition as well as 
the non-official parties is bothersome.
<P>
	I heard references that go back to the 1972 Liberal 
government. I am part of the class of 1993. In 1972 I was not 
involved in partisan politics. I know what happened in 1972 but 
some of the programs that government came out with in 1972 are 
really not applicable today.
<P>
	Let me read something for members. I am going to quote very 
briefly from a presentation made to the Conference Board of 
Canada by the chief administrative officer of the city of 
Waterloo, Mr. Bob Byron, with whom I had the pleasure of 
working. I found him to be a new breed of civil servant, a new 
breed of manager. I can say that Gerry Thompson, who was the 
chief administrative officer at the region of Waterloo, is also of 
the same mould.
<P>
	He talks about governments and how municipal governments 
are experiencing severe reductions in sources of revenue. He 
states: ``To compensate Waterloo has significantly reduced its 
workforce and actively pursued lesser cost activities. However, 
these are short term measures and further effort is required to 
achieve long term permanent savings.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Traditionally local government has looked first at its 
expenditure requirements and then at where the revenue would 
come from to support the expenditures.
<P>
	What needs to be done is to look at what revenues are 
available and then decide how expenditures can be controlled to 
fit the resources available.
<P>
	I believe that simply raising taxes is counterproductive and 
serves only to create additional hardships on businesses and 
individuals faced with prospects of little or no growth in their 
revenue potential. Reduction in service or service level which 
tends to alienate the taxpayer is not a solution. The solution lies 
in productivity gain and lowering of costs''.
<P>
	Certainly from the municipal perspective in Ontario that is a 
very good and prudent approach.
<P>
	One thing that the municipal government does not have to do 
in our system in the Waterloo region is to offset the cost of high 
unemployment. The municipal government in our jurisdiction 
does not pay for social assistance. The regional government 
does. It has a different approach. Because regional governments 
have to pay 20 per cent of the welfare costs, when their budgets 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4672"> 4672 </A></B>
<P>
get tight they cut back on expenditures on hard services such as 
sewage, roads and what have you.
<P>
	I mention this because at those two levels of government you 
have different mandates. The regional government has no 
option. It has to provide 20 per cent of the welfare costs. The 
municipal government does not have to do it so it can plan much 
better within the terms of its fiscal realities.
<P>
	Debates at the local level tend to bring together the collective 
wisdom from different frames of reference in an non-partisan 
fashion on to the issue. We really try to accomplish what we 
believe is the best for the ratepayers of our municipalities.
<P>
	I do not find the same level of co-operation in the House. It 
seems to me that the job of the governing party, of which I am a 
member, is to put forward programs and the job of the 
opposition is to oppose it. Whether it is consistent in its 
opposition really does not matter very much.
<P>
	I can talk about some parts of the debate where arguments 
came from every different angle. We have had the Bloc say that 
the government should not be looking at social programs, it 
should not be looking at health care programs, let us keep the 
status quo because somehow it has served us well.
<P>
	The Bloc even went further and said that we did not talk about 
the reform of social programs or the reform of the health care 
system prior to the election. We did. We talked about reforming 
health care and there were very good reasons for it. The reasons 
are the way our health care expenditures have been going. We 
cannot just keep throwing money at a very necessary service but 
one that needs to undergo fundamental reform.
<P>
	If you can practise preventive health care you are going to 
save billions and billions of dollars in terms of providing the 
level of service to the Canadian public that they have come to 
expect.
<P>
	Another nice thing about it is that by doing preventive health 
care we also have the opportunity of having a healthier public. 
One of the problems we have had in the health care system is that 
it has been sort of a crisis care, when you get sick you go to the 
doctor. If you look at the mortality rate over the last 100 years, 
the reality is that it was not the medical profession that cut it 
back so drastically. It was the civil engineer who was able to 
provide safe, wholesome water. It has been our ability to handle 
waste that has made the greatest impact on health care, as well as 
the medical officers of health. They have been the ones who 
have been working on health care in the preventive sense.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Now we are looking to see if something better can be done to 
make better use of the dollars we have. I think that is very 
important. We know social services have become very 
expensive and that is the reason we are having the social 
services review.
<P>
	One thing I would stress when we examine the whole issue of 
social services is that the Canadian public wants a safety net to 
catch people at a time when they might be totally disabled and 
we expect to support them for the long term. Certainly if they 
become unemployed they want us to support them in a new 
emerging economy where training, retraining and education 
become very strong components and pillars of our whole 
economic system.
<P>
	The expectations are in the long term that no longer can 
people work for one company for 25, 30, 35, 40 or 50 years. The 
chances are they are going to be moving on to a number of 
different jobs. As firms get smaller they are getting smarter. 
They are better at responding to economic conditions. Those are 
going to be the major employers and the creators of new jobs.
<P>
	The budget recognizes this and deals with it when it says that 
85 per cent of the new jobs are going to be created by small and 
medium sized businesses.
<P>
	When I talk about small and medium sized businesses I speak 
for the federal riding of Waterloo which is really one of the 
leaders in the new economy that has emerged. It is exciting but it 
also takes a lot of work trying to keep up with the changes that 
are taking place and watching the new emerging technologies.
<P>
	Sunday evening I spoke with a gentleman from Elmira from 
Brubacher Technologies whose family for generations has been 
involved in shoe repair and building shoes. Now his company is 
going to be getting into the high tech production of orthopaedic 
shoes. Why is it exciting? It is exciting because at the present 
time it might take his company 40 to 60 hours to make one shoe 
and now because of high tech he is going to be able to do it in 40 
to 60 minutes. His business is a world leader in this area.
<P>
	Many other companies are leaders in the high tech field. We 
recently had a software firm which sold for $100 million. It was 
developed by a number of university professors and it had a 
number of university students involved with it. That is not a bad 
sum of money when you think about it. However, the sad part is 
that the new owners are American.
<P>
	The challenge for us is to somehow create a climate where 
those businesses which are on the verge of becoming big 
businesses will stay in this country.
<P>
	I mentioned that I found the debate to be not very consistent 
on different levels. When I was looking through my <I>Quorum</I> 
today, as I am sure everybody else has, I came up with a story 
from the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> authored by Barbara Yaffe. She asks: 
``Do we need more MPs? Let's look at the cost''. I know that the 
Reform Party is very strong in its opposition to us looking at the 
whole question of the boundaries.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4673"> 4673 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to step back a little bit to my municipal mode. It is 
interesting that about two weeks ago I was at the electoral 
boundaries commission meeting. Of course, I am the Liberal 
member of Parliament and my former colleague, Mayor Brian 
Turnbull, who is a staunch Conservative supporter, was there to 
support me in my quest. We do not want the wholesale 
rearrangement of boundaries in the region.
<P>
	The other interesting thing is that the NDP candidate in the 
last election, Scott Piatkowsky, was also there making the same 
pitch. A motion from Waterloo city council was also moved 
speaking to the point that we do not like how the redistribution 
was proposed and we wanted to keep the boundaries intact. That 
motion was moved by the former Reform candidate who is now 
on the Waterloo city council. Following my presentation, my 
colleague from Kitchener made a similar presentation. The 
former member for Cambridge from the Conservative Party also 
came forward to make a presentation.
<P>
	The reason I recount this is because it amazed me. I have been 
on the Hill for a time and we have partisan politics. Somehow we 
are not able to capture that sense of community where party 
lines are crossed to preserve the integrity of communities. That 
is essentially what we did when we were in Hamilton talking 
about the redistribution.
<P>
	It would be very useful if we could bring that kind of spirit to 
the debates in this House. We probably would strengthen the 
country. Of course there is no question that the Bloc Quebecois 
is not interested in strengthening Canada, certainly not with 
Quebec in it. That is what they campaigned on and we all 
acknowledge it.
<P>
	What is bothersome though is at a time when there is fiscal 
instability around the world and a lot of our economic 
performance depends on the confidence of the fiscal markets, it 
is unfortunate that debate is being ignited even more so by the 
leader of the Reform Party. I thought it was just the bailiwick of 
the Bloc Quebecois but I see the Reform Party is picking it up. 
That is too bad because at the beginning of this session in 
January the leader of the Reform Party would stand up and say 
he did not want the Prime Minister to break his promise not to 
discuss the Constitution, that he wanted us to get on with other 
business. It is unfortunate he has forgotten those statements.
<P>
	I raise that because another area where the Reform Party has 
been less than helpful is with the fiscal markets. It is forever 
trying to say the road we are headed on is going to bankrupt this 
country. It has only been six months since the election. During 
that time we put our plan forward to the electorate. That plan 
was the famous red book. When I was at the committee on 
human rights and the disabled today, I was glad to see one of the 
Reform Party members quoting from it, which is good.
<P>
	However we came through with a plan and we are essentially 
keeping our promise of doing what we said we were going to do 
if we got elected. I do not believe that Reform Party members 
would truly expect us to go counter to what we said we were 
going to do.
<P>
	Let me touch on another point before closing. There is no 
question in my mind that government, certainly at the federal 
and provincial levels, has to get a lot more efficient. I have 
raised an issue, as most of my colleagues know, on waste and 
move management by the government. I think we can improve 
that. I look forward to improving that and I look to the minister 
of defence to realize some savings in that area. I am sure all 
members could act in that fashion collectively. Let us see to 
what extent we can eliminate waste.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	This government has recognized the fiscal realities we are in. 
We said we are going to bring down the deficit to 3 per cent of 
the GDP within three years. We recognize the deficit problem 
cannot be solved by cutting out programs, the safety net and the 
UI benefits which are put in place to assist the people most hurt 
by the downturn in the economy.
<P>
	We recognize that job creation has to be part of the solution. 
There is no question in the mind of my government that the best 
social program we can have is to make sure there is the 
economic climate so that all those people who want to work are 
able to work and contribute to society.
<P>
	I call upon members of the opposition to support that aim. 
Ultimately we are talking about developing the Canadian 
people. We are talking about developing the country and we are 
talking about keeping our country united.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the hon. member's speech. I appreciate his sentiments 
with respect to working together as opposed to engaging in the 
rhetoric of partisan politics. However, I was very disappointed 
by his comments with respect to our being in opposition and 
therefore always opposing. I do not know how he did not hear 
what we have been saying today. The elements of Bill C-17 that 
we support were clearly enunciated. We basically support most 
of it.
<P>
	The freezing of salaries makes a lot of sense. The government 
proposes it and we agree with it. We are on the same wavelength. 
We agree on the capping of the transfer of money through the 
Canada assistance plan. On the reduction in transportation 
subsidies though it affects us most vigorously in the west, we 
agree. In these times of fiscal restraint, those things need to be 
done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4674"> 4674 </A></B>
<P>
	I challenge this concept of the previous speaker when he says 
we always oppose because we are in opposition. No, we are here 
to debate the issues. I am very deeply committed to not reduce 
myself to name calling. Let us stay on the issues and if we agree, 
then let us say we agree.
<P>
	On reducing the UIC rates, I really could not agree with the 
member more. As was previously stated today, if that reduction 
of seven cents is so significant in creating jobs, perhaps we 
ought to look at it further.
<P>
	At the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology where I 
worked before, 750 instructors together with the employer 
portion contribute an amount of money which would give about 
60 people jobs, each at $35,000 a year. That is from 750 
instructors at NAIT.
<P>
	Clearly that money left in the hands of the individual would be 
very useful in creating real ongoing jobs. Someone could then 
afford to have their leaking roof fixed instead of just paying 
their taxes and UIC premiums and getting nothing for it. The 
individual would have a job instead of the benefit of UIC.
<P>
	I appreciate very much those members in the Bloc who are 
saying that we are threatening the very poorest among us, but 
that is very narrow thinking. That is saying that all we can do to 
help poor people is to give them a handout in the form of UIC or 
welfare. The most significant thing we can do for them is, as the 
hon. member just said in his speech, to provide an economic 
climate in which there is prosperity. That is done by reducing 
government spending and allowing the marketplace to be 
strong.
<P>
	I appreciate the member's speech. He has said a lot of good 
things, but I would encourage him to listen more carefully 
before he jumps to the conclusion that we are always opposing. 
We are not.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me respond to that. I will expect 
Reform Party members to support us whenever we say we are 
going to have a reduction but the feeling I always get from them 
is that we have not cut enough. There is not that sense that we 
have a balance in how much we have cut. I listened to the hon. 
member and the only thing missing was his saying that if we 
were to cut more his party would have supported it more. I am 
calling on that recognition to find a balance.
<P>
	In the debate on the infrastructure program Reform Party 
members opposed it in general, as a party and as individuals. I 
can only point out that is part of the balanced approach and 
investing in the infrastructure of this country will give us the 
opportunity to have growth. That is a role for government in the 
expenditure of public funds. Private enterprise is not in the 
business of building public facilities such as roads, sewage 
treatment plants, and what have you.
<P>
	I remind Reform members to be a little more balanced in 
terms of the cuts and to recognize that cuts alone without control 
are not going to solve our economic woes. We have to have a 
much more constrained level of spending. We have to be much 
more fiscally prudent. At the same time we also have 
investments to make which we as a government believe we have 
to do.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
direct my question to the hon. member for Waterloo.
<P>
	In relation to the opposition, his statement was that 
government proposes programs and the opposition opposes 
programs. As my colleague has pointed out, our role in 
opposition is not to carte blanche oppose programs. It is to 
identify possible weaknesses or omissions and to offer 
constructive criticism and possible alternative solutions.
<P>
	The final decision still rests with the party in power. Its role is 
to make those decisions possibly based on other considerations. 
Our possible options may appear as not being constructive but 
on the other hand the decision is there for the government to 
make.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased the member is as aware of Reform 
policy as he is of his red book. He reminded me of a lot of 
Reform policy today in his speech.
<P>
	The hon. member made reference to the fact that 85 per cent of 
jobs are provided by small business and he also made reference 
to high tech coming into small business. I would like to hear his 
comments in relation to high tech possibly eliminating a number 
of jobs in small businesses and it is the small businesses that are 
being hit by taxes and low wages, et cetera.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question that there is a 
historical role to official opposition parties and third parties and 
other oppositions that are not official.
<P>
	What I saw when I walked into this House today is something 
we see every day. Canadians come from across this country. 
They take pictures and have great respect for this institution of 
ours. It amazes me that if I were to listen to the debate in this 
House long enough I would get the impression we were a third 
world country and we were going to be bankrupt next week and 
the whole country was going to fall to pieces. We know that is 
not the case. I was looking forward to a kinder and gentler 
House. We started off talking about that but somehow the 
rhetoric since the start of this 35th Parliament has not followed 
that up.
<P>
	Certainly on the second point the member says she is glad I 
am aware of Reform policies. The point that needs to be made is 
that most members of the House are new. The class of '93 has a 
different perspective from that of previous Parliaments.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4675"> 4675 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I dare say the thinking of most parliamentarians who returned 
and have been here for a number of years-some have been here 
for a number of decades-has changed in terms of current 
realities. I like to think of myself as a small <I>r</I> reformer. I have 
been one ever since I have been involved in municipal politics 
and in community activity preceding that. I will continue to be a 
reformer a long time after I am gone from this place. In terms of 
high tech hurting small business, I guess in the new, changing 
economy we as a country have to make sure we are playing a 
major role.
<P>
	I refer to my experience in the federal riding of Waterloo. It is 
the home of the University of Waterloo, an excellent technical 
university. It also has a good arts program. Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
University is down the street and is very strong in business. In 
our community we are very much players in the new economy. 
We are seeing the creation of thousands and thousands of jobs. I 
can only say that it is working for us. We have the lowest 
unemployment figures in Canada at 7.1 per cent. Of course 
many of our firms are exporting. It is amazing how many of our 
export firms are bringing hundreds of millions of dollars into the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Mercier-Fisheries; the hon. 
member for Yukon-Employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am glad you allow me this new opportunity to talk about Bill 
C-17.
<P>
	Ever since the finance committee formed a sub-committee to 
study Bill C-17, a measure implementing the largest reform of 
the unemployment insurance program ever undertaken by a 
federal government and freezing the salary of public servants, 
among other things, I have closely followed this matter, as a 
member of the committee and as an opposition member 
provided with limited means. I have tried to do a little more than 
my Liberal friends, I have tried to make democracy speak.
<P>
	You know that, despite the fact that this bill is the largest 
reform ever done of social programs in general and 
unemployment insurance in particular, the Liberal government 
had planned on only two days of hearings, including one with 
senior officials who were to explain to sub-committee members 
the provisions and technical interpretations of Bill C-17. 
Without the intervention of the Bloc Quebecois which 
demanded that we make a more thorough study of such a 
fundamental piece of legislation for social programs and for the 
future of many communities in Quebec and Canada, we would 
not have had, like we did, the equivalent of a week and a half to 
hear witnesses.
<P>
	I can understand why, this morning, when the secretary to the 
minister of industry, trade and commerce rose to speak on Bill 
C-17, he did not dare speak about it, because he was ashamed of 
that bill. Selling Bill C-17 is an impossible task.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	That is why he naively spoke about his recent trip to China. 
Do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that they are proposing a 
$5.5 billion cut in the UI system over the next three years. It is 
all about the despair of the many individuals who must endure 
the evils of unemployment, the plague of unemployment, in 
Quebec and in Canada, but the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry would rather tell us about his trip to China.
<P>
	I was outraged when I heard him. I controlled myself, since 
control is still the best attitude, but I want to say now to my 
Liberal colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Industry, that the way he is dealing with this bill is 
outrageous.
<P>
	You were here this morning, Mr. Speaker, so you heard as well 
this same member, and others around him from the Liberal Party 
of Canada, shouting down duly elected members of the Bloc 
quebecois and tarnishing their reputation. Not only according to 
Quebecers who elected us, but also to Canadians in general, on 
basic issues such as the future of social programs, the economic 
policy, the disgraceful benefits enjoyed by the richest 
Canadians-family trusts-the Bloc Quebecois is the real 
Official Opposition.
<P>
	Without us, many more objectionable measures like the ones 
implemented since the February 23 budget and measures that are 
unpopular and harmful to ordinary citizens, to taxpayers, would 
have been adopted by the government since it took power.
<P>
	When a bill or government measure is indefensible, it is 
normal that members opposite resort rapidly to insults since it is 
the only weapon they have to sell a plan that is rotten from the 
start as far as unemployment insurance is concerned.
<P>
	As my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, did this 
morning, I would like to point out that close to 60 per cent of the 
planned cuts in unemployment insurance for 1995-96 will hit 
two regions: first, the Atlantic, and second, Quebec. It is 60 per 
cent even though these two regions have only one third of 
Canada's population.
<P>
	Indeed, in 1995-96, the Atlantic provinces, with only 8.5 per 
cent of the population, will lose $630 million, bearing 26 per 
cent of the cuts for that year. The same thing will happen in 
Quebec, where the federal government will cut $735 million in 
unemployment insurance benefits, or 33 per cent of the total for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4676"> 4676 </A></B>
<P>
that year, when the province has only 24 per cent of the Canadian 
population.
<P>
	From the beginning, there was an East-West split in the 
decision to dip into the UI fund. In 1990, in Quebec, we had the 
report titled <I>Deux Québec dans un</I>. Some of my colleagues 
remember very well that that report identified two Quebecs: one 
that was participating in and benefitings from economic 
development, and the other, rural Quebec, that was excluded.
<P>
	The measure proposed by the federal government also 
identifies two regions where unemployment and 
underemployment are most widespread. There is more 
widespread unemployment and underemployment in these 
regions than any measure contained in the red book can ever 
solve, despite the fact that those people have shouted 
themselves hoarse, some to the point of losing their voices, 
waving the red book and claiming that jobs were the priority of 
the Liberal governement. In spite of all this, no concrete, 
meaningful, structural measures have been put into place in 
order to create sustainable employment. Instead, the 
government chose to take it out on two regions which do not 
deserve that, precisely because they are regions where 
underemployment and poverty are the most striking.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The measure to increase from 10 to 12 the number of weeks of 
insurable employment required to be eligible for unemployment 
benefits, which are themselves reduced in terms of percentage 
and of the number of weeks covered, has plunged several rural 
communities into utter confusion. These communities have 
already suffered, in the case of the Maritime Provinces, from the 
reduction of the fishing activity, from the reduction of the 
farming activity because of low prices and of the international 
crisis and from the reduction of forestry activity, all of which are 
seasonal.
<P>
	The measure to increase from 10 to 12 the number of weeks of 
insurable employment required to be eligible for unemployment 
benefits directly affects the Maritime Provinces and part of 
Quebec, in particular the Lower St. Lawrence and the 
Matapédia-Matane areas and, in general, the Gaspé Peninsula. 
In these regions, where the activities are concentrated in one 
industry or are seasonal, many already had difficulty gathering 
the 10 weeks of insurable employment previously required.
<P>
	I was flabbergasted when I realized that 60 per cent of 
unemployment insurance cutbacks would be made in the 
Maritimes and Quebec, particularly because the Maritimes were 
really hit in a horrible way. I was shocked when I thought that 
the current Prime Minister was once the member for Beauséjour 
and that, while he knew about the social and economic realities 
of that riding, he had accepted, as leader of the government, that 
such disastrous measures for rural communities be put in place.
<P>
	I was even more flabbergasted when I heard the Prime 
Minister allude recently to the people of Beauséjour and said 
that the unemployed were beer drinkers. I understood then that 
our Prime Minister, when treating the unemployed this way, the 
most disadvantaged people of our society, when saying things 
like that, was not a head of state because a head of state has to 
show respect for the people who elected him and allowed him to 
be the member for that riding for four years and to come back 
into politics. I found that to be really shocking, coming from a 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	Besides, what we heard from the Prime Minister and what I 
saw in the committee which examined Bill C-17 are very much 
similar to systematic cynicism. I also had to live for two weeks 
with sarcastic remarks from my Liberal colleagues. I am still 
calling them my colleagues even though I am deeply 
disappointed with the attitude of the Liberal members on the 
finance sub-committee.
<P>
	We had witnesses, mainly from remote areas in Quebec, such 
as the Lower St. Lawrence, the riding of my colleague from 
Matapédia-Matane, and also from Gaspé. People came before 
the finance sub-committee from Newfoundland and Labrador 
where, at times, unemployment reaches 85 per cent. These 
people do not know where to turn to. They had pinned their 
hopes on this new government which talked about creating jobs, 
as well as restructuring and diversifying regional economies. 
They believed in the government. So, now that it has hit them 
with those measures, they do not know where to turn to 
anymore.
<P>
	We had people from Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and 
from both Acadian and anglophone communities in New 
Brunswick.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I will quote from a short newspaper article to illustrate the 
cynicism and the sarcasm shown by the Prime Minister who 
attended these sub-committee hearings. This article was 
entitled ``New Brunswickers appearing before a sub-committee 
on unemployment insurance reform are kicked out after barely 
an hour''. They kicked out people who came all the way from 
New Brunswick, even before their allotted time had expired.
<P>
	If you allow me, I will quote Mrs. Mathilda Blanchard, who 
has been a union activist for the past 40 years. She said: ``I have 
never been treated that way in my 40 years as a trade unionist''. 
And you can read further that: ``After coming to Ottawa, all the 
way from New Brunswick, to discuss the impact of 
unemployment insurance reform on her area, she and another 
group were cut short after only 30 minutes. The two other groups 
from New Brunswick that came after her were treated the same 
way''.
<P>
	In conclusion, the parliamentary committee which was 
reviewing Bill C-17 and certain budget provisions summoned to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4677"> 4677 </A></B>
<P>
Ottawa four Acadian groups but gave them only a total of 60 
minutes to explain the consequences of the reform, when they 
were entitled to twice that time.
<P>
	However, a number of business representatives, friends of the 
party who benefit from what we call tax loopholes and tax 
conventions, did voice their support for the government's 
measures. These individuals also receive preferential treatment 
from this government and contribute to the Liberal Party's 
coffers. This one group alone was allowed to testify for 
47 minutes, whereas normally they would have been entitled to 
30 minutes. However, because they were voicing their support 
for such hateful measures as cuts to unemployment insurance 
and because they spoke the same language as the government, 
viewing the jobless as lazy, they were allotted 50 per cent more 
time than they would normally have had.
<P>
	I am flabbergasted to see that, in politics, there are people 
who behave this way toward Quebecers and Canadians, and 
dismiss offhand the lives of others, people who have no sense of 
fair play, the fair play which the members opposite claim to 
have, the same members who profess to be great Canadian 
democrats who listen to all Canadians. When we see things like 
this happen, we have some very serious doubts about the honesty 
of these individuals.
<P>
	I would also point out that when the witnesses from the 
Maritimes testified, no Reform members were on hand because, 
despite what they say about being great Canadians from coast to 
coast, each time an issue arises which affects that part of the 
country east of Manitoba where they have no representation, 
then they become a little less Canadian. I find this rather sad.
<P>
	Thursday evening, on the last day of hearings, there was one 
Bloc member on hand and no Liberal members, except for the 
chairman, and no Reform members. Perhaps they prefer to go 
out and dine in a good restaurant on Thursdays. In any case, the 
scheduled witnesses were from Newfoundland. When they 
showed up, they were astounded and scandalized. That evening, 
we were quite pleased when we were told that there was only one 
party in the House of Commons willing to defend 
Newfoundlanders and Maritimers, and that party was the Bloc 
Quebecois. How very cynical of this government. The other 
party is also blatantly guilty of not taking matters seriously.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	In view of all this, of the cynicism displayed by this 
government in spite of its positive bias for employment, in view 
also of the proposed cuts to the UI program and the way the 
people who are the hardest hit by unemployment are being 
treated, I cannot help but compare their treatment to the 
coddling treatment of Canada's wealthiest families.
<P>
	This morning and again this afternoon, family trusts were 
discussed. We were reminded that, year after year, the 
government deliberately forfeits between $350 million and $1 
billion in revenue, owing to a policy put in place by Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau in 1972 and commonly known as family trusts. I 
cannot help but contrast the preferential treatment given to the 
wealthiest families in Canada against these cuts to the 
unemployment insurance program and their destabilizing effect 
on rural communities in Quebec and the Maritimes.
<P>
	I cannot help either, since the two bills were debated one after 
the other, but think about the tax treaties in Bill S-2 and how 
major Canadian corporations have managed to dodge taxation 
and pocket hundreds of millions of dollars every year. I cannot 
help but notice that this government will cut $5 billion in social 
programs, and in the unemployment insurance program in 
particular, over the next three years, and in that it treats ordinary 
citizens the way I just described.
<P>
	I would have liked to speak longer, but you are signalling that 
I have only one minute remaining. I will say this. I urge the 
government to reconsider its position on Bill C-17, in particular 
regarding the proposed cuts to unemployment insurance, 
because these measures will completely destabilize several 
communities in the Maritimes and in Quebec.
<P>
	I would also request, with respect to another measure 
contained in this bill, namely wage freeze, to return to a better 
frame of mind. Twice in the matter of four years action had to be 
taken by the International Labour Office to remind the Canadian 
government it is required to abide by international conventions 
concerning free collective bargaining. When in opposition, the 
Liberals denounced the freezes imposed by the Conservative 
government, but they are now following their lead.
<P>
	I am calling for a return to a better frame of mind because the 
government cannot go on like this, treating the people of Quebec 
and Canada with the kind of arrogance, sarcasm, cynicism and 
brutality they have demonstrated over the past few months. I 
hope for a return to a better frame of mind.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too serve on 
the Standing Committee on Finance and I am very disappointed 
in listening to the previous member's comments. It seems to me 
that he has a different version of the facts than I have. I was there 
and heard some of the comments and some of the explanations 
given.
<P>
	With respect to the people he had invited who were kicked out 
and went to the media after, it was quite clear that some of the 
parties did not have an invitation or arrived unexpectedly and 
were allowed to present their cases. Both of them agreed that 
they would present their cases within a half an hour. The 
chairman of the standing committee gave permission for that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4678"> 4678 </A></B>
<P>
and co-operated so that both parties could be heard, and this is 
the  appreciation they get. The grandstanding and the criticism 
in the press came after that.
<P>
	I was present, I heard the explanation to that and that is a 
different set of facts. I am just saying what I saw and what I 
heard differs from what the hon. member just said.
<P>
	His decision to put on a flair that he is the person now 
representing all of Canada because he has such an interest and 
such a caring heart for the unemployed is adverse to reality. 
Everybody cares about the unemployed, but we also have a 
concern about the deficit and the debt. We also have a concern 
about how to approach it.
<P>
	For a member who quite clearly wants to separate from the 
rest of Canada to state and argue and present a case that we are 
not for Canada borders on double talk or contradiction of terms.
<P>
	He is talking about a member of the Reform Party being 
present or not being present at these committees. I was not the 
individual named to the subcommittee that examined Bill C-17. 
I am sure there were problems getting people together. I am sure 
it was hard to co-ordinate it all because there are only 100 things 
that you have to do within an hour around this place.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	If he truly were interested in representing his point of view, 
representing his argument, I suggest that he would go a lot 
further in accomplishing those goals if he pointed out the 
problems of Bill C-17 as we have, pointed out the constructive 
alternatives to Bill C-17 as we have, and then let the House 
decide which way to vote instead of going around and basically 
distorting the way events actually occurred.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start with the hon. member's 
last remark because it makes me a little angry. He said that, 
instead of criticizing as I do, I should point out the problems of 
Bill C-17 and propose solutions. Mr. Speaker, we just went 
through second reading of Bill C-17 and Reform members were 
too lazy to do anything other than delete clauses. They also 
voted against their own amendments and they are now telling 
Bloc members who put forward constructive amendments 
meeting the concerns of Quebecers and Canadians to make 
constructive suggestions. So why did they make all these 
deletions?
<P>
	In any case, even colleagues with more experience than me 
had never seen anyone propose such amendments and vote 
against their own amendments. If they call this being 
constructive, we also call it wasting our time. If they think the 
way they acted during the second reading debate is constructive, 
we have a problem. We, on the other hand, proposed real 
amendments. We also did some serious work in committee.
<P>
	In answer to the second point raised by the hon. member when 
he said that Reform members were present the night the New 
Brunswickers were thrown out, I would ask him to refer to an 
article published in the May 11, 1994 issue of <I>Le Droit</I>, where 
the journalist noticed the same thing I did in the finance 
committee, namely that no Reform member was present. It is 
there in black and white. There is a problem somewhere.
<P>
	In the third point he made, he said that Bloc members felt deep 
compassion for the people of the Maritimes. Indeed, even 
sovereigntists can be humanistic and feel compassion for 
suffering people but we do not feel as compassionate toward 
those who make them suffer.
<P>
	Do not forget that the sovereignty plan is open to the world 
and that we have been reaching out for 25 years to our friends in 
Canada, the United States and the world to build a better society, 
a society where measures such as the UI proposal that break the 
backs of those who do not deserve such treatment will be 
opposed by sovereigntists. We will fight against that our whole 
lives because the sovereignty plan is strongly humanistic. You 
tarnished that term and our plan. Because people like Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau fought against this plan for 25 years, we must 
work very hard to restore the true foundations of this plan, which 
is open to the world, compassionate and humanistic.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that takes care of the three questions raised by 
the hon. members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess we 
can conclude that the member opposite is not happy with the 
bill.
<P>
	I was chair of the subcommittee on C-17 and I want to 
congratulate all members of the subcommittee from all political 
parties in this House for their work and the time they spent 
hearing innumerable witnesses, almost some 60 witnesses 
representing hundreds of thousands of employed and 
unemployed Canadians. Members of the subcommittee spent 
many hours listening to Canadians and their views both for and 
against the changes contained in Bill C-17.
<P>
	The fact remains that the changes proposed will preserve the 
viability of this system. The changes proposed will build 
flexibility. The changes proposed make sense at this time for 
people on the system.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	While the member opposite may wrap himself in all the 
indignation in the world, the fact is that he did not like the bill 
from the beginning. He was not prepared to hear anybody who 
was in favour of it. I will not get into discussions in the House 
about what took place in committee. I will not discuss that out of 
committee except to say that people on all sides of the issue were 
given a full and fair hearing.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SENIORS-REDUCTIONOFAGECREDIT">SENIORS-REDUCTION OF AGE CREDIT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should withdraw the 
measure to reduce the age credit that it introduced in its most recent budget, and 
retain the Old Age Security Program and the Canada Pension Plan in their 
present forms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Motion M-289 which I am presenting in 
this House today brings out the expectations of seniors 
throughout the country. Groups of seniors from Vanier, Les 
Saules, Limoilou, Neufchâtel, Ancienne-Lorette and Duberger 
in my riding told me about their concerns for the future and I 
fully share these concerns in light of recent events.
<P>
	The present Liberal government displays a serious lack of 
social equity and economic justice. Instead of reducing its 
shameless waste and administrative duplication or even 
requiring the 90,000 corporations that do not pay tax to 
contribute their fair share, the government is attacking the poor, 
the middle class, the disadvantaged, the unemployed and the 
elderly.
<P>
	On the pretext of reducing its deficit, the Liberal government 
is attacking defenceless groups in society which are already in a 
precarious financial situation, because these Liberals are a 
heartless government.
<P>
	In the last budget, we saw how $5.5 billion was taken from the 
unemployed in unemployment insurance programs. We just 
voted on this measure in this House.
<P>
	As for seniors, the first thing the government did in this same 
budget was to reduce the age credit. I say the first thing the 
government did because other equally harmful measures were 
introduced and are still to come from the Liberal government. 
The age credit reduced federal income tax by about $610 a year 
for all taxable seniors. The amendment reduces this credit by 
15 per  cent for all seniors whose taxable income exceeds 
$25,921 and it is totally eliminated for incomes over $49,100.
<P>
	Thus the Liberal government intends to save $490 million by 
1997 on the backs of seniors. Across the country, 800,000 
seniors will be affected by this measure. Does the Liberal 
government consider that an elderly person with an annual 
income of $25,000 is a rich taxpayer? Does it consider that with 
such an amount, which is barely above the poverty level, that 
person must still give money to the government, after having 
paid taxes throughout his life and working hard to be able to 
enjoy a modest income in his retirement years?
<P>
	The federal government did not stop there as regards cuts 
made at the expense of seniors. Its latest idea is to set up a 
centralized answering machine system using voice boxes to 
answer queries from seniors. This dehumanization of services to 
the elderly is simply pitiful!
<P>
	The idea is simple. Offices serving seniors in Val d'Or, 
Chicoutimi, Gatineau, Rimouski, Sherbrooke, Drummondville, 
Trois-Rivières and Sept-Îles will be closed. The number of 
agents in Quebec City will be considerably reduced, since at 
least 123 of the current 347 positions across the province will be 
abolished.
<P>
	In fact, the number of jobs eliminated could reach 50 per cent 
of the current strength and all these positions will be replaced by 
a single telephone exchange in Montreal, a recorded 
questionnaire for touch-tone telephones for seniors across the 
province.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	From now on, the elderly will talk to a pre-recorded voice. 
They will talk to a machine to get the information they need. To 
make things worse, if the lines are overloaded at the Montreal 
exchange, the calls will be transferred to another province. Is 
this not a perfect example of how the government holds our 
elderly in contempt? We can easily imagine the numerous 
problems which they will encounter with this new system. 
Indeed, problems related to hearing, eyesight and dexterity are 
common occurrences in that age group. Talking to a machine 
will create unavoidable difficulties for seniors. How will they be 
able to ask that machine to explain something they do not 
understand? How will they be able to explain particular 
circumstances? How can the machine understand all the 
subtleties of a case and know in which category to find the 
information required by the person?
<P>
	Such recordings are already being used in several locations 
and they never provide the information required. I myself have a 
lot of problems with the touch-tone system requiring you to 
press one for English, two for French, three for general informa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4681"> 4681 </A></B>
<P>
tion, and four for specific information. The question we want to 
ask never falls in the proposed categories.
<P>
	This is not to mention the fact that many elderly do not even 
have a touch-tone telephone. These people, and those who will 
not have managed to get an answer, will be able to talk to an 
agent. But how long will they have to wait? The staff of people 
manning the phones has been cut by nearly 50 per cent. And do 
you think the government bothered to consult senior citizens, 
the group concerned here, or their associations or federations? 
Certainly not! They did not consult seniors to find out whether 
the system met their needs.
<P>
	Liberal members will tell us that the system will provide 
faster and more efficient service. We know that the new system 
will get on a lot of people's nerves. Using speed and efficiency 
as an excuse, the Liberal government will manage to cut down 
on the amount of money paid to seniors, since many seniors will 
give up trying to claim what they are entitled to, because it is so 
hard to get the information they need.
<P>
	Misinformation of its senior clients as a result of a 
dehumanized system will help the Liberals save money at the 
expense of seniors, who did not file the requisite applications or 
were unable to use this so-called speedy and effective system 
correctly. Effective for whom?
<P>
	Many pensioners will forgo their right to the guaranteed 
income supplement, for instance, because of lack of a 
information. The Liberal government prefers to dehumanize the 
system and not inform to its senior clients, so that seniors 
themselves will give up on the service. I think this is sufficient 
proof that the Liberal government is ruthless. Instead of 
attacking seniors, instead of reducing their tax credit or 
changing the way they receive services, the government should 
pull up its socks and cut where cuts are really necessary.
<P>
	Family trusts, for instance. We talked about these in the 
House today during Question Period, to show how the Liberals 
caved in to pressure by lobbyists who wanted to maintain family 
trusts. These family trusts make it possible for rich families to 
put billions of dollars in a tax shelter. We know these trusts 
contain at least $100 billion, and we know who benefits.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Is cutting money for seniors and the unemployed and 
maintaining family trusts the kind of equity the Liberals had in 
mind? A tax of only 20 per cent on the $100 billion in family 
trusts would mean $20 billion, and that kind of measure is 
worthwhile, to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	Abolishing the many tax shelters and loopholes in corporate 
tax would also give the government a chance to show it is 
serious about attacking the deficit. Meanwhile, cutting fat in the 
public service and getting rid of duplication would raise several 
more billion.
<P>
	We should also get rid of historic institutions that are 
symbolic and have become too costly for a country like Canada, 
such as the Senate, on which the government wastes $500 
million annually, and the Governor General, the 
Lieutenant-Governors and the Queen. We also have 90,000 
Canadian corporations that do not pay a cent of income tax, and 
hundreds of millionaires who paid less than $100 in taxes last 
year. They should also contribute towards putting Canada's 
finances back on track, instead of leaving this to our seniors and 
unemployed.
<P>
	There are many other measures I could suggest, if I had more 
time. To paraphrase the Bible: The government giveth and the 
government taketh away. It takes money from us all and gives 
only to a chosen few.
<P>
	Before we make cuts in the Old Age Security Program or the 
Canada Pension Plan, we have to remember that the government 
made some moral commitments when it created these two 
programs. The OAS Program was built with the sweat of our 
senior citizens. In 1952, when this program was introduced, a 
majority of 81 per cent of MPs decided that this program would 
be universal, that is to say that it would be paid to everyone 
reaching the age of eligibility, regardless of their income.
<P>
	When it started, 41 years ago, the OAS Program was being 
financed by a special tax called Old Age Security Tax. The 
government collected this tax with the personal income tax, the 
corporate income tax and the sales tax. The revenues were 
transferred to a special account, the Old Age Security Fund.
<P>
	In 1972, as part of a fiscal reform, the Old Age Security Tax 
was integrated with the general tax. In 1975, the Old Age 
Security Fund was transferred to the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund. Since then, we have all forgotten that people had paid all 
their lives into this program, hoping to receive payments in their 
older years. They planned their retirement with that money in 
mind and, despite the heartless people across the floor, private 
pension plans negotiated with employers took this into 
consideration. The rate of taxation for this program which was 2 
per cent in 1952 had risen to 4 per cent in 1972 and, according to 
established taxation policies, higher income earners have paid 
proportionally more into the plan.
<P>
	This is why the decision taken in 1989 to tax-back the OAS 
payments of senior citizens having an income over $50,000 
outraged those who had contributed to the program, in good 
faith, for almost 40 years.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Taxpayers who have been paying and are still paying specific 
and visible taxes in preparation for their retirement feel that 
they are entitled to get them back. Old age pension is not a 
privilege nor a handout, it is the repayment of a debt society 
owes them.
<P>
	People over 65 are far from being a privileged and rich group. 
Forty per cent of them are eligible to receive the guaranteed 
income supplement which keeps them at the poverty level. For 
72 per cent of female seniors and 50  per cent of male seniors, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4682"> 4682 </A></B>
<P>
old age pension benefits and the guaranteed income supplement 
become an essential source of income.
<P>
	I will say for the benefit of members opposite that, in 1991, 
47 per cent of women over 65 and 18 per cent of men in that 
same age group had an income of less than $10,000. Since the 
poverty line is set at $17,000, one must conclude that nearly half 
the female seniors in this beautiful country live below the 
poverty line. Only 5 per cent of senior citizens make over 
$50,000 a year.
<P>
	It is time to dispel the myth that senior citizens are rich and 
have a grandiose and opulent lifestyle. Only a very happy few 
can afford it. For the vast majority of seniors, old age pension 
and the guaranteed income supplement are the only source of 
income they have.
<P>
	Thanks to such support measures, the quality of life and the 
situation of senior citizens have been greatly improved, even 
though they are far from perfect. Year after year, senior citizens 
are making up an increasingly larger portion of the population. 
It is estimated that the elderly population will increase by 40 per 
cent in the next 15 years. The government would be better off 
focusing on the health and welfare of our seniors, instead of 
shunting them aside, as this Liberal government seems to want 
to do.
<P>
	Such a move would prove costly to society. By cutting 
assistance to seniors, the government will only ensure that 
hospitals fill up faster and that health care costs increase. The 
government must respect senior citizens and recognize their 
contributions to our society.
<P>
	Instead of seeing them as an ideal scapegoat for its deficit 
reduction aims, the Liberal government should view them as an 
untouchable group.
<P>
	Forty years ago, the government signed a social contract, 
agreeing to redistribute the moneys collected from contributors 
once they reached 65 years of age. Now this Liberal government 
is trying to get out of this contract by channelling the funds 
elsewhere, all because it has mismanaged its own affairs.
<P>
	Seniors worked hard all their lives, secure in the knowledge 
that part of their income was being set aside for their golden 
years. Senior citizens are the pioneers who built our country, 
who made sacrifices and who suffered to give us what we now 
enjoy today.
<P>
	Quebec owes its system of caisses populaires, one of the best 
in the world, to its seniors who were there from the very 
beginning and who believed and participated in this venture. We 
owe a great deal to these courageous people who were also 
visionaries. Our seniors were the ones who raised the children 
who now, as adults, are running our businesses. They are the 
ones who fought the battles, and won the victories on which we 
can build today for the future.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Canada owes a lot to seniors for their efforts. The least the 
Liberal government should do is respect them and maintain the 
benefits they have earned.
<P>
	That is why I tabled so far in this House petitions signed by 
almost 3,000 seniors from the Quebec City region who strongly 
deplore the recent measures taken by the Liberal government. I 
ask, as stated in Motion No. 289 that I presented today, that the 
government withdraw the measure to reduce the age credit that it 
introduced in its most recent budget, and retain the Old Age 
Security Program and the Canada Pension Plan in their present 
forms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity on behalf of the government to clarify the measure 
proposed in our February budget regarding the old age credit.
<P>
	This is an issue deserves better than partisan politics, sacred 
cow logic and misinformation because the challenge of an aging 
population is very real for every region of this country.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion states quite bluntly that we plan to 
reduce this credit and he implies that the old age security 
program and Canada pension plan are being altered. Let us deal 
with the facts.
<P>
	To start, the budget contained no changes to old age security 
and the CPP. Here the member's motion is no more than 
unfortunate fearmongering. Next, simply put, budget action on 
the age credit means there is no reduction for three-quarters of 
seniors, about three million people with incomes under $25,921.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to be very clear on this. This budget measure will have 
no effect on the majority of low-income seniors. However, some 
seniors will indeed be affected by this measure.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of what the finance minister 
announced in his last budget. The current age credit provides 
special tax relief for all Canadians subject to tax 65 years of age 
and older, regardless of their income. This includes 200,000 
seniors with personal incomes over $50,000. I am talking about 
personal and not family income.
<P>
	If we want to preserve a social safety net that protects those 
who really need it while reducing the deficit and debt burden 
that translates into ever increasing taxes for all Canadians, we 
cannot continue to subsidize the wealthiest in our society.
<P>
	That is why the budget provides for a gradual reduction of the 
age credit for taxpayers with net personal incomes over $25,921.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4683"> 4683 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a result the credit which reduces federal taxes for a senior 
by just over $600 a year will be reduced for some 800,000 people 
with incomes over the set mark. Of this group the credit will be 
eliminated for some 200,000 seniors, 5 per cent of the total with 
yearly incomes over $50,000.
<P>
	It is true that the budget announced a policy paper will be 
released this year that will examine the challenges and 
opportunities posed by our aging society. The government 
indicated that this paper among other things would examine 
what changes are required to the national pension system to 
make it financially sustainable.
<P>
	I find it ironic and insulting to all Canadians, especially 
seniors, that here we have a member dedicated to the dissolution 
of our country with all the chaos and cost that would entail and 
that same member has sanctimoniously advanced a motion 
demanding the preservation of key elements of that country's 
social safety net. Obviously some status quos are more equal 
than others.
<P>
	I cannot prejudge what will be in the government's policy 
paper on an aging society but it is absurd to demand today that 
something so important as old age security be retained ever 
more unchanged when the pressures of an aging society are 
themselves changing at a rapid clip.
<P>
	Let me remind the member of some more of those basic facts 
that no Canadian dare overlook. Because people are on average 
living longer and having fewer children, our population is aging. 
The proportion of people over age 65 will almost double over the 
next 40 years from 12 per cent today to 23 per cent in the year 
2030. This will have real fiscal consequences. It is estimated 
that this evolution will demand that the contribution rate under 
CPP be pushed up from 5.2 per cent of eligible income to 13 per 
cent by the year 2030. That is almost a triple increase in the 
burden on employers and working age Canadians, a prospective 
increase that will compound a tax burden most people already 
feel is excessive.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Given this outlook I again see this motion as being absurd in 
trying to bind the government's hands by demanding that we 
retain the existing system that would prevent any action to 
improve and preserve the old age security system and the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	That is not surprising. I doubt if the hon. member wants to see 
anything that would improve things for all Canadians, including 
seniors who have spent their lives, building a country that the 
United Nations has again identified as the best place to live in 
the world.
<P>
	I passionately believe that one of the most sacred 
responsibilities any nation has, any government has, is to the 
senior citizens who have built and shaped that nation. Those 
facing economic hardship have a priority call on the best support 
that we can afford. However this respect  and responsibility 
means that we must do what is needed to ensure that we can 
deliver this support consistently and securely in the years ahead. 
Those years will be years when the number of seniors grow 
dramatically.
<P>
	The only way to resolve these dual demands for appropriate 
assistance today and to ensure that government can provide 
assistance tomorrow, this government-the government of a 
united Canada-has to ensure that our fiscal house is put in 
order. The budget did that by wide ranging action to set the 
deficit on a path down to just 3 per cent of GDP. Beyond that we 
are committed to balancing the books in the medium term.
<P>
	Income testing of the old age credit is one part of that fiscal 
action. It reflects the fact that our $500 billion public debt is a 
national problem and that the solution demands actions that will 
touch on many Canadians in all regions. Again let me remind the 
House that for every dollar of fiscal improvement on the tax 
side, our budget took five dollars out of action on the spending 
side. Our actions, like those affecting some seniors, were 
carefully balanced to ensure we do everything possible to 
protect those in real need.
<P>
	In conclusion, I see this motion as nothing more than an 
attempt to play cheap politics with Canada's senior citizens. It 
misrepresents government action and it fearmongers, and that is 
a shame. It supports a status quo without recognizing the shifts 
that are taking place in society. For all these reasons it merits our 
dismissal.
<P>
	Canadians, senior citizens as well as those not yet facing the 
exigencies of retirement age, are willing to pay certain prices to 
ensure that this country remains the best place on earth to live. 
With this government at the helm it will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
last speech was so emotional it almost brought tears to my eyes. 
In particular, hearing the government is going to get its fiscal 
house in order I think the tears were at the humour.
<P>
	During the last election the Liberal candidates said those bad 
Reformers are going to make two classes of seniors by 
determining what their income is and then provide benefits 
based on that determination. Means testing they called it.
<P>
	Here we are after the election looking at the Liberal 
government providing a means test for seniors by developing a 
formula for determining an individual's age tax credit. I wonder 
when Canadians will hear the truth from the traditional parties 
during an election. During an election on the one hand they say 
one thing; on the other hand after the election they do what they 
want to do. Such is the case once again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4684"> 4684 </A></B>
<P>
	Reformers at least were up front with the senior citizens 
indicating that we would preserve the benefits of 
non-contributory social programs, like old age security, for 
Canadians whose household income is below the average 
Canadian family income of $54,000 a year. We also committed 
to reduce and eliminate old age security benefits for households 
above the Canadian average income of $54,000 a year.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Crazy, said the Liberals. Foul, said the Liberals. Unfair, said 
the Liberals. Here we are on the last day of May 1994 and the 
Liberals propose the following. For the 1995 and subsequent 
taxation years, they are going to reduce the individual's age tax 
credit by 15 per cent of the amount, if any, by which the 
individual's income for the year exceeds $25,921. That is a 
means test.
<P>
	For the 1994 taxation year by the lesser of $1,741 or 7.5 per 
cent of the amount, if any, by which the individual's income for 
the year exceeds $25,921. That is a means test.
<P>
	The only word I can think of that applies to those who say one 
thing and do another is hypocrisy, and it does sound familiar.
<P>
	That being said, this reduction or change is somewhat 
progressive and administered in a similar fashion to other tax 
credits such as the child tax benefit. The measure will not affect 
75 per cent of seniors who have incomes below the $25,921 
threshold. Seniors with incomes between $25,000 and $49,000 
will lose a portion of their credit and those with incomes above 
$49,134 will lose it completely.
<P>
	Means testing is very much in line with Reform principles. 
These types of measures should be supported because they are a 
step toward better fiscal management. The idea behind this 
measure is similar to our clawback recommendations for seniors 
collecting old age security while having incomes above the 
average national family income.
<P>
	The tax credit is mostly used by seniors who have substantial 
savings in RRIFs, RRSPs and other investments that yield 
dividends. There is no reason other than political to provide 
further preferential treatment via tax credits. Rather than simply 
using personal income as the base for reducing the tax credit, the 
government should implement family income as the measure, 
especially since this tax credit is transferable to a spouse. 
Further, many low income seniors live within a high income 
household. It is time that the federal government started 
distributing benefits based on need.
<P>
	That reminds me of what happened in the House today as we 
disclosed in question period that this government is providing 
old age security and the supplement, Canada pension and GST 
refunds to people while they are in prison.
<P>
	If you want to look at means testing, if you want to look at why 
we distribute benefits to people, I question very much a 
government that would provide to killers, to people who have 
raped our women, old age security in addition to their housing, 
their food, their recreation, their training, and yet expect seniors 
of our country to live only on old age security. Maybe the 
government should have a look at their own policies again and 
distribute benefits based on need.
<P>
	Currently $1.7 billion goes to seniors via old age security who 
have personal incomes over $50,000. If we considered 
household income this number would be $2.6 billion a year. 
Seniors in this income range also receive $3.5 billion in Canada 
pension by household. Clearly the tax credit can be reduced.
<P>
	Most people would agree that seniors with high incomes 
should not be getting these payments when they could be better 
used to help the truly in need or used toward debt reduction or 
tax relief.
<P>
	The ``old'' old age security and Canada pension exemplifies 
the problem that is inherent in our political system today. 
Resources are not distributed on the basis of merit or need but on 
political preference. How unfortunate for Canada.
<P>
	In summation, we agree with the means test, not the one 
proposed, but we are getting there. Therefore we are not in 
favour of this motion.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the motion 
presented by the hon. member for Québec-Est in which, among 
other things, it demands that the old age security program and 
the Canada pension plan be maintained in their present forms.
<P>
	To begin, let me assure the House that the government has 
absolutely no intention of reducing old age security pensions for 
current seniors. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development have stated this clearly on 
numerous occasions.
<P>
	As well it is important to remember that the February budget 
included annual increases in old age security expenditures. The 
total expenditures for 1993-94 were in the order of 
$19.9 billion. In 1995-96 these will grow to approximately 
$21.4 billion.
<P>
	I should add that the government understands very well the 
importance of these programs to Canada's seniors, especially 
given the fact that in 1991 approximately 40 per cent of the 
income of seniors was made up of old age security and 
Canada-Quebec pension plan benefits. To suggest that the 
government might somehow sacrifice the standard of living of 
seniors by massive cuts strikes me as extremely irresponsible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4685"> 4685 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time society does change and so do the needs 
which our social programs must address. One trend likely to 
impact on social programs is our aging population.
<P>
	Over the next 40 years the proportion of people in our country 
over the age of 65 will double as well as the proportion of those 
age 65 and over will increase even more quickly, doubling by the 
year 2011. By 2031 the number of people over 65 compared with 
the number of working age Canadians will fall from one in five 
to one in three.
<P>
	Clearly these realities must be addressed. To this end the 
government is studying these issues and will shortly release a 
paper on the challenges and opportunities posed by our aging 
society.
<P>
	This paper will address the full range of issues relating to our 
aging population and will examine what must be done by 
governments, employers, working age individuals and families 
to plan for their future. It will examine the changing roles and 
needs of our seniors as Canadians live longer and healthier lives. 
It will look at services and labour market issues and whether 
changes are required to the public pension system to ensure it 
remains sustainable. It will also examine the current tax 
treatment of private savings for retirement.
<P>
	We all know that planning for an aging society cannot be done 
overnight. We simply cannot engage in short term thinking to 
such long term issues. With this in mind the government has 
committed itself to examining these long term trends so as to 
ensure that future generations of Canadians will have the same 
level of security currently enjoyed by our seniors.
<P>
	To do this it will be necessary to define a set of efficient and 
compassionate programs to meet our future needs. The release 
of the discussion paper in the coming months will be the first 
step.
<P>
	Of course, any future programs must continue to be fiscally 
responsible and fully sustainable. These are fundamental issues 
and to ensure success the government will need the active and 
informed participation of all Canadians as it seeks to arrive at a 
consensus on the direction that policies and programs should 
take.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	For instance, older Canadians have declared that they want to 
be involved in developing solutions. Their voices must be heard 
as must those of other concerned Canadians. As we move 
forward with this review, we cannot lose sight of the fact that we 
have a great deal to be proud of. Our current programs are rooted 
in a great tradition which is the basis of the caring society 
Canada has become today.
<P>
	Today seniors are financially more secure than those of any 
previous generation. With the planned development of Canada's 
income security system over the past few decades there has been 
a substantial decrease in the incidence of poverty among older 
Canadians. For  example, between 1980 and 1992 the incidence 
of low income among seniors fell from one-third to less than 
21 per cent. While single elderly women continue to have a 
much higher incidence of low income, 53 per cent in 1992, this 
figure was down significantly from 70 per cent in 1980.
<P>
	The situation is by no means perfect. Overall seniors incomes 
are still modest. In a recent survey on aging and independence 
more than 60 per cent of those between ages of 65 and 69 years 
named government pensions as their main source of personal 
income. Still all Canadians can be proud of the network of 
government programs that have helped to improve the standard 
of living of seniors in Canada. For instance, the basic OAS 
pension together with the guaranteed income supplement and 
spousal allowance ensure financial security, especially for the 
poorest Canadians as they approach and enter retirement.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan together with its sister program, the 
Quebec pension plan, is the social insurance program to which 
working Canadians contribute. It provides not only retirement 
income but a measure of income protection against disability 
and death. The Canada-wide portable coverage these programs 
give is a great example of what federal and provincial 
governments can achieve by working together.
<P>
	Together these programs have made a significant contribution 
to the economic security of Canada's seniors. Although there is 
an increasing number of people living well beyond age 65 years, 
fewer are living in poverty. Proof of the success of this network 
of programs becomes clear every month as millions of people 
receive their pension benefits from the government reliably and 
on time.
<P>
	In Canada in the late 20th century we can be proud of the 
initiative and the planning which almost 30 years ago laid the 
groundwork for the satisfying life of retirement which more and 
more Canadians are enjoying.
<P>
	This is not to say that our retirement income system does not 
need examination, review and revision. In the past we have 
regularly examined our income security programs, reviewed 
them in light of changes in our society, and revised them to 
respond to those changes. We must be prepared to consider 
changes as they become necessary. We must maintain a sound 
system based on the foundations of the past and responsive to 
the needs of the future.
<P>
	I conclude by urging all members of the House to be active 
participants in this process of examining our current system, 
deciding what we as a society want and putting in place a 
strategy for tomorrow.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague from Québec-Est has put before this House a 
motion which reflects the opinion held by seniors in my riding, 
in Quebec and in Canada. By reducing the age credit, the federal 
government is attacking the most vulnerable members of our 
society, because the majority of seniors have very modest 
incomes.
<P>
	As spokesperson for seniors associations and organizations, I 
fully support my colleague's motion against the reduction of the 
age credit. The budget proposal is to reduce the age credit for 
individuals with net incomes exceeding $25,921. The age credit 
will be reduced at a rate of 15 per cent of an individual's net 
income exceeding $25,921. Senior with incomes over $49,134 
will no longer receive any age credit.
<P>
	According to the Department of Finance, this measure will 
affect 800,000 seniors out of 2.6 million. This group includes 
600,000 seniors with incomes between $25,921 and $49,134, 
and 200,000 seniors with incomes over $49,134. Are we to 
understand from this measure that the government considers 
seniors with incomes of $25,000 as rich? Whatever little efforts 
are made to reduce government spending are made on the backs 
of the disadvantaged.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments have a mandate to 
provide services to protect and promote the well-being of all 
Canadians. The governments must also work together with 
consumers and representatives from the non-profit sector, the 
industry and the business community to develop policies and 
programs. They must project a positive and realistic image of 
seniors.
<P>
	The Income Security Programs Branch is responsible for the 
administration of old age security, the Canada Pension Plan and 
the child tax benefit. The branch employees are presently 
working in regional data processing control stations to approve 
requisitions for payment and keep the files of seniors and 
families who receive children benefits up to date.
<P>
	In <I>Le Droit</I> of Ottawa-Hull for Thursday, February 24, 1994, 
the Association de défense des droits des retraités expressed 
outrage about the federal budget, which abolished the personal 
income tax exemption for seniors earning between $25,000 and 
$49,000 a year. Yvette Brunet, president of that association 
which defends pensioners' rights, said that it was odious and 
scandalous. Coming after election promises of tax fairness, the 
budget shows that this government does not really want change. 
The wealthiest people are still spared by the tax department. 
Remember the tax shelters. Furthermore, the government is also 
trying hard to reduce services for seniors.
<P>
	On May 10, I asked the minister responsible for seniors a 
question about the plan to install voice mail to answer inquiries 
from seniors. The minister simply told us about the speed of the 
proposed service. I explained that many seniors are reluctant to 
use such a service and they have expressed this opinion clearly 
through the representative of the Federation of Senior Citizens.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	On May 11, 1994, I was at it again. I asked the following 
question in the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Why does the federal government insist on attacking senior citizens, 
considering that most of them find it very difficult to deal with a system that is so 
impersonal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The answer from the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was disarming and unacceptable. He said that this 
program would be more efficient and more personalized and 
give seniors better service.
<P>
	A centralized telephone answering system using voice mail to 
answer all seniors' inquiries about government programs will 
have a huge impact on the quality of services provided to 
seniors.
<P>
	EDS Limited, which never consulted the public, was hired by 
the government at a cost of $220 million to make this change. 
EDS Limited intends to reduce services to clients who want to 
speak directly to an officer. Seniors will have to deal with an 
answering machine. The required listening and communication 
skills will no longer be available.
<P>
	The few representatives working in the region will become 
inaccessible and permanent offices will disappear. Employees 
working for income security programs receive calls from 
seniors asking them to phone, on their behalf, the Régie de 
l'assurance-maladie du Québec, which uses a touch-tone 
recorded questionnaire. These people complain that they do not 
get the information they need.
<P>
	EDS Limited itself admits that this service will reduce direct 
communications with agents. Because of this, seniors must 
increasingly rely on themselves and no one else. These people 
have good reasons to worry and even to rebel against unfair 
treatment. They want to be considered like full-fledged citizens 
and they want to be respected in every way, including from a tax 
point of view.
<P>
	Seniors have gained a lifelong experience. They have helped 
build this country. They have the right to be informed in a human 
way to be able to support themselves. They rely on their savings, 
investments, private pensions, public fund transfers, and 
sometimes even on the generosity of their relatives. They are 
confronted with the rise in the cost of living. Making access to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4687"> 4687 </A></B>
<P>
information more difficult and reducing financial help to 
seniors will not improve their quality of life.
<P>
	The government must ensure that the information on services 
and programs for seniors is easily accessible.
<P>
	A quick reminder: the previous government had targeted the 
Canada Pension Plan, but the Prime Minister of the time, Brian 
Mulroney, had to revise his position. The Ottawa lady who 
became an instant celebrity in 1985 with her famous ``Good bye 
Charlie Brown'', when the first Mulroney budget was tabled, is 
proof that seniors are not going to be fooled and that they will 
not be scapegoats as regards the national debt, while the 
government is wasting public money.
<P>
	Take family trusts for example. What is the government 
waiting for to tax these trusts which only benefit rich families? 
Why target the poor who have worked hard all their lives? The 
government must promote and facilitate independence among 
seniors by providing them the support they deserve through 
income security and services geared to their specific needs.
<P>
	Seniors have contributed throughout their lives to a universal 
plan.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Obviously, they expect all Canadians reaching the required 
age to receive those benefits, whatever their income may be.
<P>
	Right now, 72 per cent of all retired women and 50 per cent of 
retired men are receiving OAS benefits or some income 
supplement. Only 5 per cent of older Canadians have an income 
over $50,000. Life expectancy is increasing. These additional 
years must be fulfilling and enjoyable for our elderly.
<P>
	To efficiently maintain the quality of life for our elderly, we 
must provide them with the tools they need to get all the 
appropriate information. Finally, I would like to reiterate a 
request I made during a speech in the House of Commons, on 
February 3, 1994, and which boils down to this: ``Why is there 
no secretary of state or department responsible for issues 
relating to seniors, like the one we had under the previous 
government, since this issue is so vitally important?''
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The period provided for

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 3, 
1994, I put the following question to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, which was preceded by the following 
comment: ``Yesterday, this minister clearly indicated to this 
House that the Atlantic fishery workers unions had been 
consulted about the individual contracts that workers must sign, 
thus committing themselves to undergo training or do 
community work in order to receive their benefits. We checked 
and the unions were never consulted on this''.

	My question to the minister was: ``How can the minister 
reconcile the statement he made yesterday in the House with the 
confirmation that was given to me afterwards by the head of the 
fishery workers union, who said he had never been consulted on 
the issue of the individual contracts?'' I later met the president 
of the fishery workers union who again confirmed that he had 
never been consulted about this matter.
<P>
	My question was: How can the minister reconcile his answer 
with my information? I expected an answer that would at least 
address the question, but that is like trying to reconcile the 
irreconcilable. What I got was a model of political rhetoric, not 
from the Minister of Human Resources Development but from 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	I therefore want to take this opportunity to draw the attention 
of the House to the lack of openness of the government and the 
ministers. Some explanations are in order about the issue of 
obliging workers who participate in the pilot project to sign a 
contract in exchange for the benefits promised by the minister, 
something people find disturbing.
<P>
	If this pilot project leads to further projects, people certainly 
had the right to know whether there was any consultation. The 
answer was no. This government will have to learn to be more 
open, because otherwise, how can it proceed with its reform of 
social programs?
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I have a very good reason for raising this issue again this 
evening. There are communities all over Canada where workers, 
like the fisheries workers, have lost all hope, except that their 
numbers are not as high as in the fisheries industry.
<P>
	So how can we help those workers? Can we help them only by 
making this help compulsory, when in many cases they are older 
than average? There is a very large number-24,000-between 
the ages of 25 and 49, but many, in fact more than 6,000, are at 
least 50 years old. Now workers who are between the ages of 
35 and 49 need to know what they will get in the end, because we 
cannot pay them a pittance for a few years and oblige them to 
take training that is a dead end. We have to ensure that the 
community has the resources to create jobs, to help them create 
businesses and to attract businesses, so there is some hope for 
the future. Compulsory training, clean-up programs and com-

munity  assistance programs as such are useless if workers and 
their communities are not helped to find real jobs.
<P>
	My question was: How can the minister reconcile that? There 
was no consultation, and that is really too bad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure the hon. member that extensive consultation took 
place in the development of the TAGS program, including the 
fishermen, food and allied workers associated with the sectoral 
councils.
<P>
	The people in our region are really looking for hope and 
opportunity. It is for this reason that this government has 
engaged in what I consider a rational and reasonable approach to 
reshaping the economy of that particular region.
<P>
	Under TAGS there are at least a dozen adjustment measures 
that individual participants can use to help themselves adjust to 
their circumstances.
<P>
	Throughout the consultation process it was made clear that 
active participation of the fishermen and plant workers affected 
by the groundfish crisis would be a requirement for ongoing 
income support. However, what we heard from the fishermen 
and the plant workers is that they wanted opportunities such as 
training from literacy to university levels. We have 
opportunities with the participation in green projects involving 
working and learning activities within their communities. No 
matter which option is chosen, however, participants will be 
required to take an active role in helping themselves.
<P>
	The intent to require participants to be actively involved in 
their adjustment was clear from the start. In effect, each person 
applying for the benefits of TAGS commits to this process by 
signing the application form.
<P>
	The concern raised by the hon. member for Mercier did not 
relate to the principle of expecting participants to actively take 
part in the program. Rather the question related to the 
administrative means used to ensure that participants continue 
to actively pursue their adjustments while receiving income 
support.
<P>
	On May 6, 1994 a special representative of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development met with officials of the 
organization. These discussions provided a satisfactory 
resolution to the concerns raised for all participants. There will 
not be an administrative social contract which individual 
participants will be required to sign. The signed application 
form will suffice.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 25 
I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development to take 
the $1 million, indeed over a million dollars, that his department 
plans to spend on promoting and advertisements in relation to 
the social policy review and redirect it to those young Canadians  
who are living in poverty, those young families that are clearly 
in need now.
<P>
	The minister's response did not address the real issue and that 
is what will this government do to help those most in need?
<P>
	There is a crisis in our country, a crisis of poverty that is 
undermining the fabric of our society and, alas, that is 
increasing. Those Canadians most in need of assistance from 
this government are young people, young families and women.
<P>
	On May 25, the same day that I posed this question to the 
minister, a report entitled The Outsiders was released. It was 
very disturbing. It indicated that the rising divorce rate has led 
to further complications among young families as one in four 
metro Toronto families is headed by a single parent. The report 
also notes that single parent families have the lowest levels of 
social assistance. Even among those single parents who work 
poverty rates are twice as high as those of two parent families 
with a single earner. I want to ask what the government will do to 
help these single parent families.
<P>
	Recently a report from the United Nations development 
program gives Canada high marks for education. It says that 
Canada is the number one place to live, and we are all proud of 
that. However, when human development by the United Nations 
is measured separately for males and females Canada drops 
from first spot to ninth spot largely because of the wide income 
disparity. The report indicates that the adjusted real income rate 
for Canadian women is 51.5 per cent of that for men.
<P>
	I want to ask this government will it leave people behind? 
There is the over $1 million proposed to be spent on advertising; 
more recently, $55 million to be spent on advertising dedicated 
to help Canadians to stop smoking. While we would like to see 
Canadians stop smoking the proof is very fragile in terms of 
what that advertising budget will do.
<P>
	This government was elected on the faith that it would create 
jobs for Canadians. It has created jobs for Canadians, in 
particular those Canadians who are in the advertising industry.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is a good program but is largely 
directed to jobs for men.
<P>
	I want to ask the member responding for the minister what this 
government is prepared to do besides advertising, creating jobs 
for advertisers. What is it prepared to do for those young 
families living in poverty, the single women who are raising 
families, a large majority living in poverty? Why not act? Why 
just advertise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for her  intervention and I 
look forward to answering her question.
<P>
	There are too many people living in poverty today, far too 
many people with the proper skills in Canada to make us 
competitive, far too many young people facing the problems and 
challenges associated with transition from school to work, the 
1.2 million children who live in poverty in Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4689"> 4689 </A></B>
<P>
	This is precisely the reason why we as a government have 
taken on the challenge to modernize and restructure Canada's 
social security system, a challenge that past governments have 
run away from.
<P>
	On January 31 of this year the Minister of Human Resources 
Development introduced a three stage process to the House that 
would result in new a new social security system for Canada 
which would address the labour market strategy challenges that 
we face and would address the concerns cited by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	We are taking interim measures to address the issue of 
unemployment. That is why as a result of the SEED program this 
summer 60,000 young people will be employed. That is why we 
are reducing the UI premiums, so that small business can 
generate more jobs, so that we can generate more jobs.
<P>
	We were elected on a mandate to create jobs. We are well on 
our way to doing that. Not only that, we are taking on the very 
important challenge to modernize and restructure Canada's 
social security system so that fewer Canadians are faced with 
the challenges and the plight of living in poverty.
<P>
	We have only been in government for approximately six 
months. Our record to date on the measures we have taken so far 
show that this government truly cares about the lives of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7 p.m., this House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7 p.m.)
