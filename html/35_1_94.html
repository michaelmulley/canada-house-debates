	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was reported in the media Tuesday that the minister 
of supply and services has struck a committee of bureaucrats to 
find ways of moving supply and services jobs from Ottawa to 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I strongly disagree with the study and any decision to move 
public servants from the national capital region.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the present time 31.7 per cent of federal public servants 
work in the national capital region, whereas in each province 
and territory the number is proportionate to population.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister has no intention of either pursuing Tory 
practices or, even worse, applying the Reform Party's right wing 
agenda vis-à-vis the public service. He informed me today that 
the study is just that, a study. I am confident that we will treat 
any suggestion of transferring public servants out of the capital 
as an ill advised, bad public policy.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the recent figures in the Work Competitiveness Report 
show that Canada is in a very bad position. In 1989 Canada had 
the fourth most competitive economy among OECD countries. 
Five years later, it stood fourteenth!
<P>
	This drop is the predictable result of the federal government's 
inability to control its deficit. The government's stubborn 
insistence on using its spending power to intervene in provincial 
areas of jurisdiction is a waste of public funds and is slowing 
down job creation. Labour training, a tangle of 
federal-provincial overlap, as the Quebec manufacturers 
association pointed out yesterday, is a perfect example of the 
ineffectiveness of  federal intervention. And who is paying for 
all this? Taxpayers and the unemployed.

compensate my constituent, Mr. Walter Jerram.
<P>
	His bull was seized because its only crime was being imported 
from the United Kingdom and just may have been exposed to 
BSE, mad cow disease.
<P>
	Last Thursday Agriculture Canada and the RCMP seized the 
bull at 6.30 a.m. They cut through his chain fence, seized his 
bull and were gone in 20 minutes. No warrant was produced and 
a curt letter was left behind informing him that because he had 
resorted to legal recourse he would not be paid the routine, if 
low, $2,000 in compensation.
<P>
	The handling of this case is despicable. They came as thieves 
in the night. Canadians deserve better from their government. I 
call upon the minister of agriculture to pay the compensation my 
constituent deserves and launch an inquiry into the handling of 
this case.

the graduation ceremony of 14 young Vietnamese men who 
found an alternative to their lives. Of these young men 
two-thirds were on drugs and three were in jail. They were all 
part of gangs, did not have families and were all on social 
assistance.
<P>
	These young people participated in a project called New 
Directions. For a year they were coached, taught, put through 
school, and they are now all free from drugs. They all have 
become part of society and some are continuing with school. It 
was an uplifting experience. Fourteen lives were saved. There is 
an alternative to crime but we must be proactive.

strengthen and expand their short lines.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Canada, and particularly in the province of Ontario, CN and 
CP are abandoning their branch lines at an astonishing rate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This includes Midland-Uhthoff subdivision which will be 
abandoned as of October 8, 1994 unless the petition to governor 
in council I presented on August 30 is successful in keeping the 
line open.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These closures are taking place at a time when Ontario's new 
labour legislation does not allow operators of secondary lines to 
buy and run abandoned lines at a profit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada needs a strategy to address this grave situation before 
our short line network has been completely dismantled. I urge 
the Minister of Transport to come up with a plan quickly to save 
our short line network.

	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 15, 1994 the Government of Canada 
entered into two administrative agreements with the province of 
Saskatchewan. These agreements provide for the more effective 
administration of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
the pollution provisions of the Fisheries Act and the 
complementary Saskatchewan legislation.
<P>
	The agreements are among the first of their kind in Canada. 
They apply to the areas of environmental protection and are 
jointly regulated by federal and provincial groups. The 
agreements will lead to more effective environmental protection 
programs by reducing duplication. The agreements ensure 
co-operation and reduce duplication in areas of reporting spills, 
spill response, inspections, investigation and information 
gathering.
<P>
	The agreements reflect the federal government's goal to 
effectively protect the environment through federal-provincial 
harmonization and to ensure wise use of our limited resources.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
people of Quebec make a little noise and threaten to walk out, 
you can always find some well-intentioned English-speaking 
Canadians to tell them that their Canada includes Quebec. The 
fact of the matter is that the rest of Canada usually greets 
Quebec's claims with: ``Your demands are inadmissible and 
unacceptable. But we really like you and would want you to 
remain within Canada.''
<P>
	That is precisely what happened yesterday at the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce convention, where the delegates from 
English Canada rejected a resolution from the Sainte-Foy 
Chamber of Commerce asking that manpower training be 
transferred to the provinces. ``Quebec, we love you'', said the 
Premier of Alberta yesterday.

about mud, dust and pain. In fact Rod walks around with plates, 
screws and wire holding his hip together because of a rodeo 
mishap three years ago.
<P>
	He is almost in as bad shape as I am. All of the pain and hard 
work has paid off for this 25-year old cowboy. Today Rod is 
$50,000 richer thanks to the biggest rodeo win in his life, the 
saddle-bronc championship at the greatest outdoor show on 
earth, The Calgary Stampede.

week in September I had the privilege of being part of the 
Canadian delegation to the United Nations conference on 
population and development in Cairo, Egypt.
<P>
	There were many significant things to be learned. One of the 
most interesting was an understanding as to how the world 
community views Canada. Canada is nation to be trusted. It is a 
nation turned to when issues are polarized and emotions are 
frayed.
<P>
	We are truly the honest broker on the global stage. This is 
important for us to understand right now because initiatives here 
at home threaten to tear our country apart. For Canadians that 
means risking the loss of the rich culture and heritage that is so 
much a part of Quebec and her people. For the world there is a 
risk of loss of a great partner, the likes of which could never be

bring the world to our doorstep, to extend friendship and to 
exchange cultural traditions with our close cousins in the 
American hemisphere.
<P>
	Indeed showcasing Canada to the world by hosting 
international games contributes immeasurably to forging 
international bonds. At the same time it instils in Canadians a 
sense of national pride and unity and a better understanding of 
the diversity of linguistic and cultural identities.
<P>
	It will be a great celebration in 1999. Winnipeg has a long 
tradition of excellence in playing host to major events. I am 
proud to have had the opportunity to work with the excellent 
co-chairs Don Mackenzie and Barbara Huck, the mayor of the

adversities that he and his team mates encountered outside the 
ring. His outstanding performance is testimony to his skills, 
hard work and commitment to excellence. The efforts, 
teamwork, sportsmanship and dedication of athletes like Mr. 
Strange constantly make Canada's sporting scene one of the best 
in the world.

Speaker, as we know, Quebec spent $45 million in 1992 to 
organize its own referendum on federal offers. Yesterday, we 
learned that the federal government refused to refund the $26 
million, or one quarter of the total costs, the people of Quebec 
have contributed toward the referendum held in the nine other 
provinces.
<P>
	All told, the cost of the referendum on the Charlottetown 
Accord to the Quebec taxpayers was $70 million, as compared to 
$80 million for the rest of Canada. Moreover, the Deputy Prime 
Minister was pleased to hear this yesterday. She said that 
separation is expensive.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Quebec is not a sovereign state yet and the 
Quebec taxpayers have paid three times as much as those from 
the other Canadian provinces for the referendum that buried any 
hope of federal renewal to be held. It was expensive indeed just 
to find out that federalism equals status quo.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the brutal repression which the Haitian police and army 
carry on is getting worse in Port-au-Prince, as the American 
soldiers watch impassively. For his part, exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has publicly repudiated the agreement 
reached between Washington and the military junta, referring 
back to the Governors Island Accord. The UN special envoy who 
was in charge of negotiating these accords has just resigned. His 
name is Dante Caputo.
<P>
	I ask the minister who seems to be increasingly embarrassed 
by the growing confusion to tell us if negotiations are now going 
on in Washington to ensure the speedy and effective return of 
President Aristide.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my answer is yes. As much as the Leader of the 
Opposition, I deplore this carnage that has followed the arrival 
of multinational troops in Haiti. These are certainly 
unacceptable actions which should have been expected from the 
military who are losing control of the country. I think that we 
must see what is happening there in that context and I would ask 
the Leader of the Opposition not to make a partisan issue of it 
but to accept that the Government of Canada is playing a very 
important and very useful role with President Aristide, who will 
return to his country very soon.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always thought that Canada's policy was to support 
President Aristide. I wonder if President Aristide cannot rightly 
ask whether Canada did not support him by signing an 
agreement with an impostor president who has taken his place, 
without any reference to President Aristide's own legitimacy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Did the minister intervene on behalf of Canada with 
Washington in order to ensure that the return of President 
Aristide takes place under conditions which respect the 
Governors Island agreement rather than according to the terms 
of agreement negotiated last Sunday with the U.S.?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition should know; if he does 
not, he should talk to President Aristide, who will confirm for 
him that he fully supports what the Canadian government is 
doing.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	President Aristide has always shown himself to be very 
interested in and very close to the positions taken by Canada. He 
knows that the Canadian government is a dependable friend and 
ally.
<P>
	So I do not accept the Leader of the Opposition trying for 
partisan reasons to create dissension between the Government 
of Canada and President Aristide when there is none at all.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us limit the debate to whether or not Canada is 
meeting its commitments to democracy and the support 
promised for President Aristide.
<P>
	In this regard, if the government really played an important 
role, how could it let this agreement be reached with an impostor 
president, with no mention of President Aristide, who is 
supposed to be Canada's protégé?
<P>
	In particular, I ask the minister whether he agrees with the 
clauses in the latest agreement that provide for amnesty, despite 
what was in the Governors Island Accord; according to our 
information, these clauses are the main obstacle to President 
Aristide's return.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it particularly interesting that the Leader of the 
Opposition is now second guessing the actions of President 
Carter and the emissaries who at the very last minute obtained 
capitulations from the military junta.
<P>
	What took place there at the last minute was that decisions 
were made by the Haitian junta to accept that multinational 
forces would arrive in Haiti without any confrontation in order 
to ensure that there would not be any loss of lives. That is what 
took place. Nothing else.
<P>
	All the elements of resolution 940 will be carried out and will 
be exercised by the military forces that are there. That will 
ensure the speedy and safe return of President Aristide.

the problems experienced by the government in collecting

owed in taxes?

was very encouraged and pleased by what I read. He has 
identified the close to doubling of the taxes owed during the last 
five years of the Tory administration of which my hon. friend 
has made mention.
<P>
	He has made it perfectly clear that this is indeed an area which 
the Government of Canada must pursue vigorously to make sure 
that all Canadians pay their fair share of taxes and that the 
business community is faced with a level playing field so it does 
not have to compete for contracts against those who do not pay 
their share. It is clear that he has identified a problem which we 
have recognized.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that within three weeks of 
becoming minister I announced a major campaign in 
consultation with my friend the hon. Minister of Finance to 
make sure that we would be able to address these very problems

does to cut social benefits through its upcoming reform of those 
social programs designed to protect the poorest ones in our

collect those unpaid taxes?

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal premier of New Brunswick has expressed the view 
that Canada will sink into a lower economic order if the federal 
government does not come to grips with the debt problem.
<P>
	He says that the efforts of the provinces to control their 
spending are being held back by the federal government which 
has yet to show a clear demonstrable commitment to fiscal 
management that would inspire international investors.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will not heed advice from members on 
this side with respect to this subject. He does not heed advice 
from the taxpayers and the investment community. Perhaps he 
will heed the words of his Liberal colleagues and provide a clear 
demonstrable commitment to sound fiscal management.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister publicly direct the finance minister to 
reduce the deficit, not by raising taxes but by further spending 
reductions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is exactly what the Minister of Finance is doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister apparently has no idea of the uncertainty that 
these non-answers and political answers create with respect to 
investors and taxpayers.
<P>
	Many resource companies, particularly in western Canada, 
are starting to make money for the first time in a number of 
years. They are in a position of trying to decide whether to invest 
those profits in Canada or take them elsewhere out of the reach 
of the government.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister, given his track record on this issue 
and the uncertainty, creates only more uncertainty by 
responding, will the finance minister clear the air by stating 
categorically that he is not planning any tax increases on the 
resource industry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to know that the leader of the Reform Party is 
conceding that when we had a Conservative government even 
less right wing than his, business was not making money and 
with the Liberal government in power it is starting to make 
<P>

<P>
money. It does not know where to invest it. It is better to have 
that  problem than the problem it had with the Tories in 
government.
<P>
	Talking about uncertainty I would like the leader of the 
Reform Party to be a bit objective. It is on TV every night and 
every morning that the Canadian dollar is going up. The interest 
rate is going down. The international community has more 
confidence in Canada than ever before. He should rejoice. That 
is simple.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> I read the 
papers, Mr. Speaker, but I am more conscious of the fact that the 
government is spending $110 million more per day than it takes 
in, and a lot of other people recognize that as well.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister cannot answer this question with clarity 
and resolve uncertainty in the resource industry perhaps he can 
say something that would calm the uncertainty among RRSP 
investors.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister would not give a straight answer 
on whether the government is contemplating a raid on RRSP 
contributions. These investors are already organizing 
themselves to oppose an expected tax grab while we wait for an 
answer from the government on how many more dollars will 
seek a safer haven elsewhere.
<P>
	My question is for the finance minister if the Prime Minister 
cannot answer. Will he clear the air on this issue by stating 
categorically that he is not planning a tax raid on RRSP 
contributions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it very 
clear that we are about to embark on the most comprehensive, 
deep consultative process in the budget preparation that has ever 
been done. There will be extensive opportunity for debate. We 
welcome that opportunity.
<P>
	The challenge I lay before the leader of the Reform Party is to 
rise to that opportunity. Or, is the Reform Party going to do what 
it did in the pre-budget debate, what it has done throughout the 
summer, and that is refuse to be constructive, refuse to tell us 
what it would do and refuse to face the fundamental challenges 
facing the country?

we now know that in five years, Canada has dropped from fourth 
to fourteenth place among the 24 OECD countries as far its 
competitive position is concerned, mainly because of the 
unprecedented extent of the federal debt, inefficient government 
policies that undermine job creation and, above all, the wasteful 
overlap in manpower training.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. 
Considering this disastrous state of affairs, what more will it 
take for the Minister of Finance to decide to make a move, act 
responsibly, eliminate the inefficiencies in federal spending and 
at last do something about duplication and overlap?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have every intention 
of dealing with overlap. In fact, the Minister responsible for 
Public Service Renewal has been given that role.
<P>
	I may add that the problems are more fundamental and that we 
will have to deal with the loss of our technological edge, the 
manpower issue, and, of course, the issue of the debt. That is 
why the Minister of Human Resources Development is going to 
start on his program to restructure our social programs, why the 
Minister of Industry is going to start on his program to 
restructure industry, and why we intend to reach our objective of 
bringing the federal deficit down to 3 per cent of GNP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier I heard the Prime Minister refer to the Conservatives. I 
now hear the Minister of Finance saying exactly the same thing 
he said about a year ago.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will put the question to the minister: What has 
he done for the past year, aside from conducting some pretty 
useless consultations, to cut operating expenditures? What has 
he done to eliminate overlap and duplication? What has he done 
to help the government make a sensible decision, which would 
be to decentralize all authority over manpower training to 
Quebec?
<P>
	Eight hundred thousand unemployed individuals are waiting 
for this to happen. They are waiting for the glimmer of hope that 
the Minister of Finance and the government are certainly not 
giving them. So what has he done? That is my question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

growth was 6.4 per cent during the past quarter, the best

3.5 per cent during the first half of 1994. Exports were up 0.6 per

concerning the date of a referendum in Quebec. You will also 
know that many Canadians, after 25 years, are sick and tired of 
this separatist merry-go-round.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister to clarify for the House 
whether he has clearly communicated the position of his 
government, of the vast majority of members of the House and 
the vast majority of the population of Canada that the premier of 
Quebec should fulfil his commitment to have this referendum as 
soon as possible. What assurances has he received in that 
regard?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer is yes, and the commitment was not only in a private 
conversation. It was made public on the Wednesday afternoon 
during a press conference when Mr. Parizeau answered a 
question by a CBC radio reporter stating he was to fulfil his 
commitment. I took his word in the press as well as what he said 
privately.
<P>
	I see that the Reform Party is trying to make money on that 
subject by having a 1-900 telephone number. It is pretty 
awkward for a political party to want people to express a view 
and pay money to the Reform Party on a divisive issue like this 
one.
<P>
	It is unbelievable and not very ethical to take a controversial 
problem, one that is very divisive and ask the people to pay to 
make money for the Reform Party. I can understand why the 
Reform Party has problems with its funding at this time, if we 
judge it by its performance in the House of Commons.
<P>

	It is in the interests of this party and should be in the interests 
of the government to get the views of all Canadians on the unity 
of the country. I am surprised that the Prime Minister does not 
want that.

<P>
	Here is my supplementary question: Does the Prime Minister 
intend to contact officially the new Quebec Government to urge 
it to respect its commitment and hold its referendum as quickly 
as possible, on the simple question of Quebec separation?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
already called them, as I mentioned before in this House, and I 
made a speech in Quebec City, before the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce last Sunday, so my message is well known. We want 
this question to be resolved in a civilized manner and quickly, so 
we can turn our attention to the other problems facing this 
country.
<P>

subscribed to a 1-800 number, instead of trying to make money

<P>
	On May 31, the Prime Minister pledged to help francophones

for this licence in their system. The FDA had not required 
Canadian centres to have this licence for several years.

	I can tell the hon. member we are going to have to deal with

Jamaica for overstaying his visa. Four years later he was 
actually deported and the following year he returned. He was 
deported again and again he returned. Last Saturday Mr. Forbes 
allegedly walked into a Toronto establishment and opened fire 
on a crowd killing two and wounding several more.
<P>
	After having been deported twice Forbes was recently granted 
permanent resident status. My question is why?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

overstaying and returned in 1986.
<P>

<P>
	If the hon. member is questioning whether people who are 
deported should not be permitted to return and go through due 
process then why is it that his party is refusing to adopt Bill 
C-44? Those amendments would allow the individual to be 
turned around at the border without legal process. Why is his 
party saying no to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
minister's record is not before the police; it is open for the

entering this country. We will not support the half measures the 
government proposes.
<P>

Canadian health and safety ahead of all other concerns in 
immigration, ahead of procedure, ahead of his friends in the 
immigration industry, ahead of his own personal ambitions?

impugn motives. That part of the question is out of order. I will

like to answer it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party does not like to 
deal with the facts, but it should get around to doing that.
<P>
	The facts are that this individual came to Canada and left 
some 15 years ago. The police are looking for this individual. 
Charges are pending. The person is at large. There are 
deportations on the books of individuals who are convicted of 
crimes that we believe are due to deportation. Fifteen years after 
this individual has entered Canada, is charged by the 
police-not convicted, charged-and is at large, what does that

how we remove individuals. We set up a joint task force made up

authorities.

from April to July. However, these numbers also show a 
significant increase in social assistance costs-and that applies 
only to the federal government's share and does not include the 
increased costs in the provinces.
<P>
	Given these figures, how can the Prime Minister take

Commerce in Quebec City, in saying that a growing number of 
Canadian households no longer need to rely on unemployment 
insurance or social assistance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very clear that there has been a significant decrease in the 
number of people who need UI benefits at this time and that the 
creation of 275,000 jobs allowed these people to return to the 
workforce. That is why I said that fewer people need to rely on 
unemployment insurance and social assistance, since many jobs 
have been created in the last 10 months.

pedophile just released from prison for the killing of a six-year 
old boy. His psychiatric assessment shows he is a pedophile with 
psychopathic tendencies. The protection of society has to be our 
number one priority yet there is no mechanism in our system to 
protect society against people like Keith Legere.
<P>
	Will the minister take immediate steps to bring in legislation 
that will indefinitely incarcerate dangerous offenders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, part XXIV of the Criminal 
Code calls for the indefinite incarceration of dangerous 
offenders. Part XXIV has been in place for decades. In the 
appropriate cases it permits the prosecuting attorney to bring to 
the attention of the court circumstances which would establish 
that the accused person is of sufficient danger to society that 
they should be locked up indefinitely. That happens weekly in 
the courts of the country.
<P>
	The government has identified a gap in the system. It is that 
category of case in which no such application under part XXIV 
of the Criminal Code is brought. Such persons may be 
incarcerated for fixed periods but may arguably still be 
dangerous upon the expiration of those terms.
<P>
	I am not speaking to the case of Legere but speaking generally 
when I say that for the past several months the Solicitor General, 
the Minister of Health and I have been working with our 
provincial counterparts toward the creation of a nationwide 
policy with changes to the provincial health acts, if necessary. 
This is to provide for the continued detention under the health 
regimes of persons who, upon the expiration of their criminal 
terms, may be dangerous to the public.
<P>
	I will be happy to provide the hon. member with details of the 
state of those discussions. They continue and I remain

improvement in the system in that way.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is

However from what I have seen from the proposals and the talk I

immigration policies.
<P>
	I will give another example. A convicted sexual predator, a 
pedophile named Galienne, will be released in October. Experts 
say he is not rehabilitated and will prey on young children again.
<P>
	Washington State has successfully enacted legislation that 
locks up perverts indefinitely. Will the justice minister 
implement an immediate moratorium on the release of all 
dangerous offenders until such time as new effective legislation 
is in place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's 
concern for the safety of the public, but I suggest that a different 
approach would be more effective and in the long run necessary 
as constitutional.
<P>
	The hon. member may have noticed two weeks ago that an 
Ontario court upheld a ruling. It would keep in detention a 
person who had completed a prison term but who was taken into 
the Ontario health regime and held involuntarily for the 
protection of the public.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	The person challenged that ruling and the ruling was upheld. I 
took that as very encouraging for the approach that the Solicitor 
General of Canada, the Minister of Health and I want to pursue, 
which is working with the health systems to fill that gap.
<P>
	There cannot be a moratorium because that would not be 
lawful. It would not be constitutional.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Would it be safe?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> What is safe and expedient is not always what is 
lawful. The rule of law must govern. I can assure the hon. 
member that we will pursue the approach I have described. We 
are confident it will result in an enhancement of public safety.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. In 1985, UNESCO of the United Nations recognized 
the unsurpassed heritage value of the historic old port in Quebec 
City, placing it on the world list of heritage sites.
<P>
	Will the government also recognize the heritage value of the 
old port of Quebec and monitor the encroachment of developers 
whose sole interests for prime real estate are for profit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr.

the development of the world heritage convention.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To reassure her further, I am pleased to report that I was 
informed that the City of Quebec announced on June 23 that it 
was pulling out of a project to build parking spaces and, a few 
days later, the promoters of a Imax cinema project also 
abandoned their plans for that area.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources. The 128 
workers of Ogilvie Mills, in Montreal, have been on strike for 
three and a half months now. And there is no hope of settlement 
in sight, as the company can hire scabs to remain in operation.
<P>
	Considering that about 70 per cent of the Canadian workforce 
is already protected by provincial anti-strikebreaking 
legislation, does the minister intend to table in this House 
proposals to amend the Canada Labour Code by adding 
anti-strikebreaking provisions at the federal level?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to reply to the hon. member that the 
minister met on Monday with several CNTU officers 
representing Ogilvie Mills workers. He assured them that he was 
taking a close look at this whole issue of Canadian 
anti-strikebreaking legislation, an issue which will be 
considered as part of the in-depth reform of the Canada Labour 
Code, and that he will give this problem the urgent and serious 
attention it deserves.

not worry. We are inspecting the blood supply and by March this 
will all be taken care of.
<P>

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to rise on a point of order regarding question period 
yesterday afternoon. I asked the Prime Minister a question about 
an appointment of a lawyer.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to Beauchesne's 6th 
edition, citation 489 which states that the phrase ``has not got 
the guts'' is unparliamentary. That comes from <I>Debates</I> of May 
27, 1959, page 4078.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to <I>Hansard</I> of yesterday, 
page 5898 where the Prime Minister responded to me with the 
exact words ``if the member had any guts she would try to prove 
that the person is not competent''.
<P>
	I think it is fairly clear that statement is out of order and I 
would like to ask that the Prime Minister either withdraw those 
comments or apologize.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am speaking in my capacity as government House leader.
<P>
	With respect to the point of order just raised, I respectfully 
submit there are two problems with it. First, I am not aware 
whether the hon. member gave notice to the Prime Minister that 
she intended to raise it so that he could be present. More 
important, I understand that such matters are to be raised at the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5947"> 5947 </A></B>
<P>
first opportunity which should have been yesterday 
immediately after the end of the question period.
<P>
	The time has passed for raising this point. However in saying 
that I am not in any way accepting the premise of the hon. 
member's point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Many times in the course of debate when we 
take words out of context they do not always have the same 
connotation that they ordinarily would have.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the fact that the hon. member has rightly 
pointed out that the statement which she quotes as being used is 
out of order I would refer the hon. member to page 149 of 
Beauchesne's 6th edition, ``unparliamentary language'', where 
it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker has consistently ruled that language used in the House should be 
temperate and worthy of the place in which it is spoken. No language is, by virtue 
of any list, acceptable or unacceptable. A word which is parliamentary in one 
context may cause disorder in another context, and therefore be unparliamentary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would say the point has been made. I would rule that it 
should have been brought up probably at the instant when it 
occurred rather than a day later. I am hopeful the hon. member 
will accept it is on the record that these words are indeed 
unparliamentary. My ruling for now would simply be that I hope 
the use of these words would not occur again in the near future.
<P>
	Is this on the same point of order?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Unless it adds something new I would prefer 
just to lay this aside. Thank you very much.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMENTSDURINGQUESTIONPERIOD">COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question was 
ruled out of order and I would like to request a ruling on that 
please.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The ruling is simply that it is out of order in the 
context in which it was made. I think that this kind of language 
in certain circumstances could be very inflammatory and I 
would ask the hon. member that in future when he is putting 
questions that they not in any way stoop to even a hint of 
vulgarity.
<P>
	That is not by way of explanation so much as it is by way of 
asking the hon. member to please refrain from language which 
could be judged to be inflammatory.

<P>
	The Canada Elections Act presently obliges taxpayers to 
reimburse 50 per cent of election expenses of candidates and 
political parties if they achieve set percentages of the vote.

	Such reimbursement is actually a taxpayer funded grant to a 
special interest group which should be raising the money from 
the people it purports to represent. Passage of the bill would

plain language is to ensure that plain language is used in federal 
legislation so that legislation may be clearly and readily 
understood by non-lawyers. Some of the bills the House has

the Canada pension plan to permit income transferred to a 
spouse to qualify as pensionable and thereby extend CPP 
benefits to stay at home parents.
<P>
	The bill is a follow-up to my, Bill C-256, introduced on June 
7, 1994 which proposed to amend the Income Tax Act to allow 
one spouse to pay or split income up to $25,000 to the other 
spouse who is managing the family home and caring for at least 
one dependent child who has not commenced full time 
attendance at school.

<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure today to introduce 
a private member's bill entitled an act to amend the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act (money purchase pension).
<P>
	The bill if passed will significantly change the MPs pension 
plan. It is designed to reduce the burden significantly taken on 
by taxpayers under the current member of Parliament pension 
plan.
<P>
	Currently members of Parliament contribute $1 for $7 of 
taxpayers' money to the existing plan. This new plan is $1 for 
$1, taxpayer by member. It will reduce the cost to taxpayers of 
the pension plan for members of Parliament by approximately 
$11.7 million per year.
<P>
	This is a plan that is endorsed by the Saskatchewan Taxpayers 
Association, the Canadian Taxpayers Association and the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business. It is a plan that is 
modelled after the Saskatchewan MLAs plan which has been in 
place for over 15 years and works very well for both taxpayers 
and members.
<P>
	It will end unfunded future liabilities of MPs pensions. It will 
also reduce overall pension payout and set a higher age limit for 
qualifying for a pension.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of Canada's current and future international 
peacekeeping commitments in this world, with particular reference to the 
former Yugoslavia, Haiti and Rwanda.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I want to address the House this 
afternoon about one of the strongest and most enduring 
traditions of Canadian foreign policy, our commitment to 
peacekeeping. Almost forty years ago, Lester B. Pearson first 
developed the modern concept of peacekeeping: a UN Force.
<P>
	That idea defused an explosive international crisis and led to a 
peaceful disengagement of warring parties under the United 
Nations flag.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Today, I may recall that since the creation of the first United 
Nations Emergency Force in 1956, under the leadership of a 
Canadian, Lt. Gen. E.L.M. Burns, there have been 26 other UN 
peacekeeping missions. In every case, Canada has participated 
in some way. Canadians have served with distinction in all 16 
peacekeeping operations currently under way in the UN.
<P>
	More than 3,700 Canadians are currently deployed in eight 
international operations, while helping the UN secretary general 
with the planning of two other missions in which some 700 
Canadians might eventually be called to serve. This is a unique 
record of achievement of which all Canadians should be proud.
<P>
	A decade ago, the UN had only three active peacekeeping 
missions, but today, a number of important factors, including 
the end of the Cold War, the unfortunate outbreak of ethnic and 
nationalist conflict, and the new co-operation among the 
members of the Security Council, where veto rights are no 
longer used to paralyse the UN-have changed the 
peacekeeping equation.
<P>
	The United Nations has been empowered to act where once 
there was a stalemate. As a result, the UN is now becoming the 
instrument of international co-operation which was the world 
community's hope in 1945. The fact that the Security Council is 
now using peacekeeping as a central instrument to bring about 
peaceful change is a development we should applaud and one we 
wholeheartedly support. There is no doubt that Canada is one of 
the UN's strongest supporters.
<P>
	Next week at the United Nations, I will be putting forward 
suggestions for making the organization more responsive to a 
new era in which peacekeeping and related tasks will become 
even more central to its mandate.
<P>
	But we have also recognized in recent months, pending the 
implementation of these vital reforms, that the UN has more 
peacekeeping mandates than it can realistically handle, 
involving a variety of tasks which the international community 
is ill-equipped to manage. It therefore seems a useful time to 
take stock of the situation and to ask ourselves a series of 
questions about peacekeeping. What are Canada's national 
interests in the new era of peacekeeping? How should we play a 
role in the more diverse and demanding era which is now 
confronting us? How should we deploy our very valuable 
resources abroad at a time of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5953"> 5953 </A></B>
<P>
fiscal constraint at home?  How should we support the UN in a 
time of transition to new and more demanding tasks?
<P>
	In the coming weeks, two parliamentary committees, one 
responsible for reviewing Canada's foreign policy and one 
responsible for reviewing our defence policy, will be asked to 
prepare a report by the end of October, and I am sure that both 
committees will have some very interesting recommendations 
to make, as they try to answer these questions.
<P>
	I am also convinced that today's debate in the House will give 
many of us an opportunity to intervene and offer the government 
suggestions on the best way to answer the very fundamental 
questions I just formulated.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Allow me at this point in time to make a few personal 
comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My view is that peacekeeping is fundamental to Canadian 
foreign policy. It is not simply a question of continuing a 
tradition for which Canadians have a deserved international 
reputation. It is a question of making a concrete and key 
contribution to international security at a time of instability in 
many parts of the world. It is also a question of making the 
United Nations work in directions that are in Canada's interests 
and in the interests of virtually the entire global community.
<P>
	In emphasizing the importance of peacekeeping, we have to 
recognize Canada's strong desire to help the UN whenever we 
can, but at the same time we have to acknowledge that Canada 
cannot be everywhere and do everything.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In my view, a number of factors should guide our future 
action. First of all, we should devote time, attention and 
resources to the planning and administrative functions at the UN 
which will enable the UN to function effectively in the future. 
This means developing ideas to make the UN secretariat more 
responsive to international developments, offering personnel to 
the UN for explicit planning functions, helping the UN plan and 
coordinate the initial phases of operations and, in certain cases, 
offering our leadership in operations, as we did in Rwanda. We 
had the pleasure earlier today to salute Major-General Dallaire, 
who was in the visitor gallery, and who so brilliantly served the 
UN in Rwanda.
<P>
	This emphasis on the ``front end'', based on wide-ranging 
Canadian experience, will help to ensure that UN operations can 
function with a maximum of effectiveness. Second, Canada 
should focus on roles in UN missions involving what we do best. 
In Rwanda this has meant communications and logistics, the 
supply of fresh water, and the provision of medical field 
hospitals.
<P>
	This is also what we have done with our civilian police 
contributions, through the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in 
Namibia and the former Yugoslavia. This is what we intend to do 
shortly in Haiti.
<P>
	Third, we should try, in thinking about our roles, to offer 
contributions which are not only useful in the peacekeeping 
phase, but which also make a contribution to the broader 
reconstruction of society-the ``peacebuilding phase'' which 
follows a peaceful settlement. In Kigali, for example, Canadian 
troops have opened the airports, and helped restore vital 
communications functions. In Haiti, the UN will use an 
international force of specially trained police officers, under the 
leadership of Superintendent Pouliot of the RCMP, to transform 
the Haitian police into a professional unit appropriate to a 
democratic society.
<P>
	Lastly, I believe we should be open and responsive when 
needs arise quickly and when the international community 
requires an urgent response. But, to fulfil this fourth objective 
we will need the necessary resources. The Canadian 
Government and the Department of National Defence will have 
to plan, a bit ahead of time, to make available the human 
resources required to intervene, when the situation requires it, in 
an area of the world where our traditions or our interests might 
call us.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I am thinking in particular about the day when peace in the 
Middle East will finally have been achieved. As you know, 
Canada was part of the very first UN peace mission in the 
Middle East. Here is a part of the world where Canada can play a 
significant and useful role, and I am sure it will certainly be 
willing to help implement the peace process which seems to be 
taking shape and in which we are actively involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are no hard and fast rules about Canadian participation. 
There should be no arbitrary limits to Canada's contributions. 
What we do in each situation must be judged in light of our 
interests, in light of the requirements, and in light of our ability 
to participate.
<P>
	Resource constraints have become an obvious consideration. 
A decade ago our share of the total UN cost of peacekeeping was 
only $8 million. In this fiscal year the Canadian share will be in 
excess of $150 million.
<P>
	Other issues need to be looked at. For example, there is the 
continued deployment of our peacekeepers and the capacity of 
other countries to participate in these types of operations. There 
is always value in reviewing our ongoing peacekeeping 
commitments.
<P>
	In light of the conditions I have just outlined, the House 
knows that our future peacekeeping presence in the former 
Yugoslavia is up for renewal at the end of this month. As 
members will recall, last February the government held a debate 
on the same question. Today we are continuing this tradition. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5954"> 5954 </A></B>
<P>
are looking for advice, suggestions and comments from 
members on  both sides of the House before a final decision is 
reached by cabinet.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has played a key role in the Balkans over the past three 
years. We joined the European Community monitoring mission 
in 1991, and committed forces to the UN protection force in the 
former Yugoslavia in 1992.
<P>
	We are continuing the humanitarian airlift into Sarajevo in 
cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for refugees.
<P>
	We have contributed funding to the investigation of violations 
of international humanitarian law and to the international 
tribunal for war crimes. We have some 45 RCMP officers in 
Bosnia to help in policing operations. Canadian Naval Forces 
are part of NATO's Adriatic Command. We have participated in 
CSCE investigative and monitoring missions, and we are about 
to support the monitoring of the border between the federal 
republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe we have a moral obligation to continue to help. In the 
field of humanitarian assistance, the Sarajevo air bridge has 
proven indispensable and its work will continue.
<P>
	Today I am pleased to announce in addition to what we have 
pledged already, an additional contribution of $1 million to the 
International Red Cross and $7 million to be divided among four 
United Nations agencies: the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees; the World Food Program; 
UNICEF; and the World Health Organization.
<P>
	I also want to announce the extension of projects with Care 
Canada for the installation of water purification units in 
Sarajevo, and with Queen's University for developing a network 
of rehabilitation centres for the wounded and the handicapped. 
All of this is in Sarajevo. Canada will also contribute $500,000 
to the special United Nations fund for the restoration of essential 
services in Sarajevo.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Having said that, I want the House to understand it is 
increasingly difficult to sustain all of these efforts. This is 
especially so at a time when the conflict still rages, when the 
parties are far from a peaceful settlement and when the prospect 
of lifting the arms embargo may compromise the UN's mandate 
and endanger all peacekeeping forces in the region.
<P>
	I am happy to report that the contact group is making a 
significant contribution to the negotiating process, although the 
prospect for a settlement remains far from certain.
<P>
	Canada fully expects to play a role in the diplomatic process 
commensurate with the size and importance of our 
peacekeeping contribution. We will obviously be very happy to 
know the views of all members of this House in regard to our 
involvement in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe it is possible to sustain our role in the UN protection 
force, at least in the short run. We need to give negotiations a 
chance to work. We need to ensure the provision of humanitarian 
assistance while political pressure takes effect.
<P>
	What may prove to be necessary are adjustments in the size or 
disposition of Canada's contribution at a time when there are 
other real demands on our peacekeeping forces. Whatever 
changes we may need to make in the months ahead, the first 
priority of Canadian policy must be the conclusion of a peace 
agreement among the parties.
<P>
	Canada is also playing a key role in the efforts of the UN and 
the OAS to help in the restoration of democratic government in 
Haiti.
<P>
	I think the House will share my relief at the last minute 
agreement reached between the American negotiators led by 
former president Carter and members of the de facto military 
regime. We look forward to an early return of Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to his rightful place as democratically-elected 
president of Haiti.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I understand that meetings are taking place today in 
Washington between Secretary Perry and President Aristide. 
There is a full briefing on the activities of the multinational 
force in Haiti, how it has been deployed, what the mandate is of 
this force and how it intends to facilitate the speedy and safe 
return of President Aristide in his country.
<P>
	I have a quote by President Aristide after his briefing. He 
compliments President Clinton for what has taken place, saying 
it was as a result of his leadership. There is no doubt that the 
operation to unsettle the military junta was and still is a difficult 
task. Many people have spoken out on it but it took decisive 
action by the United States of America to fulfil what was 
considered to be the first phase of an important process in 
bringing back democracy in Haiti.
<P>
	Some countries were ready to intervene in the first phase; 
some were not ready to intervene in any phase. Canada has 
indicated clearly from the very beginning that we would not 
participate in the first phase in order to be able to play a greater 
and more substantive role in the long run. We will participate in 
the second phase and work side by side with President Aristide 
to rebuild his country and help its population.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5955"> 5955 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada will, of course, play a prominent role in re-building 
democracy in that troubled country, when the time is right. We 
feel confident that, in a few weeks, we will be able to deploy the 
contingents we promised. One of their tasks will be to train 
Haiti's civilian police. Canadian troops would also be part of a 
UN peacekeeping mission to restore stability so that President 
Aristide can govern his country without interference from a 
military junta who did not, does not and will never believe in 
democracy.
<P>
	There is much work to be done over a period of time and we 
are very confident that we can do it in a reasonable amount of 
time in accordance with the wishes and goals of President 
Aristide himself.
<P>
	I must say that we have no doubt that the Americans heading 
the multinational force in Haiti share our opinion that President 
Aristide must be reinstated. Never, in all the discussions I have 
had with American officials, have I doubted a single moment 
that they were as committed as we are to ensuring that 
democracy be restored in Haiti and that President Aristide be 
allowed to complete his mandate as president of his country with 
the full powers vested in him.
<P>
	I wanted to clarify this point because my friend the Leader of 
the Opposition led me to believe, by certain comments and 
questions, that he assumed the Americans would not stand by 
President Aristide and would let him down. I can tell him that, as 
far as I am concerned, his doubts concerning the Americans are 
unfounded. The Clinton administration must not be imputed 
motives that it does not have in my view. Each within our own 
area of responsibility, we must believe in and support this 
process leading to the return of President Aristide in his country, 
with him being able to exercise full powers.
<P>
	Allow me in closing to briefly recall the actions Canada has 
taken concerning Rwanda. I mentioned earlier the key role 
played by General Dallaire. I would like to say that, through his 
contribution and in many other ways, Canada has played a 
prominent role in restoring some peace to that country. Last May 
Canada called for a special session of the UN Commission on 
Human Rights.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Canada was also the first country to make funds available to 
send observers to assess the human rights situation. When the 
crisis escalated, Canada stood out among UN action supporters 
by providing substantial financial assistance to the UN mission 
in Rwanda, in support of General Dallaire as it were.
<P>
	For a long time, we were the only country to provide air 
transport to the capital, Kigali, taking in food and medicine and 
bringing out the wounded or those in danger of dying. I say 
without hesitation that the Canadian effort to reinforce this UN 
mission helped to save thousands of lives, including that of the 
current Prime Minister.
<P>
	We were also among the first to lend tangible support to the 
second element of our strategy, encouraging refugees to return 
to Rwanda, which we think is very important at this time. We 
sent a 200-person medical unit to Rwanda and we were the first 
to send experts to see what could be done to restore the 
infrastructure of the country, its water supply, electricity and 
telephone services.
<P>
	But we must realize that this awful crisis is primarily and 
ultimately political. It is clear that any final agreement must 
have the support of all parties. That is why Canada will continue 
to increase its efforts in the UN mission in Rwanda and at other 
levels, to help stabilize the situation and prepare the ground for a 
peaceful settlement.
<P>
	The Canadian Armed Forces may eventually be deployed in as 
many as ten UN operations, but even with this type of global 
involvement, Canada will also have the flexibility to respond 
rapidly in the event of humanitarian tragedies or if the 
conclusion of peace treaties results in a need for monitoring 
activities. I say these things because, again, we must consider 
the choices to be made. We want to make these choices after 
consulting Parliament, as we promised at the beginning of our 
mandate, after consulting the elected representatives in this 
Parliament who can help us forge a foreign policy that fully 
meets the objectives of the Canadian people and that is fully in 
keeping with Canada's tradition and interests.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I want to thank the government and the minister 
for providing us with an opportunity to discuss these very 
important issues today. I certainly agree with the minister that 
Canadians are very proud of their peacekeeping missions. In 
fact, if there is one initiative which gets the full support of the 
public in Canada, it is this collective commitment to 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	It should also be pointed out that these peacekeeping missions 
were not an afterthought in the evolution of the Canadian 
society. They were, from the very beginning, an integral part of 
our diplomatic efforts as a sovereign state. They were an 
extension of co-operation efforts which soon led to 
interventions. Following the very appropriate comments made 
by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I can only endorse the 
compliments made to the late Lester B. Pearson, who is among 
those responsible for building Canadian diplomacy, and for the 
prestige that this country now enjoys.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5956"> 5956 </A></B>
<P>
	However, it must be said that while these missions proved 
very beneficial, albeit not easy, and were perceived as being 
effective in the first few years, they are now faced with new 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	These problems are both enormous and very acute, and they 
could undermine the credibility of Canadian commitments to 
peacekeeping missions. This justified the setting up, by the 
House of Commons, of committees which are developing new 
policies in that sector and are trying to redefine commitments in 
a way that is more relevant to the current reality.
<P>
	These problems are not necessarily all new ones but they have 
intensified and they are enormous. Take the cost issue. Canada is 
not as rich as it was in the fifties. In those days, the costs 
involved were probably not a major factor in determining 
whether or not to participate in a mission. I believe that Mr. 
Pearson was a happy political leader who did not have to worry 
too much about this aspect. Indeed, at the time, costs were not 
very high and, moreover, the Canadian government's debt was 
almost non existent and its financial stability was such that the 
public rarely opposed the allocation of monies to that purpose.
<P>
	However, those costs have increased. Obviously, we need 
increasingly sophisticated equipment. Some belligerents use 
very modern equipment; consequently, we sometimes have to 
face them with inadequate material. And increasingly, we must 
deploy substantial contingents, so that cost becomes a very 
pressing issue. Even more so, now that every debate in this 
House and most of the concerns of the ministers and the Prime 
Minister focus on the crisis in our public finances, so that 
taxpayers, who are already taxed to the hilt as a result of our 
national debt, are starting to ask questions. They are starting to 
wonder how extensive this kind of international commitment 
should become.
<P>
	There is another factor, and I am referring to the complex 
problems that create situations where intervention is necessary. 
Mostly, we are looking at conflicts arising from religious or 
ethnic differences or even worse, they may be connected with 
the imperialistic designs of those who want to expand their 
territory and engage in ethnic cleansing, and, of course, 
conflicts whose causes are rooted in the history of these peoples.
<P>
	It is very difficult for us to go into these countries, as North 
Americans who may not have a European's sensitivity to this 
type of problem. It is very difficult to go in and quickly find a 
solution, a way to cut through the inextricable tangle of 
problems that are rooted so deeply in a country's history. I may 
recall what is happening now in Bosnia. The presence of 
different ethnic groups within the same territory, in a crazy 
patchwork of different communities is all due to the impact of 
historic events and a very complex sequence of developments 
that is practically impossible to reverse today.
<P>
	There are also some new questions and principles being 
formulated, in a debate that would have been unthinkable 
before. People are now asking: Is it legitimate to violate the 
sovereignty of foreign peoples? There used to be fundamental 
principles that were never challenged, at least not until now. A 
country's sovereignty was inviolable, period. No one would 
dream of challenging this principle, and those who did were 
condemned by the entire community.
<P>
	Anyone who dared to break treaties, invade territory and 
undue challenge the sovereignty of foreign countries was 
ostracized by the rest of the world, while today, in democratic 
societies like ours, at international venues as distinguished as 
the UN and UNESCO, and elsewhere, we hear sensible people 
who respect the rights of others asking whether we should not 
intervene in such and such a country, irrespective of that 
country's sovereign rights, to impose peace and to neutralize 
situations that are a threat to human rights.
<P>
	So we have these new fundamental questions and a new 
debate. There is a new culture, and there is a new kind of action 
that countries are being requested to take. And I am afraid that 
people are starting to wonder more and more about the 
effectiveness of these interventions. This is of course due to the 
fact that interventions are taking place in increasingly difficult 
situations, with fewer chances of being successful, but there is 
also the issue of modern technology.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Let us take Rwanda for example. I entirely agree with what 
the minister just said about the outstanding Canadian 
contribution in that part of the world, starting with 
Major-General Roméo Dallaire, whom we had the pleasure of 
welcoming today.
<P>
	We know that there were outstanding acts of personal bravery, 
that all the troops we have dispatched did their utmost and that 
Canada made as much resources available as it could under 
extremely difficult circumstances. Yet, we realize this is but a 
drop in the ocean in the context of this conflict and that our 
efforts, however laudable, had little effect on the magnitude of 
the horrible massacres that have taken place over there.
<P>
	Our limited capacity for intervention in any conflict or 
situation of this sort is reflected most clearly by television, as 
we can witness these horrible scenes broadcasted live night after 
night. We will never be able to make everything right. There will 
always be massacres. There will always be parts of operations 
that will prove impossible to carry out. Mistakes will be made 
and be caught on camera. Television crews in the field will 
faithfully report them for us to see in our living rooms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5957"> 5957 </A></B>
<P>
	People can see for themselves, in their daily life, from their 
own homes, how difficult any action is and how little we were 
able to accomplish. That is why they have questions, and some 
pretty relevant ones at that.
<P>
	I imagine we will soon take stock of the operations in Bosnia 
and determine how useful our action was over there. We know 
about what went wrong in Somalia. As for Rwanda, I think we 
all saw what happened in terms of the consequences and the acts 
of cruelty.
<P>
	There are also aspects of a more political nature that we need 
to look at. Take the events in Iraq for example. We went over 
there to free Koweit which had been the victim of an intolerable 
act of aggression. I remember the rationale for intervention, a 
legitimate one at that, was to restore democracy. At the time, the 
government of Kuwait had promised to put in place a more 
democratic regime. We know full well that these promises were 
not kept and the bottom line is that the billions of dollars 
invested by many countries to free Kuwait and put Iraq in its 
place had very little impact in terms of promoting democracy 
either in Iraq or in Koweit.
<P>
	Some may wonder if the intervention was not motivated by 
more pragmatic considerations. The cause for such a rapid, 
concerted and efficient action was the petroleum found under 
the desert sand, was it not? Canadians are asking themselves a 
lot of questions. I think we must be careful because if we do not 
answer these questions adequately, we will hurt the credibility 
of peacekeeping missions. On the day when Canadians no longer 
support the government's efforts in this area, we will lose that 
ability.
<P>
	Again, I am happy to have the possibility in this House to 
address this issue. It is very important to ask ourselves questions 
and try to see where we are going. What path should we take? 
There are no easy answers. We could perhaps take one 
case-Haiti's case-and see if there are lessons to be learned 
regarding the approaches and criteria we could adopt in the 
future. So what is happening in Haiti?
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to remind the minister 
that I never questioned the Americans' motives, but I did 
question his. Of course, everyone knows that the Americans are 
really eager to restore peace and democracy in Haiti and that 
they are the only ones making a real sacrifice. Despite the 
minister's heavy rhetoric, despite his lyrical statements, he did 
nothing. He simply watched the Americans, as we all did. I 
certainly am not blaming the Americans for anything in this 
matter, on the contrary. It is the minister I blame for his 
powerlessness and his sugary speeches. He tells us: ``I met with 
President Aristide, I called him, I talked with him, I like him, he 
likes me and we will protect him.'' Yet, President Aristide is still 
in Washington and it is not the minister who will arrange his 
return to Haiti. So please, let us not engage in petty politics. Do 
not attribute to myself, my party and the Official Opposition  the 
slightest intention of undermining the honesty and selflessness 
of American motives.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	That said, it is not because we agree with the approach, 
because we are satisfied with the first results of this approach 
that we cannot be concerned about what is coming. There is 
cause for concern; I am sure that the minister himself is 
concerned and that it is only through considerable self-control 
that he manages to hide his anxiety. Because the minister knows 
full well that Mr. Aristide is now in Washington, that he 
denounced the agreement that was reached, that American 
soldiers are now in Haiti, powerless, their hands tied by an 
agreement they signed with a presidential impostor.
<P>
	I come from the legal world but I am still surprised to see that 
this approach, this American operation in Haiti was based above 
all on the need to restore the legitimate president, the first 
president to be democratically elected in Haiti, that this was the 
real approach, the real objective, the basic justification. So I am 
surprised. The minister himself must have been surprised as a 
lawyer whose legal knowledge I had a chance to appreciate back 
in my university days. The minister must have been surprised as 
I was to see that the first page of the agreement contains only the 
name of the current president, the disgraced president, the 
puppet president appointed by the military junta despite 
President Aristide who was elected democratically a few years 
ago. So that is rather surprising. It is dangerous to recognize a 
usurper. The issue arises.
<P>
	A practical question also arises. The Americans are now 
there. President Cédras is the one who really controls the 
situation, who is the trouble maker, the man who has denied all 
democratic freedoms, who is ultimately responsible for the 
massacres that we see on television. He has not signed the 
agreement. He has incurred no obligation. He walks around the 
streets of Haiti and continues to lead the military junta. On 
television last night, we saw someone being killed as an 
American soldier watched horrified, wondering what he was 
doing there unable to intervene.
<P>
	There is a problem, basically. The minister is surely 
concerned about it. I am sure that once he is back in his 
department with his senior officials, he will continue to express 
his concern and call Washington and try to use Canada's 
diplomatic efforts to bring about a quick settlement of the 
situation, because it is disturbing.
<P>
	October 15 is mentioned, but it is far off. How many more 
people will die in the streets of Port-au-Prince? How many will 
be beaten by the police, by those thugs in the streets of 
Port-au-Prince who hit unarmed people? How much more will 
the people have to suffer while the Americans look on 
powerless? They will not stand for it either. If we Canadians do 
not like to see that, imagine what the Americans think. What 
would we say if we saw armed soldiers wearing the Canadian 
uniform who had gone there from all over Canada and did not 
say a word  but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5958"> 5958 </A></B>
<P>
watched powerless as those whom they had gone to fight strike 
helpless victims? What would we say? We would not be pleased.
<P>
	The Americans are not pleased either, I am sure. We must 
push forward. The minister must intervene, he must speak 
publicly and tell it like it is; he must stop giving us syrupy 
speeches on his feelings for President Aristide, on the telephone 
call he made to him yesterday and Mr. Aristide's call back to 
him. That is not really serious. That is not the real issue. That is 
not what a government is responsible for.
<P>
	The Canadian government must intervene forcefully, speak 
up and demand that President Aristide return there, and insist 
that the Haitian army be dismembered and dismantled, because 
what is going on? The Haitian army is still there, in control. But 
it has no more structure, no more effectiveness, no more 
operational integrity. How can President Aristide return under 
such conditions?
<P>
	How can we imagine that President Aristide will return to 
Haiti in a few weeks and that the army, his enemy which fought 
him and kills and tortures people, will now work hand in hand 
with him and take his orders, and that General Cédras will go to 
salute President Aristide every day in his office?
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	No one can think that. What will happen? Are necessary 
measures being taken to control the Haitian army? As far as we 
know, this is not the case. We do not know anything. All we 
know is that poor President Aristide, who denounced the accord 
a few days ago, today congratulated President Clinton, even 
though nothing had changed.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government has the support of the official 
opposition to find a solution to this issue. We will not play 
politics with that issue. There are no votes to be won or lost. We 
are well aware that this is a matter of honour, a matter of respect 
for mankind, a matter of democracy. In fact, it is a matter of 
preserving the credibility of our peacekeeping missions and our 
role in this type of situation.
<P>
	We have to intervene and we have to be credible. We have to 
act in an efficient and pragmatic way, taking our means into 
account, and our role must be redefined. How do we do that?
<P>
	The first lesson to be learned from the Haiti operation is that 
we cannot intervene elsewhere if such a measure is not based on 
democratic legitimacy. We must not look to General Cedras but 
to President Aristide. We must not look to the impostor but to 
the real president. In our reviews, as well as in the criteria to be 
defined, we should include a requirement to justify any 
intervention on a democratic legitimacy in those countries. 
Secondly, and more importantly, we must not compromise with 
the enemies of democracy. In the case of Haiti, one cannot help 
but wonder if we made a move to protect the  Haitian army rather 
than the population. Indeed, the Haitian army and police 
continue to commit abuse.
<P>
	Thirdly, I think that these interventions should be rigorously 
planned in a concerted fashion. What does that mean? It means 
that we should first clearly define the objectives and the tasking 
orders. What happened in the case of Haiti is that a response 
force showed up and, at the last minute, in extremely difficult 
conditions, I agree, an agreement was hurriedly negotiated. 
However, these people had no framework. No clear objective 
had been defined at the outset. A compromise was negotiated in 
the heat of the action, and that can sometime lead to an 
arrangement that does not take all the relevant factors into 
account. Unfortunately, this seems to be the case here.
<P>
	I also said that these interventions should be planned in a 
concerted fashion. Indeed, even though resolution 940 was 
passed by the UN, the fact remains that there is only a national 
force over there, namely the Americans; this is certainly not 
what you would call a multinational intervention. I heard the 
Minister use the word ``multilateral'' several times in his 
remarks. This does not change the fact that the troops which are 
there are strictly American. Some will say that this is because 
the others were not brave enough to go. That may be so, but it is 
still the case that it is a national force.
<P>
	What we must hope for the future-and it cannot be done right 
now, of course-is that the forces there will be more diversified 
and put under UN command. This is easier said than done. The 
UN must have the means to do it; we must redefine 
``peacekeeping''; we must find a new framework for UN 
missions. This is something we can do. It is better than the 
minister's speeches; it is a job for Canadians; it is a job for our 
diplomats.
<P>
	We should be in New York right now, putting forward 
proposals to revamp UN mechanisms defining peacekeepers' 
mandates and mission objectives. This is a job for the minister, a 
job for his colleagues. Instead of crying on President Aristide's 
shoulder, let him do something constructive! Let them go to 
New York! Let them come up with a plan, present it and advise 
our friends to broaden the forces and to place them under the 
auspices of the UN, whose main role it is anyway. As long as we 
are relying on national policing forces-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> It has been done already.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Did you present a proposal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> Yes, we did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Well then, what are we doing to do now? 
What is the existing commission doing right now? We need 
much more than pious hope, we need proposals on how to share 
the financial burden. Countries should tax themselves, Canada 
should be a leader in that respect. If we do not take the lead in 
that matter, let us do it with others. It must be done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5959"> 5959 </A></B>
<P>
	As long as we depend on one national force, we will have 
complicated situations like the one we have now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about that. Of course we fully 
support the maintenance of Canada's commitment in terms of 
peace missions. A basic creed of Canada is to be present all over 
the place when it is appropriate to do so. At the same time we 
have to improve the way it is done, not only by us but the rest of 
the world. We have to make sure that the credibility of our 
interventions is maintained. If we do not do anything now we 
will undermine the support this and other governments have 
been given by the public in terms of tax money and different 
interventions.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	It should be one of the fundamental tasks of the committees 
now working to define and shape new objectives and missions 
and to make sure that many countries will share the burden if it 
cannot be achieved through United Nations activities. We have 
to be very active at the UN and a strong supporter. We have to 
stop making empty speeches. We have to make sure the next 
mission will not be conducted by national forces like the 
Americans, but that many countries will work together 
efficiently in harmony so as to achieve clearly defined 
objectives.
<P>
	I do not accept the accusation from the minister that we 
suspect the motives of the American administration. We agree 
they were courageous. They were the only ones to do it. They 
had the means to do it and they did it. They had the guts to do it 
and now they are there. It was possible for them to land on Haiti 
without any bloodshed. The problem is that now we have to go 
further because blood is being shed in Haiti every day, the poor 
people victims, and still the same people are hitting and killing 
them, those against whom the Americans decided to intervene.
<P>
	That is why I strongly urge the minister to work closely with 
the Americans to make sure the commitment toward President 
Aristide will be fully respected.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley West-Immigration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
minister for having the opportunity to talk on this most 
important subject. This certainly is an example to Canadians 
when Parliament is allowed to speak on a subject of such 
national interest. I go along with the other speakers in terms of 
our reputation and the pride we have as Canadians in our 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	Since the first peacekeeping mission in 1956 tens of 
thousands of Canadians have been involved in these missions. 
Some of them have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives. 
We want to thank those people for what they have done; it is 
certainly appreciated. The millions of people around the world 
they have helped certainly know what we as Canadians have 
done. On behalf of the Reform Party and Canadians in general I 
would like to pay tribute to those people and say: Job well done.
<P>
	As the House is aware since early this year the special joint 
committee reviewing Canadian foreign affairs, of which I am a 
member, has been travelling across the country to find out from 
Canadians what they think about foreign affairs and our 
international commitments for the coming decades. It has 
become very clear to me and to many members on the committee 
just how deeply concerned Canadians are with events around the 
world.
<P>
	We want to stand up and be part of the missions that occur. We 
do not want to bury our heads in the sand and not take part in all 
of those things that affect our world.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are not prepared to give up on their proud tradition 
of caring and intervention for the sake of peace. These times 
however cannot be seen from a purely international perspective. 
Our foreign commitments must be in harmony with our 
domestic needs. Therefore we must be sure when we do support 
peacekeeping that we are operating in Canada's best interests 
and within the very real financial constraints that must be the 
primary concern of any good government. We must pick our 
spots and we must choose wisely.
<P>
	Today's debate is an example of trying to choose those spots 
and pick the ones that are of most interest. One thing we must 
make clear is that Canada cannot become the 911 phone number 
for the world. As much as we want to help others, this desire is 
tempered by the fact that we cannot be all things to all people. It 
is better that we help effectively in a few cases rather than 
spreading ourselves too thin. In this way Canada can protect its 
own vital interests and provide the most effective help for the 
international community.
<P>
	As we examine the issue of peacekeeping it is worthy to note 
that since the end of the cold war the demand for peacekeepers 
around the world has skyrocketed. If the past few years has 
taught us any lesson it is that instability will continue. New hot 
spots will continue to crop up and Canada must be ready. If more 
requests come from Africa, southeast Asia or the former Soviet 
republics how will Canada respond?
<P>
	Clearly, Canada must establish criteria to test the importance 
of each request for our help. While this is a sensitive issue and I 
do not claim to have all the answers, I would argue that the 
following should be considered by Parliament when deciding 
whether to approve peacekeeping missions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5960"> 5960 </A></B>
<P>
	First, Canada's economic ties are an extremely important 
factor when we determine how willing Canadians would be to 
commit our resources.
<P>
	Second, the conflict's impact on the state of international 
stability is another obvious test of whether Canada should get 
involved. If the conflict has a serious potential to escalate or 
destabilize the whole region, we should consider this seriously 
when making our decision.
<P>
	Third, geographic ties are important. For reasons of regional 
stability, the world would be a better place if countries 
co-operated to make sure that their own part of the world 
remains stable. Where peace does break down, regional 
organizations should co-operate to make things right. After all 
it will be the member nations of such regional groups that have 
the greatest interest in restoring stability. For logistical reasons 
as well, proximity is an important factor in determining whether 
a country can respond to a crisis in a timely and effective 
manner.
<P>
	Fourth, humanitarian considerations must also be taken into 
account. While Canadians want bang for their buck, they also 
want Canada to maintain its tradition for compassion. While I 
could say more on this item, one of my colleagues will talk on 
that subject later on this evening.
<P>
	Fifth, our prior commitments must be given more weight than 
is the current practice when determining what else we are going 
to do. We only have so many troops and a limited amount of high 
quality equipment. Therefore we owe it to our troops to be fair in 
our decisions where we send them and to make sure that we do 
not overcommit our forces. My fellow Reformer, the hon. 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, will talk on 
that issue.
<P>
	Another very important consideration which must be taken 
into account is that our judgment should not be clouded by the 
media spin in each crisis, the so-called CNN factor. There are 
many conflicts in this world which could use the assistance of 
Canadian peacekeepers however the media does not treat them 
equally.
<P>
	The usual process involves one crisis headline becoming 
really big and bouncing everything else from the front pages. 
The media raises a hue and cry to be heard throughout the world: 
Why is the world not helping to do more? Then two weeks or a 
month later the media drops that story and picks up on 
something new. That is just the way it works and we have to be 
conscious of that. Just because the media likes this approach 
does not mean their priorities are always correct; nor do they 
always reflect Canadian interests.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	To the extent that Canadians do care about what they see in the 
media, we have to acknowledge the media will always be a 
factor. However, we must not let the headline du jour drive us 
into unwise or hasty action. Whether it is a sexy headline or not 
Parliament should do the right thing, period.
<P>
	Now that I have outlined some of the basic criteria on which 
we should be judging our participation in peacekeeping, I would 
like to move on to two specific cases which we are discussing 
today, Rwanda and Haiti.
<P>
	According to the six criteria which I have listed, I do not 
believe that Rwanda was a fully appropriate peacekeeping 
initiative for Canada.
<P>
	First, Rwanda and Canada have virtually no trade ties. 
Therefore we certainly could not argue that our economic 
interests were at stake. Other central African countries are 
Rwanda's main trading partners and they are the ones who are 
having their trade disrupted.
<P>
	While the massacres in Rwanda have had an impact on the 
neighbouring countries, especially in terms of creating large 
flows of refugees, I do not believe the crisis there represents a 
threat to regional or world stability.
<P>
	In terms of my third criteria, geographic ties, Canada is 
neither close to Rwanda nor do we have a tradition of dealing 
with that country or its people. Therefore there was a long delay 
before the majority of our peacekeepers could even get there.
<P>
	In the future Canada should encourage regional organizations 
such as the Organization of African Unity to build up their 
capacity to respond when a local crisis arises. Beyond this 
Europe has many more ties to central Africa than we do. This 
tradition makes it more natural for them to adopt a leadership 
role there just as France did.
<P>
	When taking humanitarian considerations into account, 
clearly Rwanda is a case which required the world's attention 
and help. While Canadians will always help in such 
circumstances, do we always have to send in the troops to show 
we care? I do not think so.
<P>
	Many thousands of Canadians spoke with their wallets and 
donated money to Canadian and international NGOs that were 
helping with humanitarian relief. This was an appropriate 
reaction. We would like to do more, but quite frankly others 
were better placed to provide the peacekeeping in Rwanda.
<P>
	One of the main reasons that our reaction to the Rwandan 
disaster was so limited relates to my fifth criteria: our prior 
peacekeeping commitments. No other country has given more in 
the cause of peacekeeping or has been on more missions, but our 
forces are stretched to the limit. It simply is not fair to keep 
asking our soldiers to go on so many endless peacekeeping 
missions. They are the Canadian forces, not the Canadian 
foreign legion. If we scale back or shut down other missions, 
then perhaps we will have some reserve forces to be deployed 
upon need, but right now we do not.
<P>
	According to the last factor, the CNN factor, it is beyond 
doubt that the extensive media treatment of the Rwandan 
disaster initiated the response from this and many other 
governments. Let us not forget that about two years before in 
neighbouring Burundi many thousands were slaughtered for the 
third 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5961"> 5961 </A></B>
<P>
or fourth time  since the 1970s but there was no media reaction, 
no hue and cry, and no peacekeepers.
<P>
	In the future, Parliament must do a better job in assessing the 
seriousness of a crisis. An international crisis is more than the 
sum of the media coverage it receives.
<P>
	Before I move on from the topic of Rwanda, I will talk about 
my experience with Rwanda. In 1971 I read an article in 
<I>National Geographic</I> about the mountain gorillas and the 
country of Rwanda. I decided I had to go there and 15 years later 
I managed to complete that dream.
<P>
	My wife and I experienced a country with beautiful green 
covered hills and mountains and fertile volcanic soil. There 
were friendly people who were smiling and happy. I will always 
remember the markets we visited with the children playing and 
the people doing their weekly shopping. How can a country 
change so dramatically? We were aware of the two tribes but not 
of the hatred. What happened? NGOs and missionaries warned 
of impending problems but nobody listened. Nobody took the 
leadership to try to prevent the carnage which was to follow.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	If we wanted to get involved in Rwanda it should have been 
then, when our diplomatic negotiations and leadership could 
have been more effective. Instead the international community 
failed to act proactively and went to its old standby: when the 
damage was already done they called in the peacekeepers, 
Canadians included.
<P>
	We must learn from this experience. Proactive measures 
through diplomatic channels or through international 
organizations are not only more effective and cheaper than 
expensive peacekeeping missions but they can save a lot of 
lives.
<P>
	Let me go on to Haiti. Once again we have a situation which is 
seemingly thrust on us, a crisis that requires our immediate 
attention. However, on closer inspection a very different picture 
appears.
<P>
	First, we have virtually no economic interests in Haiti. 
Neither is international stability threatened. In terms of 
geographic ties Haiti is certainly in our hemisphere, therefore 
we should have an active interest. But if we are going to get 
involved it should be under the auspices of the Organization of 
American States, not as part of the U.S. led adventure that may 
be opening a Pandora's box into which peacekeeping nations 
may enter, never to withdraw.
<P>
	If Canada is going to Haiti, let us make sure that we know 
what we are getting into. How much will it cost? When do we get 
to leave? What are we trying to accomplish? Is Cedras a 
diabolical murderer yesterday and our partner for the reform of 
Haiti today? Not in my books he is not. I would gladly kick his 
butt but I would not shake his hand.
<P>
	Clearly things are not going as the Americans first planned. 
Haitians are still being beaten and killed by thugs. Aristide is 
clearly unhappy. Haitians in Canada are unhappy. The American 
soldiers are unhappy. In fact the only ones with smiles on their 
faces are the coup leaders. If this is not a clear warning sign I do 
not know what is.
<P>
	On the humanitarian side, there is no doubt that Canada can be 
of assistance to the poorest and most desperate people of Haiti. 
Once again, I argue that it is our NGOs that are best equipped to 
do this; not our soldiers who are already stretched to the 
maximum when it comes to peacekeeping around the world.
<P>
	The Haiti crisis is a hot item today in the media. It may be hot 
tomorrow. However let us not forget that Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
was thrown out in 1991. This is not a new issue. Haiti's problems 
were not even new in 1915 when the Americans invaded the last 
time. Back then they stayed for a generation. Let us make sure 
that this time next year we are not watching the American troops 
pull out only to leave our Canadian servicemen and women there 
for the next generation.
<P>
	Canada can be an effective world player and peacemaker. 
Canadians are proud of this and we do not have to prove it to 
anyone. If we decide not to go to Haiti the world will not hold it 
against us.
<P>
	Let us do Canadians a favour and give the Canadian forces a 
break for once. We will keep our troops at home and instead take 
a leadership role in the OAS. If we build the strength and 
credibility of this and other regional organizations then maybe 
we can really solve the problems of countries like Haiti.
<P>
	It is in this precise role that Canada excels. While other 
countries may be known for their strength or guile, Canada has 
worked long and hard to develop its image as an honest broker 
and leading middle power. We are a member of all of the 
strongest clubs, NATO, G-7, UN, OAS, et cetera, and yet we do 
not have the historical baggage of the world's great military 
powers. Therefore others look to us and trust in our ability to 
build up international institutions like the UN and the OAS. 
Canada will do a great favour for the world if we take this role to 
heart and help to bring about constructive change.
<P>
	On a visit to Washington last week I asked the OAS and State 
Department the same question: Do you feel Canada has played a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5962"> 5962 </A></B>
<P>
strong leadership role in trying to solve the Haiti problems 
diplomatically? I got a negative response from both. Instead I 
was told that Canada is  very timid and suffers from an 
inferiority complex when it comes to dealing with foreigners.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We can play a strong middle power role and become a world 
leader in brokering peaceful solutions to international crises. 
However first we need government leadership to show the way, 
to demonstrate a commitment to diplomacy and playing a more 
active role. We have the education, the foreign staff and most of 
all a reputation as a reasonable, democratic society that can be 
trusted.
<P>
	What we have been lacking is the political will to succeed. 
Such change would not only be good for the international 
community but would be good for Canadians, since affected 
international organizations could go a long way in preventing 
any future problems. Without a crisis there is no need to spend 
more money or risk the lives of members of the armed forces.
<P>
	In conclusion, we should not enter Haiti or any other area until 
we establish, first, the criteria; second, the cost; third, a plan 
including the logistics, our specific job, how and when we will 
get out. We must be sure that Canadians support our actions and 
that we always debate this issue in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The time has come for us to take a step back. Before we send 
our troops on yet another indefinite mission with uncertain 
dangers and an unknown cost, let us establish a credible set of 
criteria on which we can depend to make sure that we pick our 
spots wisely. Canada can make a difference in this world. 
Canada can still be an innovator and a leader in the area of 
peacekeeping but we have to make a choice. Any foolish 
government can say: ``Yes, we will help'', and it will think it is 
doing the best thing. It takes a strong government to say: ``Meet 
me half way and then I will help; otherwise you are on your 
own''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I understood there was a 
brief question and comment period. If so, I have a question for 
the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to inform you that 
Liberal members from here on will be using the 10-minute and 
5-minute provision; in other words, sharing the time as opposed 
to the usual format.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There are no questions 
and comments for the first three speakers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
seek clarification with respect to the rules. My understanding 
was that there were no questions and comments following the 
initial speaker and then the speaker immediately following the 
minister. Certainly my understanding is that the rules do provide 
for a period of questions or comments after that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> On your copy of the 
Projected Order of Business for today you will read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Minister moving the motion and 
Member replying immediately after the motion-unlimited time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All other Members-20 minute maximum and speeches are subject to a 10 
minute question and comment period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would also refer you to Standing Order 43(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unless otherwise provided in these Standing Orders, when the Speaker is in the 
Chair, no Member, except the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, or 
a Minister moving a government order and the Member speaking in reply 
immediately after such Minister, shall speak for more than twenty minutes-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	In this case orders of the day read that the first two speakers 
have unlimited time. As a member responding for the Reform 
Party he had unlimited time with no questions and no comments.
<P>
	Because the wording reads ``only a member replying 
immediately after the minister'', we will allow the usual 
question and comment period for the member for Red Deer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am not sure my question is that desperately 
important. However I do appreciate the opportunity put a 
question and make a comment with respect to the comments of 
the member for Red Deer as the official spokesperson for the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Certainly I share the deep concern that has been raised, 
particularly by the Leader of the Opposition with respect to this 
issue. In fact earlier during question period I spoke myself-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I pointed out that Sunday night's agreement between an 
illegitimate president, a straw man, Mr. Jonassaint, and Mr. 
Carter, an agreement made without consulting President 
Aristide or the United Nations, was in fact a tragic betrayal of 
the Haitian people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I pointed out as well that President Carter just last week 
referred to General Cedras and his armed thugs as conducting a 
reign of terror, executing children, raping women, killing 
priests. As the dictators have grown more desperate the 
atrocities have grown ever more brutal.
<P>
	Certainly many of us are deeply disturbed and angered by this 
deal which in effect refers to the great honour and integrity of 
these same people. There is talk of mutual respect. There is talk 
of a general amnesty, of honourable retirement and appealing to 
their sense of honour.
<P>
	I want to ask the member for Red Deer for clarification. As I 
understand it, the position of his leader, the member for Calgary 
Southwest, was that Canada should be joining in the military 
invasion with the United States. In fact the member for Calgary 
Southwest said, and I quote that member from yesterday: ``We 
can only play this game so long. We do not get our hands dirty at  
the front end. But we come in after''. He suggested we should be 
going in with the Americans.
<P>
	I have listened with care to the comments of the member for 
Red Deer who suggested that we should not be going in at all and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5963"> 5963 </A></B>
<P>
that the OAS was the body that should have accepted 
responsibility here.
<P>
	I would like the member for Red Deer to clarify the position of 
the Reform Party. Who speaks for the Reform Party? Is it the 
leader of the Reform Party or is it the member for Red Deer?
<P>
	Finally, I wonder if the member could clarify as well his 
position with respect to the issue of prevention. Certainly in the 
context of Rwanda, many of us believe that had the world acted 
earlier to prevent the genocide that much of the subsequent 
tragedy could have been averted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I really welcome the 
opportunity to answer that question. I would have thought that a 
member of such senior rank would know not to believe 
everything he reads in the press.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	To clarify, it is great that I have that opportunity. What my 
leader did say in response to the reporter's question was that 
Canada should have played a role in leadership in the OAS and 
in the United Nations and that if we were to be involved and 
entered the country we should be entering with an OAS force, 
not a U.S. force.
<P>
	That makes a major difference because going in with the OAS 
and the United Nations is the big problem that we have. I 
welcome the opportunity to clarify that and to make very clear 
that the leader and I are speaking from exactly the same song 
book.
<P>
	Regarding the preventive measures, I hope I have made that 
clear as well. In 1985 when I spent a month visiting Rwanda, the 
country was not in turmoil. Shortly after that and with the 
underlying problems, there were many NGOs and many 
government people warning that there was an impending 
problem.
<P>
	It was at that point that we had to get in there and negotiate a 
settlement between those two tribes. When it comes to 
prevention, that is how one prevents those kinds of things, not 
waiting until they start killing each other because emotions take 
over as they did in Yugoslavia and as they do anywhere in the 
world when one has a problem like that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I have a supplementary 
question. I would note that until 1992 the previous government 
was providing substantial government to government aid to the 
brutal regime in Rwanda. We allowed into Quebec City as a 
visiting professor one of the people who had been most vigorous 
in his incitement of genocide when he was living in Rwanda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We do 
need clarification. My interpretation of the standing orders is 
that when we divide a 20-minute period into 10 and 10, it is 10 
minutes plus 5 minutes for comments and questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. We have not 
yet started to divide our time. We will be dividing it after the 
defence minister's speech. Questions and comment for 10 
minutes for the hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Nice try, Jesse. Madam Speaker, the member 
for Red Deer in his comments did not make any reference to the 
situation of Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia. Obviously this is 
one of the important elements that the House is addressing.
<P>
	I personally had the opportunity to visit our troops in 
Gradacac in Croatia. Certainly the men and women there were 
doing a very fine job under very difficult circumstances.
<P>
	Could the hon. member for Red Deer clarify what his position 
and the position of the Reform Party is with respect to the role of 
Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia and in Croatia? The hon. 
member is doubtless aware of the recent concerns.
<P>
	Just today there was a report that some 750,000 Muslims and 
Croats have fled from Serbian held areas of northern and eastern 
Bosnia over the past two and a half years. According to the 
representative of the United Nations, hundreds of thousands of 
them are victims of ethnic cleansing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member but the hon. member for Red Deer has 30 
seconds left in his questions and comments. Would you like him 
to respond to your question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I await with great interest 
the response to the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, some of the money 
that is being sent out there is a major concern. We have to tidy up 
the whole CIDA program, that whole area. In answer to the very 
first question, that would be my answer. Yes, we have to improve 
on that.
<P>
	Second, in terms of Bosnia and Yugoslavia, the hon. member 
for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt will be speaking on the 
subject of divided countries. The hon. member will hear the 
answer. He will have to wait.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
hon. members that the government has decided to divide its time 
with 10 minutes each. There will be 5 minutes for questions and 
comments after each speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5964"> 5964 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will take 10 minutes. I will be succinct.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I had some comments planned but I am absolutely shocked at 
what I have been hearing this afternoon, the cynicism of the 
member for Red Deer who just spoke on behalf of the Reform 
Party dealing with our engagement in Rwanda and Haiti. I 
understand my colleague, the Secretary of State for Latin 
America and Africa, will deal with that in her speech following 
me.
<P>
	However I am even more shocked at the belligerent tone of the 
Leader of the Opposition both in question period and this 
afternoon in what had been until now really rational and well 
ordered debate. His belligerent criticism of what happened on 
the weekend, the agreement that former President Jimmy Carter 
ironed out in Port au Prince, is beyond belief. His shooting from 
the hip is incredible. If he conducts the affairs of his party that 
way then I do not know what the rest of this parliamentary 
session is going to be in for.
<P>
	The hon. Leader of the Opposition should have reflected and 
been a bit more statesmanlike. He perhaps would have found 
that the deal that was made on the weekend had to be explained 
to all the parties and indeed has been explained. Shortly after 
three o'clock this afternoon, President Aristide issued a 
statement in Washington. I quote: ``In the past three days 
something has happened in Haiti to uphold democracy which 
was the result of President Clinton's decision for the 
commitment to lead a multinational effort in carrying out the 
will of the United Nations to help restore democracy in Haiti''.
<P>
	He has thanked the United States for its military intervention 
to restore him to power. He said he will be back within 24 days. 
He also said that to help foster the environment of civil liberties 
and political stability he has asked his minister of defence, 
General Jean Beliotte, to head a transition team and recommend 
the next steps to be taken in order to ensure the quick restoration 
of constitutional order.
<P>
	To listen to the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon one 
would have thought that he did not want President Carter to 
avert the disaster that would have occurred with a military 
invasion. I think the statement that President Aristide has just 
issued should calm everyone and help bring some rationality to 
the debate. President Aristide declared this afternoon that he 
will be back within 24 days. After he is restored to power, as we 
have said publicly on a number of occasions, we will take part in 
any effort to help reconstruct Haiti, certainly using the Canadian 
Armed Forces.
<P>
	I will not give any details on what we will actually be doing 
because we will be part of an international reconnaissance team. 
In fact a Canadian colonel will be leading as chief of staff that 
team in the days immediately following President Aristide's 
return and stability being  established there to determine what 
requirements will be necessary of a UN peacekeeping 
engagement. Canada will be happy to take part in helping with 
the reconstruction of Haiti wearing blue berets.
<P>
	I want to talk for a few minutes, since we have not got much 
time and have divided our time on this side, about the changing 
nature of peacekeeping in the world. We are seeing that the 
peacekeeping that was enunciated by former Prime Minister 
Pearson and the peacekeeping tradition that was established in 
the post Second World War era has drastically changed over the 
last number of years. We are facing situations around the world 
which are vastly more complex. They require a multiplicity of 
responses. In some cases, as we have seen in Bosnia and Croatia, 
the circumstances are incredibly dangerous.
<P>
	In the past five years international operations have involved 
three or four different types of peacekeeping arrangements: 
humanitarian work in Ethiopia, Somalia and Bosnia. Let us not 
forget that our troops have been in Bosnia as a humanitarian 
effort under the auspices of the United Nations to bring relief 
and supplies. I think our men and women have done a 
remarkable job in the last two years in bringing that kind of 
humanitarian relief to Bosnia. They are still there as we debate 
this issue today.
<P>
	We have been involved in demining and reconstruction in 
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Kuwait, Iraq and Haiti. We have been 
involved in nation building. We have been involved in embargo 
enforcement such as in the Persian gulf, the Adriatic and the 
waters off Haiti, and we have been involved in confidence 
building through arms control and verification.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	When we talk about peacekeeping we do not just talk about 
the strict conflict resolution and patrolling the line as we did in 
Cyprus for many, many years in a very civilized fashion. We use 
the word peacekeeping in a much wider context. For Canada to 
take part in the world governance through the United Nations 
requires a multifaceted capability on the part of our armed 
forces to try to discharge the missions that come forward.
<P>
	One of the points I want to raise today is that there is an 
ongoing commitment of the armed forces. We have about 3,400 
people actually deployed, not counting what we perhaps send to 
Haiti and which we can discuss in the next few weeks. With a 
whole group of people waiting to go, a whole group of people 
just coming back, and those who are being deployed at the 
moment, we are getting somewhat stretched. We have about 
10,000 peacekeepers involved in this kind of rotation. One of the 
concerns the government has at the moment is how much of our 
resources should we continue to devote to these peacekeeping 
missions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5965"> 5965 </A></B>
<P>
	In particular I want to talk about the commitment concerning 
Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will outline our contribution to the United Nations force 
deployed in the former Yugoslavia, which is our main 
commitment at present. The mandate of the UNPROFOR 
expires on September 30 this year, and will likely be extended.
<P>
	Canada's commitment towards the force also ends on 
September 30, and it has not yet been decided whether to extend 
it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, we have not made the decision in fact to let the 
members of the House know. We do have about 1,500 to 1,600 
personnel ready to go to Croatia and Bosnia starting in the early 
part of October, which is only about 10 or 15 days away. These 
are the Royal Canadian Regiment that will be going to Croatia 
and the Royal Canadian Dragoons that will be going to Bosnia. 
They have both been training in the last little while at CFB 
Petawawa.
<P>
	This training is worth noting as more and more, because of the 
engagements that we are taking on, we are having to deploy 
reservists. This summer I spoke at a function in St. Thomas, 
Ontario, one of the constituency functions of my colleague, the 
member for Elgin. I was really quite touched by the fact that the 
members of the Elgin Regiment, a reserve regiment, will be 
offering nine people for this next engagement as part of the 
Royal Canadian Regiment to go to Bosnia and Croatia.
<P>
	We may well ask why is he saying that they are ready to go? 
What is this debate all about? We want to know before we 
actually send our people that the members of the House of 
Commons are comfortable with a continuation of this 
arrangement. The purpose of the debate is to get the views of the 
men and women in the House who have been talking with their 
constituents over the summer to see if we should continue this 
engagement, how long, should we pull back a battalion or should 
we cut it in half? We have 750 people in Croatia and 750 people 
in Bosnia. The balance is near Split as a supply unit. We want to 
know whether or not we should continue that operation for the 
next engagement. As I said earlier, the engagement ends 
September 30.
<P>
	While no decision has been taken, the government is very 
cognizant of the depletion of our resources. We are cognizant of 
the fact that the armed forces budget is under pressure. We are 
trying to find other, more effective, cheaper ways of discharging 
our duties in terms of peacekeeping. As the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs said, this government remains totally and absolutely 
committed to the concept of peacekeeping, of Canada playing a 
role as a bridge between other nations, whether it be at the sharp 
end, as we see it in Bosnia and Croatia, or whether we see it in 
terms of reconstruction as we have seen it in Rwanda and as we 
may see it in Haiti. The Canadian Armed Forces has the most 
enviable  reputation. When the Prime Minister was in Bosnia 
this summer the Prime Minister of Bosnia said we have 
outstanding troops and he wanted us to stay and be part of the 
effort to help bring peace to the area.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We had the Serbian leader, General Karadzic, who said the 
same when we were faced with the problem of how we would 
relieve our forces in Srebrenica.
<P>
	We have the best armed forces in the world. They have 
suffered as a result of some of the deployments. We have lost 10 
people in the former Yugoslavia. We have about 50 wounded but 
those men and women are prepared to continue to discharge any 
obligations that the government will seek to discharge and those 
obligations will be determined by consultation with members of 
the House of Commons and that is why we are very interested in 
having the views of the members today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the minister's 
comments and I too travelled to the former Yugoslavia and 
found there that our troops indeed are doing a magnificent job 
under extremely difficult circumstances and we should all be 
very proud.
<P>
	As the minister mentioned, peacekeeping is not the only issue 
that the Canadian Armed Forces has to deal with and because the 
resources are very thin and we are downsizing the Canadian 
Armed Forces we have to look at the possibility of internal 
conflicts here on our shores in Canada.
<P>
	You might say that Canada never has to worry about things 
like that but even in my own riding of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt this summer we had a forest 
fire in that region and had to call out the Canadian troops and we 
had people from Calgary come in and do a job there. That was a 
very small contingent and just a small example.
<P>
	We do not have to go back too far. We had a situation in Oka 
where we had great demands put on the situation there as well.
<P>
	How can the minister or the ministry deal with ensuring that 
we keep our role in the world as a peacekeeper but also ensure 
that we have enough resources to ensure we have the people here 
to do the job as well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, that is a very good question. 
I thought I did address it although I am not used to having to 
speak in 10-minute periods. Perhaps I did not have the time to 
enunciate it.
<P>
	More and more we discharge our obligations whether it be 
peacekeeping or whether in aid to the civil power, domestic 
crises such as the ones we saw this year. We helped in the search 
for a young Saskatchewan girl. We helped with the forest fires in 
B.C. We helped last winter with the floods in Quebec. We are 
going to have to turn more and more to reservists, those men and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5966"> 5966 </A></B>
<P>
women who  train part time, on the weekends, the unsung heroes 
of the Canadian military tradition.
<P>
	It costs money and to continue to do this we have to reorder 
our priorities, reshape our budgetary priorities.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that we will not be so 
stretched that we will not be able to discharge those very 
emergencies of which he speaks. That is why I have raised the 
subject of our future continued engagement in Bosnia and 
Croatia. We are getting not to the breaking point but to the 
stretching point. If we are to continue the multiplicity of 
peacekeeping engagements, and they have been coming fast and 
furious, we are now talking about the possibilities of Haiti and 
we have been in Rwanda, which was unforeseen certainly when I 
became minister, obviously we are going to have to redirect 
more and more of our budget to this. This could mean that we 
will have to take it from other very deserving components of the 
military budget.
<P>
	I want to assure the member that when we have disasters such 
as the ones of which he spoke a little earlier we will be there. We 
will not let the Canadian people down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I guess what I 
am concerned about is that there are so many areas that are going 
to erupt and I do not see us developing any criteria as to what our 
guidelines are going to be in the future.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	We are getting more and more letters telling us about the 
quality of our equipment. More and more letters are coming 
back home saying our equipment is not adequate. Could the hon. 
minister respond to that, please?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, we would not send people 
outside of the country to do this work if the equipment were not 
good. I can assure you and all Canadians the equipment is good.
<P>
	However, we do have some needs to replace various 
components of armed forces equipment. Those questions will be 
addressed in the context of the defence review. I know one of the 
points that the hon. member made for which he should be 
commended is he is trying to put our peacekeeping engagements 
in some kind of conceptual framework in terms of the priorities.
<P>
	I do not particularly agree with the conclusions that he drew 
with respect to Rwanda and Haiti, but the fact is the defence 
review and the foreign policy review will I hope help set those 
criteria so that we will be able to answer the hon. member and 
the UN when it comes knocking on our door for future 
commitments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa)):</B> Madam Speaker, it is frustrating to hear some of 
the debate going around the House and have inadequate time to 
respond today. I was most disturbed by the comments made by 
the Reform Party with regard to Rwanda and Haiti. For a party 
that is  supposed to represent the interests of the Canadian 
people it is no wonder it is plunging in the polls today.
<P>
	If the Reform Party had looked carefully it would understand 
from polls that have been done recently moral and ethical 
considerations are considered by Canadians the way that they 
would judge priorities in the world. They put Rwanda and Haiti 
at the top of the list. At the bottom of the list they put 
self-interest. I am quite appalled that the Reform Party bases its 
foreign policy on self-interest.
<P>
	Canada's support to the United Nations and our commitment 
to peacekeeping remain strong. Our reputation worldwide for 
balanced and fair diplomacy, humanitarian and determined 
confidence building initiatives such as peacekeeping and our 
commitment to global peace and development all give Canada 
influence much beyond what our economy and population size 
would suggest is possible.
<P>
	Canada must not squander the opportunities our reputation 
presents both for our own good and the good of the world. 
Canada does not earn this reputation through playing the role of 
the belligerent, unfortunately necessary as this role might seem 
to be from time to time. It is peacekeeping, the role so strongly 
associated with Canada, that earns us our enviable reputation 
and thus influence in the world.
<P>
	However important peacekeeping is to Canada's foreign 
policy and defence policy, it is costly. We must continue in our 
role as peacekeepers but constantly look at less costly 
alternatives such as early warning systems, conflict prevention, 
management and resolution.
<P>
	Granted, important initiatives are already being taken in this 
area by Canada and others around the world, thereby warding off 
the crises the public never hears about.
<P>
	The government will continue to follow up good ideas and 
recommendations with diplomatic initiatives. An example of 
Canada's initiatives in this area of policy is our decision to send 
Bernard Dussault to consult in and around Rwanda not only to 
find appropriate and timely solutions to the crisis situation in 
Rwanda but also to address the political difficulties in Burundi, 
Zaire and the refugee problems in other countries in the region.
<P>
	In the development of our strategy for Haiti Canada has been 
fully conscious of the need for a long term strategy to not only 
return democracy to Haiti through peacekeeping but to build and 
strengthen the institutions needed to support and sustain it in the 
long run.
<P>
	I would wish that all members in this House had been able to 
accompany me to visit President Aristide in Washington last 
week to see the very warm reception that he gave to our Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and his effusive thanks for the leadership role 
that Canada has taken on the issue of Haiti and his return to Haiti 
to head a democratically elected government there which he 
represents.
<P>

<P>
	Our role fits into a broad historic approach that Canada has 
taken to peacekeeping and emphasizes the contribution to be 
made to that category of international peace operations that the 
Secretary General of the United Nations has characterized as 
peace building.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	Once President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is returned to power in 
Haiti, under the terms of Governors Island agreement and UN 
resolution 940, Canada will participate in the United Nations 
mission in Haiti, UNMIH, by providing up to 600 military and 
100 police personnel. Canada will assume a particular 
responsibility in police training and supervision.
<P>
	Altogether UNMIH will assume the task of maintaining a 
secure environment which will provide the necessary 
foundation upon which to begin efforts aimed at establishing a 
durable and lasting democratic system in Haiti.
<P>
	These are daunting objectives that will require a long term 
commitment. It is important to remember that we will remain in 
Haiti for the long haul. Establishing the foundations of a civil 
society in a country whose population has been numbed by years 
of desperate poverty, brutal violence and repression is an 
enormous challenge.
<P>
	We have to build from the bottom up by providing assistance 
with basic education and literacy training, agriculture and 
health care and by creating employment opportunities that will 
put in motion the wheels of a healthy economy. The success of 
these initiatives is only possible when the political environment 
is secure and stable.
<P>
	Our aid program has and will continue to reinforce these 
objectives through the provision of assistance to the 
development of civil society and good governance, including 
the respect for human rights in Haiti.
<P>
	Our contribution to Rwanda has also been significant, 
initiated well before the conflict escalated in April. Canada 
provided the chief military observer to the first UN mission on 
the Uganda-Rwanda border. We fully supported the Arusha 
peace agreement providing for power sharing and integration of 
the armed forces.
<P>
	The force commander for the UN mission assigned to oversee 
the implementation of this agreement was our Canadian hero 
Major General Romeo Dallaire. Through a coherent strategy 
formulated by the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Defence and 
the Canadian International Development Agency, Canada has 
also made a significant contribution to the peacekeeping and 
humanitarian relief effort in Rwanda through the provision of 
medical experts, engineers and the ongoing airborne delivery of 
essential supplies. Assistance from multilateral and 
non-governmental aid organizations working on the ground has 
been invaluable.
<P>
	In taking these initiatives to establish lasting peace and 
stability in Rwanda Canada is clearly focused on the task. 
Rwanda must have an acceptable, broad based government in 
power. It badly needs a functioning infrastructure, basic 
services such as water and electricity. The thousands of 
displaced refugees must return to their homes as soon a possible. 
These are all objectives of our peacekeeping mission in Rwanda.
<P>
	Given the difficult circumstances peacekeepers have played 
an indisputably critical role under the steady and courageous 
leadership of Major General Romeo Dallaire and now Major 
General Tousignant. Peacekeeping must be broadened by 
committed political activities that do more than keep the 
warring factions apart. We must be proactive to build the 
institutional pillars of a peaceful and secure society and to assist 
Rwandan citizens to experience their fullest human capacities.
<P>
	In our debate today we have to address the important issues of 
our extended peacekeeping role throughout the world in light of 
limited resources for peacekeeping. I am attempting to convey 
that despite our limited capacity to continue to respond to every 
crisis in the world Canada can continue to have an effective 
voice through concerted efforts to not only prevent conflict from 
erupting but in maintaining our commitment to fragile states 
once the peacekeeping phase is over. Peace building and conflict 
prevention are much less costly than war and crisis responses.
<P>
	I cannot finish these remarks without a particular 
acknowledgement of the basic component of our peacekeeping 
effort, our peacekeepers, our Canadian Blue Berets. Canada 
would not have the enviable reputation for peacekeeping it has 
were it not for the professionalism, skill and discipline of our 
peacekeepers. Canada cannot take part in peacekeeping without 
our soldiers having the best training and adequate equipment 
and material support meeting the best standards for the 
protection of our soldiers and assuring that they have all the 
necessary tools to succeed in the task.
<P>
	We must be grateful, as I am, for the women and men who 
volunteer to serve Canada as part of our important peacekeeping 
missions; grateful to them and their families for their sacrifice 
in helping to bring about global peace and security, to bring 
dignity and freedom to innocent men, women and children, the 
victims of conflict.
