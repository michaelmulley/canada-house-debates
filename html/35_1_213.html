	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, tomorrow Ontarians will be called on to elect a new 
government.
<P>
	Mike Harris and his crew are catering to the extreme right by 
promising unrealistic tax and spending cuts. I call on the 
Conservative leader to come clean with Ontarians and tell them 
exactly how these cuts are to affect education, health care and 
social programs.
<P>
	I pledge my full support behind Lyn McLeod and her excellent 
team of candidates. I am convinced that if Ontarians focus on 
provincial issues and see Mike Harris for what he really is, a 
Mulroney clone, they will elect a majority Liberal government.
<P>
	Mike Harris will cut education and create a two tier health 
care system. Mike Harris wants to bring us back to the future of 
the 1950s old boys network where you take from the poor to give 
to the rich.
<P>
	Let us move forward with the realities of the 21st century and 
elect a fiscally responsible-

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

best bungler to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	After his murky role in the Ginn Publishing affair, his attempt 
to influence the CRTC's decision regarding a broadcasting 
licence, his decision to slash the CBC's budget and refusal to 
admit that he had done it, his embroilment of the CRTC in the 
Power DirecTv matter, his less than timely visit to Los Angeles 
and its impact on the Seagram matter, the minister just keeps on 
going.
<P>
	Why should we be surprised that the minister accepted to be 
the host of a $2,000 a plate dinner organized by a lobbying firm? 
Why should we be surprised to see that the minister's office 
awarded that very firm three contracts?
<P>
	In light of these revelations, one question comes to mind: 
Why does the Prime Minister protect this minister who is 
singlehandedly bringing down the semblance of respectability 
and ethical conduct that the government has so painstakingly 
built for itself?

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the native blockade at the Douglas Lake ranch has 
finally come to an end. It was taken down not because the RCMP 
enforced the law and removed this illegal blockade but 
apparently because charges against the four Nicola band 
members that were illegally fishing were dropped. Because the 
RCMP refused to enforce the law this whole affair has cost the 
Douglas Lake ranch around $200,000. Who pays for that?
<P>
	Now the chief of the band is warning that if progress is not 
made to their satisfaction more blockades will go up. The RCMP 
action will undoubtedly result in B.C. being transformed into a 
blockade battleground this summer.
<P>
	This whole Douglas Lake affair is clear evidence that a two 
tier justice system is being actively pursued by the government. 
So much for equality and so much for equality before the law.

Superintendent Len Olfert of the RCMP and to other members of 
the force for their exemplary performance in fulfilling their 
professional duties of enforcing the court order to remove the 
blockade erected by the Upper Nicola Indian Band.
<P>
	The barricade was removed in a peaceful and safe manner. 
The RCMP demonstrated a cultural appreciation, recognition 
and sensitivity that enabled a communication channel to be

maintained between the members of the force and the First 
Nations leaders involved in this serious dispute.
<P>
	Appreciation must also be extended to the First Nations 
peoples involved. Despite their serious historic grievances they 
were prepared to co-operate with the RCMP and agreed to 
resolve any differences through a process of negotiation.
<P>
	This action bodes well for a satisfactory resolution of the 
issues. It once again reminds us why the RCMP is the most 
professional and respected police force in the entire world.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to voice my opposition to the Reform Party like tactics 
being used by the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party 
during the Ontario election campaign.
<P>
	Mike Harris and his party troops are spreading a gospel of 
fiscal fantasy. On the one hand they promise $4 billion worth of 
income tax cuts; on the other they pledge to balance the budget 
in six years. On the one hand they would promise not to cut 
health care and education; on the other they would spend 
millions of dollars on end of pipe solutions, punishing youth in 
boot camps, a system that has already failed in the United States. 
Are they for real? To top it all off, the Harris posse pledges to 
take a 25 per cent pay cut if they fail to meet their deficit targets, 
targets set for some time after the next provincial election.
<P>
	The people of Ontario do not need naive politicians who make 
lofty promises that do not make any sense. They need the 
McLeod team: realistic promises, realistic goals, good 
government.

	That is right, Mr. Speaker. We will not be fooled by the fairy 
tale provincial Tory election plan. We heard tall tales like these 
from Brian for nine years.
<P>
	Economists are being polite when they express their 
scepticism about the Tory plan for balancing the budget. 
However, behind closed doors they are rolling on the floor 
laughing at Harris' Alice in Wonderland election ploy.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Let us get real. The Ontario electorate is not so naive as to 
believe that a 30 per cent personal income tax cut will ever come 
their way. This comes from the guy who wants Ontario students 
to sell chocolate bars in order to subsidize the huge Tory tuition 
plan and the increases his party has planned for them.

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the eve of 
the Ontario election I want to look at the hot buttons the Tories 
are pushing.
<P>
	They are telling the people of Ontario that workfare will 
work. I was glad to see in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today, the number 
one Tory supporter, that it has identified that plan as an 
unworkable policy clunker.
<P>
	The Tories say that employment equity is all about quotas and 
if we just get rid of the legislation we will find all the jobs that 
we need for Ontario. That is simplistic and is a totally 
outrageous misrepresentation.
<P>
	The Tories tell us they will cut our taxes by 30 per cent, they 
will balance the budget and they will not touch health care. We 
all want that but there is nothing in their plan that will get us 
there except perhaps a new Ontario health tax for individuals.
<P>
	What bothers me the most is that they are speaking to the dark 
side of human nature. They are giving licence to us to attack 
people who are least able to defend themselves. It is unfair and 
unjust. The people of Ontario will not vote for that platform 
tomorrow.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this morning the final press release of the G-7 Summit in 
Halifax, a summit that has not even taken place yet, was 
available to all. The source of this leak, which has embarrassed 
the governments of the six other G-7 countries, must be the 
Canadian government, the host of the summit. How confident 
the other G-7 countries must be of this government's reliability!
<P>
	This amateurism puts us to shame. Quebecers and Canadians 
could be proud of the accomplishments of previous 
governments on the international scene. In earlier times, we 
were on the cutting edge of peacekeeping missions the world 
over. We once were the conscience of the western world 
regarding human rights. We once were the bridge between east 
and west, north and south, the United States and Europe. Today, 
the lack of imagination, of a vision for the future and the failure 
to see big have relegated us to a second rate role. The Canada of 
which so many people were once proud is no more.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
eve of the election in Ontario I rise to outline yet another Liberal 
broken promise.
<P>
	On page 20 of the red book the Liberals promised to reduce 
the professional and special services budget of the government 
by 15 per cent. What has happened? The professional and 
special services budget has increased by $136 million.
<P>
	The Department of Transport saw an 86 per cent increase in 
the need for special assistance over the past year. Even the 
governor general needed special help to the tune of $87,000 
more than last year.
<P>
	This is just another example of the lack of Liberal will and 
ability to cut spending. Meanwhile the Reform Party has put 
forward more than 50 motions to eliminate wasteful spending in 
the main estimates which will be debated tonight.
<P>
	Will the Liberals live up to their red book promises and vote 
for spending reductions? We will wait to see.

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week, a few days before the Ontario provincial election, the 
Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario, ACFO, held its 
annual convention in Toronto. This organization has defended 
the interests of Ontario's francophone community for decades.
<P>
	The leaders of the Liberal, New Democrat and Conservative 
parties were invited to attend. Mike Harris, the leader of the 
Conservative Party decided, however, not to. Would Mr. Harris' 
decision not indicate how little interest he has in Ontario 
francophones? It would seem so.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Ontario's francophones want a government that is sensitive to 
their needs, a government that is not afraid to respect their 
rights. Clearly, Mr. Harris has little concern for these claims and 
for the francophone community of Ontario in general.

Mr. Speaker, Ontario Conservative leader Mike Harris has 
promised a referendum on any future tax increases. This reads 
like Reform Party policy. Maybe the people of Ontario could 
call Mike on a 1-900 user pay service. His motto could be 
``when I want your opinion, I want you to pay for it''. Mike 
could seek advice on issues that are important only to him, or 
Mike could do what Reformers are known for, ignore the people 
and vote the way the Reform politicians think best.
<P>
	The people of Ontario want action and they want jobs. Liberal 
promises are real and they will be kept. In 1993 the people of 
Ontario elected only one Reformer. They have shown their 
common sense. Tomorrow they have a chance to once again 
reject doom and gloom and lots of empty promises by putting 
the Conservatives where they belong, as they did the Reformers, 
in opposition to stay.

<P>
	As members will recall the immigration department refused 
to grant a visa to the Algerian film maker Mrs. Koudil so she 
could present her film at the Vues d'Afrique festival. The

put on a play at the Theatre Festival of the Americas denouncing 
the rise of fundamentalism in Algeria.

	The anticipated removal of the chairman of the Standing

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
people of Ontario are getting wise to the reality of Mike Harris' 
ultra conservative policy. His pie in the sky promises of a 30 per

of this province. How does he propose to juggle a massive tax 
cut and balance the budget without slashing essential services? 
He does not.
<P>
	Mike Harris is deceiving the people of Ontario, shamelessly 
exploiting the discontent brought about by five years of NDP 
government. He is using it as a pretext to dismantle progressive 
and essential programs that the Liberals across this country have 
helped establish.
<P>
	There is only one real choice for the voters in Ontario. Lyn 
McLeod has demonstrated her commitment to the people of 
Ontario by proposing realistic and workable proposals for 
change, realistic tax cuts to stimulate job creation, a balanced 
budget in four years, a firm commitment to cut $3.5 billion from 
government spending while maintaining funding for education 
and health.

government.
<P>
	The Liberals have promised not to increase taxes but to 
balance the provincial budget within four years. They have 
presented a responsible and prudent plan that recognizes both 
the government's fiscal responsibility and its social 
responsibility not to place the burden of reducing the deficit on 
the backs of the least advantaged in society.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	It is one thing to hold the line on personal tax increases. It is 
irresponsible to substantially cut them when facing a large 
deficit. Ronald Reagan showed us in 1981 what happens when 
taxes are cut without a sound economic plan. The rich get richer, 
the debts get larger, and the middle class becomes poorer.
<P>
	The people of Ontario know that it will require leadership and 
not gimmicks to guide the province. Lyn McLeod and the 
Liberals will provide that leadership.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday CRTC chairman Keith Spicer was very 
critical of the directives the federal government is about to 
approve with respect to direct to home satellite television 
services. He referred to these directives as illegal and 
condemned their unprecedented retroactive effect as well as 
their incredibly detailed content. Mr. Spicer said that 
government intervention undermined the independence and 
integrity of the CRTC and could lead to political interference 
with its operations.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Considering 
that yesterday, Mr. Spicer felt it was necessary to remind us that 
the government's authority with respect to communications did

Let us hear what the opposition has to suggest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, obviously these excellent arguments failed to 
convince the chairman of the CRTC who knows the subject 
inside out.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> My question was about the integrity of this 
government, and the custodian of the government's integrity, 
the person who is ultimately responsible for the government's 
integrity is the leader of the government. My question is 
directed to the Prime Minister, and I want to ask him to explain 
how he can claim that his government followed normal 
procedures in this case and acted with integrity, when we know 
that the orders were tailor made for Power DirecTv in which his 
son-in-law has an interest?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Once 
again, Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition chooses to 
confuse policy with accusations that have nothing to do with 
reality.
<P>
	Let me remind him again that the origin of the issue was the 
issuance of an exemption order which effectively created a 
monopoly in the direct to home satellite sector.
<P>
	Let me remind the hon. Leader of the Opposition exactly why 
the exemption order was created in the first place in the bill 
proposed by the former government.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	The explanatory note says that an exemption order exists as 
part of the technology neutral approach of the act. An example 
of a service which is technically broadcasting but which the 
commission would probably want to exempt is real estate radio.
<P>
	What we have here is the use of the exemption order by the 
CRTC to authorize the entry into a very major component of the 
broadcasting service in the country of direct to home satellite 
broadcasting.
<P>
	It was never anticipated that an exemption order would be 
used for such a purpose. It is entirely appropriate that the 
government seek a transparent method of looking at the means 
of licensing and recognizing the entry into the market in this 
important sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I pity the CRTC! Someone is responsible for 
defending the government's integrity: it is the Prime Minister, 
and he is not saying a word. Someone is responsible for 
defending the CRTC in this House; he is not saying a word, and 
the Minister of Industry is trying to cover for these people. He is 
getting involved in something that is none of his business.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I will give the Prime Minister another chance 
to act responsibly on this issue. I want to ask him how he can 
continue to claim he did nothing out of the ordinary and that the 
matter is being dealt with, when Expressvu, the competing 
consortium which had agreed to comply with the CRTC's 
criteria, has already made it clear that it would challenge the 
cabinet directives in the courts and that the CRTC will refuse to 
implement orders it feels are unlawful and also plans to bring 
this matter before the courts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, throughout this issue the Prime Minister has acted with 
the utmost integrity by withdrawing himself from any 
discussion concerning it.
<P>
	The government's objective is to establish a competitive 
environment in this important sector. Apparently there are 
plenty of legal opinions floating around. The hon. member 
knows very well that lawyers can be found to give opinions from 
virtually any point of view.
<P>
	However, in this case we are confident we are acting entirely 
within the authority we have within the act. We have created a 
process that is open and transparent. We are seeking a policy that 
is pro competition and pro consumer.
<P>
	Again I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he has a 
suggestion to make on how the policy ought to be shaped, if he 
wishes us to listen to protect one particular interest, we will hear 
him.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I urge hon. members to make the questions 
direct and the answers a little shorter.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister or his messenger boy. I do not 
know who will choose to respond. The Minister of Industry may 
feign indignation, but he cannot hide his own and the whole 
government's discomfort.
<P>
	The chairman of the CRTC told the parliamentary committee 
yesterday that the government's power to issue directives never 
meant that it could take over the CRTC's role of setting Canada's 
broadcasting policy.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister or his messenger boy, his underling, 
not think that, by bypassing the usual decision making process 
in this matter, putting in place a special committee as proposed, 
and drafting a very specific order tailor made for Power 
DirecTv, the government usurped the CRTC's powers, as CRTC 
chairman Keith Spicer claims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we not only have the right to issue directives governing 
debate here in this House, but we also have the duty to set the 
best possible broadcasting policy for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	That is what we did. We have not heard a single word from the 
official opposition about the broadcasting policies it favours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
not take long. Given the kind of answer I am getting, I will try to 
make my question shorter and clearer. Perhaps then the minister 
will understand.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Impossible! It is impossible for him to understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Given the absolutely unprecedented attack by 
the CRTC chairman-not just anyone but the person appointed 
by the government to head the CRTC-, how can the minister 
continue to claim that the government followed normal 
procedures in this matter? How can he make such a claim, when 
it is quite obvious that all government decisions have directly 
benefited Power DirecTv, in which the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law has interests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem with the hon. member's thesis is that it is 
wrong. Our order did not favour anyone. We proposed that the 
CRTC create a licensing system for everyone. We did not ask the 
CRTC to favour a specific group, company or individual.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The exemption order does that. It is an exemption order which 
is not subject to any appeal. It exists for a very limited purpose 
within the statute.
<P>
	We have set in process a means of determining a policy which 
we think will be better in the interest of Canadians and the 
interest of consumers.
<P>
	I have yet to hear from the hon. member whether he disagrees 
with the expert panel, whether he disagrees with Friends of 
Canadian Broadcasting, whether he disagrees with the 
Consumers Association of Canada, all of whom say this is what 
we should be doing. That is the advice we are taking, not his.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, section 23 of the federal conflict of interest code 
includes this guideline:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A public office holder shall take care to avoid-the appearance of being placed 
under any obligation to any person-that might profit from special consideration 
on the part of the office holder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In September the heritage minister blatantly broke the 
guideline. He did not avoid the appearance of conflict of 
interest. He participated in a private dinner at which guests were 
invited to pay $2,000 for access to the minister and after which 
several received government contracts.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was therefore clearly wrong when he said 
in the House yesterday that ``the minister has contravened none 
of our rules or directives''.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister, before he digs himself in any deeper, 
now demand the resignation of the Canadian heritage minister 
for violation of this guideline?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I replied to these questions yesterday. I said that 
ministers have been engaged like all members of Parliament of 
all parties in fundraising. The names of the people and the 
amount of money have been transmitted to the party according 
to the laws of Canada. Every minister and every member of 
Parliament are doing that. Everybody has to do it according to 
rules set out by the elections act. In this case the minister has 
followed that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1987 Conservative cabinet minister Roch LaSalle 
held a $5,000 a head cocktail party in a private home for a group 
of business people with interests in his department.
<P>
	The Liberal opposition declared this to be a conflict of 
interest and demanded the minister's resignation. Prime 
Minister Mulroney, that great guardian of public ethics, 
eventually asked LaSalle to resign.
<P>
	In 1994 the Liberal heritage minister held a $2,000 a plate 
dinner at a private home for a group of business people with 
interests in his department. We demand his resignation and 
declare it to be a conflict of interest, but the Prime Minister 
denies there is any wrongdoing.

and raise himself to the ethical standards of Brian Mulroney and 
demand the resignation of that minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

works are wrong over patronage. The Minister of Canadian 
Heritage is wrong over conflict of interest and the Prime 
Minister is wrong to defend those types of errors.
<P>
	In the name of red book ethics, will the Prime Minister start 
today to do the right thing and demand the resignation of the 
minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have replied to these questions and the hon. member 
has not put forward any new facts.
<P>
	We have the names of the people who contributed to the 
Liberal Party at this occasion. The names were printed in public 
documents. It is part of the political process of contributions to 
the party. As I said yesterday, the contributors did not receive a 
contract in relation to the government. Most of these 
contributions came from corporations which gave to the Reform 
Party as well.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are not fooled by the government order, which 
has a double objective: help Power DirecTv and hinder 
Expressvu.
<P>
	Canadians' confidence in the integrity of the process that led 
the government to favour Power DirecTv was strongly shaken 
by the striking revelations made by the chairman of the CRTC.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the Prime 
Minister not feel that, by letting the heritage and industry 
ministers undermine the authority and integrity of the CRTC in a 
matter that benefits his own son-in-law, he is in fact condoning 
an unacceptable situation that was strongly denounced by the 
chairman of the CRTC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again, the facts are the following. We introduced a 
transparent public process. The directive issued in this House is 
open for discussion. It is possible for both the official opposition 
and the Reform Party to propose amendments. To date, they 
have not proposed any. Neither have they discussed the CRTC 
order in terms of the monopoly it set up. Consumers in Quebec 
and Canada prefer that there be competition in every sector. In 
the emerging satellite broadcasting sector in particular, there is 
no reason for not having open competition.
<P>
	We are on the side of consumers. We are in favour of 
competition. What does the opposition have against that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a limit to leading people down the garden 
path. With Expressvu, there was no monopoly; Power DirecTv, 
however, did not meet CRTC requirements. That is why he wants 
to prevent the start-up of Expressvu.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Given that the Prime Minister's senior 
adviser was kept abreast of progress on the Power DirecTv issue 
and that we now know that the government orders are illegal 
because they have a retroactive effect, how can the Prime 
Minister continue to maintain that the usual transparent 
procedure was followed in the case of Power DirecTv and that 
his son-in-law's interests did not carry inordinate weight in the 
matter?

Broadcasting Act is quite clear and we have followed it to the 
letter. We have tabled the direction in the House; it is there for 
discussion.
<P>
	I have yet, despite numerous times today, to hear once from 
the opposition whether it thinks the directions should simply be 
withdrawn in order to create a monopoly for one company or 
whether it thinks the directions should be changed in some way. 
If so, let it propose it.

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The minister has a responsibility to preserve the CRTC's 
independence, as well as that of Canada's regulatory process 
regarding broadcasting.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage associate himself 
with orders in council deemed illegal by the CRTC, which is

of his ministerial responsibilities, he must protect the CRTC's 
independence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr.

did nothing to compromise the CRTC's independence, since we 
followed a process which is provided for in the broadcasting 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	The situation is very clear. There is a parliamentary process. 
We could debate the issue in this House. We have no intention of 
restricting the CRTC's independence. If Bloc members have a 
different view on the directive, they can share it. We are 
prepared to listen.

that the committee will be as receptive to our amendments as the

Minister of Canadian Heritage. How can the minister willingly 
ignore the criticisms made by the CRTC chairman, who has to 
call on public opinion to preserve the independence of his 
organization? Is this not a serious neglect of duty?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very important the opposition understand what we 
are trying to do.
<P>
	The complaint would have validity if there was an attempt to 
interfere with the CRTC's process, if there was an attempt in 
some fashion to determine who would receive a licence or who 
would not.
<P>
	Instead we are dealing with situation in which the government 
is endeavouring to establish policy. That policy includes an 
obligation on the part of those who wish to provide direct to 
home satellite services of applying to the CRTC to obtain a 
licence to do so. Nobody would be able to carry on that business 
without a licence granted by the independent tribunal, the 
CRTC.
<P>
	That does not in any way limit its independence. It is an 
appeal to it to use its independence in a way that is understood 
by the process to have a public application heard, debated, 
discussed and licences issued free of interference from the 
Government of Canada.

years' experience, MacDonald McNeely, that would have been 
handling the case, was let go. In spite of concerns expressed by 
myself in the House to the justice minister, concerns expressed 
by the RCMP in public and to the justice department and even 
the newly appointed prosecutor himself, the justice department 
still let him go ahead with the prosecution and he blew it.
<P>
	I ask again, will the minister do the right thing. Will he get rid 
of the revenue minister's appointments and give the people of 
B.C. what they deserve, a properly run justice system free from 
patronage?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, prosecutions by the federal government take many 
forms.
<P>
	The Criminal Code is a very large book. A lawyer can go a 
whole career and never have prosecutions under certain 
sections. It is extremely unreasonable not to allow a 
representative of the attorney general not to prosecute because 
he or she may not have had a previous case under that particular 
section.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The national hearings on the tainted blood scandal allow 
members of the Krever Commission to hear witnesses in order to 
understand the events surrounding this tragedy. It happens that 
some decisions were made by federal political figures. Yet, 
these same people have not been invited to appear before this 
commission.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that her department's authorities 
have made all the information required to shed light on the 
decisions that were made between 1978 and 1985 by the various 
actors, including the political figures, available to the Krever 
Commission?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we want to fully co-operate so that we really know 
what happened. I am told that, indeed, all the information has 
been made available to Mr. Krever.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I got the minister's answer and would like to ask 
her another question.
<P>
	Considering that at the time of the tainted blood scandal, 
Connaught Laboratories were controlled by the Canada 
Development Corporation, a federal corporation, how does the 
minister explain that no one on the board or in management of 
this corporation between 1978 and 1985 has been invited to 
testify at the national hearings of the Krever Commission?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Krever inquiry is to look into what happened in the 
past.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	I personally or as the Minister of Health will not make any 
comments concerning any of the witnesses or any of the 
evidence that is being brought before Mr. Krever.
<P>
	We await his final report. Mr. Krever is independent in 
deciding how to conduct his inquiry and we will continue to 
ensure that independence. We think it is very important.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on seven 
previous occasions I have asked for a full public inquiry into the 
Perez affair. It has been denied every time.
<P>
	The Prime Minister says he wants proof. Here are several 
documented instances. A Liberal member of the other place 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13373"> 13373 </A></B>
<P>
received $5,000 per month from Perez for several years. The 
chairman of Canada Post had his hotel in Spain paid for by Perez 
and his son received over $100,000 from Perez.
<P>
	We have more proof. An associate of Perez considered the 
payments to the chairman's son as part of the Canada Post deal. 
There is the proof.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister prove to Canadians that he has the 
high ethical standards that he claims to have by authorizing a 
full, independent investigation into the scandal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
opposite has raised this question on a previous occasion.
<P>
	It would be inappropriate for the government to do anything 
because an RCMP investigation is presently under way. 
Proceedings are taking place under the Bankruptcy Act. This 
question was put to the president of the Canada Post Corporation 
when he appeared before the standing committee.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's desire to make further 
accusations against the individuals involved but it would be 
highly inappropriate for us to take action until those 
proceedings come to a full and complete ending. Thereafter 
decisions can be made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bankruptcy 
investigation is one thing. The ongoing business of Mr. Perez 
with the government is what the government ought to be 
concerned about and that is current.
<P>
	Mr. Perez is still very much a player here in Ottawa and 
seeking government contracts. My question is specifically for 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Has he at any time received money from Perez? If so, is this 
clouding his decision-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, both the questions and the answers 
today have been quite forceful. I suggest with all respect to the 
hon. member that the question is impugning great motive. I 
would like him to withdraw the question if he would.
<P>
	I will permit him to rephrase another question but I would like 
him to withdraw that question if he would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, my sincere apologies. I meant no 
disrespect. I apologize and I withdraw the phrase.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister to state very clearly to us what 
his reason is for not advancing an investigation with respect to 
the current operations of Mr. Perez and the dealings of the 
government. It is a matter of ethics.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue should be 
very clear to the hon. member.
<P>
	An RCMP investigation is under way. Proceedings before the 
bankruptcy court are taking place. For any minister of the 
crown, including the Prime Minister, to take any other kind of 
action would be inappropriate.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that he wait for the appropriate 
time when all of the proceedings are concluded. Thereafter 
decisions will be made.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	During the appearance of Assistant Deputy Minister Comeau 
before the agriculture and agri-food committee last week, 
extensive reference was made to memos written by officials of 
agriculture Canada that left the impression the government 
might not be fully supportive of the supply management system.
<P>
	Could the minister clarify the issue and give his commitment 
to the government's support for supply management?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the documents 
referred to in the hon. member's question, I am advised that 
Madam Comeau was not the author of the documents being 
complained about. That material was prepared for the previous 
federal government, before October 1993, and not for this 
government.
<P>
	We have defended Canada's supply management system. If 
our Canadian supply management system is at some future date 
challenged by some legal means, by the United States or any 
others, Canadians may rest assured that we will continue our 
strong defence of supply management because we believe it is 
right as a matter of trade policy and trade law.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This brings to a conclusion the question period 
for today.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-331, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (taking a sample of a bodily substance).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
today to introduce this private member's bill, which deals with 
what is considered to be a gaping hole in the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	The bill I am introducing today would give the police the 
authority to require a suspect in a criminal investigation to 
provide a DNA sample.
<P>
	It is unfortunate today in Canada that a person suspected of 
drinking and driving could be forced to provide a breath sample, 
yet someone who is suspected of committing a murder or a rape 
cannot be forced to provide a DNA sample.
<P>
	The bill will allow the police to obtain a warrant from a justice 
of the peace requiring the person to provide a sample. Failure to 
provide the sample will result in a criminal prosecution of that 
particular individual, and the person's refusal to provide the 
sample can be used in court against the accused in the criminal 
proceedings.
<P>
	As I indicated, this bill will fill a gaping hole in the criminal 
justice system. DNA evidence is a powerful, reliable form of 
evidence, which can be used to solve hundreds of serious crimes 
in the country that are unsolved at present. Not only can it 
establish guilt, but it can also be used to establish innocence.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill, an act to provide for improved 
information on the cost of proposed government programs, is 
something that is long overdue in this place.
<P>
	Basically the bill would provide that any new programs 
introduced into the House are properly costed beforehand. That 
costing and the methodologies used therein would be supported 
by the auditor general. In other words, the auditor general would 
actually review the costing methods used and certify them as 
being appropriate. That legislation, wherever it is advertised 
and promoted, would also include certification by the auditor 
general and also the actual cost, not only of the total program but 
also on a per capita basis for all the taxpayers of Canada.

violent expression of that discrimination.

<B><A NAME="13376"> 13376 </A></B>
<P>
	The petitioners also note that the Canadian Charter of Rights

Government of Canada, discrimination based on sexual 
orientation; that the courts have ordered that we consider that 
the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination

in favour of equality for one and for all.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Vote 10, in the amount of $1,329,481,000 under Human Resources 
Development-Employment and Immigration-Employment and Insurance 
Program-Grants and contributions, in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 1996 (less the amount voted in Interim Supply), be concurred 
in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, while it is normal practice that I would 
remain after my remarks on the matter to hear the initial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13378"> 13378 </A></B>
<P>
presentation of the opposition, another meeting requires that I 
leave after I make my presentation and answer questions and 
comments.
<P>
	I will initially speak to the notice of opposition to Motion No. 
1 as placed by the hon. member for Mercier and will deal with 
the substance of the expenditure recommended in the main 
estimates on that item. Also in the course of my remarks I will 
get into some general comments about the estimates.
<P>
	We have 59 opposed motions with respect to the estimates 
today that we will have completed by ten o'clock this evening.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 1 which deals with vote 10 in the 
amount of approximately $1.3 billion for the Department of 
Human Resources Development, this specifically being for 
employment and insurance program grants and contributions, I 
would ask that this allocation be concurred in.
<P>
	Most members of the House will support the view that the 
employment and insurance program is one of the key elements 
in the federal government's social and economic development 
efforts. The program is comprised of three major activities: 
employment, unemployment insurance, and Canada 
employment centre management and joint services.
<P>
	In the fiscal year 1995-96 it will be a transition year for the 
program as the department completes the integration of various 
components that came together with the creation of the new 
department.
<P>
	The employment and insurance program develops and 
supports productive utilization of labour market resources in 
Canada while respecting the principles of equity in employment 
and ensuring the protection of public funds to promote the 
effective and efficient functioning of the Canadian labour 
market.
<P>
	The main goal of the employment activity is to provide 
Canada's social security system with the capability to help 
people get back to work and the dignity that work brings to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The activities and overall orientation have been redesigned to 
accommodate such tasks as increased focus on youth along with 
offers of increased planning and management responsibilities 
made to provinces and territories.
<P>
	The objective of the unemployment insurance activity is to 
promote economic growth and flexibility by providing 
temporary income support to unemployed workers who qualify 
for benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act without 
placing an unnecessary burden on individuals, on groups or on 
regions of the country.
<P>
	The vote affected by the motion before us is in the federal 
government's main vehicle for delivery of employment 
development services to Canadians who are out of work and not 
eligible for the unemployment insurance benefits of 
development youth initiatives.
<P>
	The federal government payments from this vote will be used 
to assist Atlantic fishermen. They will be used to assist youth, 
aboriginals and other Canadians seeking to improve their job 
readiness and to enhance their ability to secure steady and 
productive employment.
<P>
	Specifically the payments in the hands of the recipients are 
directed toward self-employment assistance, mobility 
assistance, job training and income support while awaiting 
training or not.
<P>
	Funding provided from the vote represents the federal 
government's commitment to its belief that it has a role in 
manpower training within Canada and its efforts to work closely 
with provinces and territories to eliminate overlap and 
duplication in the area of manpower training.
<P>
	I should like at this point to turn to some more general reasons 
as to why we should have the support of the House with respect 
to the main estimates for the current fiscal year, which I initially 
tabled in the House on February 28.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The main point I want to make is that Canadians want an 
efficient, responsible, and affordable government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 1995-96 main estimates help deliver just that by 
reinforcing the approach taken in the February budget to reduce 
spending and to reshape the role of the federal government.
<P>
	Canadians support the budget in part because it is aimed at 
refocusing government on the key priorities and key needs of 
Canadians. It is about getting government right.
<P>
	The estimates lay out planned spending department by 
department, program by program. They reflect tough choices on 
spending on programs the government has had to make to meet 
its fiscal targets, to get its fiscal house in order.
<P>
	The main estimates detail in 80 separate volumes $164.2 
billion in total planned budgetary expenditures for this fiscal 
year. This includes $116.2 billion under existing legislation and 
$48 billion in expenditures for which we are seeking 
parliamentary authority.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Why should we have members' approval for these 
expenditures? Because we have acted decisively to reduce the 
size of government as a result of the budget review process. 
Because we have rationalized the activities and programs we 
should deliver 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13379"> 13379 </A></B>
<P>
and those that should be delivered by other levels of government 
or perhaps by the private sector or through partnerships. 
Because we must deliver quality services to Canadians that they 
need and quality services that they can afford.
<P>
	Altogether, the estimates include $2.3 billion of the total $4.1 
billion in expenditure reductions announced in the budget. They 
could not reflect the impact of legislative proposals to cut 
spending. They must indicate the reality of legislation that 
exists at that particular point in time. Nor do they include all the 
revenues to come from new cost recovery initiatives. As they are 
fleshed out and as they are further developed then of course they 
will become part of the process.
<P>
	Nevertheless, they give a very good description of the 
government's expenditure plans and priorities. Canadians want 
affordable government. Canadians want us to deal with 
priorities. Canadians want us to provide efficient and effective 
programs.
<P>
	Program review looked at our program expenditures and our 
services. That process has helped us to bring the size of 
government down by almost 20 per cent over the next three year 
period.
<P>
	I would like to talk about how we carried out this review 
which was innovative and required a change in the approach by 
ministers and departments. I believe it has proven to this point to 
be very effective. We asked departments to review every one of 
their programs and activities and to check them against a series 
of tests. Members may have heard of the tests before but I think 
they bear repeating.
<P>
	Some of the questions were what is the department's key role? 
What are the services that must be provided to people to here and 
abroad? What must be done by the federal government that 
cannot be done better by another level of government or perhaps 
by the private sector? Of the services that should continue to be 
provided by the federal government, which ones are being 
carried out efficiently and which ones are affordable?
<P>
	As a result of program review and these various tests, we were 
able to collectively make the difficult decisions that were set out 
in the February budget. By 1997-98, in three years, 
departmental spending subject to the program review will 
decline by some 19 per cent relevant to the 1994-95 fiscal year.
<P>
	Looking at this from a departmental perspective, each 
department has had to pinpoint areas best served by the private 
sector or other levels of government. The departments have had 
to focus on their key responsibilities to decide what businesses 
they are in and what they can no longer afford to provide. They 
are examining how technology can make their operations more 
efficient. I believe that technology can be an enabler to help our 
public service in the provision of more effective services.
<P>
	We are moving away from direct subsidies to business and 
putting more emphasis on repayable contributions. Departments 
are moving ahead on ways to recover costs of certain 
government services from those who benefit most directly. They 
are also merging similar types of programs to create greater 
efficiency.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that we want to deliver effective and 
responsible government that Canadians can afford. The 
expenditure management system will help us to do that. The 
revamped system which I announced in February of this year 
will help departments manage within available resources. It 
requires them to review their programs and spending 
continuously and to reallocate resources to meet changing 
priorities, not further adding to the tax burden.
<P>
	The system we have put in place will help the government 
make responsible spending decisions by delivering the 
programs and services that Canadians need and that Canadians 
can afford. It also promotes a business planning approach that 
allows departments to focus on making changes to programs and 
lines of business to meet budget targets. It also provides 
flexibility to ministers and departments to help them manage 
within approved resources. The system will also help establish a 
more effective way of accounting for program results.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Performance measurements. It will do so by requiring the 
government to deliver better and more timely information on 
program performance to Parliament. We are making the system 
far more results oriented.
<P>
	This spring for the first time reports called ``Departmental 
Outlooks'' are providing parliamentary committees with 
information on the future year expenditure plans and priorities 
of departments. Very clearly this is bringing all members of 
Parliament into the process far beyond what has been the case up 
until this government took office.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This report provides committee members with the context for 
consideration of the Main Estimates.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As this is the first year for the outlooks, I am looking forward 
to seeing how the committees put the new information to use. 
My understanding is the reports are being well received by 
committee members and have been discussed as part of this 
year's review of the estimates.
<P>
	I am aware that at least one hon. member opposite has 
questioned why the dollar figures for the main estimates I tabled 
on February 28 are not identical to those announced by the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13380"> 13380 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of Finance in the February budget. I will he happy to 
explain that for the benefit of hon. members opposite.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the main estimates cannot incorporate 
any budget measures that require the legislative approval of the 
House. Likewise, the budget includes planned spending for 
which Parliament's authority will be sought later this year in 
supplementary estimates, once program details are fully 
developed and approved. Also, some budget decisions were 
made too late to be reflected in the estimates documents that had 
to go to press. Members will know that the estimates were filed 
the day after the budget was presented in the House.
<P>
	These are only three examples of the many technical reasons 
that the estimates and the budget figures differ, as they do every 
year. This is a normal situation because of the legislative 
restrictions.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that we have the internal 
controls under the authority of the Financial Administration Act 
needed to achieve the full savings announced in the budget. The 
information hon. members are seeking will be set out in the 
public accounts. This report and not the estimates is where 
members can expect to reconcile the planned expenditures laid 
out in the budget with actual departmental expenditures.
<P>
	Reducing the public service was not an objective of program 
review. It soon became clear however that changes of this scope 
would require reductions in the size of the federal workforce. As 
a result, we developed a program of options to help departments 
deal with the planned reductions and to help affected employees 
make a successful transition from the public sector. We intend to 
treat all of our employees fairly and reasonably.
<P>
	These options include the early retirement incentive and the 
early departure incentive programs. Our goal in introducing 
these and other transition measures, for example training and 
counselling measures, is to be fair to the taxpayer as well as to 
the affected federal employees. I believe that the programs we 
have put in place to carry out the downsizing have balanced 
these objectives.
<P>
	I am enthusiastic about the prospects of a smaller, more 
effective and more affordable government. I believe we can 
develop a government and a public service that will have a 
greater sense of satisfaction for employees, for the customers 
they serve and for the taxpayers that we all serve.
<P>
	I suggest that members of the House should support our 
request for full supply in the 1995-96 estimates because the 
estimates reflect strong decisive action that meets our fiscal 
targets. They prove our commitment to being fiscally 
responsible by providing quality services to Canadians that 
Canadians need and that Canadians can afford.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member's speech has given me further incentive to voice 
my objections to the vote in the amount of $1,329,481,000 under 
Employment Insurance Program, money that is part of the 
Human Resources Investment Fund, since the hon. member just 
said that these estimates were the result of a program review by 
the federal government and concluded that they represented the 
most effective use of these moneys for all Canadians.
<P>
	It would be appropriate to say at this point that, on all these 
policies for manpower and employment development, embodied 
in the estimates before the House today, in Quebec at least there 
is a consensus. The people of Quebec, through its 
representatives, wants these policies to be the responsibility of 
Quebec.
<P>
	When we held our hearings on social programs reform, we 
heard the Association des manufacturiers du Québec-this was 
in December 1994-say the following in its presentation: ``Such 
measures mainly involve vocational training programs, 
apprenticeship programs, direct job creation programs and work 
force adjustment programs''. The Association des 
manufacturiers du Québec made it clear that these proactive 
measures should be the responsibility of the provincial 
government, in their comments on patriating federal budgets for 
manpower development to Quebec.
<P>
	The labour unions were just as emphatic. They said that by 
initiating this debate on social programs reform, the government 
confirmed their apprehensions about the constitutional aspect, 
in other words, the present team in Ottawa was led by a 
consuming desire to make Canada a strongly centralized 
country. This objective, which was apparent throughout 
Minister Axworthy's Green Paper, was diametrically opposed to 
the reigning consensus in Quebec and, contrary to the designs of 
the federal government, members of the CEQ, the CSN and the 
FTQ firmly believed that only full and complete recovery by the 
Government of Quebec of control over all economic, social and 
cultural instruments would create an environment that was 
conducive to developing the full potential of Quebec society.
<P>
	After these comments by the Association des manufacturiers 
du Québec and the labour unions, I need hardly recall that this 
abiding desire to control manpower training and, even more so, 
job development and job readiness training, has been manifest 
throughout Quebec's history. When the minister tells us that 
these estimates are the best expression of the effectiveness of 
the decisions that Ottawa can make, I would like to say, with 
respect, that as far as Quebec is concerned, he is wrong.
<P>
	The G-7 summit, soon to convene in Halifax, confirms the 
apprehensions of Quebec about the central government's desire 
for further centralization.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, it seems to 
me that the hon. member is engaging in debate and this is 
actually the time for questions and comments. We are not all 
going to get a chance to question the President of the Treasury 
Board. Therefore, I ask that she limit her remarks to comments 
on his speech and a question.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not think the hon. member was in 
the House when I asked if there were any questions or 
comments. At that time nobody rose so we went to debate. The 
hon. member is now speaking on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I apologize if I missed that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague cannot give me back my momentum.
<P>
	The G-7 meeting in Halifax confirms our fear that the federal 
government intands to centralize further. The G-7, which 
includes the word's most industrialized nations, is concerned 
about education and job development. We understand this to be 
the current trend of centralized countries, and this is why we feel 
these votes must be controlled. The reason for our speaking out 
against the votes this afternoon is to say, in the only way this 
Parliament allows and on the budget, what we could not say 
during consideration of Bill C-76, which is that, as far as 
Quebec is concerned, at least, others may agree, the votes 
available should be transferred to Quebec as tax credits.
<P>
	Why? For greater efficiency. The Conseil du patronat and the 
labour congresses are saying what they are saying, simply 
because Quebecers are a distinct people and Quebec is a distinct 
society with its own approach to its development. Its labour 
market is also distinct. And in the case of this measure, the only 
way to ensure efficient use of the rare public funds available for 
employment training, skills development and job development, 
the various job readiness programs is for them to be integrated. 
The key word is ``integration''.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
was concerned about integration for Canada as a whole. I think 
integration is what they are after and I can understand why, for 
the rest of Canada, it would be considered efficient to run it out 
of Ottawa. I respect this decision, because it is historically 
based. I submit, however, that differences in labour markets will 
mean integration will have to take these differences into 
account. In the case of Quebec, however, efficiency dictates the 
integration of all programs.
<P>
	Last week's women's march evocatively known as the ``bread 
and roses'' march illustrated the need for integrated 
employment training policies. Why? The clientele of job 
development or job readiness program training are either 
welfare recipients or people who have  never had benefits of any 
sort-women who have been at home and have to join the labour 
force, young people and people receiving UI benefits. The 
clientele is varied and, with the unresolved jurisdiction 
problem, we feel the only solution is for Quebec to have full 
control, even though elsewhere in Canada Ottawa has full 
control.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The only way to be effective and to ensure this integration, to 
provide these people with the services that they need, whether 
they are welfare recipients or unemployment insurance 
beneficiaries or whether they never received any benefit, is to 
have an integrated system. As things now stand, however, that is 
impossible. Who is paying for this? The hon. members 
opposite? Us? No, ordinary Canadians, the people who have 
some needs.
<P>
	This is why we are saying that there is only one way, in this 
sector, to be efficient. As federalist Liberal ministers from 
Quebec have said, we must agree that the manpower 
development policy must be the responsibility of Quebec and 
that the necessary funds and tax points be transferred to Quebec.
<P>
	We are again faced with the problem of people who are falling 
through the cracks in the system, as we saw with the Carrefour 
Jeunesse-Emploi program. There were different types of 
clients, and the minister claimed that he had to put an end to the 
subsidy. This does not make any sense. Nor does it make any 
sense that we were not able to put forward an amendment to 
correct the situation, to have a debate and a vote on this issue. It 
makes no sense whatsoever that we should constantly have to 
plead, that we should be unable to control all the government 
funds to better serve the public.
<P>
	I must add that within this budget, money going to job 
stimulation and employability has been reduced. We can 
question the fact that the money that will help people to get back 
to work, if it is used as effectively as is claimed, has been 
reduced. We can question that.
<P>
	Yet, we can question even more that the money once taken 
from the consolidated revenue fund is, increasingly, being 
replaced by money taken from the unemployment insurance 
account. It is unacceptable to use the unemployment insurance 
account as a cash cow. It is important to point out that not all 
workers pay unemployment insurance premiums, but only those 
whose maximum earnings are $40,000. I will check the figure. 
Anyone who works extra hours does not pay more that the 
maximum contribution limit. Therefore, it is in the employer's 
interest to hire people to work long hours.
<P>
	Therefore, middle income and upper income workers are the 
ones who pay unemployment insurance premiums. Companies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13382"> 13382 </A></B>
<P>
with a lot of workers, those that have less equipment and use less 
technology than others and give work to more people also pay 
unemployment insurance premiums. Those companies that hire 
the most people pay the most in unemployment insurance  
premiums. So, it is the workers and the companies that pay for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Is it normal, and we mentioned that in the minority report we 
issued with the report of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, that workers and companies, through 
the unemployment insurance account, pay more for job 
stimulation, for employability? The government is drawing 
more and more on this account, and is withdrawing from 
contributions to the general fund. It means that workers and 
companies paying unemployment insurance premiums are 
doubly hit, doubly penalized.
<P>
	The whole of society is desperately in need of such 
jobs-while taxes collected by governments are ever 
increasing-since a more healthy economy increases the 
general level of wealth. In addition, it is not the government nor 
the taxpayers as a whole, but the workers themselves who pay 
for that.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The minister who, a while ago, made the important point that 
appropriations do not provide for everything mentioned in the 
budget, should perhaps answer the following question: When 
will appropriations and governmental spending reflect the 
additional $700 million in cuts to unemployment insurance?
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the government announced in the throne 
speech that an additional $700 million in cuts or 10 per cent of 
the total contributions, in cuts would be made to unemployment 
insurance as of July 1996, which means that the year after, 
additional cuts will amount to $1.5 billion. We fail to see where 
the $700 million will come from, in the appropriations. Highly 
arbitrary decisions will be made without due consideration. We 
are told that this is the way things are done, but this is not really 
the right way.
<P>
	The minister said earlier that the government had to make 
tough choices. In the case of employment development, which 
should be a key concern for a government that was elected on a 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'' platform, we see that, on the contrary, the 
amounts from general funding have been reduced.
<P>
	Yet, the new human resources investment fund, which is 
mentioned in the budget speech but does not appear in the 
estimates and which includes the appropriations I am referring 
to, has applications that come directly under provincial 
jurisdiction. According to a discussion paper distributed across 
Canada as part of the consultations on social program reform, 
the possibility of using the UI fund in a more flexible way in 
order to provide Canadians with better employment assistance 
will be considered.
<P>
	In my opinion, the government's intention with respect to this 
human resources investment fund is to use UI reform to fulfil 
that mandate. What does it say? ``Greater emphasis on 
employment development services''. ``Greater emphasis'' 
requires more money. ``For example, initial needs assessment, 
counselling services, literacy and basic skills training, 
on-the-job training and experience, child care services and 
income supplements''. Most of these functions currently come 
under provincial jurisdiction. It goes on to say, ``The Minister of 
Human Resources Development will define program parameters 
in the coming months''. It is that simple. The minister has full 
discretion.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The intention reflected in this appropriation, the budget and 
government action is that, far from being prepared to give back 
to Quebec what belonged to it in the first place, namely control 
over job development and manpower as a whole, the central 
government has set out to dip into the unemployment insurance 
fund to invest more money directly in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	In our view, this is unacceptable because it goes not only 
against the very essence of the distinctness, the uniqueness of 
Quebec as a people and a nation within Canada, but also against 
the most basic rules of efficiency, that the people of Quebec 
have been demanding in strong terms.
<P>
	Let me remind you that those who need this money, these 
programs the most include, and there may be more, the 342,000 
families on welfare and 320,000 jobless people in Quebec.
<P>
	The sad truth is that, on the contrary, and I want to emphasize 
this as strongly as possible, this appropriation which, according 
to the minister, was reviewed on the basis of efficiency reflects a 
stubborn and deliberate failure to recognize the basic needs of 
ordinary people. Such an attitude tells many Quebecers that 
there is no time to lose, the situation has become so urgent that 
we can no longer afford to come and plead in this place, year 
after year, for those who are in the greatest need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Mercier referred to the control of manpower training. She 
mentioned in her speech that she wants that control to be a 
provincial responsibility.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. Let us assume for a 
moment that the responsibility for manpower training is left to 
the provinces. Here, in the national capital region, over 30,000 
people come from Quebec to work in Ontario, and vice versa. 
We often see the need for national standards on training 
provided to employees. Would the hon. member agree to the 
development of national standards by all the provinces working 
together?
<P>
	Workers in Quebec could decide to work in Alberta, or vice 
versa, since they would all have received the same training. This 
would promote manpower mobility from  province to province. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13383"> 13383 </A></B>
<P>
Would the hon. member agree to the implementation of such 
standards?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, that suggestion is very different 
from what I said in my speech. Quebec wants to control its 
manpower policy. It will try to harmonize it when it is in the 
workers' interests to do so, and not just with the rest of Canada, 
but also with the United States. Many people who work in the 
U.S. for a while, and then come back home. The same situation 
exists in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We are discussing totally different issues. However, I will say 
that we would have a better chance of achieving efficiency 
if-and the other provinces will have to make their own decision 
in that regard-Quebec controlled manpower and employment 
development policies, as advocated by the manufacturers' 
association. It is for reasons of efficiency that we have to be in 
control. Quebecers cannot agree to any other formula without 
relinquishing their own identity. It may be that, in the rest of 
Canada, people do not mind letting the federal government 
impose standards, but it is just not possible in Quebec.
<P>
	The sooner Quebec assumes full control of that sector, the 
sooner we can have efficient and well-thought-out measures 
which will benefit the public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in listening to the hon. Bloc member's comments, 
reference was made to Quebec and also Canada.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that at this time Quebec still is very 
much a part of Canada. Quite frankly, after the referendum I am 
quite sure Quebec will be very much a part of Canada. I want 
Quebec to stay a part of Canada. They want Quebec to stay a part 
of Canada. I am sure she will be surprised by the vote.
<P>
	I do not agree with a lot of the comments made by the hon. 
member for the Bloc. I also do not agree with the way the Liberal 
Party proposes to operate the unemployment insurance fund and 
program.
<P>
	One reason why we have the conflict between Quebec and the 
federal government is manpower training and funds for job 
creation programs. If the unemployment insurance program had 
remained as it was intended, a pure insurance program to 
provide temporary assistance for workers temporarily between 
jobs, we would not have all this bickering over the funding for 
job creation programs coming out of the UIC fund. One way we 
will solve some of the problems is to return the UIC program to a 
pure insurance fund, giving employers and employees the 
opportunities to make decisions on how it is administered.
<P>
	Back when politicians had their fingers on the UIC program 
and decided to use it for job creation programs, historically 
government job creation programs have never, despite billions 
of dollars spent on them over the years, created real, long lasting 
jobs.
<P>
	The government has to get out of the job creation program and 
get business back into the job creation program. Real jobs come 
from private business, jobs that last and that pay well. They do 
not come from government programs that end when the money 
has run out.
<P>
	When the Liberal Party adopts this attitude, when the Bloc 
members from Quebec, part of Canada, adopt this attitude, 
maybe we will get the economy going again and there will be 
jobs and we will not have to worry about income supplements 
and money for job creation programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, dear colleague, first I would like 
to say that the Bloc Quebecois has been asking again and again 
in this House for a reduction in the rate for unemployment 
insurance premiums. I would also like to say that our minority 
report suggested that initiatives other than the unemployment 
insurance program should not be paid for with the 
unemployment insurance funds. We have been asking that 
employers and workers be given greater control over these 
funds.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I must say, however, that we believe a number of measures, 
not all of them but some of them, will effectively help men and 
women who are temporarily out of work to find a job, by 
becoming more efficient or by developing new abilities. But we 
know, and have been saying so repeatedly, that job creation is of 
the utmost importance.
<P>
	Having been a history teacher greatly interested in economic 
and social history, I would like to remind the hon. member that, 
even if at times there were no standards or regulations or 
unemployment insurance in the past, it does not mean that there 
was no unemployment, quite the contrary.
<P>
	Also, there were periods when there were regulations and 
standards and when unemployment was lower. I will also remind 
the House, by the way, and I will conclude with this, that when 
the President of the United States tried to rally everybody during 
the Great Depression, he proposed standards, regulations, and 
salary increases for workers. Thanks to these measures and to 
the war, of course, there was an economic recovery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
debate the main estimates of the government. Later on we will 
vote on the main estimates. I doubt very much we will see any 
changes in the main estimates and therefore one has to wonder 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13384"> 13384 </A></B>
<P>
what on earth we are trying to accomplish by a debate such as 
this when the  government stonewalled at every opportunity to 
decrease the estimates by even one dollar.
<P>
	The House will be asked later on today to vote on over $48 
billion of spending, which has been reduced by the interim 
supply passed in April. This represents the new spending 
requested by the government. The $48 billion is in addition to 
the $116.2 billion in statutory spending already authorized by 
previous acts of Parliament. That brings the total spending to 
$164.2 billion. I always thought we were in an era of deficit 
reduction, spending reduction, and yet it continues to increase.
<P>
	In the past the House simply rubber stamped requests for 
spending by the government. I think in this day and age when we 
should have deficit reduction, we should have spending 
reduction, when it is paramount that we insist we get value for 
every dollar spent by the government, we should take the 
estimate process seriously.
<P>
	Not since the 1972-1974 Parliament have we seen any cuts in 
spending. During the last 21 years governments have 
completely and absolutely stonewalled any opportunity by the 
opposition to reduce spending. That is why the spending was out 
of control over the last number of years.
<P>
	In 1972 there were two reductions allowed, one for $19,000 
from a grant and $1,000 from the president of the CBC's salary 
because there was a problem with the president at that point. 
One millionth of 1 per cent reduction was allowed.
<P>
	Today as we debate the spending of $164.2 billion in 
expenditures surely in the House and in committees, which have 
spent many hours this year debating the estimates, examining 
the estimates, we would have found some reasonable reductions. 
We feel we have.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	These motions have been put on the floor. We will find out 
whether this government is prepared to listen to this House and 
the Canadians who pay these taxes. We will see if the 
government is prepared to make some adjustments. I have my 
doubts and I have my reservations. However, we must wait and 
see.
<P>
	I think it is time the government allowed Parliament to do its 
job to examine, make recommendations and approve the 
spending not rubber stamp, approve. Check it out, call the 
witnesses, listen to the justifications, find out if it is reasonable. 
That is all we are asking.
<P>
	We are asked to approve. Therefore we should be entitled to 
have that type of insight into the estimates. Once we have that, if 
we find out there is room for reduction then surely it would be 
the honourable thing for this government to listen to the 
recommendations of these committees and approve the 
reductions.
<P>
	The committees are all deemed to have reported to this House. 
They have agreed in many instances that the reductions put forth 
are reasonable, rational, and quite appropriate. What have they 
done? They defeated the motions. This government again is 
stonewalling and saying they will not tolerate any reduction in 
the estimates. It is a farce that has to change.
<P>
	It is time the government stopped hiding behind this excuse of 
confidence. We look at history and see that it has been 
recommended that this confidence be weakened and reduced. 
There is the McGrath report of 1985, the public accounts 
committee of 1988, and the House management committee of 
1993. Take a look at what they have said over the years.
<P>
	Remember the rules of the House are largely based on the 
Parliament in London, England. The McGrath report said that 
from 1972 to 1979 there were 65 defeats of government 
measures in the British House, and this was not the end of 
responsible government. The government did not cease to 
govern. It was simply forced to modify or abandon some of its 
policies in deference to the House. That is all we are asking here. 
Surely that is not too much to ask. The British Parliament has 
recognized that. When the House speaks and requests a 
reduction in the expenditures, surely this House, which draws 
upon the rules and the experience of the House in London, 
should defer to the wishes of the people who sit here and 
recognize some reductions.
<P>
	Recent British experience makes it clear that at present, 
losing a vote, even on a financial measure, is not automatically a 
matter of non-confidence entailing either the resignation of the 
government or the dissolution of the Commons. Remember this 
is from the contents of the McGrath report that was tabled in this 
House in June 1985. I am talking about the Canadian perception 
of what is happening in London, England. I am not just drawing 
upon their experience specifically.
<P>
	A minority government of Pierre Trudeau lost 8 of the 81 
recorded votes between 1972 and 1974. Setting aside the vote of 
May 8, 1974, which brought down the government, four of the 
lost votes were on government bills, two were on motions 
pertaining to parliamentary committees, and one was on a 
supply item, specifically on a supplementary estimate of 
$19,000 for Information Canada.
<P>
	That is exactly what we are debating today, reductions in 
supply. In 1974 that reduction in supply was approved and the 
government did not fall. Yet today the government argues that 
confidence prevents them from reducing the estimates. We have 
them speaking out of both sides of their mouths. It was a Liberal 
government back then that accepted a reduction in supply.
<P>
	The Liberal government today has promised open, 
transparent, competent leadership and a balanced budget some 
time down the road, with a reduction in the deficit to $25 billion 
in the first three years. That government sits here today and 
refuses to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13385"> 13385 </A></B>
<P>
accept even one dollar's  worth of reduction, even though the 
Liberal precedent recognizes that it can be done.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The minority government of Lester Pearson lost three votes, 
again another Liberal government. Two were on appeals on 
rulings made by the Speaker. The third came on February 19, 
1968, and ended with the defeat at third reading of Bill C-193, 
respecting income tax. This vote was regarded sufficiently 
serious to require the government to introduce a motion to the 
effect that the House did not consider its vote of February 19 as a 
vote of non-confidence in the government. This motion was 
passed, after debate, on February 28.
<P>
	When the government loses an important vote, as it did on that 
vote in 1968, the government does not fall. It went on to 
introduce a motion of non-confidence and the government 
survived that vote. That is exactly what the Reform Party 
proposes as part of opening up the democratic process so that we 
can have freer and more open votes in the House and we can 
speak and demonstrate the will of the Canadian people.
<P>
	If perchance we defeat a motion being proposed by the 
government, then we do not suggest that the government fall but 
that it be followed by a vote of non-confidence. If the 
government survives that vote, then the government shall 
remain in power. It is fairly simple, fairly clear and it allows this 
House to do its job.
<P>
	Instead we make a mockery of democracy. We sit here in 
committee, we sit here in opposition, and we put forth motions. 
We debate them in committee and we hear from the government 
side that these are appropriate, they are reasonable, they are 
rational, they are legitimate. What happens? The answer is no.
<P>
	The time has come to change. These are the types of things the 
Reform Party, as a matter of principle, speaking for Canadians, 
says. We hear what Canadians are saying. The government side 
is not prepared to listen. It stays with the old story of 
stonewalling all the way and saying that it is a matter of 
confidence when they find that its members agree with us that 
there are reductions available. Yet nothing is done.
<P>
	We will see this evening if the government is brave enough to 
allow Parliament to do its job or if it will hide behind some 
outdated notion of confidence.
<P>
	Before us at this time we have a motion prompted by the 
member for Mercier. It is to eliminate the funding for vote 10 in 
the human resources department, which is the grants and 
contributions under the employment and insurance program.
<P>
	The largest single grant in vote 10 is for $1,049,905,000. That 
is for payments to facilitate the efficient functioning of the 
Canadian labour market. It is kind of fuzzy, but there it is. To be 
more specific, over $1 billion is being spent on payments to 
provinces, territories, municipalities, and other public bodies, 
organizations, groups, communities, employers, and  
individuals-nobody is left out-for the provision of training 
and/or work experience, the mobilization of community 
resources and human resource planning and adjustment 
measures necessary for the efficient functioning of the Canadian 
labour market.
<P>
	It is very specific. Nothing was left out. This is a very 
ambiguous justification for $1 billion on that: broadly based, 
nobody is excluded, let us spend a billion dollars; anybody can 
come up with a program; let us approve it. When we talk about 
trying to create work, create jobs, get people back to work and 
we are going to spend $1 billion in this fuzzy and unclear way, 
then surely it is time that we expressed an opinion, that this 
government listen to it, that we work together in harmony to 
achieve some real reductions in spending and go on to balance 
our budget.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	In part III of the estimates for Human Resources Development 
Canada we find that it says ``support for the program review 
exercise by contributing to the deficit reduction and continued 
negotiations'', and so on. That statement goes on to say that the 
focus is to reduce expenditures. Yet we find out that they are 
actually going up. These types of things we have called into 
question.
<P>
	If the government truly wants to contribute to deficit 
reduction then it should begin by making some serious 
reductions in its spending, cuts in the range of 25 per cent to the 
grants and contributions. Overall, the human resources 
development that this vote pertains to has spending increases 
this year from $32.827 billion to $33.547 billion, and that is on 
top of the statutory spending, which we will not even be voting 
on today. Vote 10 has increased from $1.281 billion to $1.321 
billion.
<P>
	Also in part III, on page 258, we take a look at the 
government's real efforts to manage the department and reduce 
expenditures. On the personnel requirements, when we went 
through it comparing the actuals from 1993, just before the 
government took office, to its estimates today for 1995-96, 
personnel requirements have changed by the massive number of 
just under 80. The government reduced it from 19,479 to 19,392 
people, a reduction of 87 people.
<P>
	This is where the government is trying to say it will balance 
the budget in a very short period of time and it will give value for 
money to Canadians.
<P>
	We take a look at the personnel requirements and we see that it 
has taken from the lower salary scales. It has taken 44 people out 
of clerical and regulatory, where the average salary is $27,000. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13386"> 13386 </A></B>
<P>
It has taken 45 people out of program administration, where the 
average salary is $41,000. Yet when we move up into the area of 
economic, sociology, and statistics, where the average salary is 
over $57,000, we see an increase in numbers. When we take a 
look at the executive category, where the average salary is 
$79,000, again we see an increase in numbers.
<P>
	These are the types of things we questioned in committee. Yet 
what did we find? Stonewall. It cannot be changed. Why? I do 
not know why. I ask the government why.
<P>
	When we take a look at page 258, on goods and services, again 
we find that comparing the actual 1993-94, where the spending 
was $264.097 million, it has gone up to $319.997 million, an 
increase of about $55 million. We ask why. We get the answer 
from the witnesses and the senior bureaucrats who have come 
before our committee. We make recommendations. Is this 
justified? Can that be justified? Is there a good reason for these 
increases? When we find there is not and we make the 
recommendations for the cuts, what do we find? They stonewall.
<P>
	That is why we feel a mockery is made out of the estimates 
process. That is why this Liberal government, with its 
commitments to good government, transparency, responsibility, 
open government, and a clear way to manage this country, has 
fallen far short of its responsibilities. Its broken promises litter 
the floor with the way it has taken every promise in the red book, 
ignored them, and passed them over in favour of what the 
government would consider pragmatic government.
<P>
	We are looking for responsible government. We are looking 
for principled government where the government lives up to 
what it promises. That surely is not too much to ask. That is why 
we are saying confidence on the estimates must go. If the 
government feels threatened by a defeat on any particular 
motion then let it be followed by a motion of non-confidence. If 
it survives that non-confidence, then there is no threat.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	If we could introduce that as a matter of policy then the 
opposition and the government could work together to ensure 
that the Canadian taxpayer gets value for money on the $165 
billion that we spend on their behalf. This is what we are asking 
for and it is what Canadians expect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was somewhat 
surprised to hear the hon. member attacking the public service 
of Canada when we know we have one of the finest public 
services in the world. I do not think taking a cheap shot at them 
was really called for in terms of what they are contributing or 
what they earn.
<P>
	I will quickly move on to make the point that this government 
did something that was unprecedented when it opened up the 
process. It is the first time in the history of this country that a 
government has done a preconsultation on the budget.
<P>
	I was elected on a set of promises that my party made during 
the last election. When I run I run as a member of the Liberal 
Party. To that extent, my responsibility is to vote with the party 
at least on the issues my party ran on during the election. For me 
to do otherwise is unfair.
<P>
	At the same time, I have mixed feelings about having this 
open for every member of Parliament to vote the way he or she 
likes. If we are going to do that, then the government no matter 
which party it is in the future, will have to spend the vast 
majority of its time lobbying individual members of Parliament 
so they will vote for it. The reality is that the responsibility of a 
government is to carry through on what it promises the people 
during an election period.
<P>
	How many times has the hon. member stood and voted against 
his party? During this past one and a half years we have seen the 
Reform Party day in and day out voting as a block. I am not 
saying that is wrong, but how often has the hon. member voted 
independently?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I did not take any cheap 
shots at the civil service. I just mentioned the pay scales. I 
pointed out that the government seemed to be protecting those at 
the top while cutting those at the bottom which I do not think is 
fair.
<P>
	I want to respond to the hon. member's main point where he 
said that he felt his job as a member of Parliament was to stand 
by the platform on which he was elected. On page 20 of the red 
book, the Liberals promised to reduce the professional and 
special services budget of the government by 15 per cent. He 
may read this on page 20 of the red book if he has not read it 
already. I presume he has not since he is standing here today 
saying he stands by the policies he ran on at election time.
<P>
	The professional and special services budget has increased by 
$136 million. If the member is going to say that he stands by the 
platform on which he was elected, he will vote against the 
motion that approves this $136 million because two seconds ago 
he said it was the platform by which he sits on that side of the 
House.
<P>
	The whole thing we are trying to point out is that Liberal 
broken promises are littered all over the floor. This is another 
one which was just repeated by the member over there.
<P>
	My final point is that on several occasions members of the 
Reform Party have voted against the block of the Reform Party 
which totally defeats the point he made earlier on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Without any disciplinary measures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13387"> 13387 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Without any disciplinary action whatsoever.
<P>
	Today, a longstanding member of the Liberal Party, a former 
member of the cabinet, has been turfed out of the chairmanship 
of the justice committee because yesterday he voted against the 
government. We have seen they will not tolerate it on that side of 
the House which is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was interested in what the hon. member for the 
Reform Party had to say about a particular issue. Why is it 
impossible to change things? I think the human resources 
investment fund is a good example.
<P>
	I think the federal government, probably because of the power 
of the bureaucrats and also the impression that Ottawa can solve 
all Canada's problems for Canadians across the country and that 
it knows all the answers, this attitude, in the case of the human 
resources investment fund, means that the federal government 
will go on spending vast amounts of money but in addition, as in 
this particular case, it will be other people's money, because the 
money in the Unemployment Insurance Fund is provided by 
employers and employees. There is no government money in 
that fund. The federal government uses the fund to intervene in 
areas under provincial jurisdiction, especially education and 
manpower training. So when a member of this House wonders 
why change is impossible, one reason is that the federal 
government refuses to respect these jurisdictions and thus 
control its spending.
<P>
	Now I realize that the Reform Party says we are separatists 
and do not want to go on being part of Canada, but even from a 
federalist perspective, would the hon. member not agree that in 
the case of the human resources investment fund, the 
government is committing fraud? Because if the money paid 
into the fund by employers and employees were not used in the 
human resources investment fund, do you know what we could 
do? We could gradually reduce employee and employer 
premiums so that the money, instead of getting lost in 
bureaucratic channels would go directly into the economy to 
create the jobs this society so badly needs and the present 
government has failed to create. What does the member for the 
Reform Party think of this approach?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the member's 
question, of course the federal government can spend money as 
it sees fit.
<P>
	As a member of the opposition side, when I look at my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois on my right, yes they are 
separatists. As far as I am aware, they always will be as long as 
they call themselves the Bloc Quebecois and are committed to 
the breakup of the country.
<P>
	The point Bloc members have been trying to make is that they 
want control over the money. It makes absolutely no sense 
whatsoever for anybody to think that the panacea of the breakup 
of the country is going to create jobs. It will do the exact 
opposite.
<P>
	Separation of the country will cause unemployment to rise. If 
Bloc members were interested in helping the people who elected 
them to this place, they would be working to create employment, 
to reduce uncertainty, to create an economic climate where 
people could get work.
<P>
	When I talk to people in the province of Quebec they seem to 
be the same as the people I talk to in the province of Alberta. 
They are concerned about mortgages, houses, careers, their kids 
and their future. Nobody I talked to was concerned about 
separation, other than the detrimental effects it will have on 
their futures. There may be a future of high taxation and low 
opportunity created through the concept the Bloc is trying to 
achieve.
<P>
	Now we see that Bloc members have become totally 
unprincipled in the fact that they have watered down their 
separation message by saying: ``Please vote for us. We want to 
separate if we can get some kind of economic association with 
Canada''. I suggest that they put their shoulders to the wheel and 
join with all Canadians in recognizing that we have a 
responsibility to all Canadians from coast to coast to provide 
them with a future, secure housing, education and to provide 
them with the things they want. I can assure the member, 
separation is not one of them.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the matter of full supply of the estimates for 
fiscal year 1995-96. This year the main estimates total $164.2 
billion of which the government is seeking parliamentary 
approval for $48 billion and new spending authority. The 
balance of $116.2 billion represents statutory payments which 
have already received parliamentary approval.
<P>
	The main estimates incorporate $2.3 billion worth of the $3.4 
billion of 1995-96 expenditure reduction measures achieved 
through the government's program review. The comprehensive 
review was undertaken last fall to identify the federal 
government's core roles and responsibilities and to reallocate 
resources to priority areas in order to provide effective 
affordable government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This program review was much more extensive than any 
previous across-the-board expenditure reduction initiative; 
every department was reviewed. As a result, all sorts of 
spending 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13388"> 13388 </A></B>
<P>
cuts and resources adjustments were decided, as evidenced by 
Mr. Martin's budget for 1995.
<P>
	It all goes to show that the government is committed to cutting 
expenditures, streamlining operations and making drastic 
changes in terms of program availability and delivery. In a word, 
we are determined to redesign the federal administration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Beyond the program review savings, measures already 
included in the main estimates are cost recovery measures which 
will generate new non-tax revenues, initiatives which require 
prior legislative approval, and other changes announced in the 
1995 budget which simply were not finalized on time for 
inclusion in these estimates. In the latter cases the savings will 
be achieved through the lapsing of appropriated funds.
<P>
	Let me give some examples of the types of changes resulting 
from the program review exercise. Government departments 
will focus on their core responsibilities. Federal and provincial 
overlap will be reduced, which is something a number of people 
have been asking for. Technological improvements will create 
efficiency gains. Costs of services will be recovered by new or 
increased fees charged to those who directly benefit from the 
services. Where feasible, similar programs will be merged to 
improve efficiency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By concentrating our efforts in key areas of responsibility and 
improving program delivery patterns, we will be able to carry 
out the most significant downsizing of the federal public service 
since World War II.
<P>
	If and when all the decisions made following the program 
review are implemented, the public service workforce could be 
reduced by as many as 45,000 positions over the next three 
years.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board has prepared a set of 
options to ease the transition for affected employees as part of a 
program that is fair both to the people involved and to Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bottom line is that these main estimates are $3.5 billion 
higher than those for 1994-95. However, as I just explained, 
some of the increase is actually overstated due to the program 
review savings not yet incorporated into these figures. Even so, 
at first glance any increase seems inconsistent with our major 
expenditure reduction efforts.
<P>
	It must be noted though that the bottom line change is 
principally the result of an $8.5 billion increase in public debt 
charges, to $49.5 billion. The rising interest and servicing costs 
on the debt more than outweigh the significant savings achieved 
through the program review and previous expenditure reduction 
measures. This underscores our acknowledged need to live 
within our means and the need for continuing deficit reduction 
aimed at moving us in the direction of declining debt charges.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Program spending excluding public debt charges is $114.4 
billion or $7 billion less than the 1994-95 estimates level. This 
is an important figure. By 1996-97 the impact of the program 
review savings will result in a decrease of 10.8 per cent relative 
to the 1994-95 level. By 1997-98 that decrease will amount to 
an impressive 19 per cent reduction in program spending.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Public debt charges come under statutory spending, that is to 
say expenditures already approved by Parliament. Statutory 
spending for fiscal year 1995-96 amounts to $166.2 billion, or 
approximately 71 per cent of the main estimates. This is a $4 
billion increase over the 1994-95 main estimates. Besides 
public debt charges, statutory spending also includes the main 
transfer payments to Canadians for old age security, the 
guaranteed income supplement, spouse's allowance and 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, statutory spending includes federal transfers to 
the provinces under the fiscal equalization program, the Canada 
assistance program and established programs financing, 
providing assistance to Canadians for health care, 
post-secondary education and social assistance.
<P>
	Established programs financing assistance to the provinces 
and territories takes two forms: cash transfers of about $9.1 
billion form part of these main estimates. Beyond that amount a 
further $12.6 billion worth of tax transfers do not appear in the 
main estimates.
<P>
	The total consolidated budgetary main estimates, both 
statutory and voted, of $164.2 billion can be categorized into 11 
sectors. Of these, spending in three sectors comprise over 76 per 
cent of the total estimates: social programs excluding the 
federal contribution to provincial and territorial social spending 
account for 30.6 per cent, public debt charges amount to 30.2 per 
cent, fiscal arrangements with the provinces and territories 
represent a further 16 per cent of the total. The balance or about 
24 per cent is spread between defence, general government 
services, natural resource based programs, foreign affairs and 
international assistance, industrial, regional and scientific 
technological support, justice and legal programs, heritage and 
culture and the transportation sector.
<P>
	Social programs comprise the largest area of federal spending 
at $50.2 billion in 1995-96. This does not include an additional 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13389"> 13389 </A></B>
<P>
$16.4 billion in major cash transfers to the provinces and 
territories for social purposes.
<P>
	The objectives of the social programs are to promote the 
health and well-being of Canadians and to foster equality of 
access by all Canadians to the benefit of Canadian society. 
Benefits and services are directed at those most in need through 
a broad range of assistance programs. These encompass 
employment, health, housing and other initiatives which benefit 
aboriginal peoples, veterans, senior citizens, children, 
immigrants and the unemployed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Generally speaking, the program review helped strengthen 
the primary mandate of the departments responsible for social 
programs, including Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Health, Human Resources Development, Citizenship and 
Immigration, as well as Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	Reducing spending in priority social programs, a large 
number of which are closely related to the population increase, 
is a particularly difficult challenge.
<P>
	These departments will have to pay greater attention to the 
streamlining of their operations, in order to function with 
reduced resources. This means that, more than ever before, 
social benefits and services will have to be provided to those 
Canadians who need them the most.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A larger proportion of the costs related to these benefits and 
services will also be recovered from users who benefit directly 
from them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Similar approaches are reflected in all program expenditure 
sectors within these estimates. For example, natural resource 
based programs in the 1995 main estimates are $463 million 
lower than in 1994-95. The departments of agriculture, 
environment, fisheries and oceans and natural resources have 
redefined their core mandates in areas of expertise. More 
emphasis will be placed on the strategic use of public funds to 
promote sustainable development, enhance Canadian 
competitiveness and rationalize and recover costs.
<P>
	The transportation sector estimates show a $329 million 
decrease, as Transport Canada moves from direct involvement 
in transportation operations to focus on its core roles of 
developing policy and legislation, and setting and enforcing 
safety and security standards. Reduced subsidies paid by or to 
the transportation crown corporations and agencies also lead to 
significant expenditure reduction in this sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The streamlining of our operations, combined with the greater 
efficiency achieved through technology, has resulted in savings 
of $209 million in general government services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The main estimates also mark the implementation of a new 
expenditure manager system, one which reflects the 
government's commitment to funding new requirements by 
reallocating existing resources. The system will necessitate an 
ongoing evaluation of priorities, both within departments and 
government wide, and will lead to more informed spending 
decisions. Centrally funded policy reserves to support new 
initiatives have been eliminated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The operating reserve managed by Treasury Board has 
significantly diminished, and its role has also changed. 
Traditionally, the reserve was used as an emergency fund to 
cover additional expenditures related to existing programs. 
Under the new expenditure management system, the operating 
reserve will, in most cases, fulfill the role of a banking 
institution.
<P>
	Its main responsibility will be to provide additional financing 
for projects which have a significant impact in terms of 
productivity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Departmental business plans will focus on strategic changes 
to programs and lines of business while the related outlook 
documents, a new initiative, will enhance parliamentary review 
of estimates and future year expenditures with emphasis on 
performance.
<P>
	It is recognized that effective management within a fixed 
level of resources presents a challenge to ministers and 
departments. In that context, treasury board is examining ways 
to enhance managerial flexibility and to support reallocation 
efforts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The 1995-96 main estimates, along with the related 
initiatives which I described today, clearly show that the 
government has taken a new direction as regards expenditure 
management.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians have responded favourably to the changes put 
forward in the budget. They recognize that tough choices had to 
be made, that real change is necessary in order to implement the 
jobs and growth agenda and to get the country back on track. 
This year's estimates confirm that those changes have begun.
<P>
	As I listen to the comments that have been made concerning 
the government's budget and the ensuring activity, I hear mostly 
favourable comments directed at the government. The Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13390"> 13390 </A></B>
<P>
people recognize it is easy to cut. But at the end of each cut is a 
victim, someone who is going to suffer as a result of the 
decision.
<P>
	Surely the government must be doing things right. The 
official opposition suggests that we should not cut, we should be 
spending more. The third party suggests that we should have cut 
even more dramatically, recognizing fully that a lot of people 
have suffered as a result of budgetary decisions.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians understand you must go at this kind of exercise 
gradually. They want this kind of government. They do not want 
their co-citizens to suffer unduly.
<P>
	If anyone is going to be fair minded about the budget and the 
ensuing activity, he or she will need to acknowledge that the 
government has taken an important first step at addressing the 
question of the deficit and the debt, at creating long term, well 
remunerated employment for Canadians and at addressing the 
whole issue of social programs that Canadians want for those 
who need them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I indicated, the government has taken a very important 
first step.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we listened to the hon. member articulate in his 
presentation numerous statistics, figures, rationale, 
justification for the Liberal Party's budget, a budget that fails 
miserably in meeting what this country needs.
<P>
	The average Canadian trying to support a family is interested 
in only one thing. When on earth will there be some tax relief? 
The Liberals presented a budget that is to add another $100 
billion to the debt. It is to add another $10 billion in interest paid 
on the debt. At the end of three years, according to their figures 
which are not exactly believable they will still end up with a $25 
billion deficit.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me how he explains to a 
pulp mill worker in Prince George, B.C. who is paying in excess 
of 60 per cent of his gross income in taxes of all forms, how a 
budget like this, a budget that is to increase the debt, that is to 
increase the interest on the debt that must be paid out of taxes, 
can expect in the near future to have more disposable income in 
his pocket so that he can provide for his family.
<P>
	Also, I would like the hon. member to explain to me and to the 
corporations and private business in Canada how the Liberal 
government appreciates the role they play when in the budget it 
increases corporate taxes. They are the ones who create real, 
long lasting, good paying jobs. How is he to explain to them that 
the Liberal government is on their side and that their 
government wants them to provide more jobs, expand and invest 
in the country when there is no certainty whatsoever in the 
taxation levels that corporate Canada is to pay?
<P>
	At the same time that the hon. member is rationalizing all the 
plans of the Liberal budget, how will he explain to Canadians the 
1.5 cent a litre gasoline tax that affects everyone in the country 
whether they are private citizens or corporations that rely on the 
transfer of freight or vehicles running, flying in the air, taking 
trains? How will he explain that the government had to raise 
gasoline and fuel taxes by 1.5 cents a litre?
<P>
	The average citizen is interested in only one thing. When will 
my taxes be brought down? When will overspending in the 
annual budget stop? The figures that the member just quoted 
might be for our benefit because we have access to all the details 
in the budget but the average Canadian citizen is not blessed 
with having all the details.
<P>
	They are asking only the one question. I would like the hon. 
member to tell me how he is going to answer the average 
Canadian taxpaying citizen.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a number of questions 
and I will attempt to answer them all.
<P>
	It is true taxes are quite high. It is also true that in the 
foreseeable future as a result of a debt that was more than 
doubled by the previous government, a debt we will have to 
continue.
<P>
	Let us look at figures. When the previous government came 
into power the debt was roughly $179 billion. That is the figure 
from the auditor general. When this government came into 
power it was almost three times as much. Let us put it in 
perspective.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons the Reform Party will never get 
anywhere. It does not understand the big picture. It exaggerates. 
I am surprised that my colleague did not mention we are now 
spending $7 billion less than in the 1994-95 estimates. I am 
surprised my colleague did not mention that as a result of the 
program review, a rational review to make sure government was 
doing what it ought to be doing, we have saved $3.4 billion.
<P>
	How I wish I had more time. I have a series of quotes, because 
I had anticipated the question from one of my Reform 
colleagues, applauding the Liberal budget, recognizing nothing 
is perfect. I have other quotes and I tried to find one positive one 
about the Reform budget in which the figures did not add up.I 
could not find one positive quote.
<P>
	I find it very difficult to have a member of the Reform Party 
telling us we do not have it right when the majority of Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13391"> 13391 </A></B>
<P>
think we are doing it right. It does not mean it cannot be 
improved but we have started in the right direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a brief 
question, one that needs to be answered very honestly.
<P>
	He said the total budgetary requirement for the government is 
some $164 billion this year, an increase of $2 billion over last 
year. We need to commend the government for spending less 
than it could have, possibly less than governments of previous 
years would have spent. However, while we are experiencing all 
the cuts in the estimates we are debating today, we are spending 
more because of our huge interest payments. Those interest 
payments are growing every year because we are still 
borrowing.
<P>
	I ask the member whether he acknowledges at all and if so to 
what degree that there is urgency in balancing the budget so 
hopefully we do not totally go down the tube. As has already 
been mentioned, the three year budgetary plan of the 
government adds $100 billion to the present $550 billion debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my enthusiasm in responding 
to the previous questioner I made a reference to the debt being 
$179 million and it should have been $179 billion. I apologize if 
that slipped out the wrong way. I do know the difference. There 
are 1,000 millions in a billion. I know my colleague will be 
happy to know that.
<P>
	With regard to his question, it is a very serious problem. That 
is why we have reduced as much as we have. We recognize more 
could have been done but we also recognize that if we do it too 
dramatically we can destabilize society.
<P>
	What is important is we made a commitment in our red book 
before the election and during the election that we would reach a 
3 per cent of GDP target and we will do that. Once we have done 
that we will start attacking the debt. It is accumulating. We wish 
we could wish it away. There are no panaceas here. There are no 
magical solutions. There are no simple answers. That is what is 
sometimes offensive.
<P>
	There is a suggestion that we could sort of wish it away. It 
cannot be wished away. It will take planning. It will take hard 
work. It will take the decisions that have been made, continuing 
in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I fail to see a 
quorum in the House. I am wondering whether it is because 
Liberal members are not interested in this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask the clerk to count the 
members present.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<I>And there being fewer than 20 members present:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am told by the Table there is not a 
quorum. Call in the members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the bells having stopped</I>:
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there is now a quorum, we 
resume debate. The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to discuss the motion on 
Vote 10, dealing with human resources development, and also 
ask the Minister of Human Resources Development to reflect on 
a consequence of the current budget, namely the major 
restrictions imposed to the Canada employment centres.
<P>
	Let us do a bit of history. For several years now, there have 
been two manpower networks in Quebec: one managed by the 
provincial government, and the other by the federal government. 
The Quebec government already has jurisdiction over all the 
issues related to the labour market, including the Labour Code, 
the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Labour Standards 
Act and the Collective Agreement Decrees Act.
<P>
	As well, the federal government developed a network which 
was originally designed to maintain UI services and related 
programs.
<P>
	Over the years, we realized that we did not have the means to 
afford two networks, and that we had to find a way to integrate 
them. In Quebec, a consensus was reached by all the 
stakeholders. The consensus was such that even the Quebec 
Liberal Party, a federalist party which was in office for several 
years, asked for an administrative agreement under which 
Quebec would manage the UI program over its territory.
<P>
	That Liberal government created an organization called the 
Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre, which had the 
necessary structures, powers and programs to provide all the 
services related to manpower.
<P>
	This year, given the budget constraints, the federal 
government had the option of saying: Yes, we will let the 
Quebec government assume full responsibility for manpower; 
this will allow us to make significant savings.
<P>
	However, this is not the option chosen by the Department of 
Human Resources Development. Instead, it chose to reduce the 
number of its employees in the Canada employment centres 
across the country, so as to spread the cuts and make the process 
look like a reform or an administrative reorganization which 
will result in the creation of Canadian human resources centres. 
Some 20 to 30, if not 35 to 50 such centres would be established 
in Quebec. They would be like information booths or banking 
machines.
<P>
	The fact is that, with this reform, this downsizing of every 
employment centre, under colour of seemingly commendable 
objectives, they will actually create appalling situations. For 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13392"> 13392 </A></B>
<P>
years now, we have been saying among other things that 
adequate consulting services  should be made available to the 
unemployed. Psychologists and other manpower counsellors 
working with the unemployed should be in a position to do so.
<P>
	As a result of the federal government's decision, there will not 
be one single employee left in smaller urban centres, only 
automated tellers. In medium sized centres, much fewer people 
will be assigned to and available to provide services to the 
unemployed, the service users.
<P>
	The minister is currently considering suggestions made by 
bureaucrats, public servants. It may be useful at this time to 
remind him that, before moving to implement this reform, the 
main effect of which will be to reduce personal contact between 
people on UI and those who can help them, perhaps other 
options should be considered.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Let me give you concrete examples. At the La Pocatière 
employment centre, in my riding, one of the most performing 
centres in Canada in terms of service requests processing speed, 
it had become the custom to automatically refer anyone filling 
an unemployment insurance claim to a counsellor. This 
prevented claimants from getting lost in the system or getting 
inadequate advice.
<P>
	As a result of this measure, the staff will be cut by 17,6. I am 
not crazy about referring to people in terms of decimals; 
therefore, let us say about 18 people. After all the cuts are 
implemented, only 13 people will be left.
<P>
	It is impossible to both reduce the number of employees and 
maintain or improve service at the same time. Therefore, the 
pilot project under way will probably have to be scrapped.
<P>
	Let me give you another example. The employment centre in 
Rivière-du-Loup, which serves a vast area, was putting in place 
practices that would have made it easier to reach unemployed 
workers in the various communities scattered throughout the 
territory. Since staff will be cut from 48 to 38, the unemployed 
will go back to the old practice of merely sending a card to the 
employment centre. The impact of these cuts will also be 
difficult to assess, since people will turn to the employment 
centre more to collect unemployment insurance than to job 
search. This would run counter to the objectives of the 
government's planned contract with the people.
<P>
	I would like to come back to what I was saying about 
information booth or banking machines. Imagine people who 
are not used to computers. The clients, who are often the long 
term or chronically unemployed, are people who freeze before 
the huge bureaucratic machinery. They have a hard time finding 
solutions. By making them use a computer and denying them the 
possibility of receiving individual service, we will put them in 
an intolerable situation.
<P>
	What could have been done other than making cuts? In our 
opinion, the first, the real solution would have been to recognize 
Quebec's jurisdiction over manpower training and to transfer 
the employees affected, thus allowing us to correct some rather 
absurd situations.
<P>
	For example, the federal network now manages 27 manpower 
programs, while the Quebec network handles 25. There are some 
100 Canada Employment Centres in Quebec, whose services are 
duplicated by the Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre. This 
requires stakeholders in each region to spend a lot of energy 
working in concert with others to reach a consensus and develop 
manpower strategies adapted to local needs. People do so in 
good faith and make the system work because, if the Canada 
Employment Centres and the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre followed national criteria and established 
procedures to the letter, the system would not work. There 
would be no way for the system to work properly.
<P>
	As I was saying, we think that the first solution is for the 
federal government to give jurisdiction to Quebec so that 
Quebec can streamline operations to make the system work.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Here is another example of measures which seem rather 
mind-boggling and which are the result of a bad decision. The 
department informed job search clubs, which are organizations 
co-operating with the employment centres and which are 
claimed to be among the priorities of the Department of Human 
Resources Development, that they will only serve UI 
beneficiaries.
<P>
	The documents on the reform refer to more partnership 
agreements and more co-operation with all sorts of 
organizations capable of doing the job at a lesser cost. At the 
same time, job search clubs are informed that they will no longer 
be allowed to provide services to those who are not UI 
beneficiairies.
<P>
	Just imagine knocking at the door of one such club, whose 
role is to help people looking for work, and being asked first 
whether you are a UI beneficiary. If this is not the case, you are 
out of luck, otherwise you may be referred to a Quebec labour 
department office.
<P>
	The case of a person who does not get any UI benefits is truly 
mind-boggling. For example, a student graduating this year, 
who is not eligible to UI benefits, who is still a dependent, and 
therefore not eligible to welfare assistance, will not be able to 
get any help. I do not think this is the right way to treat people.
<P>
	Before making a decision and following up on the proposals 
made by his officials, the minister should conduct a vast 
consultation exercise among MPs regarding the proposed 
administrative reorganization.
<P>
	Such a consultation is important, both for the government and 
the opposition parties. It could be done regionally. For example, 
the members from Quebec, Ontario, the western provinces and 
the Maritimes could  be invited and informed of the impact of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13393"> 13393 </A></B>
<P>
that reorganization on the employment centres in their ridings. I 
think this approach would shed a different light on the subject 
and be a useful adjunct to the studies prepared by bureaucrats.
<P>
	Another concern linked to the estimates is the number of 
national advisory groups at the Department of Human Resources 
Development. Before cutting back on the number of employees 
in customer services, the people who provide services to the 
unemployed in all municipalities, in every single part of Canada 
and Quebec, it might be advisable to see if cuts could be made in 
these advisory groups which would be in line with the 
government's current budget requirements.
<P>
	We are not saying that nothing should be cut. Obviously, 
considering the size of the debt and the deficit, we must all do 
our share. We all have to contribute. When we say all, we do not 
mean only the people assigned to customer services.
<P>
	In the private sector, I think customer services would be the 
last place where they would cut staff. We have to consider what 
can be done, and I hope the minister will ask all members for 
their views on the reform proposals, to ensure that the final 
decision will take into consideration what the situation is in each 
region.
<P>
	I was looking at a list of criteria for a Canada human resources 
centre, a local human resources centre and a kiosk. Some criteria 
work very well for urban areas and some for rural areas, but 
there are other criteria that are not considered at all. It is like 
looking through the wrong end of a telescope.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	It says that a Canada centre should have between 75 and 150 
employees, but not a word about the customers. I think that the 
criteria for a Canada centre should include the customers these 
people will have to serve and then, and only then do we decide 
on the administrative structure that is adapted to customer 
needs. In this case, the structure comes first and then they adjust 
the needs to this particular reality. It sounds rather farfetched, 
and I think we have a responsibility to represent these customers 
and take their needs into consideration.
<P>
	A good example is an employment centre that deals with large 
numbers of seasonal workers, people who are spread over a vast 
territory. In that kind of situation, we must realize that when 
there are a lot more transactions, when there are very busy 
periods, when programs have to be put in place to give these 
seasonal workers a chance to find jobs or develop jobs that will 
give them some additional income, because they are the first in 
line to apply for these jobs, we need adequate services to do this.
<P>
	I think it is important for the minister to include in his reform 
what he said in the documents, in other words, the new 
structures will be customer oriented and will be based on 
partnership. And to achieve this, the first thing to be done is to 
determine who the clients will be and with whom public servants 
will be dealing, and whether certain segments of the population 
or certain areas are more affected by the system and whether the 
reforms should take that into consideration.
<P>
	Therefore, overall, while we are waiting for the government 
to eventually merge the two systems, and we will have to wait 
until the federal government decides to take the first step and 
admit that it has no place in the area of training the labour force, 
in the interim, these reflections aim to ensure that Canadians 
and Quebecers using employment centres will not be penalized 
by the decision, and that we will not be faced with absurd 
situations in which people are forced to travel great distances to 
obtain a service. The system should run smoothly.
<P>
	Another element must be taken into consideration. I would 
say that about 90 per cent of the salaries of people working at 
employment centres come out of the unemployment insurance 
fund. That means that the employees who are paying 
unemployment insurance premiums and the employers who are 
making their corresponding unemployment insurance 
contributions are supporting this system. It is they who 
ultimately pay the salaries of the staff at employment centres. 
They should therefore have a say regarding the kind of services 
they will receive.
<P>
	The way things are going, the government wants to create a 
sizeable human resources investment fund so that it can 
intervene in sectors like daycare and services for handicapped 
people, which both fall under provincial jurisdiction. This will 
artificially inflate the financial needs of the unemployment 
insurance commission when the government could easily have 
decided to take another approach altogether.
<P>
	Now that there is a surplus in the Unemployment Insurance 
fund, could we not decide to continue to give people proper 
counselling services? Could we not decide as well to find a 
compromise solution which would maintain proper services 
and, at the same time, permit a reduction in UI premiums? This 
is one way to create jobs. If employers and employees pay lower 
premiums, a significant amount of money is then injected 
directly into the economy. This is a much more active approach 
to job creation than putting money in funds like the human 
resources investment fund, which will be bureaucratic and will 
not quickly find its way back into the economy.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, in looking for job creation solutions to make better 
use of all our human potential, the minister should consider the 
situation and the creation of the human resources investment 
fund or at least take a look at the scope he intends to give it, so 
that money may be made available quickly and show up in the 
paycheques of individual Canadians and Quebecers who earn 
their living with it and of employers too, who will then be able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13394"> 13394 </A></B>
<P>
put more money into research or technological development, 
which will mean better service to the public.
<P>
	Therefore, I am happy to have this time in the House to 
encourage the minister to analyze the recommendations made to 
him in detail and to invite him to submit them to the House 
before any decision is made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noted 
that the member was back on the old rhetoric of the Bloc 
Quebecois that it is so concerned about provincial rights and 
responsibilities that it wants total control over manpower and 
training.
<P>
	Surely the argument is the creation of jobs, the creation of a 
well trained and productive workforce. The whole argument 
among different levels of government which may create 
bureaucratic jobs as the provinces and the federal government 
fight each other over who shall and shall not accomplish and 
spend money in what area is totally and absolutely 
non-productive. The issue should be that we want Canadians to 
be productive. We want them to be well skilled. We want them to 
be efficient in order that we can compete in today's international 
marketplace.
<P>
	How does the member think that by having the money spent 
by the provincial government instead of the federal government 
it is going to achieve any of these particular aims and 
objectives?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find this question a bit surprising 
coming from a member of the Reform Party, because it seems to 
me that part of the answer can be found in an argument they have 
frequently advanced, which is that, if decision making were 
truly decentralized in our system, significant savings could be 
realized.
<P>
	One of the sad facts of the terrible debt we are now facing is 
that, in our federal system, it is very difficult for individual 
citizens to identify who is responsible for what, and as a result 
they are forever turning to both the provincial and the federal 
governments for money, hoping that one of the two levels will 
come through with what their organization needs to function.
<P>
	There is therefore a rather unhealthy competition between the 
two levels of government, because their fields of action often 
overlap. Another aspect is that it is not true that the manpower 
profile is the same throughout Canada. Quebec has its own 
characteristics because of the French language and culture of the 
majority of its citizens, and therefore the mobility of Quebecers 
is not the same as what may be the case in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	There are also different choices that must be made in terms of 
occupation of regions. For example, when the human resources 
development committee conducted its cross country tour, 
Maritimers were in dread of a reform that would suddenly bring 
about an exodus to the west, when what they wanted was to be 
able to stay in their part of the country, exploring and developing 
the resources there.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	That would lead to very different choices regarding 
manpower training. A truly pan-Canadian policy really 
encouraging full-scale mobility to the max would mean that we 
would train people in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia for jobs in 
Ontario, Alberta or Vancouver. On the other hand, if were to 
keep our manpower training policy to a local scale, if our 
objectives encourage people to find employment in their own 
areas, to lead their lives in their current environments, we would 
make different choices regarding training. We would go size up 
what resources are available in their areas and what kind of 
training needs the people already living in an area have. That 
would make a huge difference.
<P>
	Take fishermen for example. Given the very inaccurate 
forecasts made, they became the victims of the overlap in the 
fisheries jurisdiction. If these people are put in a position in 
which they have to go back to school to train for jobs in an 
entirely different region, they will be cut off from the only 
reality they know and we will be faced with the same problems 
many southern countries are currently facing.
<P>
	So, to get back to the hon. member's question, I think that the 
main solution is decentralization which, in itself, will be much 
less costly. If provincial governments do make mistakes, if they 
spend money irresponsibly, it will not take long for the 
electorate to turf them out. The way things are now, the people 
cannot actually determine whether the federal government, the 
provincial government or the municipal government is 
responsible for such and such a thing. In Quebec, there is 
overwhelming support in all regions for a massive 
decentralization of power. This would make it possible to 
quickly determine who created a situation in particular, who is 
responsible for ensuring it is a success, and who to praise if it is, 
or who to blame if it is not. That is one way of getting Canada out 
of debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
very interested in what my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, who is from one of the 
regions, had to say and I have a question for him, not about 
decentralization, because he would like to see a move to 
decentralize towards the regions, but as the Canada human 
resources centres are formed, we realize there will be some 
centralization. Because of staff reductions, they are going to 
centralize staff, which is supposed to enhance efficiency, and 
they will set up service outlets. Since we are from these regions 
and, in my opinion and that of my colleague, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13395"> 13395 </A></B>
<P>
these service  outlets will not have any decision making 
authority, people in the riding of Abitibi will have to travel more 
than 250 kilometres to talk to someone who has that authority.
<P>
	Does he think it is efficient for the federal government to 
establish Canada human resources centres without consulting 
the regions and to develop a strategy that may be effective in 
Toronto and Montreal but not necessarily in our regions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague raised an 
important point in the current debate. It seems that when there is 
a trend towards restructuring, and this also happens in the 
regions, people always recentralize when cutbacks have to be 
made. Amazingly, in a decision making pyramid, it is always the 
job at the bottom, never the job at the top that becomes 
expendable. The job at the bottom may provide direct services to 
customers but does not have as much clout at the decision 
making level.
<P>
	My recommendation was to ensure that members could be 
consulted before this reform was implemented and it is right in 
line with my colleague's philosophy. I want members to be able 
to say: The suggestion that we should have only one Canada 
human resources centre in Rimouski is entirely unsatisfactory, 
considering the situation in the region. In the Gaspé, we would 
need a major centre, under whatever name, and another centre 
for the region around Rivière-du-Loup, and staff should be 
appointed accordingly, because Canada centres are going to see 
their consultant resources, who are not in direct contact with the 
public, regrouped in these so-called regional capitals. This will 
not have the desired effect, which was to provide direct services 
to customers. Imagine if McDonald's decided that instead of 
setting up branches where there are a lot of people, it would have 
only one restaurant and ask people to come and eat hamburgers 
15, 20 or 50 kilometres from their residence. The company 
would go out of business.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	If we do not make the right decisions, we will end up with the 
same results in terms of the satisfaction of Canadians and 
Quebecers with services offered by employment centres and 
with everything connected with unemployment insurance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to inform the Chair that I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Brandon-Souris.
<P>
	I have the honour today to talk about the government's cost 
recovery and user fee policy. It is important that all Canadians 
have a better understanding of this policy. The 1995 budget 
announced that as a result of the program review, departments 
would introduce new or expanded initiatives to recover a greater 
portion of the cost of certain programs.
<P>
	This government is committed to changing its approach to 
managing its activities and operations in total. In the context of 
program review, the government has been rethinking what its 
core functions are, how these core functions should be carried 
out and how best to finance the activities.
<P>
	Cost recovery is one of many management initiatives that 
reflect this government's commitment to greater reliance on 
market forces, to improving the efficiency of its operations and 
effectiveness of its programs. Cost recovery and user fees 
involve having those who benefit the most or most directly from 
a government service or program pay a fair share of the cost of 
providing that service. It makes use of the user pay principle in 
which the user specific beneficiary rather than all taxpayers 
bears all or a portion of the financial responsibility for an 
activity.
<P>
	On the face of it, this is viewed as reasonable, justifiable and 
fair to most people. However, cost recovery and user fees are 
often perceived as another form of taxation. It is important to 
recognize that cost recovery and user fees differ from taxes in 
their nature and function. Let us look at the way they operate.
<P>
	Taxes are mandatory levies of which there is no quid pro quo 
for goods or services. Taxes bear no direct relationship to the use 
or benefits from public services or resources. Taxes are used to 
finance public goods such as national defence and security.
<P>
	Cost recovery and user fees on the other hand are payments 
made by individuals and firms in exchange for some direct 
benefit. Generally they are levied when the people enjoying the 
benefits are a specialized or select group. For example, campers 
pay for entrance fees for camping in our national parks and 
Canadian travellers pay for obtaining a passport for travelling 
abroad.
<P>
	The government recognizes that cost recovery is not 
appropriate for all of its activities. The government provides 
many programs for the benefit of all citizens, and others that for 
other policy reasons are intended to assist the recipient. These 
programs will continue to be financed from general tax 
revenues. Our view is that the introduction of cost recovery or 
similar charges for many programs or parts of programs could 
improve government administration and reduce costs to the 
general public without harming the public good.
<P>
	The concept of cost recovery is not new. The principle is being 
applied increasingly by all levels of government both in Canada 
and internationally. Some federal departments and agencies 
have been charging fees since Confederation. Think of the fee 
for a new passport. That has been around since the early 1800s. 
Since only a limited number of Canadian citizens require a 
passport, it is appropriate to request a small fee for the service 
from a recipient of that privilege rather than have the general 
taxpayer pick up the entire bill.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13396"> 13396 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that there are no free services. All 
government services come with a price tag, a price tag that 
either the recipient of the services or the general taxpayer must 
bear. The issue is getting the right balance. Let me provide some 
examples of existing cost recovery initiatives in this federal 
government.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada charges fees for the use of 
pastures and breeding facilities; inspection of seed, feed and 
food; and quality of inspection of livestock and grain. Industry 
Canada charges fees for issuing licences for non-broadcasting 
radio communication equipment; fees and charges for a broad 
range of activities such as inspecting equipment used for 
weighing and measuring consumer products; patents and 
trademarks; and metre inspections. Immigration and 
Citizenship Canada charges for immigration visas and 
citizenship certificates.
<P>
	National Defence charges for the sale of goods and services to 
NATO, the United Nations and foreign governments. The Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police recovers most of its costs from 
provincial and municipal policing services. The superintendent 
of financial institutions recovers the costs of most of his 
regulatory activities from the banks and other financial 
institutions. Transport Canada charges for airport facilities and 
services provided to airlines, such as concessions, leases, 
landing and terminal fees.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize to hon. members that the primary 
objective of the government's policy is not cost recovery. May I 
point to three objectives.
<P>
	One objective is to ensure fairness by having direct users or 
beneficiaries pay a fair share of the cost of programs and thereby 
relieve some of the financial burden on the general taxpayer.
<P>
	The second objective is to establish a market type mechanism 
to help assess which government activities should continue to be 
pursued and which should be scaled back, if not eliminated. In 
other words, can we still afford to provide a particular service 
and is there a market for it? If Canadians are not willing to pay a 
modest fee or charge perhaps it is no longer worth doing.
<P>
	The third objective is to create a new relationship between 
users and departments. By this I mean that paying for an activity 
gives the user a more direct interest in how the activity is run, 
the quality of service provided and its cost. In turn, departments 
will become more attentive and responsive to the users' needs 
and expectations.
<P>
	For example, the Atomic Energy Control Board collects fees 
for licensing nuclear facilities such as power reactors, uranium 
mines and mills. As a result of the fees, licensees are reviewing 
their licence requirements very closely and are cancelling 
unnecessary licences. Licensing costs have led some companies 
to review their use of nuclear processes and materials and to 
consider alternative and less costly processes. Atomic Energy  
Control Board licensing managers have become more aware of 
the total costs of doing their job which is contributing to an 
increase in the efficiency of their organization.
<P>
	Canadians should also be assured that due process is used by 
departments and agencies when they introduce a cost recovery 
initiative or introduce user fees. Cost recovery initiatives are not 
simply imposed by departments. The government has 
established guiding principles for departments and agencies to 
follow when considering the introduction of cost recovery and 
user fees.
<P>
	Here is a brief description of the process. The basic premise is 
the activities provided primarily to an independent and 
identifiable recipient beyond those that accrue to the general 
public should be paid for in whole or in part by those recipients. 
Implementing cost recovery or introducing user fees must be 
done in a transparent way that is open to public and 
parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
	Where fees are appropriate, they are to be implemented in 
consultation with users and under appropriate authorities and 
accounting mechanisms. Before implementing any fee, 
departments must assess the impact of charges on users and 
others affected to ensure there are no unintended effects. The 
decision will depend on factors such as the effects the charging 
will have on the clients' satisfaction with and their utilization of 
the activity and the impact on the program's objectives and 
effectiveness.
<P>
	Interestingly enough simply studying the possibility of cost 
recovery can have some positive effects. For example, 
considering a new fee for a particular activity may lead to other 
important decisions because a good analysis may point to other 
management changes that should and could be made. It may be 
decided that people will not pay for a service if we cannot speed 
up delivery or reduce errors in providing the service.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Cost recovery can also improve the management of 
government resources by complimenting related management 
initiatives such as restructuring service delivery; for example, 
special operating agencies.
<P>
	In today's tight fiscal environment there are not enough tax 
dollars to meet all the financial demands of government 
programs. Cost recovery and user fee revenues permit the 
government to provide and improve activities that it might not 
otherwise be able to afford, or to redirect the tax dollars 
currently being used to finance these activities or even to reduce 
the deficit.
<P>
	The government is committed to providing Canadians with 
the best service possible within the resources available.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague opposite. He had a lot to say about 
cost recovery, transparency and money the government has to 
spend. I have a simple question for him about unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	When there is a $2 billion surplus, and regions such as ours 
will be penalized significantly because of distances, how does 
he explain the transparency of the Department of Human 
Resources Development, which does not use the extra $2 billion 
to provide more services for its clientele? It is not transparent as 
regards other budget items because we cannot find out why it 
does not use this extra money to keep the people needed in the 
regions to give training courses or simply provide services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	With respect to human resource development program, the 
minister looks at the program from a broad sense. He is 
obviously looking to fine tune the system so it can provide a 
much more efficient and effective program.
<P>
	In my experience in my riding and questions I have asked 
beyond my riding, the training programs are continually being 
enhanced. The minister is trying to do his utmost in the training 
program to provide training for specific areas.
<P>
	Given the information we have received from the department, 
it is trying to establish a program whereby an individual living 
in Quebec will have access to opportunities in Ontario or British 
Columbia. When we look at moneys saved, we have to look at 
the overall picture of our financial situation and direct moneys 
wherever they are needed and improve the system as best we 
can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when it comes to directing money where it can best be used, I 
would like to get the member's opinion on one expenditure.
<P>
	This year 45,000 civil servants can expect to be laid off, not 
rehired or what have you. Within the government there is the 
special measures initiative program through which the 
government will spend about $45 million specifically to target 
equity groups, aboriginals, visible minorities, women and 
people with disabilities, for hiring programs in the civil service.
<P>
	It seems odd when we are laying off 45,00 civil servants and 
spending $45 million to initiate programs to hire more people. Is 
that money well spent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. Let me 
set the record straight.
<P>
	The member said we are laying off 45,000 people this year. 
That is not true. We all know that. There are 45,000 people. 
Some will be laid off and some will retire over three years. We 
are being intellectually dishonest when we harp on that and say 
45,000 are people being laid off this year. I have spoken to many 
people who are very pleased this program is unfolding the way it 
is. They are glad to receive their early retirement, the payouts as 
well. The government is approaching downsizing in a very 
humane and compassionate way.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Last week I spoke to a constituent who would like to accept a 
package. Unfortunately because circumstances call he is not 
part of the group that will be laid off or asked to take early 
retirement. Nevertheless we have to be honest with our viewers 
that 45,000 is spread over three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a lot was said here about cost recovery. We are all 
sympathetic to this. I refer to two services being provided, the 
business development centres across Canada and the case 
counselling services with the Federal Business Development 
Bank.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting that with the parliamentary 
appropriation given to the Federal Business Development Bank 
to finance that aspect of its operation, which is not under the cost 
recovery of the mandate of that bank, the case counselling 
services will go on a cost recovery basis to the people who use 
that counselling.
<P>
	Will the people who benefit from or use the business 
development centres be charged for the computer time or the 
information available?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> I have had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, on 
several occasions to meet with representatives of the Federal 
Business Development Bank. They are providing a service in 
conjunction and co-operation with major financial institutions. 
It is a needed service. When they provide auxiliary support, yes 
that service will be paid by the user so it is not a burden on the 
FBDB.
<P>
	The FBDB provides a service that is a higher risk for various 
users. Its record speaks for itself as far as recovery and not being 
a burden on taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to add my support to Bill C-76.
<P>
	The government has done its very best in the last two budgets 
to avoid any increase in personal taxes. Every $1 we raised in 
additional taxes was matched by $7 in spending cuts in the 1995 
budget and $5 in cuts in the 1994 budget. Taxes on corporations 
were increased and the highly profitable Canadian banks will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13398"> 13398 </A></B>
<P>
pay a temporary surtax on their capital. All together, new taxes 
on corporations will raise an additional $974 million this year.
<P>
	These measures are in addition to the improvements we have 
made to the tax system in the 1994 budget in which where we 
reduced the amount businesses could claim for meals and 
entertainment from 80 per cent to 50 per cent and we eliminated 
the $100,000 capital gains tax exemption which primarily 
benefited higher income Canadians.
<P>
	During the prebudget period hundreds of Brandon-Souris 
constituents contacted my office and also made indirect contacts 
with the ministry. They sent all of us on this side of the House a 
message that the Liberal government must take strong action to 
break the back of the deficit. Great improvements and great 
strides have happened in this regard.
<P>
	The preference for deep cuts in government spending versus 
any increase in personal taxation was stressed and our 
government responded accordingly.
<P>
	I believe Bill C-76 is tough but fair. The finance minister 
worked hard to ensure balanced spending reductions and that the 
burden of deficit reduction is shared as evenly as possible in all 
regions.
<P>
	The Brandon-Souris area is no exception. We did experience 
some reductions in personnel. Our weather station was closed. 
Those who work in Shilo will experience some job losses. 
However, this is being eased to some extent by the program put 
in place by various departments.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The elimination of the Crow rate is probably one of the most 
difficult for many farmers in our area to handle but many regard 
the transition as necessary.
<P>
	Our government has cut spending dramatically but in a way 
consistent with the value of Canadians, promoting jobs and 
growth, protecting the most vulnerable members in our society 
and cutting at the government level first. Bill C-76 reflects the 
government's commitment to reducing government spending 
now while the economy is still in a growing cycle.
<P>
	Decisive action today will ensure continued strength of the 
Canadian economy, protecting future jobs and prosperity. The 
decisions made with respect to agriculture will ensure Canadian 
farmers can take the best possible advantage of new global trade 
opportunities. Farming is best done by producers, not 
governments. That is why Bill C-76 is putting decision making 
back into the hands of the farmers.
<P>
	We are expanding export markets and helping to create new 
domestic markets for commodities farmers across the prairies 
produce. How are we giving producers more control over their 
environment? Bill C-76 ushers in great improvements for 
Canadian farmers. The prairie grain cash advances would 
increase by $34 million. Cash flow enhancement programs 
would increase by $27.5 million. The NISA program would 
increase by $102 million. Transition programs to whole farm 
support for beef, lamb and hogs would increase by 
approximately $6  million. A matching investment initiative 
will increase by $12.7 million. Expanding export markets would 
increase by approximately $900 million. Further efforts are 
being made to expand the ethanol programs, and food safety 
would increase by about $5.8 million.
<P>
	One of the most symbolical changes in the budget is the Crow 
rate. It has been recognized the Crow has caused some 
distortions and some inefficiencies both for the producers and 
for the transport companies. That will soon change. The Prime 
Minister was correct when he said that given half a chance 
farmers do not want subsidies, they want access to markets and 
they need and want fair prices.
<P>
	It is the intention of the government to help farmers across the 
prairies do what they do best, feed the world, to diversify and to 
make a decent, honest living while doing it.
<P>
	I believe the removal of the Crow rate will lead to increased 
value added production in the prairies over time. The circulation 
of billions of dollars and now the incentive to add value to 
agriproducts will provide opportunities and financing for the 
food processing industry in pasta plants, ethanol plants and 
many more we have not as yet conceived.
<P>
	People learn to adjust to new opportunities and Manitobans 
have traditionally been trend setters in new markets. Clearly 
details need to be worked out, especially on pooling issues.
<P>
	There is some concern regarding compensation for land 
values and how land owner payouts will be reflected in new 
lease arrangements on the approximately seven million rented 
acres in Manitoba. The reform of the WGTA will not be easy. 
The issues are complex but I am confident the minister will 
continue open discussions and that the $300 million transition 
adjustment fund will be used as effectively and efficiently as 
possible. The western economy will be stronger and more 
diversified with the removal of the WGTA.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to bring forward two endorsements 
to the WGTA program, endorsements which are rather difficult 
to pry out of some with different political views from those of us 
on this side. It is sometimes very difficult to endorse or change 
an idea one does not have the courage to do oneself. I am pleased 
to indicate to the House that the first endorsement came from the 
Manitoba agriculture minister. He said that changes to the 
WGTA would rejuvenate the rural economy of Manitoba and 
would lead to an added value approach to farming and the 
development of job intensive processing industries.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13399"> 13399 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The second endorsement came from one of my opponents in 
the 1993 election. He was in Ottawa this week. He said that the 
payment to landowners represents a reasonable compromise. It 
is not often that the three of us agree on anything, but miracles 
do happen in Manitoba and a miracle did happen in this instance.
<P>
	Let me reiterate that although the government has cut 
spending dramatically, it has been done the cutting in a way 
which is consistent with the values of Canadians, promoting 
jobs and growth, protecting the west, protecting the most 
vulnerable in society and cutting the government purse.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague spoke a lot about agriculture. It 
warrants a lot of attention, because relations between farmers 
and markets in Quebec and Canada will be changed significantly 
by some of the measures presented.
<P>
	I have a question for him on one type of production that is 
growing considerably in Canada: lamb production. Alberta, 
Quebec and Ontario are the three largest producing provinces. 
The government has decided to close the experimental farm at 
La Pocatière, which is in my riding. It is the only experimental 
farm with a national mandate to do research on everything that 
concerns sheep. Sheep production is growing, and production 
should increase, because there is a demand for sheep and lamb in 
Canada production as a whole.
<P>
	Are there other solutions in the member's opinion? Shutting 
down the farm and putting an end to research into this sort of 
production does not seem acceptable to me. In one way it is very 
dangerous. I would like to know if he sees any alternatives. In 
fact, both his region and mine are affected by this decision, 
which has a significant negative impact on production of this 
type.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question. Its thrust is similar to other segments of agricultural 
industry. I look at it in a similar fashion to hog production in 
Manitoba.
<P>
	It is my understanding in terms of research that the thrust of 
the department is to attempt to put together partnerships 
involving the federal government, as well as specific provincial 
jurisdictions where there is great interest. More important, it is 
producers who are probably the most concerned about the 
genetic development of hogs, sheep or cattle and who may be 
addressing the markets on a global basis.
<P>
	The best way to answer the question would be to indicate that 
the producers should be looking at bringing together their 
resources. Perhaps a check off system at the marketing end 
would help to address those concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the comments made by the hon. member opposite dealt mostly 
with Bill C-76, the Budget Implementation Act, and not so 
much with the estimates.
<P>
	Since he is talking about budget implementation, I wonder if 
he would detail for me, because I am not as familiar with the red 
book as he would be, exactly how close was the red book 
promise on the WGTA with what the Budget Implementation 
Act actually did? That was to remove the WGTA. Was that the 
red book promise? Was there a different promise on the WGTA?
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, references were made to 
transportation and the WGTA in the red book.
<P>
	I have to be honest. When I started into the campaign in 1993, 
a debate was going on about how transportation should be 
handled in various regions of the country, remembering that 
there is always a moving target. Conditions did change. We were 
facing as a government, possibly, circumstances that were not 
envisioned during the campaign. I will be succinct. In 1993 I 
was not of the view of the route on which the government has 
proceeded. We have had to rethink that whole circumstance.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for those watching this debate. We are now debating a Bloc 
motion on grants and contributions from the human resources 
department's main estimates. The Bloc motion calls for $1.3 
billion in cuts. Those cuts would cover programs, everything 
from youth initiative programs to employment assistance 
programs.
<P>
	We are all making do with less in these times and government 
should be no exception. Even though this message is coming 
from Canadians, the government is not listening. Instead it has 
actually increased its spending in its first two budgets. This 
includes substantial increases in its interest spending. The 
government keeps borrowing money and having to increase 
spending on interest but it decreases spending on some other 
things for which we would rather pay.
<P>
	The Reform approach in dealing with the main estimates for 
the human resources department was to propose modest 5 per 
cent reduction in the operating expenses of the various programs 
under this department. Instead the human resources estimates 
propose significant increases in spending. This is interesting 
because it is at a time when the services being delivered by these 
programs are being significantly cut back to Canadians.
<P>
	For example, we know that pensions are going to be cut back 
sometime. That has been announced. We are not sure when or 
what. We know that unemployment benefits are being cut back. 
The budget said a minimum of 10 per cent but it could be more 
than that. We know that health care is being cut back under the 
Liberal budget. We know that tuition fees are rising because  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13400"> 13400 </A></B>
<P>
there is less money available for post-secondary education. The 
list goes on.
<P>
	During the time when these benefits and services to 
Canadians are being cut back significantly, the department that 
delivers them, instead of getting leaner and more efficient, is 
increasing its spending significantly.
<P>
	Reform felt that in fairness to Canadians who were having to 
take less from this department that the least the department 
could do would be to operate on at least 5 per cent less money 
than it asked for from Parliament.
<P>
	Unfortunately the modest decrease in operating funds of 5 per 
cent which we proposed was voted down by the Liberal majority 
on the committee and interestingly by the Bloc members on the 
committee. In committee the Bloc members did not support 
even a 5 per cent decrease in spending but in the House they 
want a $1.3 billion decrease. We find that quite interesting.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Reform proposed a very realistic 5 per cent cut to operating 
expenditures. This would have been an important first step and 
one which the government could have and should have been able 
to live with.
<P>
	Instead the government is pushing through the votes in the 
main estimates without even the kind of public scrutiny that we 
should be able to expect as Canadians from a massive spending 
program by government. These estimates are being put through 
without the members of Parliament who hold a majority being 
able to decrease that spending by even $1.
<P>
	Whatever government departments ask for, whatever the 
bureaucrats propose, is what they are being given. Is that any 
way to show accountability to Canadians? We were elected to 
oversee the spending of their money as carefully and prudently 
as possible. No. Whatever is put forward, we just put it through. 
We will see this later on today. There will be not one vote that 
will diminish the spending estimates put forward by government 
departments by even $1. That is not accountability. It certainly 
does not hold the civil service accountable for the kind of 
spending they are supposed to be doing of Canadians' money.
<P>
	This spending affects every Canadian from St. John's to 
Victoria. We should be looking very carefully at how that goes 
forward.
<P>
	Even the Bloc motion on vote 10 that we are debating right 
now is being countered with a government motion to boost the 
spending in the area of grants and contributions right back up to 
where it started. This is in spite of all attempts to give the matter 
serious consideration.
<P>
	The Reform Party in February released a budget which we 
believe the country should operate by. It was called the 
taxpayers budget. This budget was a direct result of input from 
our party members at the grassroots level right across the 
country. What ordinary Canadians were calling for and what was 
reflected in our budget were reductions to the bloated and 
inefficient programs, especially funding for special interest 
groups such as the ones that are funded under the motion we are 
debating at the moment.
<P>
	Reformers spoke out loud and clear in this area of government 
money for special interest groups. We supported cuts in these 
particular areas and our support is solid.
<P>
	Also in the taxpayers' budget Reformers were clear that areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, such as training programs, should not 
be intruded upon by the federal government. In that one area we 
agree with our friends from the Bloc and their opposition to 
some of these requisitions for money that really should not be 
allocated by the federal government but should be left to the 
provinces as the Constitution provides.
<P>
	Many of the grants and contributions in this motion are 
dealing with services which are the responsibility of provinces. 
That should be acknowledged and respected.
<P>
	The Reform plan consisted of a formula for dealing with 
grants and contributions depending on whether they were 
provided for businesses or special interest groups. We believe 
contributions to businesses should be cut on a formula of 100 per 
cent cuts and that the funding for special interest groups should 
also be cut 100 per cent. That is our formula.
<P>
	Let us now look at some of the specific expenditures that are 
covered under this motion. Part III of the human resources main 
estimates breaks funding down with vague descriptions only, 
such as ``grants to improve employability and to promote 
employment opportunities''. These are broken down further into 
what the department calls partnerships. It calls for labour 
market adjustments-it is scary for the labour market to think 
that good old government is making adjustments on its 
behalf-and what the department calls community development 
projects.
<P>
	Money from this area is supposedly to be used at the local 
level to create jobs. The problem is that the expenditure of this 
money often creates no real long term sustainable jobs at all. 
They create only artificial jobs or jobs that last only long enough 
to give an individual enough weeks of work to qualify for 
unemployment insurance, of course calling for more funding 
and more money from the government department that started 
them on this nice cycle in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	These are the sorts of make work projects the government 
prides itself on, instead of allowing the private sector to 
energize our economy. This government acknowledges openly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13401"> 13401 </A></B>
<P>
that long term sustainable jobs are  created by business, 
particularly small and medium sized businesses. Instead of 
allowing these people to keep the money they generate and get 
on with the job, government spends lavishly and in order to fund 
that it has to take money out of the pockets of these businesses, 
which therefore drives us further into debt and stifles the kind of 
private enterprise that would provide jobs in this country.
<P>
	The taxes that support the kind of spending we are talking 
about today are job killers. That is what is happening in our 
economy. Governments are scooping so much out of it, draining 
so much out, taking so much out of the pockets of people who are 
trying to keep the economy going that the economy is suffering 
and reeling from the shock of this kind of government spending.
<P>
	The future in getting Canadians back to work is to have a 
country where companies can hire with minimum amounts of 
red tape, pay lower taxes than they currently do, have less 
government tinkering in their affairs, and also have businesses 
that are able to utilize a workforce that is not dependent on 
government make work projects.
<P>
	The economics of the situation is simple. The money the 
government spends for projects to supposedly increase jobs 
could be much better spent. It has to come from somewhere. In 
this case the somewhere is from investors, Canada savings 
bonds, treasury bills and Government of Canada bonds. When 
Canadians and foreigners buy those instruments they are really 
loaning our government money. In order for the government to 
pay them back for these instruments and pay interest as well it 
has to tax individuals and companies.
<P>
	Now the cycle has gone so far that the government is actually 
borrowing money to pay interest on money it previously 
borrowed. That is why we are in such trouble. The end result is 
these so-called make work projects are actually paid for with 
borrowed money. This is not a healthy situation. It creates a 
shaky economy and we are seeing signs of that today.
<P>
	The recovery everybody talked about last year is showing 
signs of slipping. The robust profit growth of Canadian 
corporations, private companies that create jobs in this country, 
slowed in the first quarter of 1995. Operating profits grew by a 
mere 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, compared with over 10 per 
cent in the first quarter of 1994. That is a significant, incredible 
change and downturn. Economic activity also slowed in the first 
quarter, as the gross domestic product dropped 0.7 per cent in 
March after a 0.2 per cent drop in February.
<P>
	There are some real signs the government tinkering in the 
economy, taking money out of the hands of business people, 
entrepreneurs and investors, is simply destabilizing the 
situation, not helping it. Governments cannot run an economy 
but can only help make it possible for an economy to operate in a 
healthy way.
<P>
	Also covered under this motion are grants paid out under the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy, or TAGS. Over $164 million was 
allocated to the TAGS program, to be spent over five years. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development touted this program 
as being the new face of social programs in Canada.
<P>
	We have heard many examples of how TAGS has failed in its 
quest to be a training program and a program to move people 
from failing industries into healthy ones. This has evolved into 
simply another income support program. Not only is it creating 
additional dependency in an area that certainly does not need 
that and where there is already a lack of hope for viability in the 
economic sector, but the training part of those funds, the funds 
that were supposed to be given to people to train them for jobs in 
healthy labour industries, is now simply being diverted into 
more income support.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	In fact, 80 per cent of the funds for this five-year program 
have already been spent in the first year. For the remaining four 
years we have only 20 per cent of those funds left. We also know 
that a great amount of these funds, we do not know how much, is 
going to people who are already earning more than a good living 
in other fisheries activities, such as snow crab fishing.
<P>
	This is an area that needs to be re-examined. This is a 
spending area that is not working. There is room for reductions 
that would be not only not a hardship for people but would 
actually benefit the economy, because this kind of tinkering 
simply hurts it instead of helps it.
<P>
	Also under this motion is about $1 billion of spending on 
payments to facilitate the efficient functioning of the Canadian 
labour market. Who better to tell the Canadian labour market 
how to be efficient than a very efficient government?
<P>
	It seems to me that if we would leave that $1 billion in the 
hands of entrepreneurs, business people and investors, that 
would do more to help the Canadian labour market operate 
efficiently than anything the government could ever do to teach 
it to operate better. That would be the best investment we could 
make: simply let the people who know how to be efficient get on 
with the job, rather than taking their money and having it 
inefficiently allocated by bureaucrats, politicians, and grant 
recipients.
<P>
	This brings us to another component of the Reform Party's 
principles that we have been urging the government to follow 
when it talks about ways to spend better on the social side and 
stimulate the economy. This is the whole idea of effectiveness in 
government. It is not too much for Canadians to ask that their 
government provide them with this fundamental right, the right 
to have an efficient, effective government. Careless spending by 
this government and others before it has not been helpful, to say 
the least. It has put our country in over $500 billion worth of 
debt and it has left us with a country with a spending problem. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13402"> 13402 </A></B>
<P>
That is why so much  funding being provided in all these areas 
we are talking about has had very dubious results.
<P>
	We believe that Canadians simply are not getting value for 
their money. Canadians themselves believe that. In a recent poll 
published at the end of last week in the <I>Financial Post</I>, a large 
majority of Canadians really felt they were paying too much in 
taxes and they were even willing to take illegal measures to 
avoid paying tax because they felt that governments were 
wasteful, corrupt, inefficient, that programs were not giving 
value, and that the money they were giving to government was 
not giving them bang for the buck. It was not worth the money 
they were giving up in taxes for what they were getting back. 
They did not believe the management of it was prudent.
<P>
	When a large proportion of Canadians say openly to pollsters 
that their tax dollars are being squandered in a way they do not 
approve of and are not prepared to support and when their tax 
dollars produce very little positive result and only lead to 
unnecessary dependency on the part of many Canadians, then it 
is time for governments to sit up and take notice, to stop 
spending that money, stop wasting that money, and to demand 
less of the taxpayer and more efficiency from government 
departments.
<P>
	What we have in this whole business of the estimates is 
government simply saying to departments: ``Spend whatever 
you want. Spend more on your operations, because we do not 
expect you to do more with less, like other Canadians''. This is 
why we cannot support the government motion on grants and 
contributions being put forward today.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Bringing spending under control by cuts in grants and 
contributions is one way to return the country to a healthy, 
competitive identity that will let us stand proudly on the 
threshold of the next millennium.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the hon. member's comments in relation to the 
TAGS program in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I understand her concerns, but it is important that she realize 
that the process of retraining people who have been working in 
the fishing industry, which has been so devastated in the last few 
years by the failure of the cod, for example, and other aspects of 
the fishery, and trying to institute a program whereby you help 
people retrain and build them toward the possibility of working 
in other areas is not an overnight process.
<P>
	I am not at all surprised that there have been problems and that 
the training programs have not succeeded greatly in getting 
people into other industries. If there is someone who has perhaps 
worked always on fishing boats or in a fish plant and has maybe 
grade five or grade ten education, they cannot be turned 
overnight into someone who will to be prospering in the 
information age. It is a long process and it takes a lot of effort 
and a lot of investment. It cannot be done overnight.
<P>
	There seems to be a theory in the Reform Party that says let us 
cut them off and they will find something else. That is an 
interesting theory. It may work if they are in British Columbia. 
There is enough happening in some parts of the country, to some 
degree at least, so that there are other opportunities. In Atlantic 
Canada there are some opportunities, but there are not the kinds 
of opportunities that are going to deal with that kind of situation.
<P>
	If people who have been fishing all their lives or working in 
fish plants cutting fish are cut off instantly from all kinds of 
government support, from the TAGS program for example, then 
they will not instantly get into a situation where they are to be 
out there if they have no support. They do not have the money to 
go west to find a job. If they get out there, what job are they 
going to take? What would you retrain them for? How long 
would it take to train a person in that situation to get a 
prosperous, successful job in a modern economy?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question, but I am not sure why anyone who suggests prudent 
spending on these programs can be accused of wanting to cut 
people off. That is a rather extreme interpretation of what I said 
about spending the money in ways that really benefit people, in a 
prudent manner, in a defensible manner, in a way that is 
accountable to the people who should be able to count on these 
moneys to do some good.
<P>
	What do we have under this TAGS program? We have snow 
crab fishermen who make over $200,000 a year being given 
extra money from a program that should be benefiting the 
people who are trying to get out of devastated industries. We 
have people who have perfectly good jobs in fish processing 
plants saying: ``This is an easier program. This is easy money. 
Why do we not just quit working and go on this program? We are 
able to do it''.
<P>
	Will that be helping people? No, it is not helping the people in 
need. It is wasting money that should be helping people in need. 
It is the waste and the inefficiency and the ineffectiveness we are 
talking about, and we are trying to get the government to correct 
this.
<P>
	This money was supposed to train people to get out of 
devastated industries and find jobs somewhere else. As this 
member rightly says, we should try to help them. What is 
happening? The money that was supposed to go to training 
people is now going into income support for people, many of 
whom do not even need that money and should not be entitled to 
the money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13403"> 13403 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, we should be trying to help people if we can. When we 
have a program that is clearly being mismanaged and 
ineffectively administered, is helping people who do not need 
help and not helping people who do, and which has not yet 
created one long term job for anybody on the program, it should 
be criticized not just by members in the opposition but by the 
hon. member who comes from that part of the country where 
people are outraged. The government is taking money that could 
and should be helping and it is instead being totally wasted.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	That kind of help cannot take effect over night. Any sensible 
person realizes that. When there is instance after instance where 
the program is being mismanaged and wasted and not helping 
people, then we should all be on our feet demanding to know 
why, demanding accountability of the department and saying on 
behalf of the people get it right, get it right now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a comment on what my colleague from Calgary 
North said regarding our public responsibilities, including the 
fact that programs would no longer be efficient if they came 
directly under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	There is some discrepancy in what she said. She just stated 
how important it was to fund training. She also mentioned that 
with its motion, the Bloc Quebecois was refusing, so to speak, 
any cuts, especially to the Department of Human Resources 
Development for the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Since the unemployment insurance fund is showing a surplus, 
why not allocate this money, which belongs to the workers and 
the employers, the very same employers who are clamouring for 
top notch skilled workers-which is what the Bloc's amendment 
is all about-to training and programs specially aimed at 
employees and employers, or even give it to the provinces, 
which are in the best position to use it efficiently? How can she 
draw a parallel between the Bloc Quebecois not wanting to cut 
and its wish to train employees and employers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
bringing up that subject. I know it is near and dear to the movers 
of the motion and the Bloc.
<P>
	Just because money is being managed by the provinces does 
not mean it is being managed more effectively. A number of 
provinces have a very dismal fiscal record of management. That 
should be honestly addressed.
<P>
	It is sometimes hypocritical for representations to be made 
that somehow provinces which are deeply in debt and have some 
fiscal problems criticize other levels of government.
<P>
	What I did acknowledge is some of the services and activities 
were constitutionally put within provincial jurisdiction. They 
are with in the purview of the provinces and that should be 
respected. We do have a Constitution. We did have an agreement 
on these services and it should be respected.
<P>
	I agree with my hon. colleague when he suggests UI 
contribution funds should be managed by the workers and 
employers. He is on the right track. These people are paying the 
shot and they should be calling the tune. It makes sense and it is 
perfectly logical.
<P>
	He is correct when he says services should be delivered on a 
level closer to the worker. It is more accountable to workers, 
more responsive to workers, more sensitive to the needs on the 
local level, and we get away from these one size fits all, mother 
government knows everything programs. I certainly support his 
proposal that expenditure of funds for job training and education 
of workers would be better managed on that level than it is being 
managed today.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Nunatsiaq.
<P>
	Opportunities, growth, jobs, balance, honesty, fairness, 
vision, responsibility, consultation and compassion; we ran on 
those words in the last federal election campaign and the 
government has delivered on those words during the last two 
years. The Minister of Finance has delivered on those words in 
the budget. We made commitments to Canadians in the red book. 
We are keeping those commitments in these estimates.
<P>
	Canadians told us they wanted deficit reduction with no 
increase in personal income taxes. The deficit is going down and 
for the second year in a row there has been no increase in 
personal income taxes.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Canadians have told us to cut spending. For every dollar 
raised in new revenues the government has cut $7 in spending. 
The government is launching the largest restructuring of 
government spending since the end of the second world war.
<P>
	In contrast to the recommendations of the Reform Party the 
government is not simply slashing spending across the board. 
The government will not choke off growth. It will not throw the 
country back into a recession.
<P>
	The government has carefully rethought the role and structure 
of the federal government. The redesign of the federal 
government launched by the program review is reflected in the 
esti-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13404"> 13404 </A></B>
<P>
mates and will result in a smaller and smarter government. 
Government can no longer be all things to all people.
<P>
	The program review looked at all areas of government 
spending with the exception of major transfers to persons and 
major transfers to provinces. All the programs were reviewed 
under the following criteria: did the program serve the public 
interest? Did it involve a necessary role for government? Was it 
affordable and could the private sector or the provinces do it 
better?
<P>
	As a result of the review the government is reducing subsidies 
to businesses and agriculture. Many government services will 
be commercialised where practical. The government can no 
longer afford to intervene directly in the economy. The 
government from now on must concentrate on creating the best 
possible economic framework in which the private sector can 
create jobs.
<P>
	Canadians told us to revamp our social programs to meet 
today's needs but to make sure that we respected our heritage of 
social justice. The government has embarked on a program 
which will do just that.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer is not an abandonment of national 
standards, as some have argued. This transfer will provide more 
flexibility to the provinces. It will allow them to experiment and 
find the best way to deliver social programs and reduce 
administrative costs.
<P>
	The conditions of the Canada Health Act, universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration, will be maintained. The government will be 
working with the provinces to develop a set of shared principles 
that will underline the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	The Ontario New Democratic Party has suggested the federal 
government has abandoned the promises it made in the red book. 
This is not true. In the 1994 estimates every key commitment in 
the red book was funded. This year's estimates have maintained 
the government's commitments. The government will maintain 
the health of our social programs while getting the deficit under 
control.
<P>
	As promised in the red book, the government has begun to 
bring the deficit under control while at the same time funding 
the national infrastructure program, cutting unnecessary 
defence spending, introducing gun control legislation, 
reforming the Young Offenders Act, establishing a national 
crime prevention council, taking action to address foreign 
overfishing, promoting trade with Latin America and Asia.
<P>
	It is establishing a youth service corps, restoring literacy 
funding, establishing a national form on health, introducing 
parliamentary reform to give MPs more influence, introducing 
legislation to make lobbying more fair and open, reinstating the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program, establishing a 
prenatal nutrition program, beginning an aboriginal head start 
program, establishing a centre of excellence for women's 
health, restoring the court challenges program, restoring the law 
reform commission, eliminating, downsizing and privatizing 
government agencies, boards and commissions.
<P>
	The government delivered a tough but fair budget. It has 
spread the cost of deficit reduction evenly across the country. 
Despite the claims of some Ontario provincial politicians, 
Ontario did not receive more than its share of cuts.
<P>
	The government has started Canada on the path to economic 
renewal, social reform and fiscal responsibility. The 
government has not solved every problem but it has started in 
the right direction.
<P>
	The Prime Minister remarked repeatedly during the last 
election that a Liberal government would offer Canadians 
realistic hope. That is the hallmark of the Prime Minister's 
approach to government and that is the hallmark of the budget.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	If we are to offer hope we must introduce programs which will 
encourage job creation in the short term, in the medium term and 
in the long term. If we are to be realistic we have to make 
choices.
<P>
	I know some people were not happy with the choices made by 
the government. However, after extensive consultations the 
government made the tough choices that best reflect the priority 
of Canadians. For example, if we are to find money to fund 
research on diseases affecting women or spend money on badly 
needed infrastructure then tough choices have to be made.
<P>
	The government is taking steps to ensure our social programs 
are maintained. Many seniors in my riding of Hamilton 
Mountain are concerned about the future of their pensions. The 
government will be releasing a discussion paper on the future of 
the pension system later this year. The government intends to 
make the pension system fairer and more sustainable in the long 
term.
<P>
	I have spoken to many students in my riding who are 
concerned about their future prospects. The government is 
taking steps to improve the employment prospects of today's 
students. The best means of improving employment 
opportunities of young people is to provide them with practical 
experience and job skills. The new youth services corps and 
internship programs sponsored by the federal government will 
provide students with the experience and skills they need to 
succeed in today's job market.
<P>
	Many people have expressed concern about the changes to the 
unemployment insurance program. I assure Canadians the 
Liberal government recognizes the importance of the 
unemployment insurance program. The government's aim is to 
allow people to become independent, to increase help for those 
in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13405"> 13405 </A></B>
<P>
really desperate circumstances. The government's goal is to find 
the maximum dollars to put people back to work.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have expressed their concerns over 
Canada's crime rate. In recognition of Canadians' concern about 
public safety, the smallest reductions in spending were made in 
departments dedicated to justice and corrections. The 
government is willing to spend the money necessary to ensure 
the safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	Our goal is to create opportunities for all Canadians from all 
regions, from all backgrounds and from all walks of life to make 
the most of their own lives and to help our country seize the 
future.
<P>
	In the budget and in other initiatives the government has 
created the opportunity for us all to seize the future together 
through growth, jobs, balance, honesty, fairness, vision, 
responsibility and compassion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note the 
member's commitment to the red book and to deficit reduction 
is in accordance with what is perceived to be the policy of the 
government.
<P>
	Page 20 of the red book, which the member was so willing to 
put her emphasis on, states there will be a 15 per cent decrease in 
spending on special services by the government should the 
Liberals win the election, and they did. However, there has been 
a $300 million increase in the estimates as proposed.
<P>
	How does the member reconcile the red book commitment to 
a 15 per cent reduction compared with a $300 million increase? 
Is she prepared to vote against these increases when they come 
up for a vote later today?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Phinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the cost of everything has gone up 
but I still think the cuts we have made so far in the budget and in 
the government's spending over the last two years are the 
toughest since the second world war. We have reached the goals 
we promised Canadians through our red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the hon. member for Hamilton Mountain 
concerning the estimates. She detailed everything from students 
to seniors and talked about specific programs.
<P>
	I have been asking many questions since coming to the House 
concerning small business and what assistance it is receiving in 
order to create jobs and get people off unemployment and into 
jobs. Maybe the member for Hamilton Mountain could expand 
on that and on how we are going to help small business to get 
people back to work, where they really want to be.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Phinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question of the hon. member 
for St. Catharines gives me the opportunity to discuss another 
important government initiative, the proposed changes to the 
Federal Business Development Bank.
<P>
	The changes in that bank are an example of the government's 
commitment to promote small business growth, innovation and 
job creation. Many people in small business have told us over 
the last two years that they have a lot of problems with the banks 
in negotiating, refinancing and getting new money for their 
small businesses.
<P>
	The minister responsible has decided he needs to make some 
changes directly to the Federal Business Development Bank. 
These changes have been made as the result of a comprehensive 
small business policy that was developed in 1994. This 
institution will expand its operations thereby ensuring its 
programs and services meet the changing needs of small 
business today. This institution will be given a revised mandate 
to develop and deliver innovative responses to small business 
financing and managerial needs. Small businesses in all the 
ridings across Canada have expressed the need for this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for this member as I do for all of the members on the 
government side. With all of this talk about cuts, cuts, cuts, why 
is the total government expenditure up by $2 billion this year 
over last year? There is an inconsistency here.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Phinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I presume the hon. member knows 
that the interest costs have gone up considerably. We have been 
consulting with Canadians and we are spending in the areas 
where they feel spending is necessary in the next few years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For my colleagues who do not understand Inuktitut, I will 
elaborate.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to speak on the government's 
1995-96 main estimates. When the government was elected one 
and one-half years ago, we said we would do things differently 
and we are doing things differently.
<P>
	The government's main estimates for this fiscal year reflect a 
tough budget but a necessary budget. They also reflect the 
results of the program review announced in the 1994 budget. 
The purpose of the program review was to ensure the 
government's diminished resources are directed to the highest 
priority requirements and to those areas where the federal 
government is best placed to deliver services.
<P>
	The government is clarifying its responsibilities. We are also 
reshaping federal government programs so we spend less but 
provide the best possible service to Canadians within the limits 
of need and affordability.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13406"> 13406 </A></B>
<P>
	We are restraining spending, streamlining operations and 
changing what government does and how its programs are 
delivered. We are committed to reducing the deficit and meeting 
our fiscal targets. We are committed to improving the economic 
climate so more jobs can be created.
<P>
	We are focusing on the essential responsibilities: reducing 
federal and provincial overlap; using technology to become 
more efficient; promoting self-reliance; recovering more of our 
costs; and merging programs which are similar in nature for 
more efficiency. Tough decisions have been made and more 
tough decisions will be made.
<P>
	Public sector jobs have been cut. Some programs are being 
amalgamated; some programs have been cut and some have been 
eliminated. For the remaining programs and services, the 
government is seeking new and cost effective ways to deliver 
them. Because we have to live within our means, we must get rid 
of inefficient or ineffective programs so we can focus our 
energies where they are most needed.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I want to stress that the government is committed to ensuring 
that Canada's most needy do not bear the brunt of deficit 
reduction measures.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Among the most needy Canadians are the aboriginal people. It 
is a fact that the socioeconomic conditions in most Indian and 
Inuit communities are the poorest in the country. The 
government is committed to assisting aboriginal peoples to 
overcome the disparities in living conditions with other 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has been impacted by the budget and program review but not as 
much as other departments. DIAND positions will be reduced 
from 300 from the 1995-96 base of 3,237. The reductions will 
occur at all levels of the department. This is in addition to 442 
positions eliminated in 1994-95.
<P>
	The northern affairs program will be reduced by $15 million 
over the next three years. Regional economic development 
programming will be reduced in 1995 one year ahead of its 
original sunset date. I have to say that the cut to regional 
economic development programming is a painful one for the 
north. To create the jobs and opportunities the north needs, 
economic development is crucial. We have to keep working in 
this area to further northern development.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Social housing is another area of great need in the north. The 
last Conservative budget eliminated funding for new social 
housing construction. So far financial reality has prevented a 
major reversal of that budget's impact on social housing.
<P>
	I continue to be deeply concerned about the poor housing 
conditions in the Nunatsiaq riding and throughout the north. I 
know that the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services is also concerned as is the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development. I will continue to encourage the 
government to do what it can to help resolve the north's housing 
problems.
<P>
	The budget and main estimates for the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development confirm that DIAND will 
maintain its core roles and responsibilities to Indian and Inuit 
people, such as education and social assistance. Increases to the 
Indian and Inuit programs will provide funding for basic 
services such as elementary and secondary education, social 
services, construction and maintenance of schools and 
infrastructure such as water and sewage improvement.
<P>
	Overall however in light of the government's serious fiscal 
situation, DIAND's funding will be moderated. It will increase, 
but not as much as in previous years. Funding for Indian and 
Inuit programming will increase 6 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per 
cent in 1996-97 and 1997-98. The moderated growth is a 
balance between the need to make changes to reduce the deficit 
and the need to protect those who need assistance most.
<P>
	There should be no misunderstanding on this point. The 
aboriginal people of Canada are the poorest people of Canada. 
The aboriginal population is also Canada's fastest growing 
population. The aboriginal population is growing at more than 
twice the rate of the Canadian population.
<P>
	The aboriginal population is also a very young population. 
Over 40 per cent are under the age of 25 and the need for 
housing, education, and social services are great. While 
improvements have been made over the years in community 
conditions and individual circumstances, the fact remains as I 
said earlier that aboriginal social and economic conditions still 
remain significantly below those of other Canadians.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is still much work to be done. This government will not 
abandon aboriginal people. We are continuing to work on the 
fair and expeditious settlement of land claims. We are investing 
additional funds in post-secondary education. Education and 
economic wherewithal through a secure land and resources base 
are necessary tools for jobs and development and for building 
healthier and stronger communities.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague, the member for Nunatsiaq. 
Interestingly enough, there are Crees and Inuit in my riding also 
and I represent them.
<P>
	His speech made me wonder about something and, since he is 
part of the government, maybe he can give me an answer. 
Transportation subsidies for food and goods destined for the 
Crees and Inuit, and, in his case, the Inuit in the Northwest 
Territories, will not increase; some cuts are even planned. There 
is a high birth rate in those communities; how can these people 
feed their children adequately?
<P>
	Transportation subsidies are frozen and since food is often 
brought in by plane, families go without fresh produce, children 
do not get the fruits and vegetables necessary to their 
development. As a member of Parliament, can he explain how 
his people will find the money necessary for their own 
development?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the member for the question. Because of the riding he 
represents, the hon. member is as aware as I am of the high cost 
of food in the north.
<P>
	I have been assigned the task of looking at the food mail 
program. I am to report back to the minister of Indian and 
northern affairs and the Minister of Health by the fall. I will be 
assisted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health who probably knows more about the nutritional values of 
fruits and vegetables, et cetera, than I do. I know the nutritional 
values of meat. If anyone wants to know about the nutritional 
values of meat, I can expound on that.
<P>
	When I was sitting on the other side of the House the 
government of the day decided to slash that program, to 
eliminate it over a period of years. There was a cut in the last 
year but I think it is being sustained until the review is finished.
<P>
	I assure the member that during the review we want to see how 
we can improve it. I will be seeking the member's comments on 
this. We know that money is very hard to come by today, but we 
want to see how we can improve the program so that we can 
stretch it out further to the people who have the highest cost of 
living anywhere in Canada and perhaps anywhere in the world.
<P>
	I am sure members have heard me expound on the high cost of 
food in the north. A litre of milk costs $5 and a loaf of bread 
costs $3.95. There has to be a way to reflect the needs of the 
people in the north on how best to ensure that they get nutritional 
food.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	As the hon. member is well aware, and we have been 
expounding on it, the north has to be considered at the same 
level as the west, the east or central Canada. Therefore the 
services the people in the west and the east are used to should be 
available in the north, whether food or other services such as 
those of doctors, nurses, teachers and so on.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member. I will be seeking his comments as 
well, because of the area he represents, on how to improve the 
particular problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the hon. 
member aware that over the last 20 years spending through the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
increased by some 750 per cent, yet conditions in the 
communities that native people live in have essentially 
remained the same?
<P>
	Is the hon. member aware that within the last four years 
DIAND has committed $1 billion toward native economic 
development? The auditor general's report last year clearly 
shows that the effect of that spending has been absolutely 
negligible in terms of its desired goals. In other words, the 
demand for social services continues to rise on a steady trend, 
the unemployment levels continue to rise on a steady trend, and 
the demand for social assistance increases in real dollar terms. 
This massive spending by the federal government has been an 
abject failure.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree that maybe it is time to review 
what the goals of the spending programs of DIAND were 
designed to do, whether or not they are actually achieving the 
goals, and whether the whole initiative the federal government 
has been engaged in for the last 25 years has been completely 
wrongheaded?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not particularly agree the 
situation is any worse since we have come to power. I should 
know. I go to my riding as much as I can and I go to other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13408"> 13408 </A></B>
<P>
aboriginal areas in Canada. There is still a lot of work to be done 
but conditions have been improving on reserves.
<P>
	I refer to the comments we got from Chief Ralph Caribou of 
Pukatawagan, Manitoba:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am very happy to report that the skin problems amongst our people have 
decreased considerably this spring.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is because of the water and sewage program introduced 
in Pukatawagan. Conditions are improving. There is a lot of 
work to be done and we are doing it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased, as 
official opposition critic for youth and training, to talk about the 
motion introduced by my colleague for Mercier and dealing with 
the Department of Human Resources Development estimates, 
more particularly with employment services.
<P>
	The first thing I would like to say is that grants and 
contributions under the employment and insurance program are 
presented in a misleading manner. Looking at pages 12.6 and 
12.7 of the main estimates, you might think that grants and 
contributions to the program have increased from 
$1,281,552,000 in 1994-1995 to $1,354,381,000 in 1995-1996.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	However, the total of grants and contributions for 1995-1996 
includes grants to individuals under the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy, as well as contributions to provincial governments for 
the older worker adjustment program which were not there 
previously. The same amount for 1994-1995 does not include 
these grants and contributions and that explains the increase 
from one year to the next.
<P>
	If you take these two items in consideration for both years, the 
total of grants and contributions decreases from $1,614,444,000 
in 1994-1995 to $1,354,381,000 in 1995-1996. It is therefore a 
decrease of $260 million or about 16 per cent. The most 
important cuts are in the employment programs and in the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy.
<P>
	We are particularly interested in the cuts in the employment 
programs. As the auditor general has often said, the 
departmental expenditure plans are more a way of hiding things 
than of informing people. The Department of Human Resources 
Development is more guilty than others in that regard, since it is 
presenting the information in a confusing and incomplete way.
<P>
	When the time comes to collect taxes, the federal government 
is very clear. But when it has to explain what it does with the 
money, all of a sudden, everything is obscure.
<P>
	Table 6, on page 2-24, shows that Quebec is not receiving 
enough of the employment programs' funds. According to these 
statistics, Quebec gets, in fact, 21 per cent of the federal funds in 
that field, when it accounts for 24 per cent of the Canadian 
population.
<P>
	The Department's estimated manpower training spending, 
funded by the unemployment insurance fund, should reach 
about $1.9 billion in 1995, $521 million of which is for Quebec, 
which represents, in this case, a little more than its share of the 
Canadian population, that is 27.4 per cent of the total spending.
<P>
	Since, in 1995, the regular benefits in Quebec cost $3.4 
billion out of a total for Canada of $10.3 billion, which amounts 
to 33 per cent of the total, Quebec stands to lose $113 million.
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government perpetuates duplication 
and overlap by putting in place new programs, such as the youth 
service corps and the young trainee program. It shows clearly 
that Ottawa does not want to get out of that area of provincial 
jurisdiction. As well, the federal government tried to interfere in 
the area of education last fall by creating the fund for initiatives 
in the acquisition of knowledge and the office of learning 
technologies.
<P>
	Even if the federal government is hiding its intervention by 
avoiding the word ``education'', it is precisely in that field of 
provincial jurisdiction that it wants to intervene more and more 
actively, as we can see from the new initiatives.
<P>
	Speaking of figures, I would have liked to dwell more on the 
resources given to young Canadians, but I must say that getting 
those numbers is not easy. I am not talking about what was 
announced in a press release, for example, when the minister 
made public a certain number of initiatives last year. They were 
implemented later on, but we could not get the figures and 
details on where these services are offered and how much money 
was spent.
<P>
	We were unable to get the figures for this year and last, 
although we asked for them on several occasions; we even asked 
the minister when he appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development. We can wonder why budget 
estimates concerning programs related to youth initiatives are 
not included in the government's estimates. Yet, they involve 
expenditures of several millions. This is also true in other areas 
of the department.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Thus last year we had to call each and every manpower centre 
in Quebec to ask for the amounts of money available for 
manpower development programs in the whole of Quebec 
because there was no breakdown of this information by 
province.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, at the Human Resources Development 
Committee, I also asked senior officials about cuts in the 
amounts allocated to education support.  There is a $262 million 
reduction from 1994-95 to 1995-96. Again last week we were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13409"> 13409 </A></B>
<P>
told that we would get the answer a little later because all the 
information had not been compiled.
<P>
	Is the answer so complicated that the minister, his staff and 
his high officials are not able to give us an answer? Or is it 
because they have something to hide? If public servants cannot 
cope, why cut 5,000 jobs at Human Resources Development, a 
department which is precisely committed to finding jobs for 
those who are out of work, the unemployed and welfare 
recipients? We could also ask why new structures like the Youth 
Service Corps are created if we are about to close manpower 
centres?
<P>
	In Quebec the minister says that the decision has not been 
taken. Yet, all employees presently working in Labour Canada 
centres already know that there will be a reduction in the number 
of manpower centres in Quebec. The number of regional centres 
is expected to drop from 100 to 30. This is not very encouraging 
for people who would like to receive employment services from 
the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The department is cutting its spending, but is also cutting 
grants to organizations dedicated to employment development, 
particularly among young people. In the last two years, a 15 per 
cent cut has been announced. Yet, these organizations had a 
placement rate of 75 per cent, which is significantly higher than 
many government services. What happened?
<P>
	Contracts are for one year only, and we saw recently, at the 
end of the fiscal year, that the minister delayed giving an answer 
for the current year, with the result that, in some cases, it took 
two weeks to get an answer for the current year, with a warning 
that, this time, the contract would end on March 31. So, this 
suggested that further cuts might be made in the next budget. Of 
course, such cuts were announced in the budget. This suggests 
that further cuts will be made, beyond this 15 per cent.
<P>
	Meanwhile, as the government wants to make cuts to 
manpower centres in Canada and has already announced some 
cuts in the positions of counsellors, the very people who are 
there to help the unemployed find jobs, as it is cutting grants to 
organizations dedicated to employment development, 
particularly among young people, by 15 per cent, last year, it set 
up a new program called the youth service corps. I want to 
remind people that this is a new name given to a previous 
program, killed by the Conservatives when they took office, 
which was called Katimavik. This program seemed to be very 
dear to Senator Jacques Hébert, whose hunger strike conducted 
on that issue was extensively commented on by the media.
<P>
	Katimavik was re-established under the new name of youth 
service corps, but for what purposes? Occupational activities for 
youngsters like cleaning river banks, community projects, some 
travelling. In the meantime, very productive organisations 
providing help to people looking for a job had their budget cut.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	Some are very clever when playing with numbers. For 
example, the minister told us not long ago that larger amounts of 
money were invested in the creation of summer jobs for 
students. It is always the same thing. He gets this result by 
adding data from the summer component of the young Canada 
works program and from the challenge program, which now has 
a new name. By compiling these data, he is able to claim that we 
spend as much and maybe more than last year on summer jobs 
for young people, although Young Canada Works is intended for 
much younger people and is offering activities which have 
nothing to do with any future occupation.
<P>
	As I just demonstrated, in the area of social programs, the 
government tried to give less money, provide fewer services, 
and allocate fewer resources to help people find jobs. What is 
even more serious, however, is that the government-despite 
trying to blame the situation on its efforts to reduce the deficit 
and repay the debt, which will soon reach $548 billion-is 
pursuing another strategy that is totally inconsistent with this. It 
is trying to interfere to a greater extent in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, as it did yesterday by passing Bill C-76.
<P>
	In addition to implementing some budget provisions, Bill 
C-76 allows the government not only to maintain health care 
standards but also to set new national standards in education and 
job training.
<P>
	I am talking about the bill that was passed yesterday, but we 
saw it coming as early as last year, when the government clearly 
stated in its first budget its intention of moving in this direction. 
Besides the government, there are the advisory committees such 
as the National Advisory Board on Science and Technology, 
which, in its report submitted to the Prime Minister in May 
1994, states that it is imperative that national standards of 
excellence be set with regard to the acquisition of skills and 
knowledge essential to good economic performance. After 
recently reading this little known report and checking with this 
advisory board, we realized that this study was done at the 
request of the Prime Minister's office.
<P>
	Since federal funding for education comes mainly from the 
Human Resources Development Department, one would have 
expected this issue to be referred to the committee responsible 
for this department, on which I sit, or another related committee. 
Instead, it falls to an advisory committee on science and 
technology to examine the issue, at the Prime Minister's 
specific request.
<P>
	If this report was completed in May 1994, this means that it 
was in preparation for a number of weeks or months before that. 
It is obvious that, almost as soon as it came to power, the new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13410"> 13410 </A></B>
<P>
government had the clear intention of interfering further in the 
area of education.
<P>
	I recognize two government members who were on the team 
assigned to travel across Canada. They noticed, as I did, and this 
is a fact, that as far as national standards on education and other 
matters are concerned, throughout Canada except Quebec, and 
more in Alberta than anywhere else, people expected the federal 
government to step in because they were getting the feeling that 
their provincial government was going to the dogs and starting 
to cut social programs. I realized that, in the rest of Canada, 
Canadians did not care as much as we do about the fact that the 
provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over certain areas, such as 
education, health and social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	However, in Quebec, the committee was able to see that it was 
just the opposite. Because of our distinctiveness, culture and 
history, because we are a nation, we want education to remain 
under provincial jurisdiction in Quebec.
<P>
	The rest of Canada may change its views on social programs 
or education if it pleases, but we want to manage all of that 
ourselves. Since World War II, the federal government has been 
using its spending power, its power to collect taxes and 
redistribute funds in the areas I just mentioned: health and 
education in particular. It dips in the pockets of every taxpayer 
in Canada, including Quebec, to pay for that.
<P>
	We demand our share, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Ideally, you know, tax points should be transferred to us. This is 
what we want. Quebec's National Assembly is unanimous in 
requesting this. Our claims began not even under the PQ 
government, but under the previous Liberal government. On 
many occasions, we asked for all our tax points for education 
and for job training.
<P>
	I spoke about youth unemployment. We must not forget that 
more than 400,000 Canadians under 24 are presently 
unemployed. In Quebec, where 18 per cent of young people in 
this age group are unemployed, the situation is particularly 
worrisome. Add to that people on welfare. After last year's 
budget, unemployment rates have gone down, but because of 
cuts in the UI program, there are few additional jobs available.
<P>
	That is why the Liberal member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
voted yesterday against his own government, claiming that 
social programs are being destroyed. Referring to his long 
experience in the House, he said that the proposals were 
completely contrary to what was done under Trudeau and 
Pearson. Everything they did was destroyed in two years. He 
opposed the measures with good reason.
<P>
	I am not of those who encourage parliamentary dissent, but in 
view of the reasons given by the hon. member, I think that it is 
worth mentioning.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance cuts are being made in three ways: 
by extending the eligibility period, by shortening the benefit 
period, and by reducing the benefit rate. More and more 
unemployed can no longer claim UI benefits and are forced on to 
the welfare rolls.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me to mention a particular case in my 
riding, which reflects the unemployment situation and which we 
have not heard from in quite a while. I am referring to the MIL 
Davie shipyard. Two years ago, 3,000 people were working at 
that shipyard which, like Saint John Shipbuilding, used to build 
frigates, military vessels. However, the number of orders has 
dropped since the end of the cold war.
<P>
	As you know, during the election campaign, the government 
now in office promised ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. Yet, the figures show 
that there are no more jobs now than before. Moreover, a large 
number of existing jobs are not secure. Young people and 
women seeking to rejoin the labour force are the two groups 
most affected by this situation.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	What happened to the shipyard? Nothing. The federal 
government indirectly gave $30 million to the Magdalen Islands 
shipping company for a used vessel. The Quebec government 
decided to do something and have a new vessel built, so as to 
create a number of jobs.
<P>
	However, it is terrible to see 3,000 people in a riding like mine 
suddenly lose their jobs. Yet, since the local Canada manpower 
centre, along with Quebec, set up a reclassification committee, 
the unemployment data for the Quebec City region were not 
overly affected. There was a 0.4 per cent increase over a one 
year period. So the unemployment rate went from 12.4 per cent, 
in 1994, to 12.8 per cent this year.
<P>
	MIL Davie workers were affected by the UI cuts. In Quebec, 
and that includes the Quebec City region, an additional 31,000 
people are on the welfare rolls because of the cuts to the UI 
program.
<P>
	I know that some questions will follow. This will give me an 
opportunity to conclude.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
mentioned that two fellow members of the human resources 
development standing committee are in the House. This reminds 
me of last November or December when our committee held 
hearings in 27 cities. I mention 27 cities to my hon. friend 
because some of us visited different cities. We held hearings in 
27 cities in 35 days in 10 provinces and 2 territories, including 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13411"> 13411 </A></B>
<P>
the eastern Arctic. If anyone thought that was a complete 
holiday I would ask them to try to do the same thing.
<P>
	My hon. colleague reminded me of the evenings. I especially 
remember one evening that involved a 45-minute trip from the 
airport in Sudbury to the hotel. It was cold and snowing but we 
had the most beautiful Christmas carols with a bilingual 
rendition supplied by the hon. member and the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Prime Minister who is here now beside me. This 
bilingual rendition of ``Silent Night'' should have been cut on a 
CD. I am sure our sales would have been very high.
<P>
	We got along very well most of the time. The hon. member 
tells us that HRD is closing down employment centres across the 
country and there will be less points from which people can get 
services. I wonder if the hon. member has been listening to the 
minister who is always so prompt and efficient in telling about 
the future.
<P>
	There will be more centres for information, more access 
points in Canada than ever before. Kiosks will be set up. 
Canadians will get better service than they have ever had before.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the government is cutting back 
on bureaucrats and on civil servants. Does the hon. member not 
have confidence in the dedicated civil servants who will do a 
great job to take up the challenge to provide the best services 
possible to all Canadians?
<P>
	The hon. member might realize that during those hearings in 
Quebec, as in all parts of Canada, there was one thing the people 
asked of us. They wanted hope and to see a light for the future. 
They wanted jobs and a chance to get back into mainstream 
Canada. They wanted their self-esteem to be improved. They 
wanted opportunities.
<P>
	I recognize my colleague as having a lot of talent, but would 
the hon. gentleman focus on getting our fellow Canadians back 
to work rather than trying to tear the country apart?
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	With the talents that are sitting here opposite us, what a 
difference we could make if we did not spend hours and days and 
months trying to destroy what our forefathers have put together.
<P>
	I dare say that if you go out on the streets of your home town 
or I do in my home town, our citizens have nothing against each 
other. They would like to live in peace and harmony and be able 
to feel that we are part of this one great country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague, who is a fellow 
member of the Committee on human resources development, is 
right to recall something that happened at Christmas time. 
Members of different parties sang together. This shows, on our 
part at any rate, that our intention is not to fight against 
individuals, against other Canadians, because we do not dislike 
them, we do like them, even though some are even more likable 
than  others. We like them a lot and we feel that some of them do 
like us too.
<P>
	That is not the problem. The problem is with the system, a two 
tier system, a federal system that might be suitable for the rest of 
Canada, but not for Quebecers. Even though you do like us, even 
though we keep repeating the same things to you, you do not 
understand how important it is for us to manage the areas of 
provincial jurisdiction mentioned in the constitution, like 
education. Yet everything was spelled out in this contract 
concluded in 1867 between the two founding peoples which had 
agreed upon that.
<P>
	You know very well that since World War II, the federal 
government, through its spending power, has been interfering in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, and Quebec resents that. Yes, 
we are a different people, even though we do like you. This is not 
about fighting each other. That is why the Bloc Quebecois has 
stressed the need to maintain an economic union with the rest of 
Canada, and to propose such a union.
<P>
	As for the management of public finances, and our taxes, as 
for what we feel is important to us like education and job 
training, we would like to manage that by ourselves. We are 
telling you again. You do like us, but you do not understand. If 
the minister or his predecessors understood or cared to give the 
impression they understand, the problem would easily be 
solved. The government could take the funds earmarked for 
occupational training, give tax points to Quebec, and set 
national standards for the rest of Canada.
<P>
	We are not trying to paralyse the rest of Canada. We simply 
want to use the powers that were granted to us in 1867. Those are 
Quebec's historical demands.
<P>
	The hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi is well aware of 
that, since he is from Quebec. All Quebec governments, 
including the Liberal government of which his brother was a 
member, demanded that tax points for occupational training be 
handed over. He should understand. He knows what this is all 
about. But there is the party line. The party line held fast despite 
all the demonstrations witnessed by my two honourable 
colleagues who sat on the human resources development 
committee. Yesterday, they voted with the government on Bill 
C-76 implementing the budget, despite all they had seen and 
heard, like tables being overturned in Montreal, and 
demonstrations in Vancouver.
<P>
	I went to 23 of the 27 cities you mentioned, and you know 
perfectly well that there were demonstrations in all of them. 
People do not want cuts in social programs. They say our deficit 
and our debt are not due to social programs, and that the roots of 
the problem are to be found elsewhere, particularly in our tax 
system.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, I 
remind the hon. members that they should always address the 
Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I remind colleagues on both sides of the House to make all 
your interventions through the Chair and not directly to one 
another. Maybe not today, but in another debate on another day it 
could be very useful that we follow the best parliamentary 
traditions of this House.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am honoured to speak in support of full supply for the 1995-96 
main estimates.
<P>
	In the preparation of these main estimates, the government 
made not only the tough spending and program choices 
necessary to meet its fiscal targets; equally important, it has 
taken steps to ensure that control over spending becomes a 
permanent feature in the management of the government's 
programs.
<P>
	As announced by the President of the Treasury Board on 
February 15, 1995, a new expenditure management system, 
EMS, is being implemented. This represents the most 
significant overhaul of the government's expenditure system 
since the early 1980s.
<P>
	EMS is a system designed to ensure that we keep spending 
under control and provide the best programs and services 
possible within the resources available. Among its key features, 
EMS emphasizes the ongoing review of programs and managing 
through reallocations. This is significant because new 
initiatives as well as most cost increases in existing programs 
will be financed through reallocation from lower priority 
programs.
<P>
	The central policy reserves, which were traditionally a source 
of funds for new initiatives and did not encourage the ongoing 
review of existing programs, are being eliminated. A 
contingency reserve will continue to cover the risk of statutory 
expenditures exceeding their projections. It would be used, for 
example, to respond to changing economic conditions. In 
addition, the Treasury Board will continue to manage a small 
operating reserve. However, the role of the reserve will be 
altered from funder to banker. Departments borrowing from the 
operating reserve will have to repay advances with interest in 
future years.
<P>
	In addition, in cases where reallocation is not feasible 
priorities for access to the operating reserve have been 
established. In considering requests priority will be given to 
funding bridge financing projects that offer significant 
productivity payback, meeting urgent health and safety 
requirements and protecting the essential integrity of critical 
programs and the capital asset base.
<P>
	To ensure that we stay on track and reduce the deficit and meet 
our fiscal targets program planning will become more closely 
integrated with the budget planning process. Decisions on new 
initiatives and major spending reallocations required to finance 
these new initiatives will generally occur during the annual 
preparation of the budget.
<P>
	The establishment of program review and resource allocation 
as an integral part of the budget process means that the 
opportunities to propose new spending will be reduced. 
Ministers are called upon to manage within the resource limits 
of their respective portfolios.
<P>
	The government recognizes that funding through reallocation 
of resources calls for a more strategic approach to resource 
management at all levels. For this reason, the EMS requires the 
preparation of departmental business plans. In these business 
plans, departments are responsible for determining how existing 
programs must be changed to meet expenditure targets and new 
government priorities.
<P>
	The multi-year time frame of business plans will encourage 
departments to look ahead and examine the major directions and 
objectives that should be pursued for the planning period, which 
is the estimates year plus two future years at a minimum.
<P>
	A major focus of the business plan is the identification of 
strategies to bring about the major changes and adjustments that 
are needed. Other elements include the goals, targets, and 
performance measures that will be used to assess program 
results and performance information concerning areas affected 
by the significant changes.
<P>
	In addition, it is important to note that the business plans take 
an integrated approach to the management of change by 
examining all functions that are central to the department in 
making business adjustments, whether they be financial, 
human, technological, or capital. Business plans will help 
departments and central agencies plan in an organized and 
methodical way to make the adjustments required to get 
government right during a time of rapid reductions in resources. 
Furthermore, these plans will enhance the information available 
to Treasury Board ministers. Decisions on Treasury Board 
submissions will be made in the context of strategic perspective 
and clear business direction for each department and agency.
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons will also be able to 
review the overall thrust of departmental programs over a 
multi-year period. In February 1994 the government introduced 
changes to our Standing Orders of the House of Commons, 
including Standing Order 81(7), which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When main estimates are referred to a standing committee, the committee 
shall also be empowered to consider and report upon the expenditure plans and 
priorities in future fiscal years of the departments and agencies whose main 
estimates are before it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13413"> 13413 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	To assist members of the standing committees in carrying out 
their responsibility to consider and report on departmental 
expenditure trends and priorities for future fiscal years, 
ministers will provide the departmental outlook document 
directly to the chairpersons of the respective standing 
committees.
<P>
	The departmental outlooks are based on the results of the 
business planning process. They will describe management and 
operational strategies departments intend to pursue over a 
multi-year time frame in order to make whatever fiscal and 
policy adjustments are necessary to deliver government 
services.
<P>
	I am confident that parliamentarians will have a better 
perspective on the issues facing the government and the 
downstream implications of government spending as a result of 
the introduction of departmental outlook documents. 
Departmental outlooks are one example of the government's 
efforts to improve information available to all parliamentarians 
on government programs.
<P>
	The government is also striving to enhance the performance 
information that is provided to Parliament. In recent years 
departments and agencies have been developing service 
standards in order to advise the clients of government programs 
what level of service they can expect in terms of timeliness, 
accessibility, reliability and responsiveness, and what action to 
take if service does not meet these standards. All departments 
and agencies will have developed standards for their primary 
services by the end of 1995. The publication of departmental 
performance in relation to these standards has already begun.
<P>
	With the expenditure management system parliamentarians 
have an opportunity to become fully engaged in expenditure 
planning. Consultation with Parliament is in fact one of the 
guiding principles of this approach. Parliamentarians will be 
able to support ministers and their departmental officials in their 
efforts to reallocate resources and meet our target of reducing 
the deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97.
<P>
	The government will be consulting us on important initiatives 
designed to provide better information to Parliament while 
enhancing the accountability and flexibility of departments in 
managing their resources. In particular, I would draw your 
attention to the reform of the estimates currently under 
consideration. The introduction of departmental outlook 
documents emphasizes the need to rationalize reporting to 
Parliament. The current form and context of part III of the 
estimates and the departmental expenditure plans were derived 
from information needs defined by parliamentarians over a 
decade ago. Parliamentarians should now take the time to 
comment fully on how reporting to Parliament could be 
improved. The question to consider is how does the government 
ensure that the  part IIIs meet the information requirement of 
parliamentarians today without placing an undue reporting 
burden on departments or agencies.
<P>
	In addition to part IIIs, the reform of the estimates will focus 
on a number of related issues where changes may be introduced 
to create flexibilities and incentives for departments to manage 
their resource requirements through reallocation. The option of 
increasing the vote threshold for separate capital expenditures, 
grants, and contribution votes is a good example of the changes 
being considered in the context of the reform of the estimates.
<P>
	The current threshold of $5 million was established in 
consultation with the standing committee on public accounts 
during the 1970 reform of the estimates. Over the past 25 years 
the number of separate votes has increased, in part simply as a 
result of inflation. To expand managers' flexibility to reallocate 
resources we should consider increasing the threshold at least to 
a level that would take into account the impact of inflation on 
capital expenditures, grants, and contributions.
<P>
	A related option being examined is the possibility of 
establishing an operating budget vote. Minor capital 
expenditures are considered to be part of the operating budget. 
However, for departments and agencies with separate operating 
and capital votes minor capital expenditures are included in the 
capital votes. An operating budget vote would allow managers 
to use the full flexibility of the operating budget to transfer 
funds between minor capital, operating, and personnel 
expenditures.
<P>
	In summary, the new expenditure management system will 
provide for ongoing review of programs and spending to reduce 
expenditures and identify opportunities for reallocation to 
higher priority programs. It includes parliamentary and public 
input into the budgetary process. It introduces better strategic 
planning and a process for adjustment programs and services 
through the implementation of departmental business plans. It 
also improves accountability through a focus on making better 
performance information available to Parliament and the public.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	I remind members the overhaul of the expenditure 
management system formalizes the approach the government 
has taken to decision making on spending, namely financing, 
through reallocation. It is a major step forward in fostering 
greater fiscal responsibility and making the best use of 
taxpayers' money in delivering high quality service to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed the talk from the hon. member about the new 
expenditure management system. I think there are, at least 
potentially, some innovative and good ideas from the 
government. It remains to be seen how that will be played out in 
the actual budgetary process. At least on paper there seems to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13414"> 13414 </A></B>
<P>
some hope and optimism for improvement of the budgetary 
management system. For that we should all be grateful.
<P>
	I am wondering if the member would comment on what we are 
doing tonight, working late on the estimates. It seems to me one 
other improvement to the system could be that instead of voting 
on the whole sum of the estimates, to vote on a reduction in the 
estimates. In other words, if we wanted to reduce the estimate by 
a million dollars, we vote on the reduction rather than voting on 
the whole block sum, which means we either have zero 
expenditures or the entire sum the minister would like.
<P>
	I wonder if he thinks the estimates procedure would have 
more validity with the Canadian public by allowing some input 
at the end of the process instead of only at the beginning of the 
budgetary expenditure process he talked about. Does he think 
that is a good idea?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for noting 
that a number of ideas and proposals have been tabled by the 
government with regard to the expenditure management system, 
many of which I outlined in my comments.
<P>
	We are working late. We expect the debate will carry on until 
10 p.m. We have votes following that. I understand there are 
some 63 votes.
<P>
	The House through its co-operative approach to House 
business has adopted a new approach to deal with the votes 
members take here. The other evening we did manage to get 
through some 19 votes in a very short time. That is the kind of 
example that bodes well for the suggestion the member has 
made that possibly the entire process of the estimates tabled by 
the President of the Treasury Board could be streamlined so that 
we could put some focus on those areas, particularly where 
changes, adjustment or reductions are being proposed by hon. 
members, and that the debate be focused on those items.
<P>
	That is a productive approach and I encourage all members to 
make that input in the House and directly to the President of the 
Treasury Board. I am sure productive suggestions such as that 
will get very careful consideration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech made by the 
hon. member who described briefly the management control 
system the government is trying to set up.
<P>
	Indeed, this is an issue that concerns all hon. members. As 
elected representatives, we wonder how to regain control over 
the bureaucracy, to get more leeway in our dealings with the 
public servants and, especially, to be advised in a more timely 
manner of the decisions that need to be made. How are we to 
explain the difference between the commitments made by the 
current government when it took office and the very few  
achievements it has made since then and the results it got, 
especially in terms of job creation, if not by pointing out the 
influence of the federal bureaucrats?
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	I would like to know if the hon. member would, in order to 
show that the government is acting in good faith, be in favour of 
implementing the new management system right away in two 
specific instances, the first being the following. Some decisions 
found in this year's budget will only come into effect in 
1997-1998. For example, the experimental farm in La Pocatière 
will be closed on or before March 31, 1997. Under these 
circumstances, could it be possible to review this decision 
during the new prebudget consultation process, so that if we 
were to realize that the decision is wrong, we could try to 
convince the government to reconsider?
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to give you another example which 
deals with the reorganization of the employment centres. As a 
sign of good faith, could the government refer the reform 
proposal prepared by its bureaucrats to the hon. members, so 
that they could express their views on it before the decision 
comes into effect?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
comment. I think the important principle here is that when the 
government considers changes to the way it operates, its 
procedure and expenditure management system and many of the 
decisions referred to by the member, it consults. It has consulted 
extensively right across the country. The important phrase is to 
get government right. It has to be done properly.
<P>
	The direction of the government and the proposals it has put 
forward will more fully implement the will of the House to get 
government right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to enter this debate on supply. The 
theme of my dissertation will be how to improve the 
accountability of government programs and make the systems 
more efficient.
<P>
	I have often wondered coming to the House how it was 
possible that Canada created the debt it has today. I think it is 
$550 billion and rising. I have often wondered who was 
controlling the cheque books and why it was so easy for the debt 
to accumulate, seemingly without the knowledge of a lot of the 
people in control.
<P>
	Did people actually ask for all the services they received, or 
for some reason did the system actually give them services they 
did not request?
<P>
	No one seems to have taken responsibility for our spending 
behaviour in the past. The government is now doing that, taking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13415"> 13415 </A></B>
<P>
control of expenditures and trying to find ways to effectively 
reduce them.
<P>
	Has the Treasury Board in the past acted as a comptroller? 
Time and again in investigating the role of the Treasury Board I 
have discovered it often delegates authority to individual 
departments. Invariably departments seem to control their own 
expenditures. Individual departments historically have 
overspent. In the private sector if that were the case we would 
expect job losses and all kinds of negative connotations. 
Overspending in the past seems to have been a merit system. As 
the department spent more money it became larger and larger.
<P>
	Studying the estimates is very difficult. I know members have 
a great deal of difficulty going through individual estimates to 
get a handle on how government spends. I am looking at the 
estimates and I see three lines. One is the 1995-96 estimates, 
one comparison column is the 1994-95 forecast, one is a 
1993-94 actual. None of these three columns is a place in time. 
None compares estimated to actual expenditures. It must be very 
difficult for members of Parliament and others reading these 
documents to make any sense of where expenditures are 
occurring and where we have overshot our original estimates.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	How can we make government accounting more 
understandable? I know we are moving slowly to set up an 
accrual system within government and to record assets. What do 
I mean by that? Currently the accounts of Canada are kept on a 
cash basis. We only record things when we actually pay for them 
and we only record revenue when we actually receive it.
<P>
	I am not trying to demean farmers but they have been keeping 
their records on this matter for the last 100 years. It seems the 
business of government is big business and we need a better 
methodology of capturing what governments are doing. A more 
understandable methodology would be instead of focusing on 
the expenditure system we now have, we possibly think about 
revising it. What do I mean by that?
<P>
	We should look at two aspects of expenditures, investments 
and consumption; in other words, governments spend and what 
do they spend on. They spend in forms of investment, which is 
education, training, anything that upgrades the skills of the 
country.
<P>
	The other expenditure is finance consumption. We look at 
programs like the Canada pension plan, unemployment 
insurance, transfer payments in support of social services. 
These are all programs in essence that finance consumption.
<P>
	If we could look at government accounts from a more focused 
point of view and ask ourselves whether it an expenditure for 
investment or an expenditure for consumption, we would have a 
better concept of how governments spend and more effectively 
how governments can spend so they are actually putting some 
good back into the economy. For instance, do we want to spend 
money on training or do we want to spend money  on 
unemployment insurance? Clearly our focus should be to 
upgrade skills, possibly focusing on high school students who 
have dropped out of the educational system and upgrading their 
skills so they can get back in the workforce.
<P>
	If we undertook an accounting system a little more focused it 
would give us a better idea of how governments spend and why. 
Clearly we have to reduce total expenditure but while we are 
reducing total expenditure we should also consider a shift from 
the consumption side of government to the investment side.
<P>
	Today I was pleased to introduce a private members' bill. 
Since it deals almost exclusively with this very area, certainly a 
coincidence, I cannot help but resist in speaking a little about 
what that private members' bill would do to increase the 
accountability of government programs.
<P>
	The bill basically requires all new programs entered into by 
the government, individual departments presenting programs to 
the House, prior to their being presented, be properly costed. 
Properly costed means they also have a certification by the 
auditor general that the methods of projecting costs were 
appropriate. This goes back to some of my original comments.
<P>
	How did we get into the problem of overspending in the first 
place? It seems we have fallen into a lull where we bring in 
programs that sound good, somebody says they cost a certain 
amount but nobody really knows because they have not taken the 
time to do that properly, and two or three years later when the 
bills start coming in we discover the thing is way out of hand.
<P>
<B>(2000 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill would also take these programs and cost them on a per 
capita basis. In other words, each individual in the country 
would know that he or she is paying <I>x</I> number of dollars as a 
share of this program. That may give individuals in the public 
domain a better perspective of what they are paying for these 
programs.
<P>
	People feel very removed from the estimates and other 
aspects of government financing. They feel it is not their money. 
Many people believe in magic, that somehow things happen 
magically either in Ottawa or the provincial capitals, that 
somehow the money coming back to them is not really theirs but 
the next door neighbour's or someone else's. If there was a 
proper accounting system that costed programs on a per capita 
basis, people would take more of an interest in the kinds of 
programs governments are announcing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13416"> 13416 </A></B>
<P>
	Other aspects of government must be encouraged to create 
competition. Competition can be created within government, 
within departments and also between governments and the 
private sector. Competition will also breed efficiency.
<P>
	In addition, a very important aspect of spending in the federal 
domain will be to affix responsibility. In other words, line 
managers should be responsible for their expenditures. We 
should also consider remuneration partially based on successful 
management of programs.
<P>
	I had a very interesting tour of a Darlington nuclear reactor 
which is in my riding. I was very surprised at what Ontario 
Hydro of all places has done. It has actually made individual 
managers responsible for the number of kilowatt hours produced 
in that plant. If the managers are under they lose part of their 
bonus. This marks the way we should be dealing with our 
expenditure programs as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. 
member started his intervention he said he was reflecting on 
how Canada got to be in the debt situation it finds itself in today. 
He was somewhat perplexed. He was wondering who had 
control of the cheque book.
<P>
	I am a little amazed this member would think the Reform 
Party would be so naive that we did not know who had control of 
the cheque book. Does the hon. member recognize the names of 
MacEachen, Turner and Chrétien who all had control of the 
cheque book in the seventies and the eighties while this debt was 
being racked up?
<P>
	I find it amazing that Liberal members in the House will ask 
how did Canada get into the situation that it is in today and will 
start pointing fingers at the Tories and others and not be willing 
to shoulder the blame themselves, because the blame falls 
squarely on their shoulders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments. It is unfortunate we have to take a serious matter 
such as government financing where we are all trying to find 
solutions to Canada's debt problems and turn it into a political 
charade.
<P>
	The reality is all western countries: the United States, the 
United Kingdom, all OECD countries, during this same period 
of time ran significant deficits. It is not a unique Canadian 
problem. It is not related particularly to the Liberal Party, the 
Tories or anybody else. It was a symptom that occurred in North 
America and Europe, in fact, in most western countries.
<P>
	I am trying to find out why it happened so it is not repeated. 
That is enough of an acknowledgement. The reality is we cannot 
talk about the past forever. We have to get on with the future, 
which is what the government is trying to do. It has a very good 
plan and it should be supported.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to ask a question. It is 
absolutely amazing that the hon. member does not understand 
how it happened. It is really very simple how it happened. If the 
government spends more than it takes in it will end up in a 
deficit situation. If the government keeps doing that every year, 
time and time again, the answer is that the debt gets larger and 
larger.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	The member then makes the comment that perhaps since all 
the other nations are in that situation Canada would be in that 
situation too. This reminds me a little bit of a farmer who says: 
``Just because my neighbour drove his tractor into the ditch I 
should too''. That does not make any kind of sense at all.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that the way this happened was 
that governments spent more than they took in. When are we 
going to be independent and responsible to the taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I do not think he can give me any lessons in 
mathematics on things I already know and that is obviously that 
deficits occur by the very fact that more money is spent than is 
brought in.
<P>
	The essence of the member's question is that he does not seem 
to have been sitting in this place for too long or maybe he has 
been away. The reality is that there are significant reductions in 
government expenditures. The Western Grain Transportation 
Act will affect his constituents. The Atlantic freight subsidies 
have been eliminated. There have been substantial changes in 
attitude toward privatization. Canadian National railway is 
being privatized. Numbers in the civil service are being reduced. 
Therefore, the reality is that expenditure reductions are 
occurring.
<P>
	The government is taking a balanced approach to this. I do not 
think it can cut to the point where it would actually push the 
country back into a recession. The growth rate in the economy 
right now is somewhere between 3 per cent and 4 per cent which 
increases government revenues. Therefore, it is a balanced 
approach between expenditure reductions and, at the same time, 
attempting to get the economy to grow.
<P>
	The Reform Party would take a slash and burn approach so 
that the 3 per cent figure would turn into a recession and 
everybody in the country would be back on the unemployment 
lines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
make a couple of points.
<P>
	First, I would like to try to distance his comments from the 
Prime Minister who was finance minister as these deficits 
started increasing dramatically. If the member would at least 
acknowledge that an error was made at the time and that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13417"> 13417 </A></B>
<P>
government was going to try to correct the error, he would be 
moving in the right direction.
<P>
	The second point is that to make a statement that the 
government has lowered its spending is totally out of line. 
Spending in this budget, by the government's own figures, has 
increased by about $1.5 billion. Therefore, let him be accurate 
about the budget. I would think this member would know this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Once again, Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party 
has a lot of difficulty with mathematics.
<P>
	Essentially the expenditure increases are increasing at a 
decreasing rate. This is the first time that has happened. The last 
two budgets that the government has been involved in it has 
actually met its targets. It is the first time that I can remember in 
my lifetime when not only did it meet its budget targets but 
actually exceeded them by $4 billion. This is a success story, not 
a failure.
<P>
	Reform members want to go back and study history. I think 
this is what is wrong with them, they are not forward looking. 
They do not understand how we are to solve these problems 
because they keep looking back in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to inform you that I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague from Skeena.
<P>
	It is clear to everyone but the Liberal government that its 30 
years of social engineering experiments have failed and failed 
miserably. The main reason why social programs have become 
unaffordable and unsustainable is because they create greater 
and greater dependency on social programs. No matter how 
these programs are designed, the end result would always be the 
same. More and more people would use the system and 
eventually it becomes unsustainable. The government can no 
longer afford to pay the huge sums of money needed to satisfy 
everyone's so-called needs. This is why half of the people on 
welfare today are described as employable. That is why the 
unemployment insurance program actually creates 
unemployment.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	I will give an example of some of the things that the auditor 
general has said in his 1994 report. He said: ``Rising social 
program use and high repeated use suggests that social programs 
may be creating long term dependency among some users''. 
Here is something else the auditor general said: ``Disincentives 
to work are created when benefits from social programs 
compare favourably to earnings from jobs''. He also said: 
``Employers and employees may be using unemployment 
insurance to support short term layoff strategies''. ``Interactions 
among social programs may result in programs working at cross 
purposes to each other''. Finally, the auditor general said: 
``Unemployment insurance may be a factor in Canada's rising 
level of unemployment and in the lower level of outputs that 
result''.
<P>
	Today we are debating a motion which will authorize the 
government through the Department of Human Resources 
Development to spend over $1.3 billion. The same lack of 
thinking that the auditor general reported last year is evident 
today.
<P>
	The government is proposing to spend $55.3 million on grants 
to improve employability and promote employment 
opportunities. It can provide no proof that the money it has spent 
on such grants in the past has improved employability and yet it 
continues with this program. It can provide no proof that the 
millions and millions of dollars have actually resulted in 
promoting employment opportunities and actually have resulted 
in real jobs.
<P>
	If this motion passes, the government will spend over $1 
billion on grants to the sectoral training fund and on payments to 
facilitate the efficient functioning of the labour market, 
whatever that is. Study after study shows that make work 
projects do not create jobs. Study after study shows the 
government's training programs fail to train people for real jobs 
that are needed by the private sector.
<P>
	The government cannot predict where the job vacancies will 
be next year, let alone five or ten years from now. When will it 
realize it should leave the hard earned tax dollars in the 
taxpayers' pockets and let individuals pay for the training they 
think they need? When will it realize it should leave the hard 
earned tax dollars in the hands of employers so they can run their 
own on the job training programs which are far more effective 
than any other type of training?
<P>
	The government wants to force people into institutions to take 
training for jobs that are downright scarce or non-existent. It 
pays for training and employment programs because it supports 
the status quo. These programs actually support a huge 
bureaucracy that could not survive if it were judged on 
effectiveness and results. These programs support government 
handouts to special interest groups that are also more interested 
in the survival of their own organizations than they are about the 
workers they purport to represent.
<P>
	The vote on this $1.3 billion of taxpayers' hard earned money 
is an admission of failure by the government. It is an admission 
that it is committed to repeating the failed policies of the past 30 
years. It is an admission that it has no new ideas about how to get 
people back to work.
<P>
	The government knows the only way to create real jobs is to 
reduce spending, balance the budget, reduce taxes. Reducing 
taxes creates real jobs. Government programs like these create 
more government spending, which creates more debt, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13418"> 13418 </A></B>
<P>
creates higher interest payments, which creates higher taxes 
which kills jobs.
<P>
	While we were having this last exchange a few minutes ago 
one of my colleagues went out to get a book to actually show the 
members opposite what the budget is all about. They do not 
believe that when the government says it is making all these 
difficult cuts it is actually increasing spending. They do not 
understand by their own numbers that they are not doing what 
they claim they are doing.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	Higher taxes kill jobs. George Orwell's doublespeak is alive 
and well in the Liberal government. They tax the people and 
employers, which kills jobs, and then spend the money on 
programs that they say will create jobs. More jobs could actually 
have been created by simply not taxing the workers and the 
employers in the first place.
<P>
	When will the government learn? How many more billions 
will we have to waste? How long will it take for the Canadian 
people to realize the Liberals and Conservatives are the same? 
Those who came before them and those who are here presently 
have been running a shell game, which benefits mainly the 
bureaucrats and the politicians.
<P>
	Even if these programs did work, and they do not, training and 
employment programs are areas of provincial jurisdiction under 
the Canadian Constitution. It is not the job of the federal 
government to even be involved in that.
<P>
	The federal government is proposing to spend $1,329,481,000 
in an area that is the sole jurisdiction of the provincial 
government. If I were the premier of a province I would be 
demanding that the government quit taxing my people by the 
amount they are spending in my province and get off my turf.
<P>
	If government members wanted to understand how to prepare 
a budget they should look at the Reform's taxpayers budget. It 
started with basic principles. The first principle is that we will 
get the federal government out of areas where they are intruding 
into provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> How come you spent all the infrastructure 
money?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> What would you do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Members opposite are 
shouting all kinds of comments, asking ``What would you do?'' 
We have clearly demonstrated that. We have laid down 
principles. When there are principles then you build the budget 
on that.
<P>
	We said we would eliminate 100 per cent of the grants to 
business. The taxpayers' budget said we would eliminate 100 
per cent of grants to special interest groups. We made that 
absolutely clear. Is the government listening? No. It caters to all 
these special interest groups and it keeps funding them.
<P>
	We do not have enough information in the estimates to know 
how many of the grants and handouts are going to businesses and 
special interest groups. If we did I think we could cut millions 
from this motion alone if they would only come clean and give 
us that information.
<P>
	Reform also said that for all the training programs and 
make-work projects where the federal government is intruding 
into areas of provincial jurisdiction Reform would gradually 
return the responsibility to the provinces. Under a Reform 
government this process would be completed over five years to 
allow for a smooth transition. We proposed an immediate 24 per 
cent cut in this fiscal year.
<P>
	Now the government will claim that Reform's principled 
approach is somehow hard hearted. I maintain it is both hard 
hearted and soft headed to keep spending money on programs 
that do not work. It is both hard hearted and soft headed to spend 
tax dollars that would produce a worse job creation record than 
if they had just lowered taxes.
<P>
	The government will cry that thousands of people helped by 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy will have no alternative but to 
go on welfare. I have two things to say to that in response to 
these soft headed views. First, what is so bad about welfare in a 
crisis? The federal government already pays 50 per cent of the 
cost of the program, and if the provincial governments want to 
direct their welfare money into workfare and training programs, 
as the federal government has done, that should be their choice. 
It should not be decided by a bunch of bureaucrats in Ottawa.
<P>
	Second, the federal government created the fisheries crisis by 
mismanaging the fishery. Then the federal government 
responded by creating a $164 million make work program for 
the federal bureaucrats. A better federal response to the crisis in 
the fishery would be to provide emergency funding to the 
provinces to top up what they get through the Canada assistance 
plan or equalization payments. Then the provinces could spend 
the money in accordance with the wishes of the communities 
and the people hardest hit by the crisis. That money should be 
distributed and should be used by those who understand the 
situation best, not by a bunch of bureaucrats back in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	Is this too simple a solution? This government likes to play 
politics and create these grand programs that make it appear like 
it is doing something, but the simple solutions it seems to avoid. 
I am sure it will be a long time before any common sense 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13419"> 13419 </A></B>
<P>
approach like this is ever  advanced by the Liberal government, 
its power hungry politicians and money hungry bureaucrats.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
remarks made by the hon. member.
<P>
	I remind the member we have members of Parliament from 
every region of the country. I believe our members of 
Parliament, especially the minister responsible for fisheries and 
oceans, who also comes from Atlantic Canada, are well 
equipped to give advice to the House on the types of programs 
that would assist their constituents when they are going through 
this very difficult period.
<P>
	One of the things the Reform Party has to face is that it does 
not have any members in Atlantic Canada. Because the Reform 
Party does not have any members in Atlantic Canada it would 
like to let the local and provincial authorities do it. However, as 
the national party, the Liberal Party has members who are 
sensitive to every region of this country.
<P>
	The point that caused me to rise this evening had to do with 
the whole issue of tax reform. I came to Parliament full of hope 
that the Reform Party would have a very tight focus on the whole 
issue of comprehensive tax reform. What do we hear day in and 
day out in question period? During the last couple of weeks I 
have had the opportunity to look at question period, and I notice 
that the Reform Party has not focused on the issue of tax reform. 
I think maybe once the member from Calgary gave a pretty good 
speech on it. Here is an issue that could affect the lives of every 
Canadian. It was the Reform Party's issue during the last 
election, but its members came to this House and deserted it.
<P>
	The hon. member said we should cancel grants to business. 
The biggest grants to business in this country are the billions of 
dollars that are buried in the tax act, many of which go to foreign 
multinational oil companies in the form of tax credits. Will he 
stand up in the House and say that all of those tax credits, tax 
grants, and tax preferences should be cancelled?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
make comments on the various areas the hon. member 
mentioned.
<P>
	If the principle I was espousing, that the people in the local 
areas best understand the situation and can best manage the 
funds and the fishery, were instituted we probably would not be 
in this mess today. I still maintain that one of the biggest 
problems with all the programs the government runs is that the 
bureaucracy in Ottawa is out of touch with the people in the local 
areas and cannot administer these programs properly.
<P>
	Then the hon. member went on to blame Reform for the 
inaction of the government because we have not touched on this 
area or on that area. I find it inexcusable that the government 
would use that excuse to explain why it is not acting on tax 
reform.
<P>
	We have clearly said that we need to balance the budget and 
we need to do it as soon as possible. If we were to balance that 
budget within the next three years we could begin to see the light 
at the end of the tunnel. We seem to think we have to provide 
these incentives for businesses to come from other countries and 
invest in Canada. Why? Because we overtax in the first place.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	If we would get our act in order and begin to reduce 
government spending to the point where we could reduce taxes, 
this question that he has posed would be redundant. We would 
not even have to consider it. That is the problem.
<P>
	We have been overtaxed to the point where we are driving 
businesses out of Canada. Now we try to compensate by giving 
them grants and tax concessions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking to 
the estimates this evening I use the example of the Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in my remarks.
<P>
	As I said in my earlier intervention, federal spending in this 
department has increased 750 per cent over the last 20 years. In 
the past year alone, spending in this department has increased 
8.5 per cent, which is faster than the rate of increase in 
population and the rate of inflation combined.
<P>
	What are we getting for all this spending? What are the 
results? The auditor general expressed serious concerns about 
spending in this area. He pointed out that the results are not 
there. He pointed out that when $1 billion was appropriated and 
earmarked for CAEDS, which is a native economic development 
program, over the period of time that money was expended the 
demand for social services and the rate of unemployment on 
native reserves continued to rise at a steady rate. This massive 
spending on economic development had absolutely no impact on 
the problems that existed on the reserves.
<P>
	What does the government do? It pays absolutely no attention 
to what the auditor general says. It pays absolutely no attention 
to the hard and tough questions we ask of why we are spending 
this money, what are the results this expenditure is supposed to 
achieve, and what it is achieving. The government continues 
blissfully on expending the money because it feels it has to. It is 
motherhood to them. Them cannot possibly see any other way 
than to continue, because this is the way things have been done 
in the past.
<P>
	The other major problem the auditor general pointed out was 
accountability. I have had occasion over the last 18 months to 
travel to a number of native Indian reserves in Canada. I have 
had occasion to hear from a large number of ordinary grassroots 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13420"> 13420 </A></B>
<P>
Indian people who are very concerned about the accountability 
on their reserves, who are very concerned about the fact there is 
a small elite group of people in their communities who are 
receiving a tremendous amount of largesse from the  federal 
government and most of the people are ignored. Most of the 
people are not receiving any benefits to speak of. Most of the 
people are living in destitute conditions.
<P>
	Obviously there is a very serious problem with accountability. 
I personally as a member of Parliament keep bringing this up 
and asking the minister to investigate claims, to go to these 
communities and find out what is actually happening. The 
response I get is this is an internal matter for the band to deal 
with and we will not get involved.
<P>
	Massive amounts of Canadian taxpayers' money are being 
sent to reserves, to the control of an elite group of Indian leaders 
with no accountability to their people and no accountability in 
effect back to the federal government. Is that the way we want to 
see our tax dollars spent in this country? Is that the way we want 
to see our society in Canada in 1995? I submit that this 
constitutes a massive fraud on the Canadian people and a 
massive fraud particularly on the poor people in these reserve 
communities, who actually believe that they are supposed to 
benefit from this expenditure and they actually do not.
<P>
	We have built a welfare state in this country. I think everyone 
or most thinking people have come to realize that. Over the last 
30 years we have constructed a massive welfare state and we 
have all the resulting problems that go along with that.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	There are the increased crime stats. There is the increase in 
poverty and the increased lack of individual initiative. The more 
dependency on government, the more people are willing to look 
at government instead of looking at themselves as the ones who 
are responsible for themselves.
<P>
	Nowhere is this more true than in the native communities in 
Canada. If we think we have a welfare state in Canada, take a 
look at Canada's Indian reserves and see the welfare state that 
has been created there. It is many times worse than what we have 
in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	I submit that what the government is doing with these 
expenditures is perpetrating that. It is perpetrating a fraud on the 
Canadian taxpayers. It is perpetrating great and serious harm to 
the people the Canadian taxpayers feel they are actually helping. 
The net result is that we are going to end up with a greater debt. 
At some point we are going to become insolvent. At the same 
time we have created a tremendous amount of harm in these 
communities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate on full supply 
of the estimates is an appropriate time to examine how well this 
government is increasing the cost effectiveness of its spending. I 
take this opportunity to explain some of the initiatives we are 
taking to make government services more affordable while at 
the same  time maintaining or improving the quality of those 
services.
<P>
	The government undertook the program review to identify 
those programs and services which in this environment of fiscal 
restraint are no longer needed or that the federal government no 
longer needs to deliver directly. The results of this review were 
outlined in the budget. The government has indicated the areas 
in which it is reducing its role or where other levels of 
government, the private sector or partnership arrangements can 
provide services more efficiently.
<P>
	With respect to the programs that are truly needed and which 
the federal government will continue to provide, Canadians 
want this government to maintain the quality of its services and 
to deliver them in the most cost effective and responsive way 
possible. Affordable and quality service delivery will be 
watchwords of this government. For programs and services that 
remain its responsibility, the federal government is committed 
to ensuring that its clients receive quality affordable services 
that are accessible, responsive and balance the interests of 
taxpayers and those receiving the service.
<P>
	With ongoing expenditure restraint, a key challenge will be to 
find new cost effective ways to design and deliver quality 
programs and services and wherever possible, to continue to 
make significant service and efficiency improvements in the 
delivery systems.
<P>
	Across the government, departments and agencies are 
responding to this priority with innovative approaches to 
delivering programs such as the use of information technology, 
partnering with clients and other organizations and streamlining 
their operations. I describe for the House a number of initiatives 
that are now under way and which aim to achieve a public 
service that consistently provides affordable and quality 
services.
<P>
	The government has developed a number of general strategies 
for achieving this goal: adopting more efficient ways to deliver 
programs; focusing on service standards and quality; providing 
client oriented delivery; cutting regulatory red tape; promoting 
fairness through cost recovery; enhancing efficient resource 
management; and using technology.
<P>
	Following a commitment in the 1994 budget, the President of 
the Treasury Board released a draft declaration of quality 
services to federal employees in December 1994. This document 
identifies the following principles that all federal employees are 
expected to adopt in delivering quality services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13421"> 13421 </A></B>
<P>
	Services are to be accessible, dependable and timely. Timely 
access to the right service can be improved for example by 
making services increasingly available at times and in ways that 
are more convenient to the public. Services are to be delivered 
clearly and in an open manner. Communicate in plain language 
with clients about how services are managed and delivered. As 
regulations and decisions become more complex, make them 
more easily understood.
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	Services are to be delivered fairly and respectfully. Canadians 
expect to be treated in a fair and courteous manner when they 
use our government services. Services are to be good value for 
tax dollars, basing decisions on affordability, sound principles 
and good judgment to demonstrate the value of service to the 
Canadian public. Services are to be responsive and those 
delivering them committed to an improvement.
<P>
	Ongoing consultation, asking clients what they think about 
the programs and services and how they can be improved is the 
cornerstone of quality service. After consulting employees and 
the public, the government will release the declaration to 
Canadians later this year.
<P>
	Canada business service centres, CBSCs, provide one access 
point for information, assistance and referrals on all 
government programs and services to business. With the recent 
opening of a CBSC in Toronto there is now a network of 10 
centres, one in a major urban centre of every province. In most 
cases these are funded jointly and operated with a province, or a 
province and the private sector. Clients have access to services 
by telephone, fax and in person.
<P>
	As part of its action plan ``Agenda: Jobs and Growth: 
Building a More Innovative Economy'', the federal government 
has increased its support for this initiative to $15 million 
annually for four years. It is expanding services to meet the 
information needs of business clients by improving access 
through co-operative arrangements with community based 
organizations such as the economic development commissions 
and chambers of commerce, increasing the availability of direct 
computer access to the information from home or office, and 
continuing to improve information particularly on regulatory 
matters of interest to business.
<P>
	Several departments continue to make services available to 
the public through common government access points at over 
300 infocentres across Canada.
<P>
	Businesses will be able to use a single business registration 
number which is being phased in during 1995 to gain access to 
several Revenue Canada business programs including those 
relating to payroll deductions, corporate income tax, the GST, 
customs duties and excise taxes. This single business 
registration number which will allow the department and 
businesses to have access to a variety of programs and services 
replaces at least six separate identifiers currently in use.
<P>
	As indicated in ``Building a More Innovative Economy'' the 
government will have reduced significantly within three years 
the amount of time that small and medium size enterprises spend 
on federal government operations and federal government 
information requests in order to help stimulate job creation and 
a healthy, vigorous economic climate for small business.
<P>
	A joint public-private sector forum of major information 
collecting departments and representatives from small and 
medium size businesses and business associations will be the 
focal point for ongoing consultations on government initiatives 
to challenge the need for the information the government 
currently requires from small and medium size businesses, 
develop means to eliminate duplication between departments 
and governments in data collection, and to find ways to collect 
the remaining information electronically to the fullest extent 
possible.
<P>
	It should be clear to all Canadians that the program review has 
resulted in significant decisions on a broad range of federal 
government programs and services. These decisions will enable 
the government to serve Canadians better with renewed purpose.
<P>
	The initiatives and successes I have outlined today show that 
the government and public service employees are dedicated to 
achieving affordable quality services using the most efficient 
means available.
<P>
	The people in my riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington have endorsed the 1995 federal budget. Major 
Canadian and international corporations have expressed their 
confidence in our government, our country and in the greatest 
asset in my riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, the confidence in our people. The workforce in my 
riding deserves the recognition it has received. I wish to take a 
moment to describe the confidence placed in my constituents.
<P>
	Celanese Canada has won a $191 million expansion to its 
polymers facility in Ernestown township. This happened in the 
last three weeks. Competition for this contract came from the 
Carolinas and from Mexico. The manager announced that this 
international company was very impressed with the talents and 
dedication of our workforce. Three hundred or four hundred 
construction jobs will be created.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	DESTEC Energy has started construction on its new 100 
megawatt co-generation plant. This $180 million project will 
employ 150 to 200 people during construction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13422"> 13422 </A></B>
<P>
	Across the road from those two projects, Bombardier, 
formerly UTDC, has received a $595 million order for a light 
transit system for Malaysia. Our Prime Minister gave us his 
assistance in bringing home this contract from his Asian tour. 
Four hundred people will be employed from now until 1998 with 
this single order alone.
<P>
	Nearby in my hometown of Napanee, Goodyear Canada is 
undergoing an expansion in the world's most modern tire 
manufacturing plant. Twenty-seven to thirty million dollars of 
Goodyear's money is being invested in our community.
<P>
	These large projects will result in hundreds of direct and 
spinoff jobs in our communities. Between the companies 
involved, almost $1 billion has been committed to 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington recently. 
Confidence is the word to remember for 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington and for all of 
Canada.
<P>
	Allow me one more expression of confidence. One-third of 
all the people in North America live within 550 miles of my 
riding. It is a great place to make and serve your product. All 
inquiries are welcome.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the 
presentation by the member opposite.
<P>
	I would like to know whether there is any long term goal on 
the part of this federal government. We have been hearing from 
this budgetary process that the goal is to reduce the deficit to 3 
per cent of GDP. However, we have tried and have not been able 
to elicit a response from the minister or the Prime Minister on 
the question of where do we go past that.
<P>
	In doing the mathematics, I think I used 3 per cent in my 
projections of increase in productivity in the country. Hence 
there is a 3 per cent annual increase in GDP, hence an increase of 
3 per cent per year in the amount of the deficit which means that 
perpetually we add to and increase the debt. We are adding up 
the interest and as the interest adds to it, the principal value of 
the debt increases. As a result, the interest payment in absolute 
dollars is higher and higher every year. Using that model, by the 
year 2011 our debt will have reached $1 trillion.
<P>
	Does the member know or has heard any of his colleagues on 
that side of the House indicate anything more concrete in terms 
of a long term goal than this very fuzzy 3 per cent, for the time 
being let us slow down how fast we go into debt, but after that let 
it increase again?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have certainly heard many 
people voice their concerns. It is a real challenge to reduce our 
deficit and our debt. As our finance minister has said, we are 
doing it on short term targets.
<P>
	Canadians are being able to live through this period of time. If 
we were to follow the Reform Party budget, we certainly would 
have blood in the streets. People will not stand there and see 
their necks cut.
<P>
	This week a newspaper editorial in a major Canadian daily 
warned the voters in Ontario that if they buy Mike Harris they 
will get the whole package. When our human resources 
development standing committee was touring the western 
Canada provinces, which I love so greatly, in November and 
December, we had witnesses coming before us with tears in their 
eyes, especially in Alberta, telling how the Reform type 
government was making cuts on the backs of the working and 
the poor people. I am proud to be a Liberal and be part of a 
government that will cut the deficit and the debt and will do it 
while allowing people to live.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for a very good speech, 
one that relates to the Canadian public the difference between 
the Liberal Party and the parties opposite.
<P>
	Many of us on this side believe governments have a role to 
play and that governments can have a positive impact on the 
lives of individuals. We do not have to pull back to the point at 
which everyone is left to their own devices to get back to the 
lifestyles we had a number of years ago.
<P>
	Can my colleague explain to us some of the positive aspects of 
the Asian tour he mentioned relating to what the federal 
government has done in relation to jobs in his riding? What did 
the Asian tour do for the job creation initiative he talked about? 
How much federal money is involved in the process of the Prime 
Minister and the ministers of the provinces when they went as 
Team Canada to sell our products to the rest of the world?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
the question.
<P>
	I will answer more than the question about the Asian tour. The 
Asian tour was a great help for all of Canada. We have a foot in 
the door and Canadians are working. I mentioned the $595 
million order that Bombardier shared in our area.
<P>
	The full order totalled $950 million. Bombardier is making 
money around the world today and is willing to invest in 
Canada. It is making rapid transit vehicles in Germany and I 
believe on four continents today. For this very valuable contract 
it has confidence in the people in our country.
<P>
	Regarding the DESTEC Energy project I mentioned of $180 
million, the money is coming from Texas and is being invested 
in our country. Celanese is investing $191 million of its money 
here because of its confidence in Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13423"> 13423 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak about the government's main estimates for the 
1995-96 budget year.
<P>
	The main estimates are a reflection of the government's 
spending priorities for its departments and programs as set out 
in the budget. This year's estimates lay the details for the 
government's planned budgetary expenditures totalling $164.2 
billion.
<P>
	The basic figures contained in these documents show overall 
program spending has declined by 10.8 per cent, from $120.9 
billion 1994-95 to $107.9 billion in 1996-97.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The positive side of these dramatic spending cuts is that the 
government has managed for the first time in more than 20 years 
not only to reach its deficit reduction objective but to exceed it 
by $4.4 billion, without raising personal income taxes.
<P>
	With its second budget, the government will be able to meet 
the red book objective of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of 
GDP by the end of 1996-97.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will mention some of the concerns communicated to me by 
my constituents prior to this year's budget and how the 
government addressed these concerns.
<P>
	The build up to this year's federal budget saw a variety of 
letter writing campaigns opposing any new tax measures. I 
recall a few campaigns opposing any increases in personal 
income tax, any taxation of employer contributions to group 
health plans and registered retirement savings plans.
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
	As part of the government's prebudget consultation process I 
wrote to the Minister of Finance requesting that group health 
benefits and RRSPs not be taxed. I was very pleased the budget 
contained no increase in personal income taxes and that no taxes 
were levied on the programs I mentioned.
<P>
	It is important to understand that a whole new approach to 
governing was adopted in order to achieve the budgetary goals I 
referred to earlier. The program review contained in the budget 
redefines what government does and how its programs are 
delivered.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are in fact witnessing a redefinition of liberalism. This, 
however, could make us forget important liberal principles such 
as giving everyone equal opportunities. Many Canadians feel, 
like me, that our social programs helped create a more just 
society.
<P>
	After what the previous government did to social security, it is 
no wonder that many Canadians are concerned by any talk of 
reviewing social policy and public pension plans.
<P>
	I am nonetheless convinced that our government can and will 
modernize the social safety net in order to make programs more 
efficient and less costly and, more importantly, to preserve 
access for all Canadians, whether rich or poor.
<P>
	An important item in the estimates will guarantee the future 
viability of our social programs. The Canada social transfer will 
replace the current transfer payments to the provinces and 
territories under the Canada assistance plan and the established 
programs financing. Combined with the equalization payments 
that will continue to increase, the Canada social transfer will 
provide the provinces with more than $35 billion in 1996.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign I repeatedly said what we 
need are more people paying taxes, not people paying more 
taxes. It has always been evident to me that the best way to 
preserve our social programs and at the same time reduce our 
fiscal deficit is by creating jobs. More people working means 
more people paying taxes and less people drawing costly 
benefits such as unemployment insurance. In other words, we 
must continue with our job and growth agenda. We need a 
balanced approach between spending cuts and job creation. 
Fiscal restraint must not be an end in and of itself but a 
facilitator in achieving the overriding goal of job creation.
<P>
	The government did in many ways adopt this approach. 
Consider that 433,000 new jobs were created in 1994, many as a 
result of the national infrastructure program. The 
unemployment rate is now at 9.4 per cent, the lowest in nearly 
five years, productivity has surged and our trade surplus is at its 
highest level ever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to increase the fairness of the tax system. 
Again, I must congratulate the government on the progress made 
in that regard through measures such as these: a 12.5 per cent 
increase in the corporate tax rate; a 1 per cent increase in the 
corporate surtax; a temporary tax on the capital of 
deposit-taking institutions, including major chartered banks; 
the elimination of tax advantages resulting from the rules 
governing family trusts for the rich; and finally, the limitation 
on the scientific research and experimental development tax 
credit for large corporations.
<P>
	These are major achievements, but much remains to be done. 
There is still a lot to do to help the unemployed find work and we 
must take a closer look at tax advantages that benefit a 
privileged few.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some would attack the less privileged in our society and 
blame them for all our economic woes. This certainly seems to 
be the case in the provincial election in Ontario. However, 
politicians who take advantage of people's fears and anger over 
the future viability of our economy are doing a great disservice 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13424"> 13424 </A></B>
<P>
to both the social and economic well-being of our country. This 
approach is fundamentally dishonest and very destructive.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	Now that this year's budgetary process is coming to a close I 
offer my suggestions for the upcoming 1996 prebudget 
consultation.
<P>
	There is much speculation in the media about the viability of 
our public pension plan and the necessity to review this 
program. I believe any review of the public pension scheme 
should also include a review of RRSPs. A considerable amount 
of money is invested in RRSPs. They have without a doubt 
contributed to better retirement security for thousands of 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, the question of fairness has arisen with respect to 
advantages wealthy Canadians receive from current 
contribution limits. The last budget set limits of $13,500 for 
1996-97. The limit will be increased by $1,000 a year to reach 
$15,500 in 1999.
<P>
	Revenue Canada statistics also inform us only 6 per cent of 
individuals with income of less than $20,000 a year currently 
take advantage of RRSPs. On the other hand, individuals making 
$100,000 or more a year, who account for only 2 per cent of the 
population, account for 20 per cent of the total RRSP 
contributions.
<P>
	In my opinion our current system of RRSPs acts as a 
considerable tax shelter for the wealthy because of its high 
contribution levels. For this reason I would not oppose a 
reduction in the RRSP contribution limit. This would only affect 
higher income Canadians because these limits are income 
contingent. Taxing lottery winnings is also another revenue 
generating avenue available to the government.
<P>
	I urge the government to continuing applying fairness and 
compassion in budgetary policies. We must continue to give 
unemployed Canadians hope and encouragement, not blame 
them or punish them for their lot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member pointed out total spending by the government has gone 
up and yet program spending has gone down, which means 
Canadians are squeezed. We are delivering less program money 
to Canadians while we are transferring more and more money to 
the lenders. Transfer to lenders has become the biggest transfer 
program the government has.
<P>
	The member talked about maintaining the viability of our 
social programs. I am concerned about the conundrum there. As 
the government spends less and less money on social programs 
surely that would destroy the viability of social programs. He 
seems to be taking some credit in maintaining the viability of 
social programs.
<P>
	While the deficit continues and while we are continuing to 
add to the debt, which means interest costs are continuing to go 
up andtherefore program spending will continue to go down, 
how does the member intend to maintain the viability of social 
programs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. The question of maintaining social programs is very 
crucial and of much concern to the government. That is what the 
social program review initiated by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was designed to address.
<P>
	The deficit is being addressed by reducing it to 3 per cent of 
GDP. That is a minimum interim target. The finance minister 
stated many times in the House and outside the House that it is 
just that, a minimum interim target. The ultimate goal is to 
eliminate the deficit and repay the debt, leaving more money 
available to put into social programs.
<P>
	Social programs are in need of review. They were designed 
several decades ago and have not been brought up to date. There 
is wide consensus among Canadians that they are in need of a 
review and an update and it is a question of which approach we 
will take.
<P>
	Hon. members across have difficulty 20 months after the 1993 
election still accepting that the Liberal platform clearly set out 
the deficit reduction goal was 3 per cent GDP in three years. 
That is one of the main reasons we were successful in the 
election. It is a concept they have difficulty accepting.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, why would he think, as the Reformers would think, that 
Canadians would believe it when the Reform Party says it could 
reduce the debt and the deficit all in one fell swoop in a 
three-year program and at the same time maintain jobs and 
growth? This is what it is saying to us,  that the 400,000 jobs that 
were created this last year  would continue to be in effect at the 
same time as we would take some $40 billion from the economy.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to explain to us the Reform's 
rationale if he could and why the Liberal Party does not seem to 
accept that. Not even 10 per cent of Canadians accept that, as we 
could tell in the last election campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	The simple answer is I cannot explain it. I certainly do not 
agree with it. Obviously the electorate in the last election did not 
agree with it. As I previously pointed out, they rejected that 
Reform plan of eliminating the deficit within three years. 
Anyone could understand that could not be done without 
creating tremendous hardship. As has been stated previously in 
the House this evening, there would be blood in the streets if any 
government attempted to put those kinds of cuts onto the 
population. That is clearly why that plan was rejected by the 
electorate in 1993.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13425"> 13425 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
Canada social transfer, he said they are transferring $35 billion 
to the provinces. He forgot to mention that is a reduction of 
about $7 billion, if I have my figures right. That is downloading 
on the provinces.
<P>
	Maybe that is the reason the Liberals in Ontario's provincial 
election are into a skid. Maybe it is that and Bills C-68 and 
C-41. Maybe that is why this Liberal Party got so desperate as to 
campaign for its provincial brothers and sisters during 
members' statements before question period, and it does not 
even claim them as an election expense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly am amazed at the 
interest our hon. colleagues from the Reform Party have taken in 
the provincial election in Ontario. They do not seem to miss any 
opportunity to discuss it. I have the impression that there is 
perhaps, as we have heard in the media, some possibility of a 
merger with the Tory government. They seem to be very 
concerned with the fortunes of the Tories in Ontario.
<P>
	To answer his downloading question, the information I have is 
that in fact there is the same amount of money, if not more, being 
transferred to the provinces today as there was prior to this 
government's taking office.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in this debate which goes to the very 
heart of the Canadian policy issue.
<P>
	There is a proposal to reform the human resources system in 
Canada. As you know, this is the largest department and the most 
essential to any political system, for it is or is supposed to be in 
charge of job creation and training. Social and other programs 
also come under this department.
<P>
	This is an extremely important department and talking about 
reforming such a department is like trying to change the entire 
Canadian federal system as we know it.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If only the peanut gallery in the Reform Party could listen-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am trying to imagine 
what it must have been like when this wonderful Chamber sat 
every evening.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the hon. member for Quebec Est.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point I was making in such a 
colourful way is that basically attempting to change the 
Department of Human Resources Development is tantamount to 
attempting to change the entire Canadian federal system 
because this department is at the heart of every federal program, 
anything that deals with employment, training, social programs. 
We also know that HRD may well have one of the largest 
budgets, if not the largest, of any federal department.
<P>
	That is what prompts me to say that this debate tonight goes to 
the very heart of the Canadian policy issue. Looking at this 
reform proposal concerning the Department of Human 
Resources Development, we can see that the impact of this 
reform is quite disastrous in every respect. Even from the point 
of view of political philosophy, this reform makes no sense.
<P>
	There is an ongoing debate in Canada about the value of 
decentralizing political powers. I think that this policy or idea is 
widely held across Canada. At least in Quebec and in parts of 
English Canada it is regarded as good policy. The Liberal 
government however would rather adopt a centralizing policy, 
which is obvious in several bills, including bills from the 
Department of Human Resources Development. This is a 
disastrous policy thrust, as we know. I even think that a majority 
of Liberal members, and you might be one of them, care and will 
recognize that decentralizing is the key to the future of Canada's 
political development.
<P>
	However, this Liberal government and its Prime Minister 
seem more bent on centralizing, which is disastrous as we can 
see, particularly when we come from Quebec. This human 
resources reform is disastrous, both from a political and 
economical point of view.
<P>
	Although the government is trying to cut several billion 
dollars in social programs, a measure which will hurt the poor 
and the most vulnerable people in our society, it will not really 
save anything. These cuts are not well thought out; they are not 
planned; they are not part of a global vision for development. In 
fact, if this government really cared, if it really had a vision for 
rebuilding the country, it would have reduced overlapping and 
duplication. It would have opted for decentralization, instead of 
centralization.
<P>
	Once again, the reforms proposed by the Department of 
Human Resources Development show that, in the future, there 
will undoubtedly be even more duplication than before. This 
will not result in savings. Duplication means not only that 
money is wasted, to the tune of hundreds and hundreds of 
millions of dollars, but also time, energy and even human lives.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13426"> 13426 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	When we really get down to talking about client services and 
the efficiency of programs managed by the Department of 
Human Resources Development, we have to conclude more and 
more that they are not efficient. The department tries to put job 
creation or training programs in place to enable people to hold 
jobs. The department, the federal government itself, 
acknowledges that these training programs are inefficient.
<P>
	One has to actually be there, hit the streets, the towns and the 
countryside to really take stock of the current disaster, the 
mounting frustration people are venting; people are becoming 
more and more concerned about what is going on because they 
are under the impression that politicians are not doing their jobs. 
And how right they are that this government is not doing its job.
<P>
	And the reforms they are proposing for the Department of 
Human Resources Development are nothing more than 
expensive deviations from which no good will come. Who will 
ultimately pay? Now that the Liberal Party is no longer a Liberal 
Party in the traditional sense, but much more like a Conservative 
Party, there is no difference between the current Liberal Party 
and the Conservative Party that preceded it: their policies are 
identical. Inertia rules. But who actually pays for this lack of 
leadership, concern and good policies? The poor, the sick, 
seniors, students, the unemployed, welfare recipients, all of the 
classes in society which have no voice. They will be the ones 
who will have to pay. In fact, they are always the ones who pay 
for a government's slip-shod work.
<P>
	But these people will not always be ignored. We can say this 
because they are a majority. A storm is brewing in the country, it 
is brewing because there are no jobs and no training is available. 
Therefore, if the patronage and the scandals like Power DirecTv 
or other shady issues clouding this government do not bring it 
down, its inertia, lack of vision and the public's dissatisfaction 
will. Their system is doomed to failure.
<P>
	The current federal government in Ottawa has no vision. It is 
doomed to failure. One thing is sure, it is going to crumble under 
the weight of its own debt and of its shortsightedness. In fact, in 
Quebec we want to get out of this system because we can do a 
better job. One does not have to be a genius to realize we can do 
better than the federal system we have now.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development, as I said 
before, illustrates what is wrong with the whole federal system. 
This department has made presentations and introduced 
cutbacks, but is misleading in the way it  presents its budget. It is 
hard to pinpoint what they are trying to do. We know the 
minister is confusing the issue. He would have people believe he 
is improving the system, but that is not the case. They talk about 
increasing the number of programs and the amount of money 
available for training or job creation, although we know there 
have been drastic cuts in the amounts available.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	Confusion reigns in this department. As I said before, all you 
have to do is go down the street, go to the cities and towns and 
employment centres and you will see what is happening. The 
department's employees no longer know which side they are on, 
whether their job is going to disappear, how much money they 
have for which programs and which programs will be abolished. 
This is not a department with a clear vision, a sense of purpose. 
Confusion is spreading because people do not know where they 
are going.
<P>
	There is some kind of trickery afoot, but I am afraid they 
underestimate the public's intelligence. The auditor general has 
often said that budgets are mainly an exercise in camouflage. It 
is an attempt to prevent people from finding out exactly how the 
money is spent. You practically have to be an expert, and even 
the experts cannot agree.
<P>
	Cover up and concealment seem to be the order of the day. The 
Auditor General of Canada singled out the Department of 
Human Resources Development as a case in point. Confusion is 
rife, especially in this department. As I said before, the 
department is at the heart of the federal system that is collapsing 
under its own weight, through its own inertia and lack of vision.
<P>
	How the money in the Unemployment Insurance Fund is used 
is another example of this now you see it, now you don't, 
attitude. Everyone in Canada or at least a large percentage of 
Canadians has the impression that the federal government is 
putting money, their tax money, into the unemployment 
insurance program to subsidize training programs and other 
programs provided by employment centres.
<P>
	However, the federal government, as I said before, is 
withdrawing from unemployment insurance. The money in the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund comes out of the wages earned 
by workers. We all contribute to this fund, but the federal 
government is contributing less and less. However, the 
government still gives the impression it contributes, and it uses 
the money to set up training programs and job creation programs 
for young people. This is a very economical way to give the 
impression you are doing something.
<P>
	Obviously, this is one way to give the impression of doing 
something, but not necessarily a successful one. The greatest 
confusion is to be found in the new programs set up in the past 12 
months, particularly those announced with the greatest 
noise-programs for youth, young trainees or the youth service 
corps.
<P>
	In my riding, just by talking to people in the street, who have 
anything to do with these programs at all, you realize that they 
do not know where to turn anymore. For example, in 
Québec-Est, 38 projects were submitted in response to the youth 
service corps program, because people had heard there was lots 
of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13427"> 13427 </A></B>
<P>
money in it. The youth service corps proposed 36 projects, good 
projects, and only two were approved.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	These two projects will go through a whole slew of checks, 
not only locally, but at the Montreal office and, eventually, at the 
Ottawa office. It seems they even had to be approved by the 
minister himself. This is a first. Even the officials are wondering 
why. This is a sort of politicization. I do not think it is economic, 
particularly. It is a reflection of the government's desire to 
centralize, once again, at the very heart of the Department of 
Human Resources Development. Why this attempt to 
centralize? It is not economic. It does not even make any sense.
<P>
	This streamlining the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is talking about is, obviously, not streamlining. 
Anyone taking the slightest look at the thing will realize that 
there is no streamlining; it is confusion.
<P>
	You just have to talk to the head of the employment centre in 
your region; he will tell you. He does not know if he will keep 
his job; he does not know whether the programs he currently 
administers will be extended. Furthermore, he will admit to you 
that the existing programs funded by the federal government 
from the unemployment insurance fund are not working out. 
There is no guarantee that someone taking training at an 
employment centre will find work. Oftentimes, even, people 
taking training at employment centres have less chance of 
finding a job.
<P>
	This all makes sense, I suppose, in the mind of certain 
federalists, but, in my mind, it does not. There is no 
streamlining, only confusion and waste.
<P>
	In Quebec we are concerned because we want to create jobs 
and put people to work. We want to improve our society. We are 
not asleep. We are not sitting on our power on little green chairs 
thinking that everything is fine. We know there are more and 
more poor people, unemployed and people on welfare. There are 
808,000 in Quebec, alone. It is a catastrophe. This is a lot of 
human misery.
<P>
	It is important, for example, for Quebec to have power in the 
area of manpower training. The struggle has been going on for a 
long time, and we consider it very important. The former 
Quebec minister and current federal Minister of Labour sitting 
across from me is aware that the Quebec government has fought 
for full control over manpower training for a long time, even 
when the Liberals were in power.
<P>
	Manpower training is central because it lies at the heart of this 
whole game being played by the Department  of Human 
Resources Development. It is at the heart of all societal 
problems. The issues are job creation and training. And 
education is at the heart of any society. That is why Quebec is 
right to stick to its guns. Not only because it is important but 
because it is under provincial jurisdiction. Education has always 
been under provincial jurisdiction. The federalists in Ottawa do 
not understand this. They have never respected provincial 
jurisdiction. Furthermore, the government has never respected 
its own constitution. Both training and education have always 
been under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	The federal government is once again using this 
centralization policy. The fact that the Department of Human 
Resources Development is increasingly trying to exert control 
over manpower training provides further concrete evidence of 
the federal government's intention to centralize powers.
<P>
	Quebec-not only the Parti Quebecois but also the Liberal 
Party-has always unanimously expressed the need to repatriate 
all manpower training powers. All manpower training 
stakeholders, union members, even the employers' council and 
the president of the Business Council on National Issues, 
Thomas d'Aquino, a man of some renown, have argued very 
strongly in favour of decentralizing manpower training powers 
throughout the country.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we still do not have that power, which clearly 
shows once again the impossibility of reforming the current 
system because of increased centralization by the federal 
government. The impossibility of reforming the system is one of 
the reasons, if not the main reason, why Quebec must achieve 
sovereignty so that it can take control of its own destiny as soon 
as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
hon. member's statement that the federal government is trying 
to centralize powers in Ottawa even more than past 
governments, that statement is absolutely correct.
<P>
	He went on to say that federal governments over past decades 
have taken over powers which are rightfully provincial powers. 
The hon. member is 100 per cent correct.
<P>
	Reform's vision of a new Canada includes a much smaller 
federal government, with much less power centralized in its 
hands, and with provincial powers returned to the provinces as 
they were laid out in the original Constitution. I can understand 
the hon. member's frustration, which we feel in Alberta, to the 
continual movement on the part of the federal government, 
particularly over the last 30 years, to take over powers which are 
rightfully those of the provinces.
<P>
	I want to make those comments to the hon. member and to the 
people of Quebec, acknowledging this is a problem which must 
be reversed. If that happens, as the  Reform Party has laid out in 
its vision of a new Canada, Quebecers will be happy to be a part 
of the country. If that does not happen, as it certainly will not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13428"> 13428 </A></B>
<P>
under this government, Quebecers will want to leave. I can 
understand that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, if it were possible to 
decentralize Canada it would be very interesting. I do not 
believe it is possible to decentralize the federal government 
because it is part of the federal history to centralize power. That 
has been the case ever since the second world war. The federal 
government has taken more and more power. It has assumed 
more and more of the provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Today the situation is catastrophic in the sense that the federal 
government has no place being there any more. It is a useless 
political institution in the broadest terms. It is a wasteful 
institution.
<P>
<B>(2130 ) </B>
<P>
	Now its role is basically to maintain itself, to keep itself alive. 
It is like this absurd institution that suddenly finds itself alive 
and now will do everything to maintain its life in spite of the fact 
it is taxing provinces and creating problems all over the country.
<P>
	We can criticize this system inside and out completely. It is 
wasteful, it is not economical, it gives no guidance to the 
country. Its primary goal right today is to do everything to 
maintain its life. This is what the government is doing. It is 
trying to maintain the operation of this federal institution in 
Ottawa in spite of the fact it is a totally useless institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after the 
last couple of months here, after seeing the corruption across the 
floor with regard to the patronage we have been talking about in 
question period over the last few months, and after seeing a lot 
of really bad legislation like the budget, Bill C-68, Bill C-41, 
the MP pension reform which really does very little to reform, I 
understand the member's frustration.
<P>
	I have to admit the federal government is not working 
properly but it can be changed. If it could be changed, if the 
proper powers were returned to the provinces, that would be 
interesting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us say that we gained 
experience in trying to change the present system on several 
occasions: in 1990, 1992 and even before that. Numerous 
attempts were made to reform the system, but it is just not 
reformable, especially as viewed by Quebec.
<P>
	For example, Western Canada, and Alberta in particular, was 
cheated of billions of dollars under the Trudeau regime. In fact, 
it is estimated that the government collected in excess of $100 
billion from Alberta with Trudeau's energy tax. I have seen 
estimates ranging anywhere from $60 billion to more than $100 
billion in oil taxes collected from Alberta alone. All that to 
maintain the federal system based here in Ottawa.
<P>
	Other provinces had different problems, but in Quebec the 
main problem comes from way back. For one thing, it comes 
from the fact that we are French-speaking and have never been 
recognized in Canada as a different, distinct people, unique in 
North America. Everyone agrees that it is quite obvious though, 
but the fact remains that recognition has not been forthcoming in 
this system. Really, that is crucial for Quebec and the future of 
its society, because as long as we do not have the powers to 
develop as a French-speaking nation, as unique among North 
American nations, we will do all we can to try to gain these 
powers.
<P>
	We will never have the necessary political and administrative 
reforms carried out within Canada. We will certainly not 
succeed in getting Quebec recognized as a people. We tried on 
several occasions but learned that it is just plain impossible.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	The only difference perhaps between the Reform Party and 
the Bloc Quebecois is that we, in the Bloc, have realized that the 
federal system is not reformable, while our Reform colleagues 
believe it is still possible to reform this federal system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the last 30 minutes, I listened with great interest to the 
hon. member from the official opposition. It is rather strange to 
see how a parliamentarian protected by the privilege of 
Parliament can distort the facts in what I would call an almost 
shameful manner.
<P>
	The member made several allusions to Houdini in his speech. 
Let me tell you that Houdini must be spinning in his grave right 
now.
<P>
	In any case, I am pleased to address this House on the issue of 
the government's main estimates. Since taking office, the 
Liberal Party has met several major challenges. I am proud to 
point that out because, if you look at the history of our country, 
you see that each time a major change of direction occurred, it 
was invariably with the Liberal Party at the helm. We have 
always been the ones with a vision, the ones paving the way for 
future generations of Canadians. Indeed, I am proud to stress 
that fact this evening.
<P>
	We were elected at an important time in the development of 
our society. Canadians then put their trust in another Liberal 
government because they knew that we would rise to the 
challenge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> They were wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Look at Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13429"> 13429 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> We have risen to the challenge so well that you 
can hear the other side howl and scream, precisely because we 
are doing such a good job that it hurts them.
<P>
	It hurts them because Canadians are starting to see the 
positive results of our policies. It hurts them because the federal 
government is implementing a true decentralization which the 
public understands and accepts.
<P>
	It hurts them because, when they see the government 
administration make these adjustments, they realize that it is the 
end of their dream. Once again, we are showing that federalism 
is not static: it has always been in constant evolution and it will 
continue to change.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to discuss regional 
development. Canada is a very large country and we often see 
disparities within a given region. A responsible federal 
government must keep control over regional development.
<P>
	However, the whole regional development policy must also be 
reviewed, just as we have already reviewed the government 
machine. Some members opposite say: ``Use the simple 
approach. We have problems with the debt and the deficit, so 
just make cuts in regional development''.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	Their policy is irresponsible. I have heard members opposite 
say: Withdraw from the area of regional development. This is 
yet another policy that, in addition to being unrealistic, 
fundamentally goes against the opinion and the will of the 
people.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are out of touch.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Ever since this government was formed, we 
have been repeating that we want to get the government machine 
back on track in order to lead Canada to economic prosperity, an 
economic prosperity which will allow us to create jobs and make 
us competitive, not only on the Canadian scene but also 
internationally.
<P>
	Two principles underlie this vision of prosperity and govern 
all of the changes to regional development policies. The first 
thing that the government wanted to do, and did in fact do-I 
again stress for the benefit of the House that the people across 
the way keep on hollering because hearing the truth hurts, but 
Mr. Speaker, thank God for the House of Commons, a wonderful 
democratic forum in which we can express ourselves freely 
without fear and tell the public the truth-now back to the two 
principles underlying the reform of the government machine 
and the reform of regional development policies.
<P>
	There is the issue of the rationalization of public spending. I 
think that the Minister of Finance's budget eloquently makes the 
point that the first steps towards rationalizing spending have 
already been taken. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
conducted a major  program review which will eventually lead 
to program cuts, programs which will more effectively target the 
public, programs which will meet their real needs. This 
rationalization of spending shows that this government is 
responsible and can manage the debt and the deficit.
<P>
	The second underlying principle is the rethinking of the 
state's role. When they say they are rethinking the state's role, 
that means that they are going to take a sharp turn. In the past, 
not only in Canada but throughout the world, we have had 
governments that were very interventionist. Today, with all the 
problems with public finances, government has to play a 
different role, a role business people have asked us to play. The 
government has to fine tune its decision making to reflect the 
needs of various sectors, and it must also consider partnerships.
<P>
	While we are on the subject of regional development policies, 
perhaps we should mention a splendid tool for regional 
development that is part of the federal apparatus, and I am 
referring to the Federal Office of Regional Development for 
Quebec. If we consider the two principles I just mentioned, the 
issue of scaling down spending, well I must say the FORDQ has 
done its share. For instance, its budget will be cut by 70 per cent 
over three years, which means from $487.5 million to $142.9 
million in 1997-98. This is a significant reduction, and I think 
we can say that the FORDQ is doing its share.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	Well, I think the changes announced quite recently by the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development (Quebec) are a clear indication 
of this desire to make some real changes and rethink the role of 
government so that we can fine tune our response to the needs of 
Canadians. In this respect, our first conclusion must be that from 
now on, regional development will be the job of small business.
<P>
	Small businesses in Canada create 85 per cent of the jobs. 
They are a very dynamic tool that should be encouraged in every 
respect. And the government should be there to act as a partner.
<P>
	Before going ahead with the restructuring of FORDQ, the 
minister consulted the business community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> At $2,000 per plate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> If I may, I will try to convey, over the shouts of 
the official opposition, the messages sent to the minister by 
members of the business community.
<P>
	The message from small businesses regarding regional 
development is clear. They told us: ``First, cut government 
spending; second, stop subsidizing businesses; and third, 
eliminate overlap; reduce the paper burden and the red tape; and 
give us the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13430"> 13430 </A></B>
<P>
strategic information we need to meet the challenges of 
technological change and globalization of our markets''.
<P>
	Now that is progressive. That is the new approach to regional 
development. This is what the Federal Office of Regional 
Development intends to do. It will work in partnership in order 
to target promising development sectors. I must point out that 
the office has already taken action on a number of occasions in 
Quebec and throughout Canada. We target small and medium 
high tech business and, when we target high tech in partnership, 
we are targeting an area of the future. We are targeting an area 
that will mean the creation of quality, worthwhile and long 
lasting jobs, which will improve Canada's economy and make us 
a strong competitor both nationally and internationally. This is 
basic for small and medium size business.
<P>
	I was listening to my colleague earlier talking about training. 
I find it hard to believe today that people can talk about isolating 
themselves as regards manpower training. In an era of free trade 
when there is talk of a World Trade Organization, we should be 
looking to band together to better train our labour force, make it 
a quality one. This is what Quebecers want. A quality labour 
force is a dynamic one that puts Canadian business at the peak of 
competition. As a dynamic labour force, it also attracts 
investments. This is the plan of the present government and this 
is what we will continue to do.
<P>
	We are talking about a dynamic approach attuned to what 
people want. I was listening to my colleague earlier attacking 
reforms to social programs by the Department of Human 
Resources Development. You will permit me to say that I find 
such comments disgraceful, given that the new direction the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is taking is 
fundamental not only for workers, but for Canadian society.
<P>
	Let us take the example of the human resources investment 
fund, which will come into effect in April 1996.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	This fund, which in my opinion is quite a marvel, meets the 
very needs of the public. During several months, Canadians told 
us: ``We want training programs that are firmly grounded in 
reality. We want training programs which are much more 
flexible''. Again, I would point out to the Chair that I am trying 
to be heard over all the hollering of the Bloc Quebecois 
members.
<P>
	Canadians want training programs which are much more 
flexible and truly in tune with their needs. The Human 
Resources Investment Fund meets all of their expectations. It 
really reflects the real situation out there. When I hear the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois telling Quebecers that these 
parties should have control over manpower training so that they 
can hide what they are doing, I cannot help but think that they 
are not realistic and are ignoring what is going on at the 
international level.
<P>
	We must train our workers in order to become extremely 
competent. This requires partnerships, team work and 
co-operation with the private sector, which is exactly what the 
Human Resources Investment Fund is all about. Earlier, some 
members said that the Canada social transfer would lead to 
decentralization. I do not know which way to turn anymore.
<P>
	When we were considering social reform, the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois hailed the Canada social transfer as a miracle. 
They wanted us to decentralize and transfer everything to the 
provinces. That is what we did in the finance minister's budget. 
Through the Canada social transfer, we handed a number of 
programs over to them. Now that this has come to pass, they are 
trying to distort the truth by saying that the Canada social 
transfer is tied to the unilateral setting of national standards by 
the federal government.
<P>
	I think that we did not read the same document. We live in a 
country, and I think it is normal to have national standards 
across the country. During the consultations on social program 
reform, people in Quebec and throughout Canada also told us 
that we should indeed have national standards. The people also 
told us-in Quebec, too-that they did not want these standards 
to be set unilaterally by the federal government.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer is a classic example of progressive 
federalism, of co-operative federalism, of a federalism that 
does not represent in any way the status quo advocated by 
members of the official opposition, members of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> In conclusion, what is unfortunate about the 
official opposition-I am trying once again to be heard above 
the ruckus raised by Bloc members-is that, instead of allowing 
us to work hand in hand to develop a federation that will reflect 
the vitality of people in Quebec and throughout Canada, they are 
trying to ensure that the system will not work. All this, 
incredibly, just to protect their separatist philosophy instead of 
serving the public interest.
<P>
	Our government's goal is to help the people and look after 
their interests, and we will continue to do so. That is why I am 
especially proud to support the main estimates.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Outremont is wrong; I did not 
utter a word during his presentation, but I will speak now. I 
wonder on what planet the hon. member lives.
<P>
	We have 800,000 people on welfare in Quebec today, and 
there are 1.2 million in Ontario. Quebec sovereignists are 
certainly not responsible for that; the federal system is. One of 
the main reasons for this state of affairs is the manpower issue. 
The very brother of the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi, a 
minister in the Johnson government and now the member for  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13431"> 13431 </A></B>
<P>
Westmount-Saint-Henri, was among the government members 
who asked that the issue of manpower be returned to Quebec.
<P>
	These are not sovereignists, but federalists, people who have 
realized that, if we want our manpower to be trained adequately, 
training has to be provided in an acceptable regime. The facts 
contradict what the hon. member for Outremont said. At 
present, the public cannot find its way around the 27 federal and 
25 provincial programs available.
<P>
	As for concrete measures, the federal government recently 
announced that only UI recipients will have access to job search 
clubs from now on. A fine move to create a single window no 
doubt. And so logical.
<P>
	I would like to tell the hon. member for Outremont a thing or 
two about the real world, through you of course, Mr. Speaker. In 
our regions, many workers are unskilled and need adequate 
training. We are talking about regional development. Well, I 
come from Quebec's eastern region, which could be called the 
stumbling block of federalism.
<P>
	The federal government tried all kinds of things in our region, 
this in addition to Quebec's initiatives. Today, our region has the 
strongest migration movement. That trend, which started 30 
years ago, is the result of your actions.
<P>
	I want to say a word about the FORDQ. I agree with the 
member for Outremont: you did turn that office into an empty 
structure. This is obvious. All the investment budgets targeted 
for small businesses were cut. Businesses employing only a few 
people do not need to have access to the international markets. 
Quite often, they simply need a little help to build a warehouse, 
etc., but you let them down. One of the reasons is that federal 
Liberals from Quebec did not speak up. They let the Minister of 
Industry do his dirty deed, so that Ontario would regain control.
<P>
	I will conclude with a question on the Human Resources 
Investment Fund. Instead of creating an artificial fund and using 
the money contributed by employers and employees to interfere 
in Quebec's fields of jurisdiction, why did you not reduce the 
contributions of employers and employees? That way, you 
would have put the money directly in the industry, in the 
workplace, instead of spending it on the bureaucracy, and you 
would have achieved true job creation, instead of making 
systematic cuts.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would remind the House 
that debate is to end at 10.00 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague is confused 
at this point. He should call the PQ's 1-800 number so he can 
understand. The member opposite spoke of a very important and 
very serious matter-that of the unemployed in Quebec, and not 
only in Quebec, but in Canada as a whole.
<P>
	Last year, we created 430,000 new jobs. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development is changing course in response 
to the wishes of people-be they welfare recipients or receiving 
some other form of public support-who want access to training 
without running head on into inflexible programs. This is what 
we are trying to do with the human resources investment fund.
<P>
	It is unfortunate, but the truth is that we are working alone at 
the moment. The federal government is working alone, because 
the Government of Quebec, instead of working in partnership 
with the federal government to serve the public interest and 
develop a labour force in a rapidly changing economy, is talking 
about separating. It is a shame, and the cost, in the end, will be 
borne by the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 10 p.m. it is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 81, to interrupt the proceedings 
and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the 
business of supply.
<P>
	The question is on Motion No. 1. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Call in the members.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in view of the concern about the estimates process 
and the willingness of all parties recognized in the House to 
improve the process, I would now seek unanimous consent to 
move the following motion, in the spirit of co-operation we 
have been getting and are anticipating later tonight.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be instructed to 
undertake a comprehensive review of the business of supply, with particular </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="13433"> 13433 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>attention to the reform of the estimates, the processes and mechanisms by which the 
House and its committees may consider and dispose of them; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the committee make a report thereon no later than December 1, 1995.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the motion the government has brought 
forward. There has been consultation with all parties in the 
House. Recognition that we may have been sitting here all night 
without even being able to vote to reduce the estimates brought 
to the attention of all of us the need to review the standing orders 
with a view to finding reforms to make this process meaningful 
so that we can adequately represent Canadians in the whole 
process of reviewing the expenditures of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, </B><B>NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact that the New Democrats have 
expressed concern in the past about the way in which supply is 
dealt with here, we certainly concur with the motion put forward 
by the government whip.
<P>
	In light of the fact that the government whip indicated there 
was agreement from all recognized parties in the House, we are 
happy to participate in the process.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Vote 5, in the amount of $155,817,000 under Parliament-House of 
Commons-Program expenditures, in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 1996 (less the amount voted in Interim Supply), be concurred 
in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to ask, I think you 
would find unanimous consent to apply the vote just completed 
to the motion now before the House in the following way: 
Liberal Party members will vote yea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> On vote 5, Bloc Quebecois members will also 
vote yea.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party members vote no, 
but we really think the government should reduce this billion 
dollars by $9 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the New Democratic 
Party present in the House today vote nay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would like my vote to count with the government henceforth this 
evening.
