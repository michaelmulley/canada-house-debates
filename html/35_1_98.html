<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOXICSUBSTANCES">TOXIC SUBSTANCES</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, this morning I am 
releasing for consultation a discussion paper outlining a 
proposed Canadian policy for the management of toxic 
substances.
<P>
	The policy proposes that Canada introduce the most advanced 
toxic substances strategy in the world. It would be the leading 
approach taken by any nation. The document is based on the 
most up to date international scientific findings and is consistent 
with the conclusions recently reached by the world's leading 
scientific experts at a meeting of the Society of Environmental 
Toxicology and Chemistry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Although the document I am tabling today contains some very 
complex information, the objectives of the policy document are 
quite straightforward. We want to eliminate from the 
environment, as completely as possible, all substances that are 
the result of human activity, take a long time to break down in 
the environment, accumulate in living organisms and are toxic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bottom line is that the Canadian government wants to see 
no measurable release of toxic substances into the environment. 
We want to clean up what is there now and we want our 
international partners to do the same.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the case of all other substances that meet only one or more 
of these criteria, we propose to put in place a system for the 
integrated management of their life cycles.
<P>
[English]
<P>
	We propose to take a leading edge approach to toxics, those 
that are currently being used in Canada and those that may be 
introduced in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If we cannot find ways to prevent toxics from being released 
into the environment, we intend to take steps to prevent their 
manufacture and use.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new policy involves a principle of reverse onus. It is a 
very simple principle, a principle that applies now when we deal 
with issues like medication. It basically means that the onus is 
on industry to satisfy Canadians that a substance is safe rather 
than vice versa.
<P>
	When a substance is targeted for virtual elimination, the onus 
will be on industry to prove that it will achieve no measurable 
release into the environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to our proposal, the most hazardous toxics should 
not be allowed in the environment at all, and management of any 
other substance that causes problems should be subject to the 
strictest possible controls.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The policy would provide a clear framework for all federal 
laws, regulations, policies and programs dealing with toxics.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the coming weeks, our government will consult all the 
provinces and territories, business sectors and environmental 
groups on the subject of the process and about any 
improvements they would like to see in the policy and the 
discussion paper. We want to find out what Canadians think by 
November 30, because time is of the essence where the health of 
Canadians is concerned.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that our ultimate goal is to have a 
national policy on toxic substances that is the best in the world. 
We need a healthy environment, both for our economic 
well-being and our personal well-being. We must concentrate 
on preventing environmental damage instead of taking action 
once the damage is done. More efficient management of toxics 
means that the federal government must take a militant 
approach.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6178"> 6178 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the red book we said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada needs a new approach that focuses on preventing pollution at source. 
Timetables must be set for the phasing out all use of the most persistent toxic 
substances. Manufacturing innovations are needed to avoid the use or creation of 
pollutants in the first place; for example, through raw material substitution or 
closed-loop processes that recycle chemicals within the plant. There is no 
alternative if Canadians wish to stop long-term toxic pollutants from entering 
our air, soil, and water.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A new policy that will be the focus of Canada's position on 
toxic substances in our negotiations with the rest of the world. 
We want Canada to lead the way in a movement for international 
action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The simple reality is that Canada is open to the world on the 
Arctic, the Pacific and the Atlantic. We cannot solve our toxic 
problem alone. We must encourage our American neighbours 
and indeed the whole world to clean up their act. Airborne toxics 
do not respect borders. The milk of nursing mothers in Inuit 
communities that have never been touched by industrialization 
is contaminated by toxins used literally thousands of kilometres 
away. Toxics dumped in the sea do not respect borders.
<P>
	I had a meeting earlier this week with Canadian and U.S. 
members on the International Joint Commission who advised 
me that when we move to a policy of zero discharge in Lake 
Superior, which should be in the not too distant future, that lake 
will still suffer from levels of toxicity up to 25 per cent because 
of airborne toxins that come from countries around the world.
<P>
	If we are to protect Canada and Canadians we need local 
action. We need global action. We need a global agreement. We 
will only be in a position to reach that agreement if Canada leads 
from a position of strength. If we have the best policy in the 
world, if we clean up our own toxic act, we will be able to 
encourage other countries to follow suit.
<P>
	Canada must take the lead to establish its position to influence 
the international agenda on the reduction and virtual elimination 
of toxins. To that end we intend to host an international 
conference on airborne toxins in Vancouver. We hope, along 
with other countries, to pull together an international agenda for 
joint action on the reduction and virtual elimination of toxins. 
We need to seize that opportunity to present a model program to 
the world.
<P>
	The proposed policy would control the entry of toxic 
substances into Canada from sources outside our country 
through commerce and long range transport. If we can move our 
country ahead in managing toxics we can be at the vanguard of 
new environmental technologies, new green jobs and new 
opportunities. Sooner or later the world will move to control 
toxic substances, and we want  Canadians to be in the best 
position to capture the new markets for green alternatives.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Within the next few weeks, I will be announcing new 
environmental initiatives to be taken by the government.
<P>
	I hope, whatever other disagreements we may have, that all 
members of Parliament will agree on the importance of moving 
forward on our country's environmental agenda.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All members of Parliament must agree on the importance of 
moving forward on the country's environmental agenda. I think 
we all agree that we need to take very serious action to deal with 
toxic substances that are potentially a poison to our children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some of the proposals in the discussion paper may seem 
harsh, but we really must stop poisoning ourselves, our children 
and our world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know the 60-day time frame is a tight one. I also know that 
the time to end toxic substances is rapidly running out. That is 
why I look forward to not only the discussion but the resolution 
of the toughest toxics policy in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
happy to hear from the Minister of the Environment that she 
intends to establish a new policy on toxic waste. You will 
understand, however, that we cannot give our support to this 
working paper without first having a chance to examine it. The 
minister's intentions seem good, but the federal regulations are 
often not implemented in due form.
<P>
	The implementation of the primary Canadian legislation 
concerning toxic substances, the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act, presents a number of difficulties. For example, 
in the two years since the CEPA was first implemented, some 
20,000 substances have been placed on the domestic substance 
list and 44 have been identified for assessment and added to the 
priority substance list.
<P>
	In his 1991 report, the auditor general noted that, although the 
CEPA required that the 44 substances on this list be analyzed by 
1994, only two had been investigated fully. In addition, 
Environment Canada and National Health and Welfare have 
assessed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6179"> 6179 </A></B>
<P>
20 of the 33 chemical products on the list. To date, only ten of 
these assessments have been made public.
<P>
	The creation of the Office of Enforcement is an initiative that 
should help to solve these problems, but a number of concerns 
remain, particularly with respect to the regulation and control of 
toxic substances. Thus, according to the Auditor General, there 
is confusion within the federal administration regarding who is 
responsible for introducing environmental programs and the 
department has failed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing 
controls.
<P>
	This example, just one among many, is a clear indication that 
the federal government is already having trouble enforcing the 
CEPA. The minister should show us what means she intends to 
use to ensure compliance with the policy she will be introducing 
and she should realize that this is necessary if she is ever going 
to make us think that it will have a definite impact on the use of 
toxic substances in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to see the minister's policy ensure a healthier 
environment and an improved quality of life for us all.
<P>
	The minister talks about regulating industry in order to 
prevent the proliferation of toxic substances. Industry should 
convince the government that a given substance should not be 
eliminated from the environment. However, the federal 
government is not itself snow white in this regard.
<P>
	I would invite the minister to take a stroll in the Old Port of 
Montreal, a few hundred metres from the downtown core. I 
would invite her to wander over to hangar No. 3 by the 
Alexandra pier, at the corner of Callières and de la Commune. 
The federal government is storing 1.5 tonnes of PCBs here in 
downtown Montreal, for lack of another appropriate site.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	There is no cause for alarm. The building is inspected on a 
regular basis and well guarded at all times. But I can assure you 
that the Old Port of Montreal officials would be only too willing 
to get rid of it. Environment Canada should above all manage 
these toxic substances responsibly, by not taking any risk, 
however remote, of causing an environmental disaster in the 
heart of Montreal.
<P>
	Last week-end, I had the opportunity of discussing with 
members of environmental groups from Quebec and Canada at 
the general assembly of the Canadian Environmental Network. 
These people strongly dedicated to environmental protection 
described to us the enormous difficulties they are faced with 
when working on issues involving dangerous substances.
<P>
	What they are referring to is the powerful lobby of big 
industries that use harmful chemicals for the manufacturing or 
conversion of certain products. We must warn the hon. minister 
of the political and economic context of the discussions she is 
planning to have with the industry with respect to the burden 
that shall rest on it of proving that a given chemical substance 
poses no immediate or long-term threat to the environment.
<P>
	The minister also indicated that she intended to discuss with 
the provinces with a view to improving on the working paper she 
has tabled. This is the least she can do. In fact, toxic substances 
control does not fall under the jurisdiction of any level of 
government under the Canadian constitution. Both the federal 
and provincial governments can act in that area and it is of 
paramount importance that all levels of government be involved 
in developing a policy in that respect.
<P>
	Having read the minister's paper over, if it is clear that 
Quebec's jurisdiction was respected and that the policy 
provisions were duly negotiated with the Quebec government, 
the Bloc Quebecois will give its support to the minister's policy 
proposal. This means that the Bloc Quebecois support depends 
for a large part on the consultation process the Minister of 
Environment will choose to use with the provinces.
<P>
	Environment is one area where Quebec and Canada can set 
common goals. A sovereign Quebec will quite obviously 
negotiate environmental agreements with its neighbours. Where 
the interests of Quebec and Canada coincide, which is often the 
case with regard to environmental protection, the governments 
must agree to look for a mutually beneficial solution to the 
problems confronting us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this paper.
<P>
	We are all environmentalists. I believe the environment 
committee is an excellent example. It is one of the committees 
on which we all get along because we have the same aims. The 
difference is degree, and that is what we are talking about here.
<P>
	Toxic substances can be brought into the scene, for example in 
eastern Europe, in particular Romania where there were huge 
quantities of waste going into the air. The other end of the 
spectrum is something like Wood Buffalo National Park. We are 
in the middle. We clearly want to manage our affairs in the best 
way possible.
<P>
	There are naturally occurring substances such as mercury, 
lead and asbestos but then there are the man made toxics which 
are the ones we are talking about today. Clearly something that 
is toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative should not be on our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6180"> 6180 </A></B>
<P>
shopping list. Those should not be there and I believe that is 
where we are going.
<P>
	My concern, however, is that we take too hard a line. In some 
areas of B.C. we have done that. I would hope that there are good 
scientific data so that we are acting from a good broad base 
rather than a good feel, for example. As the onus is going to be 
on industry, it needs to be involved.
<P>
	I would like to go back into my other life, when I first got to 
Port Alberni in 1970. This is not a criticism of the pulp mill 
industry; in fact it is the reverse. The first time I got to Port 
Alberni I parked in a hotel lot. The next morning I got up and I 
could not see out my windshield because of the fly ash from the 
pulp mill. That was 24 years ago.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	It was the same for scuba divers I talked to who had gone out 
into the canal. The bottom of the canal 25 years ago was like a 
wasteland. Today Alberni is much different. One has to take a 
second look at the mill on a day during which there is low 
humidity so there will be no steam to actually see if that mill is 
running. There is just heat going out of the stacks. There is no fly 
ash.
<P>
	When I talk to scuba divers now they say the marine life in the 
harbour has all come back. That is where we have come in 24 
years.
<P>
	The minister is to be complimented on the consultation 
process. I have concerns about the time frame because it is 
clearly pretty tight. I would hope that in the process the minister 
will listen to what comes out of that process. I hope it is not set 
down in stone now so that in the process it can evolve.
<P>
	I am pleased to see all the groups, environmental groups, the 
industry, all levels, so they can have input into this process. 
There are some concerns with international agreements and the 
Great Lakes. How does it tie into CEPA, the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act?
<P>
	In short, I look forward to working with this document. I 
thank the minister for getting it to us so quickly.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> The Grain 
Transportation Agency advises as follows: (a), (b) and (c).
<P>
	The Grain Transportation Agency assumed responsibility 
from the Canadian Wheat Board for administering the car fleet 
in 1987. This responsibility includes dividing the fleet between 
the railways and negotiating new operating agreements with the 
railways. The operating agreement establishes the terms and 
conditions for operation of the federally owned hopper cars. The 
federal hopper car fleet consists of 12,902 cars which the 
government has provided for railway use to transport grain free 
of charge. The first operating agreement between the 
government and CP Rail and CN Rail was established in 1972. 
Prior to 1972 the railways supplied their own cars to meet 
western grain 
<P>

<P>
movement. As grain became an increasingly non-compensatory 
movement, the railways found it uneconomical to invest in 
rolling stock and the governments, federal and provincial, began 
supplying cars to meet export demand. Since the passage of the 
Western Grain Transportation Act, the WGTA, the railways are 
responsible for augmenting the fleet to meet all demands. The 
railcars are used to transport eligible commodities listed in the 
WGTA.
<P>
	The bulk of the federal fleet would be moving grain in western 
Canada to domestic and export positions. If the federal cars are 
used outside the western division, basically western Canada, the 
railways pay funds to the federal government under the alternate 
use agreement.
<P>
	The Grain Transportation Agency also administers the 
alternate use agreements. Government cars can be used in 
alternate service in order to improve customer service, to reduce 
railcar switching and improve system efficiency as long as the 
railways are able to meet WGTA movement requirements. The 
agreements restrict the number of cars in alternative service. 
Alternative service includes non-WGTA movements outside 
western Canada. The railways are charged a commercial per 
diem rate. The money earned through alternate use agreements 
is paid to the federal government through the consolidated 
revenue fund. Funds totalling $3.4 million were earned during 
the 1992-93 crop year.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have given the Chair notice of a point of order arising 
from comments made in the House during a debate on Bill C-41 
on Tuesday of last week.
<P>
	I will state my point of order briefly. It arises pursuant to the 
provisions of Standing Order 18 of the House. That standing 
order lists a number of groups and states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No member shall speak disrespectfully of-nor use offensive words against 
either House or against-any Member thereof.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on from there.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	On Tuesday of last week the following words were spoken in 
the House: ``The reference to sexual orientation in the code and 
its proposed inclusion in the human rights legislation gives 
recognition to a faction in our society which is undermining and 
destroying our Canadian values and Christian morality''. It goes 
on to state: ``Homosexuality is not natural. It is immoral and it is 
undermining the inherent rights and values of our Canadian 
families and it must not and should not be condoned''.
<P>
	Those words, spoken by the member for Central Nova, clearly 
in my view give rise to a point of order pursuant to Standing 
Order 18. As a gay man, indeed as the only openly gay member 
of the House, I want to point out that certainly I am not the only 
homosexual in the House. Indeed there are gay people on both 
sides of the House and in the other place. I dare say there always 
have been, just as gays and lesbians are found in all other walks 
of life.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 18, I want to ask what could be 
more offensive, to use the words of Standing Order 18, than to 
suggest that my very existence is immoral, unnatural, 
destroying Canadian values and must not be condoned. If 
similar hateful words had been directed toward another 
minority, be they Jews, Blacks, Chinese Canadians, people with 
disabilities or aboriginal people, all of whom are represented in 
the House, it is inconceivable the Chair would not have 
intervened and called the offending speaker to order. Therefore I 
want to ask why the standard should be any lower in the case of 
hatred directed at gays and lesbians in the House.
<P>
	Finally, just to conclude, it is not good enough to suggest that 
just because these words are not directed at a specific individual 
therefore they can be spoken with impunity. If the words are 
unparliamentary if spoken with reference to one individual 
member, why should they lose that character if spoken of an 
unnamed general group of members?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Madam Speaker, I feel 
I have a right and an obligation to respond to the point of order. I 
point out to the Chair this is not a point of order that the member 
for Burnaby-Kingsway raises.
<P>
	If any member has the right to rise on a point of order arising 
from our debates on the floor of the House on Tuesday, 
September 20, 1994, it would be me. I have a right as a 
parliamentarian to express unequivocally what I feel is 
appropriate on debate when scrutinizing legislation.
<P>
	If anyone has any concerns it should be this member because 
of the comments made by the member for Burnaby-Kingsway. 
In <I>Hansard</I> the Speaker will see where he refers to me making 
statements on the floor of the House that I did not in fact make 
on the floor of the House. He specifically makes reference to 
select words and uses the words out of context, words arising 
from a debate on May 15, 1994 on the CBC prime time news 
program ``On the Line''. The issue discussed and debated was 
what rights should gays be entitled to and questions were posed 
by both the commentator and the public at large.
<P>
	The member for Burnaby-Kingsway stood on the floor of the 
House and used select words and put to other members of the 
House his opinion of what I said. I will quote specifically from 
<I>Hansard</I> at page 5913. He states: ``Will she now stand in her 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6184"> 6184 </A></B>
<P>
place and retract those hateful comments?'' He makes reference 
to words that I used on the floor of the House as being hateful.
<P>
	Second, he indicates that I have no place in the Liberal Party. 
He then refers to me at page 5912 as ``the hon. member, and I use 
those words advisedly''. That is not proper parliamentary 
language.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	At page 5916, speaking to another member when I was not 
present in the House, on four occasions in the same commentary 
he referred to me as ``she''. Not once did he refer to me as the 
member for Central Nova. I object to that. That is improper. He 
is a senior parliamentarian and I expect respect on the floor of 
the House, particularly when I am not present.
<P>
	At page 5919 the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway in a 
commentary to the hon. member for Yellowknife said: ``The 
hon. member was present in the House'', referring to the 
member for Yellowknife, ``when the Liberal member of 
Parliament for Central Nova made comments, among other 
things, suggesting that homosexuality is immoral and unnatural 
when she suggested that AIDS was a scourge to mankind which 
had been inflicted upon the country by homosexuals''.
<P>
	Nowhere in <I>Hansard</I> will it be seen that I made those 
comments on the floor of the House. I demand a public apology.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to make a few brief comments which may 
assist the Chair.
<P>
	I think it is obvious that two members of Parliament have 
made statements in the House on which they obviously have 
strong views and have disagreed with each other. One member 
said that another member had suggested that AIDS was a 
scourge and so on. I do not know whether those comments were 
made anywhere but they were not made on the floor of the 
House. To repeat them here in the House certainly is not helpful 
to any hon. member nor to the debate nor even to decorum.
<P>
	On the other hand it is quite true that from time to time 
members of the House do make statements with which others 
disagree. I think the issue before us this morning is whether or 
not Standing Order 18 has been breached, notwithstanding all 
other considerations.
<P>
	Standing Order 18 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No Member shall speak disrespectfully of the Sovereign, nor of any member 
of the Royal Family, nor of the Governor General or the person administering 
the Government of Canada; nor use offensive words against either House, or 
against any Member thereof. No Member may reflect upon any vote of the 
House-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think those words in our rules have traditionally been 
interpreted by you, Madam Speaker, and by other occupants of 
the chair as meaning that a member of Parliament cannot accuse 
another member of having done a particular thing which is 
offensive. I cannot accuse another member of Parliament 
personally of having committed a criminal act, for instance. I 
cannot accuse another member of other types of wrongdoing in 
the House and get away with it.
<P>
	The reason that standing order is there is obviously so that the 
occupant of the chair can remind members that anyone in the 
House who makes an accusation personally against another 
member is forced to withdraw in order to have proper decorum 
and order in the House.
<P>
	We have before us today a case of strong disagreement 
between two people. I am not judging the disagreement. I am 
suggesting that Standing Order 18 has not been breached in this 
particular case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on 
the same point of order. I would urge you to rule that this is not a 
point of order that is before us but a matter of debate where two 
members of the House of Commons have put a point of view 
forward and it is part of debate.
<P>
	When I look at the circumstances here in referencing Standing 
Order 18, the member as I recall from what I heard was not 
referencing a specific member but was talking to a general 
circumstance. I think that must be taken into consideration when 
you make your ruling, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	I believe that as members of the House of Commons we are 
given the privilege of speaking about a variety of subjects, of 
giving our opinion personally or on behalf of other individuals 
or on behalf of our constituents. When we do that we take the 
responsibility for those opinions and those words as we set them 
before the House. Those are items of debate in the House and do 
not come under what we are referencing today or considering a 
point of order. We have that privilege. Sometimes we are going 
to say things in the House that are not deemed to be politically 
correct. That may not be acceptable to some people but in 
general in referencing freedom of speech they are acceptable 
and can be said as a member of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. It has 
been brought to my attention that I made reference to the hon. 
member for Yellowknife and I wish to apologize if there were 
problems arising from that. It is the hon. member for 
Yellowhead. I apologize if there was any confusion there.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6185"> 6185 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The Chair realizes the 
seriousness of the matter before it. We will take it under 
advisement and come back to the House very shortly.
<P>
	I wish to inform the House that, pursuant to Standing Order 
33(2)(b), because of the ministerial statement Government 
Orders will be extended by 20 minutes.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARDACT">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food)</B> moved that Bill C-50, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, last October the government was 
elected based on a comprehensive plan for Canada known as the 
red book, which was our platform. In that red book we made a 
number of commitments to the people of Canada. I am very 
pleased that within our first 11 months in office we have made 
considerable headway on a number of fronts.
<P>
	As Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food it is my great 
pleasure to speak today about one of these initiatives, namely 
the government's commitment to research and development 
specifically in the context of Bill C-50.
<P>
	I recall attending my very first meeting with producers as a 
new minister. It was a meeting of the Manitoba pool elevators 
last November in Winnipeg. There were a number of issues on 
the minds of delegates at that meeting. They wanted to talk 
about GATT and about trade issues. They wanted to discuss 
transportation and safety nets. All of these issues have been 
moving forward at a very rapid pace and some of them with 
much public fanfare and media interest.
<P>
	I also recall at that meeting another important issue that was 
raised by one of the delegates, one which received less fanfare 
and less public attention. The question was about research. I told 
the delegates at the Manitoba pool convention what I have been 
telling farmers and farm organizations across the country 
throughout the course of this past year. I believe agricultural 
research is an extremely important issue, one where we must 
continue to focus our resources.
<P>
	My department already has a very good track record in 
selecting research and development projects with a high return 
for Canada. We are continually reviewing our research priorities 
and programs to ensure that we are getting the best possible 
value for every research dollar. We are also nurturing our 
partnership approach to industry responsive research by inviting 
our industry, academic and producer partners to take 
responsibility with us.
<P>
	We are placing a strong emphasis on matching funding and 
joint projects with stakeholders in all facets of our operations. 
This allows us to use the market for direction.
<P>
	Some might say this approach reduces the federal 
commitment to research or that my department may use the 
check-off proposed in Bill C-50 as an excuse to reduce 
expenditures in wheat and barley research. While it is likely that 
overall government spending will decline as we battle against 
the deficit, as we must, I want to emphasize that innovation and 
a strong research program are essential to Canadian agriculture 
and will be a priority for my department.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	I make no apologies for sharing the responsibility of the 
future of agriculture with our industry and producer partners. 
Some members may have heard me talk about the matching 
investment initiative which we have launched this past year. 
Under this program we will spend some of our existing R and D 
dollars in a new way. Where industry identifies research 
projects that are of commercial interest we will match industry's 
investment dollar for dollar. This is not new money but money 
we have redirected from lower priority activities.
<P>
	This approach makes sense and allows us to move forward on 
research while maintaining fiscal responsibility to Canadians. 
Producers have told me they want to play an important role in 
research since the results of research directly affect their 
operations and ultimately their livelihoods. This shared 
approach gives us the best of both worlds.
<P>
	Good research is not a frill or an ivory tower pursuit to be 
thrown aside in tough times. Dedicated and focused research is a 
necessity for survival particularly in tough times. Dedicated and 
focused research supplies the technology that creates 
opportunities for market development and new exports which 
are so vital to the sustainability of our industry.
<P>
	One of the most important initiatives with significant long 
term implications for the future of agriculture generally and the 
grains industry in particular is in plant breeding. Today we are 
considering Bill C-50 which is legislation that will lead to an 
additional $4.7 million in annual investments in plant breeding 
research.
<P>
	This investment has the potential in about 10 years to 
translate into a $400 million increase in gross returns to prairie 
farmers annually. It is an investment which will cost wheat 
producers about half a cent a bushel or about 20 cents a tonne. I 
think any investor would be more than just a little interested 
about such an attractive rate of return.
<P>
	What I am talking about today is a research partnership, the 
result of a proposal put forward by producers through the 
Western Grains Research Foundation. The proposal calls for a 
voluntary producer levy or a check-off program to support plant 
breeding research programs for wheat and barley. The federal  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6186"> 6186 </A></B>
<P>
government is acting on this recommendation from the 
foundation.
<P>
	For the past several months my department has been working 
very closely with the Western Grains Research Foundation to 
develop a check-off program which will enable grain producers 
themselves to supplement existing research budgets. To make 
this happen we require some legislative amendments. That is 
why I am recommending that the act which governs the 
Canadian Wheat Board be amended to allow voluntary levies to 
be deducted for the explicit purpose of supporting plant 
breeding research. Such deductions are simply not possible 
under the existing Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	I bring this legislation to the House today and I am asking 
members to support it based on the knowledge that this program 
is a joint effort among government, industry and the research 
community. This check-off plan has been developed in close 
consultation with producer groups as well as with scientists 
from universities and from my department.
<P>
	As I stated earlier I am a firm believer that the best way we can 
accomplish our research objectives is for both industry and 
government to invest in research in a partnership approach. This 
effort before you, this specific check-off plan, is supported by 
the Canadian Wheat Board and has already received strong 
support from a majority of farm organizations. And well it 
should since the concept has been a producer initiative from day 
one, an initiative which we have been working on with 
producers to make it a reality.
<P>
	This program will generate additional research funds through 
the voluntary levies on wheat and barley sales. The levies will be 
deducted from Canadian Wheat Board final payments to 
producers. They will apply to board sales of most wheat in the 
four western provinces and the sales of barley in Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and B.C. Alberta sales of soft white wheat and barley 
would not be subject to this levy as producers of those 
commodities already have check-offs in place provincially.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Some people might point to reduced wheat acreages and 
suggest that producers will not want to support a so-called 
declining crop. To these people I would say that despite ongoing 
diversification of crops, wheat is still a major crop for many 
producers on the prairies. Last year it contributed $2.7 billion to 
the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Despite the recent and dramatic surge in the importance of 
canola as a crop in Canada, with better world prices in the last 
number of weeks wheat may have regained its rank as our most 
valuable crop. It is important to remember also that wheat is not 
one crop but actually is seven. Some varieties such as durum, 
extra strong, and white prairie spring are gaining acreage and 
gaining market share.
<P>
	I would like to provide the House with a bit of background 
about why research levies are needed and what we hope to 
achieve with them. I would like to  explain how the grain 
producers on the prairies in partnership with government came 
to the decision that such levies are a necessary and important 
key to the future of prairie agriculture and the grains industry in 
Canada.
<P>
	The Western Grains Research Foundation is a federally 
chartered public organization with a proven track record in 
supporting effective pure research. It was established just over 
10 years ago to allocate research funds. Its economic base came 
from the interest earned on $9 million left over from the prairie 
farm assistance act when it was repealed.
<P>
	Currently the foundation distributes about $900,000 a year in 
interest funds. It has done some very good work with that 
money. It has focused on vital issues such as the problem with 
fusarium head blight in Manitoba. The foundation is quick in its 
reaction time and it is targeted on vital issues.
<P>
	The foundation is run by a board of directors representing its 
member producer organizations and includes a representative 
from the research branch of my department. What this means is 
that the research decisions of the Western Grains Research 
Foundation are made by producers and the foundation is 
accountable for those decisions to all of its producers as well as 
the federal government.
<P>
	To carry out its new research objectives the foundation will 
establish two research advisory committees, one for wheat 
breeding and one for barley breeding. These committees will be 
responsible for developing operational plans and co-ordinating 
research programs designed to achieve our plant breeding 
objectives. They will decide which research projects to fund in 
western research centres and the emphasis will be on funding 
work that will meet a future market need.
<P>
	Western plant breeding centres receiving funding will report 
on their progress annually to the Western Grains Research 
Foundation. This progress will be reviewed by the advisory 
committees who will make decisions about continued support. 
Furthermore the foundation will report annually to all prairie 
permit book holders giving an accounting of the money received 
and how it has been used to accomplish the research goals.
<P>
	The role of the Canadian Wheat Board in all of this is purely 
administrative. All major decisions will be the responsibility of 
the Western Grains Research Foundation which is ultimately 
accountable to its producers and to the Government of Canada. I 
feel very comfortable with the accountability process which the 
Western Grains Research Foundation has established for itself 
under this proposed program.
<P>
	In supporting these amendments to the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act hon. members of the House will be in very good 
company. They will in fact be joining a team of supporters from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6187"> 6187 </A></B>
<P>
12 prairie farm organizations which make up the Western Grains 
Research Foundation.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Those member organizations are: United Grain Growers; 
Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association; Manitoba Pool 
Elevators; Prairie Canola Growers Council; Flax Growers of 
Western Canada; Saskatchewan Wheat Pool; Keystone 
Agricultural Producers; Western Barley Growers Association; 
Oat Producers of Alberta; Alberta Wheat Pool; Canadian Seed 
Growers Association; and the Unifarm organization of Alberta. 
There are recent indications that other groups and organizations 
wish to join this team of research oriented and progressive farm 
organizations.
<P>
	These organizations are key players in the Canadian grains 
industry. All of them have backed the voluntary check-off 
proposal and they have consulted with their producer members. 
It was the decision of these organizations that dedicated 
research funds be collected and applied explicitly to plant 
breeding research.
<P>
	What we have here is a program that producers want. It is one 
we will be supporting through the legislative amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act now before the House in the form of 
Bill C-50. Simply put, the program will enable producers to do 
what they have asked for: to invest a portion of their own money 
into the future of their crops, their industry and their very 
livelihoods.
<P>
	Canada's grains industry is highly dependent on exports. 
Today's grain customers are demanding both a stable supply and 
a high quality product that meets their end use requirements. I 
have consistently maintained that we must be able to respond 
quickly to changing market conditions if we are to remain 
competitive in those vital global markets.
<P>
	The proposal before the House will help us to improve our 
competitive advantage while also improving farm incomes. 
New varieties of wheat and barley will be developed. New 
varieties will lead to improved field performance, higher yield 
potentials, increased resistance to disease and insect pests, 
earlier maturity and reduced harvest losses, all improvements 
which will reduce per tonne production costs for farmers.
<P>
	The development of new varieties with specific qualities 
required by the marketplace will improve sales through the 
development of new market opportunities. This will keep 
Canada on the fast track in meeting marketplace demands.
<P>
	For example, Canada must be able to respond rapidly to new 
demands for varieties of wheat suitable for specific uses such as 
frozen bread dough, Asian type noodles, or new varieties of 
malting barley that are needed in markets like Korea and China. 
In fact we do have a variety of wheat that is suitable for the 
frozen bread dough requirement, but so far it is not grown in 
large enough quantities.
<P>
	Meeting the demands of these changing trends in food 
consumption preferences could mean significant new market 
potential and increased profits for western producers. Sound 
investments in crop research will pay off in better market 
returns to farmers in the future.
<P>
	Will Canada be ready when opportunity knocks in terms of 
these new markets? With the benefit of research initiatives such 
as this voluntary check-off proposal contained in Bill C-50, I 
firmly believe Canadian farmers will be in a better position to 
compete in that very tough and demanding international 
marketplace.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the program has the potential to bring plant 
breeding research almost $5 million in additional funding each 
year. The House will note that I used the word additional. This is 
important. I know concern has been expressed in some quarters 
that governments might take advantage of the contributions 
made by producers under this program to reduce the government 
spending on wheat and barley breeding programs.
<P>
	We all know that cuts have occurred throughout government 
and that overall spending reductions are likely to be a fact of life 
in government for the foreseeable future. My department will 
not target wheat and barley research for special reductions just 
because of the contributions made by farmers under the 
program. Funding levels for wheat and barley research will be 
held in proper proportion to the amount being spent on research 
for other grain crops within the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Here is how this voluntary check-off will be implemented. It 
will work in the simplest form possible through deductions from 
Canadian Wheat Board final payments before that money is 
distributed to farmers. When I say ``as simple as possible'' I 
mean just that.
<P>
	There are no huge administrative costs or red tape. I would 
suggest that the administrative costs proposed in Bill C-50 will 
be lower than the costs of other similar types of programs 
already in place in some provinces.
<P>
	Annual operating costs are estimated to be in the order of 
$106,000 a year or about 2 per cent of revenues. That amount 
will be deducted from the total amount of levies collected. 
Western producers of wheat and barley would pay levies of 20 
cents per tonne on wheat and 40 cents per tonne on barley. The 
barley levy is higher to partially offset the lower volume of 
barley deliveries.
<P>
	The amount to be levied will be fixed by order in council. The 
levies will be deducted from Canadian Wheat Board final 
payments beginning with those for the 1993-94 crop year and 
those final payments in the ordinary course of events for 
1993-94 would be made in January 1995.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6188"> 6188 </A></B>
<P>
	The funds collected, beginning in the coming year and in 
subsequent years, will be automatically transferred by the 
Canadian Wheat Board to special accounts set up and 
administered by the Western Grains Research Foundation.
<P>
	This program is not intended to duplicate or replace current 
check-off programs already in place in some provinces. 
Producers who choose not to participate may opt out if that is 
their preference. Any farmer wishing to opt out of the levy on an 
annual basis can do so by a simple notice in writing.
<P>
	However early indications are that we can anticipate a 
participation rate in this check-off program in the order of 90 
per cent. We have confidence in that participation rate because 
this program has been initiated by producers and producer 
organizations. It has had their keen support throughout its 
developmental stages to the point now where legislation is ready 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Research and development spending cannot be simply turned 
on and turned off like a tap. Such an attitude toward research 
only results in inadequate and inconsistent support and missed 
opportunities. Inaction on the research front would negate the 
day to day efforts of hardworking farmers across the prairies and 
Canada would risk losing its competitive edge in wheat and 
barley markets. We absolutely cannot run the risk of our wheat 
and barley breeding programs falling behind those of our 
competitors. For years now our major competitors like 
Australia, the United States and the European Union have been 
taking a direct role in renewing public plant breeding programs 
in wheat and barley. Incidentally, much of their research has 
been implemented as a result of producer funded programs. A 
check-off or a producer levy in Canada is required to keep up 
with that international competition.
<P>
	I am pleased to bring forward this producer initiative to 
increase funding for plant breeding research in Canada. The 
proposed wheat and barley check-off is a very good example of 
how producers and government can work constructively 
together to achieve something that will benefit the industry as 
whole and will translate into benefits for future Canadians.
<P>
	I recommend that the House approve Bill C-50 amending the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act to allow voluntary levies to be 
deducted in support of this important research program. I am 
anxious to hear the comments and remarks of members of the 
House who I hope will indicate their support for this particular 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I would draw to the attention of the House, this being Tuesday 
morning, that I have a commitment in cabinet to which I must 
attend. I regret not being able to stay to listen to the remarks that 
will be offered by other members in the course of the debate.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the secretary of state for agriculture and 
agri-food and my parliamentary secretary will both be here and 
listening to the remarks of hon. members. I suspect they will be 
participating in the debate. I very much look forward to the 
reaction of members to this important bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
the new agriculture critic for the Bloc Quebecois, the Official 
Opposition, I am happy this morning to speak to Bill C-50 on 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	According to the information we received at our meeting this 
week with Agriculture Canada officials, this bill results from a 
Western grain producers' initiative. What they want is simple: 
they are willing to cut back on their profits in order to invest in 
research aimed at improving the genetic quality of wheat and 
barley. This bill will allow the Canadian Wheat Board to make 
deductions from wheat and barley producers' final payment 
cheques for the purpose of increasing private research funding.
<P>
	As the single marketing agent for Canadian wheat and barley, 
the Canadian Wheat Board buys almost all grain produced. 
Deductions of 20 cents per tonne of wheat and 40 cents per tonne 
of barley will be made from payments on delivery. These figures 
were calculated by estimating research needs in millions of 
dollars and dividing the total by the number of tonnes bought.
<P>
	As a Quebec farmer, I know much more about beef, pork and 
milk production than about grain production. So I was surprised 
to learn that although the bill only refers to wheat, the officials 
who explained Bill C-50 to us assured us that amendments 
affecting wheat would automatically apply to barley under the 
regulations. It also appears that two separate funds will be 
established, one for wheat and the other one for barley.
<P>
	The deduction rates I mentioned will be set by 
order-in-council and not by legislation. This provision could 
exempt some classes of grain or some provinces. Alberta, for 
instance, will not participate in the barley deductions since the 
Alberta Barley Commission already makes such deductions.
<P>
	Again, as a Quebec farmer, I was also surprised by the fact 
that deductions are optional. Officials said they were very 
confident that grain producers would participate based on the 
current rate of participation in the Alberta Barley Commission 
deductions program. We, in Quebec, have a similar process for 
marketing and advertising milk, but participation is 
compulsory.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	A method like the one proposed here would not work in 
Quebec. As you see, we are really distinct in every way. With 
this 90 per cent participation rate, the commission intends to 
collect $4.7 million, of which $3.8 million is for wheat and 
$900,000 for barley, according to the estimates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6189"> 6189 </A></B>
<P>
	This money will then be used to subsidize research on 
improving the genetic quality of wheat and barley. Also, 
increasing the yield per acre makes the varieties more resistant 
to diseases and parasites and helps find new varieties to better 
meet new market requirements.
<P>
	The first question that comes to our mind is of course the 
funding that Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada allocates to 
research on wheat and barley. We are told that the budget for it 
now is $18.7 million. If so, why must producers fund parallel or 
complementary research out of their own pocket? Do not 
misunderstand me. I think it is quite laudable to encourage 
farmers to take charge and proceed with the solutions that they 
know are best for them.
<P>
	Nevertheless, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada should not 
shift its responsibilities to the private sector nor should it be 
dependent on the private sector. Last week, the Department of 
Agriculture tabled a bill that, among other things, clarifies its 
mandate by specifying the department's involvement in 
research and development. Despite this restructuring, western 
grain growers conclude that they have to pay twice to benefit 
from research that meets their needs.
<P>
	All taxpayers, which of course includes farmers, already pay 
$18.7 million for research and development on wheat and 
barley. Nevertheless, farmers will have to invest $4.7 million 
more to orient the research to their priorities. The department 
explains that funding for research and development is going 
down and that the private sector must take over. In the future, 
will the Liberal government lower its share to increase the 
contribution from the private sector, namely farmers?
<P>
	Certainly, research and development is the key to remaining 
competitive on foreign markets. Initiatives such as this must be 
encouraged and the participation of the private sector, producers 
and industrialists, must be increased so that more research and 
development is carried out. But I think it is fundamental for the 
government to play its role and to finance agricultural research 
and development equitably. Earlier, I asked the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane if maple syrup producers in his riding had 
problems disposing of their production.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In my riding, and more specifically in Plessisville, the world 
capital of maple syrup, we have a surplus. I urge the federal 
Department of Agriculture to promote research on maple syrup 
and sugar in order to find new markets. Surpluses are enormous. 
Our producers must sell their maple syrup for roughly the same 
price as they did nine or ten years ago. Production costs are 
constantly increasing, while the selling price remains the same 
or is even lower than before.
<P>
	In any case, what we are looking at this morning is the 
financing of a private research group, namely the Western 
Grains Research Foundation, which has already looked at the 
issue. Private financing of research offers some benefits to that 
sector. It meets specific needs identified by those who finance 
that research. On the other hand, the information gathered may 
remain confidential. Regardless of what we may think, the 
reality is that those two factors may influence grain producers.
<P>
	The budget allocated by the department is insufficient. That 
department is all in favour of finding new markets, but it does 
not provide the necessary tools to that end. The money spent by 
the department on research and development for wheat and 
barley is not in line with priorities in that sector. This second 
finding shows a certain lack of understanding of the industry's 
needs.
<P>
	I will conclude by emphasizing the importance of 
avoiding-and the minister alluded to that issue earlier-any 
duplication or overlapping between the department's research 
projects and those of the private sector. As the member 
representing the Quebec riding of Frontenac, I know what I am 
talking about when it comes to duplication and overlapping.
<P>
	The most recent example is the referendum held in 1992. 
Quebecers are very familiar with the issue of duplication. We 
pay double and we keep our mouth shut. Last week, at a briefing 
on this bill by Agriculture officials, we were told that research 
initiatives will be discussed with the stakeholders in that sector, 
precisely to avoid any duplication or overlapping. It seems that 
the projects to be financed will complement each other but, 
unfortunately, the legislation is totally silent on that aspect.
<P>
	Right now, we support Bill C-50, except for a few minor 
details. When the time comes to review this bill section by 
section for the benefit of western farmers, we will try to coax the 
Liberal government, the minister, as well as the new 
parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Beauséjour.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Champlain will also 
discuss Bill C-50 in a few moments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, it is truly 
a pleasure to be here today to speak to Bill C-50, an act to amend 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act to allow a refundable check-off from wheat and barley 
which will be taken from the producers' final payment for the 
explicit purpose of plant breeding research.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6190"> 6190 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to start by summarizing provisions of the bill. 
The bill would allow deductions from the farmer's final 
payment checks for each pool period unless the farmer files with 
the Canadian Wheat Board to be exempted from the deduction. 
It places revenue into a special account set up and administered 
by the Western Grains Research Foundation.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board must estimate how much money it 
will take from farmers to put into the account and then estimate 
the share for the research agency. The Canadian Wheat Board 
will then give the money to the research funding agency after 
paying the administration costs to the board for administering 
the fund.
<P>
	The research funding agency would then distribute the money 
received to persons or plant breeding centres engaged in the 
research into new varieties of wheat and barley. An additional 
reserve account will also be set up into which a portion of the 
money collected will be put. This reserve account is there to 
cover the costs of research contracts if there are insufficient 
deductions in a particular pool period.
<P>
	An annual report must be submitted to the agriculture 
minister on its operations and affairs no later than the end of 
June, three months after the end of the previous fiscal year.
<P>
	The deductions would start immediately and would be 
retroactive to August 1, 1993, with farmers having to file notice 
before February 25, 1995 if they decide that they want to have 
their contributions deducted or refunded.
<P>
	The governor in council may make exemptions to the program 
on the basis of the class of wheat sold or on the province or 
region in which the wheat was produced.
<P>
	The rationale behind the bill and the assumed benefits are to 
give producers a role in supporting and directing agriculture 
research. It will give farmers control to more closely link 
agriculture research to farmers' priorities and to marketing 
priorities and needs, and to develop new wheat and barley 
varieties which will assist the competitiveness of Canadian 
farmers by providing $4.7 million in additional research money 
which certainly seems to give a good payback to farmers.
<P>
	Another rationale behind the bill is to develop new market 
opportunities and to improve farm income to reduce unit 
production costs. This is a rationale behind the bill.
<P>
	I do have some concerns about the bill. The first is a concern 
about the possible overlap in deductions. There are some farmer 
groups such as the barley commission in Alberta which have 
check-offs in place now. Will there be an overlap with the wheat 
board check-off? It is a concern. There is no fixed levy and the 
rate of the levy may be increased in the future. That is a concern 
as well.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The plan focuses on producing new crop varieties. However, 
for reasons of efficiency, farmers should probably be moving to 
completely different crops in some cases. I think it is important 
that this be considered. If the money is simply not in the 
agriculture department's budget for this type of research then I 
have a concern that the department should do some priorizing 
regarding research projects under its existing budget and not 
merely download this expense on to farmers.
<P>
	Another concern is that in the last Auditor General's report it 
was revealed that research efforts within the department of 
agriculture were very poorly co-ordinated. It is important that is 
worked on and not just allowing a separate fund to deal with the 
targeting of research money.
<P>
	There would certainly be an increase in the cost of 
administering the program. There would be new administration 
costs taken from research funding. This is always a concern and 
I think it has to be carefully monitored.
<P>
	The Reform Party and I do support the bill, however. The 
reasons for our support are that the contributions to the research 
fund are automatic, although they may be refunded on an annual 
basis upon a written application by the farmer. We propose that 
the application for refund be made easier by having a box on the 
Canadian Wheat Board permit application form which gives 
farmers a choice of whether they want to take part and want to 
have the deduction refunded.
<P>
	Another reason for support is that farmers and industry 
representatives seem to support the program. There seems to be 
widespread support among farm organizations certainly, and 
there is some support among farmers.
<P>
	Another reason for support is that the program will bring an 
additional $4.7 million of research to be targeted for wheat and 
barley, which has already I believe taken a bit of a hit in terms of 
research funding due to research money going into research on 
other crops such as peas, lentils and canola.
<P>
	The research funds I believe will be in the hands of farmers 
and farm organizations; they will direct the funding. It is 
certainly a positive step any time we can get farmers, the people 
who are going to benefit from the research directly, involved in 
allocating the funding. That is a possible move.
<P>
	Again the Reform Party supports the bill. We will be 
proposing some amendments in committee. We will do that 
when this matter is discussed in committee.
<P>
	I am extremely disappointed that any bill which opens the 
Canadian Wheat Board up to discussion was not far more broad 
and substantial. If there is any doubt at all that there is a need for 
major reforms of the Canadian Wheat Board then I would like to 
demonstrate with the scenario I am going to present now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6191"> 6191 </A></B>
<P>
	Last Thursday on a farm in southern Manitoba a group of 
seven RCMP officers, special officers and customs officials 
arrived at a farmer's door, knocked on the door and seized a wide 
variety of documents from a farmer. In a neighbouring town the 
same morning at the same time another group of RCMP officers, 
special officers and customs officials arrived at a door of 
another farmer and seized documents.
<P>
	What heinous crime had these farmers committed to have this 
large group of RCMP officers, special investigators, customs 
officials seizing their documents? Was it a drug bust? Were they 
suspected of some kind of embezzlement? Was it a crime like 
that? No. The crime they were accused of was shipping grain to 
the United States without a Canadian Wheat Board permit.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Canada signed a free trade agreement with the United States 
which allows for free movement of wheat and barley across the 
United States-Canadian border. We signed the free trade 
agreement but the crime those farmers were accused of was 
shipping wheat or barley across the border without a Canadian 
Wheat Board permit. Now that is a heinous crime.
<P>
	The government, the minister of agriculture and the revenue 
minister are using these heavy handed tactics on farmers who 
are only trying to make their business profitable and in one case 
to save the farm which is close to being foreclosed by the Farm 
Credit Corporation. Instead, why does the government not 
change the law that applies to the Canadian Wheat Board which 
prohibits farmers from taking advantage of the free trade 
agreement? I think the crime is that the government refuses to 
act in spite of a groundswell of support among farmers for these 
changes.
<P>
	I believe that we do need major reforms to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. These reforms must centre around giving farmers 
direct control over their organization which they fund. Farmers 
pay the complete operating costs for the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board was set up for farmers. It was 
much needed when it was set up and it probably still has an 
important function to serve but farmers must be given control. 
No longer is it good enough to put the control of the Canadian 
Wheat Board in the hands of government appointed 
commissioners.
<P>
	The change must start by having farmers elect a board of 
directors so they gain control of their Canadian Wheat Board. 
Beyond that I am not sure the direction in which the board would 
go. Farmers have told me some of the things they would like to 
see, but it is up to them to determine the change once they do get 
control.
<P>
	I propose that shortly after the board of directors is elected a 
mechanism should be put in place with different options for how 
the Canadian Wheat Board would look. These options can be put 
forward to farmers and they can decide what the make-up of 
their organization will be and what it will look like.
<P>
	Some of the things I have heard from farmers is that they want 
competition to be allowed with the Canadian Wheat Board. They 
want the freedom to take advantage of the free trade agreement 
by shipping their wheat and barley into the United States and 
other markets. That is what farmers have told me. Farmers have 
said that once competition is allowed to the Canadian Wheat 
Board but certainly not before, they would be open to the idea of 
the Canadian Wheat Board handling other grains and oilseeds 
and specialty crops besides wheat and barley but only after they 
have the right to compete.
<P>
	Farmers have told me they want the wheat board to continue 
to guarantee loans on wheat sold abroad only as long as other 
countries continue to do the same.
<P>
	Those are some of the things farmers have told me. Once 
again, I cannot understand why this government seems so 
opposed to giving farmers control over their organization. Why 
is it so determined not to have this happen? I do believe that 
farmers absolutely will not put up with it much longer. The 
movement is there. There are more and more groups and more 
and more farmers all the time who are supporting this change in 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not talking about getting rid of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. I am talking about improving it so it truly works for 
farmers and not just for the sake of the organization itself. Make 
it democratic.
<P>
	When talking about the wheat board the argument has been 
raised from time to time that one of the advantages of the 
Canadian Wheat Board is that because it is a monopoly, because 
it totally controls the export sales of wheat and barley, it should 
give farmers a better price. It has that bargaining power.
<P>
	First, whenever there is a monopoly involved in a market the 
market does not function well. Second. when it comes to buying 
for export the Canadian Wheat Board does have a monopoly, but 
when it comes to selling it is competing against all the other 
sellers in the world. The monopoly argument just does not work. 
The wheat board is one in an oligopoly, many sellers all of which 
do have some influence on the market.
<P>
	The argument along that line has changed since the wheat 
board was put into place. When the wheat board was originally 
put into place wheat was not nearly as diverse a commodity as it 
is today. Back then there were far fewer different grades and 
types of wheat and markets. Customers did not demand a very 
specific product. In the market today however there are dozens 
and dozens of different types of wheat. No longer is wheat just 
wheat. Customers are looking for a very specific commodity. 
This of course changes the influence of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6192"> 6192 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of looking at huge markets we are often looking at the 
smaller, harder to find markets which want a very specific 
commodity. I believe as do many farmers that the wheat board 
just does not do a good job in finding and taking advantage of 
those smaller markets. Farmers and their agent grain companies 
do a good job of that and they must be allowed to do that job. 
They must not be interfered with by the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Let us realize that times have changed. Customers are very 
demanding in terms of the products. We are looking at smaller 
more lucrative markets. Let us change the board and allow 
farmers involvement to accommodate that.
<P>
	Some have suggested that the first step in changing the board 
might be to put a continental barley market into place. This may 
well be a place to start but it does not go nearly far enough. It is 
interesting to note that both the minister of agriculture and the 
Prime Minister during the election campaign promised to hold a 
plebiscite on a continental barley market very shortly after the 
election. It was a promise. They thought it was a good idea.
<P>
	I would like to know why they are not honouring their 
promise. Farmers also want to know and they want them to 
honour their promise now and that is only reasonable. Farmers 
expect the government to keep its commitment and honour its 
promise. I expect that, as do the farmers.
<P>
	The government continually takes pride in talking about how 
it consults with people before it makes a decision. I am not going 
to talk about the general consultations in other areas, but I do 
want to talk about consultation in agriculture. The government's 
consultation in the area of agriculture has been almost 
exclusively with government organizations and with farm 
organization leaders.
<P>
	Farm organizations are extremely useful bodies. They do a lot 
of good in promoting their particular commodity or their area of 
interest, but it is time for government to talk to farmers about 
what they want in terms of their future in agriculture.
<P>
	There are plans for the committee to travel to study 
agriculture. The unfortunate thing is this plan does not allow for 
focused and organized consultation with farmers. Reform has 
put forth in committee over the past several months a very 
specific plan as to how this consultation program could be 
improved immensely.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	We have proposed focus groups with properly trained 
conciliators running them to determine what issues are 
important to farmers, what issues they want to talk about. These 
focus groups would lead to a public consultation process, public 
meetings where everyone would be welcome but the discussion 
would be focused based on the results of the focus groups.
<P>
	It would be a travesty and a misuse of taxpayers' dollars if this 
committee did not allow some type of process similar to what 
Reform has proposed. I am not saying necessarily we have the 
only process, but it will work and it will work much better than 
what the plans are now. I strongly encourage this minister to go 
ahead with that.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that we do support Bill C-50. Being 
as the Canadian Wheat Board Act has been opened up, it is a real 
shame there were not far more broad and sweeping changes. I 
compare this change to adjusting a rearview mirror on an old 
beat up car that really needs to be replaced with a brand new 
model. I encourage this government to go out and let farmers tell 
them what brand new model they want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to give notice 
that the members on the government side from now on in this 
debate will share their time, 10 minutes and 5 minutes questions 
and comments, until further notice.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the bill today, the 
amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act, particularly so 
in view of the comments I just heard from my colleague in the 
Reform Party. I shall be splitting my time with my colleague 
from Dauphin-Swan River.
<P>
	As the minister said earlier the amendment will allow a 
check-off to Canadian Wheat Board sales of wheat in the four 
western provinces and of barley sales in Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
<P>
	There are two very good reasons the bill deserves the support 
of all in the House. The amendments will pave the way for an 
additional $4.7 million annually in research funding, 
specifically in the area of plant breeding. I raise for the 
consideration of the House why the Reform Party would favour 
a long consultation process with the farm groups that are already 
supporting these amendments which would delay that kind of 
valuable research. It makes no sense to me because we already 
have grassroots support for the initiative.
<P>
	Second and more important, and it ties into the point I was just 
making, Bill C-50 is a result of a specific request by the grain 
industry. The speedy response of our government to the request 
recognizes the importance of such research initiatives as well as 
the fact that no longer can government solely be relied on for 
research. Results can be achieved only through strategic 
alliances with industry.
<P>
	My riding of Saskatoon-Humboldt includes a portion of the 
city of Saskatoon and a large rural area. It is an urban rural split 
of about 60:40 respectively. In fact this time last year I spent 
many hours on the road driving around the farm area of my 
riding during the election campaign. I remember stopping along 
the road north of Domremy to talk to a couple of farmers. I guess 
the Reform Party would call that consulting with the farmers  on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6193"> 6193 </A></B>
<P>
their views. Lawrence and André Georget took a moment to tell 
me some of their concerns.
<P>
	Just last week I had a most enjoyable and informative 
half-hour meeting with one of the Canadian Wheat Board 
representatives from my province of Saskatchewan. We 
discussed many things, including the check-off provisions 
which are under discussion today. That fellow made the point, 
and I think it is a good one, that the additional research that will 
be carried out as a result of these amendments will benefit not 
just the producers but all Canadians. All Canadians will have the 
benefit of better credit as a result of increased research funding.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	How did this check-off scheme come about? It should be 
noted that the Western Grains Research Foundation, made up of 
12 prairie farm organizations, asked the government to enact 
legislation that would enable producers to invest a portion of 
their own profits into plant breeding research.
<P>
	The Western Grains Research Foundation is accountable 
directly to the producers as well as the federal government for 
the way in which research funds are spent. Producers believe 
that plant breeding research will help find new varieties and, in 
turn, enable the industry to maintain and increase its market 
share. All of this, for a farmer's investment of about half a cent a 
bushel or 20 cents a tonne.
<P>
	Another interesting point is that studies have shown the return 
on investment in agricultural research can be more than 50 per 
cent. In the case of the legislation before the House this could 
translate into an extra $400 million to prairie farmers annually. 
That is because research and plant breeding has a potential to 
lead the development of varieties that are 15 per cent higher 
yielding and equal in protein content to existing varieties.
<P>
	This brings me to another point. As I noted in my opening 
remarks, my riding of Saskatoon-Humboldt includes a large 
rural area as well as approximately one-third of the city of 
Saskatoon. That one-third of the city of Saskatoon includes the 
University of Saskatchewan and our College of Agriculture, 
which was one of the founding colleges in 1907 and enjoys a 
stellar reputation in the area of agricultural research.
<P>
	Just north of the university in the lovely area along the South 
Saskatchewan River bank we have Innovation Place, a business 
research cluster whose focus is biotechnological research, 
development and commercialization. Hence my particular 
delight in having an opportunity to speak to the bill before the 
House today.
<P>
	Producers know that research is vital to our agricultural 
industry. They know that their future livelihood depends on their 
ability to grow crops which will meet the shifting demands of 
the marketplace. Producers know as well that unless they start 
investing in research they risk lagging behind their competitors.
<P>
	Farmers in Australia, United States and the European Union 
have been taking a direct role in renewing plant breeding 
programs in wheat and barley for years. In the United States 
over 15 states have check-offs on wheat. These are made at the 
state level and are deducted at first point of sale. The check-offs 
are generally voluntary and enjoy a high level of participation as 
we anticipate this will be. The Australian wheat board has had a 
non-voluntary levy in place for the past five years.
<P>
	I mentioned partnerships between government and industry in 
my opening remarks. The industry strongly supports Bill C-50. 
This producer initiative has enjoyed broad industry support in 
its development and it will continue to do so, supporting a form 
of 12 prairie farm organizations that make up the Western 
Grains Research Foundation.
<P>
	Perhaps not everyone is aware of who the members of this 
organization are: the United Grain Growers, Western Canadian 
Wheat Growers Association, Manitoba Pool Elevators, 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Alberta Wheat Pool, Prairie Canola 
Growers Council, the Flax Growers of Western Canada, 
Keystone Agricultural Producers, Western Barley Growers 
Association, the Oat Producers Association of Alberta, 
Canadian Seed Growers Association, and Unifarm.
<P>
	Five of these organizations are also members of the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture and, most important, all these 
organizations have taken this issue to their membership and 
have received a strong vote of confidence. Again I would 
suggest this indicates some form of consultation. I doubt very 
much if the membership of those organizations would thank the 
government for going through yet another consultation period, 
at the taxpayers' expense, to find out the answer to the question 
that producers are in favour of this kind of research check-off.
<P>
	What contribution does government currently make to 
agricultural research? Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada spent 
over $2.5 million on wheat research in the last crop year and a 
further $8 million on barley research. The department will 
continue its commitment to research but this check-off 
proposed by producers will help us catch up to our competitors 
by providing additional research funding. These additional 
funds will allow us to double our wheat and barley breeding 
research programs. Government cannot do it alone and that is 
why we are so pleased to enter this research partnership with 
Canadian producers.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to review the minister's 
explanation of how the system will work. Western wheat and 
barley producers will pay voluntary levies of 20 cents a tonne on 
wheat and 40 cents a tonne on barley.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6194"> 6194 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I should point out for some of our urban listeners that this 
constant reference to check-off has nothing to do with Russian 
literature. These levies or check-offs from the Canadian Wheat 
Board payments will be put into the research fund.
<P>
	The amendments before us today are necessary to permit the 
use of the moneys collected by the Canadian Wheat Board for 
this cause. The Canadian Wheat Board will not be distributing 
the moneys collected. The funds from the check-offs will be 
distributed under the direction of the producer driven Western 
Grains Research Foundation.
<P>
	The foundation will establish two research committees, one 
for barley and one for wheat. These committees will ensure 
research moneys are spent on research projects in western 
research centres that focus on the development of improved 
wheat and barley varieties.
<P>
	Participation in this check-off is voluntary. Producers who 
want to opt out need only to submit a written request. As I said 
earlier, this check-off will garner additional research funds. It 
does not replace existing funding for agricultural research.
<P>
	Supporting the legislation will mean that the levies collected 
will assist in providing the Canadian agricultural industry with 
the means to develop and use new technologies, technologies 
that will boost our competitive edge.
<P>
	The ultimate objective of the legislation is to improve farm 
income through two main mechanisms; first, by improving the 
field performance of barley and wheat through new varieties 
that mature earlier, have higher yields and offer increased 
resistance to disease and insect pests; and, second, by 
maintaining and improving sales of wheat and barley by 
developing varieties with specific qualities required by the 
marketplace.
<P>
	The government is committed to strategic partnerships to 
secure our research goals. We have invited the industry to share 
the responsibility for the future with us as equal partners and it 
has accepted.
<P>
	I recommend the legislation be enacted to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act for the purpose of initiating 
voluntary producer levies in the interest of plant breeding 
research. We will be financially supporting the legislation 
because it is directly accountable to the producers of western 
Canada and because at its heart the legislation is motivated by 
producers who want to work with government in partnership to 
increase their competitive edge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
enjoyed the comments of the member for 
Saskatoon-Humboldt. I recognize that she represents an 
agricultural riding. I want to follow up by getting her thoughts 
on the idea of consultation with farm groups.
<P>
	I understand that in the hon. member's comments she 
suggested that farm groups are supporting this check-off bill. 
As a result of what my colleague from Vegreville said I suggest 
that it might be important to broaden the base of the 
consultations in these ongoing hearings that agriculture is 
putting forward to meet with individual farmers.
<P>
	Although there is support from farm organizations, these 
organizations may not speak for the majority of individual 
farmers. If the hon. member checks the membership she might 
find that out. Would she agree it would be important to consult 
agriculture producers in large numbers, and not just the farm 
organizations, to build support for this check-off?
<P>
	Also would she agree it might be important for the Canadian 
Wheat Board to have elected directors as opposed to those 
appointed by the federal government? Would that not also boost 
the kind of support that we need in order to build a strong 
agricultural industry?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. The point I would like make on consultation, and 
where I had some concern with the remarks made by the member 
for Vegreville, has to do with what appears to be a mixing of 
strategies.
<P>
	The amendments before the House today deal specifically 
with amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act that will 
permit an additional $4.7 million to go into research funding. 
There seems to be broad grassroots support as represented by the 
12 members in the foundation, who, I would expect, speak in a 
large part for their membership, for the producers themselves.
<P>
	My comment to my colleague earlier had to do with the 
wastefulness of delaying the accumulation of these research 
dollars that can be immediately put into plant breeding research 
for the benefit of the producers, the industry and, as I said in my 
comments, all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps I misunderstood the member for Vegreville, but it 
seems to me what he was suggesting was a giant overview of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and how it functions. That would be time 
consuming. It would involve delay and it would impede the very 
valuable contribution that this research initiative as proposed in 
Bill C-50 would have. Those were my comments and that was 
my intention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, just to 
clarify matters for the member who just spoke, I did say very 
clearly that Reform supports the bill. I also said that the bill is a 
very small change to the Canadian Wheat Board compared to 
what we need. We need substantial, wide sweeping, major 
changes to the Canadian Wheat Board. I was just pushing for 
these changes to happen, some time in my lifetime I would 
prefer, and the sooner the better.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6195"> 6195 </A></B>
<P>
	I just got a call from my assistant who said she had taken a call 
from a constituent who was wondering who this Bill Checkoff is 
and what team he plays for. Does he play for the Edmonton 
Oilers? He did not really know. She explained that no, it is a 
check-off bill we are talking about, not Bill Checkoff, a hockey 
player. I just wanted to clarify that.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned a figure for the number of 
dollars spent in research in agriculture. What benefit is derived 
from those dollars spent? I would prefer her to talk about the 
benefit derived and not so much the number of dollars spent, as 
though we are bragging about the number of dollars spent. I 
would like to ask the member to respond to that. What was the 
benefit?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to respond to 
anyone in the Reform Party at any time. I thank him for his 
support of the bill and our colleagues in the Bloc who have 
endorsed the broad picture that is before us today.
<P>
	Admittedly it is a small change. I do not think we get 
anywhere in this life by saying that if we cannot do the whole 
thing today we will not do it at all.
<P>
	I also would like to question the member for Vegreville on his 
support of the new politics we are supposed to be seeing from 
the Reform Party, in particular having the decency to come 
forward from time to time and say: ``Yes, this is a good 
initiative. We give it our support. Let's get this done today and if 
there is another aspect that we need to worry about, yes, we will 
continue with that''.
<P>
	The minister has indicated his willingness to constantly be 
improving and helping the effectiveness of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. Perhaps that is a matter for another day. We welcome the 
member's input to that process and consultation can take place 
in that regard.
<P>
	For the moment we have before us a bill that will permit 
increased research funding right away. We should just get down 
to it and keep our minds focused on what we are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as the member for Dauphin-Swan River, I would like 
to share with you and my hon. colleagues a brief but fascinating 
snapshot taken from the pages of Canadian history.
<P>
	I do this in support of the legislation that has been introduced 
to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act. The amendments are 
required to make way for a voluntary wheat and barley 
check-off that would help fund plant breeding research in 
western Canada. This initiative is producer driven and is 
expected to generate an additional $4.7 million a year to 
research funding. These funds will be administered by the 
Western Grains Research Foundation, a federally chartered 
public organization comprised of 12 prairie farm organizations.
<P>
	Wheat was first introduced into western Canada in 1812 by 
the Selkirk settlers in Manitoba's Red River valley. The names 
of the wheat they brought with them were not recorded. In 1842 
Mr. David Fife received a sample of red fife from a friend. It was 
a contaminant in a winter wheat sample obtained from a 
shipment in Poland. When this seed was grown a few heads 
appeared to be more vigorous than the rest. These were carefully 
selected and increased to become red fife, which was first 
introduced in Manitoba in 1870. Red fife quickly became the 
main variety of spring wheat grown in the area and went on to 
become the international standard of high milling and baking 
quality typical of Canadian hard red spring wheat.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	As the wheat growing area of western Canada gradually 
progressed north and west, it soon became apparent that the 
relatively short summer would eventually limit the wheat area. 
Plant breeders began to focus their attention on the development 
of early maturing varieties of wheat.
<P>
	That is when Dr. Charles Saunders entered the picture. Dr. 
Saunders was a plant breeder at Agriculture Canada's Central 
Experimental Farm in Ottawa. He was the son of William 
Saunders who founded the farm in 1885. It was the young Dr. 
Saunders who in the summer of 1892 began experimenting with 
a cross between the famous red fife and an early ripening variety 
of hard red spring wheat from India.
<P>
	Following 10 years of plant breeding experiments, Dr. 
Saunders led the way in the development of a wheat cross called 
marquis. Marquis became a world renowned wheat variety and 
is said to be the single most important factor in establishing 
Canada's reputation as a producer of high quality wheat. Its 
performance was so remarkable that all inferior varieties were 
practically eliminated from production and marquis was to 
remain the varietal standard for Canadian bread wheat for most 
of this century.
<P>
	Since the days of Dr. Saunders more sophisticated breeding 
techniques have evolved but the original challenge of human 
versus nature remains. Plant breeders have continued their 
efforts, developing subsequent varieties for qualities such as 
plant vigour, early maturing, resistance to chatter, resistance to 
rust and a number of other problems that were bane to the early 
prairie farmers.
<P>
	Canada has originated some of its most eminent varieties 
from the search for better stem rust resistance, all the while 
retaining excellent milling and baking qualities.
<P>
	I believe this brief historical overview is necessary to our 
discussion on the importance of the proposed amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act, amendments which will provide for 
a voluntary producer of wheat and barley check-off. The 
check-off will provide western Canadian plant breeders with 
additional  research funding to continue developing new 
varieties which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6196"> 6196 </A></B>
<P>
will in turn help Canada maintain its competitive edge and 
ensure a future for our industry.
<P>
	Plant breeding enables us to produce new varieties more 
resistant to diseases and insects, to give larger yields and a 
higher grade and better quality. Specific varieties are needed to 
adapt to specific conditions. For example, varieties of eastern 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba must be resistant to the rapidly 
changing races of leaf and stem rust. Varieties for western 
Saskatchewan and Alberta must have resistance to drought. For 
northern wheat growing areas the new varieties must be early 
maturing to minimize losses from early autumn frost.
<P>
	Since the early 1930s over 600 crop varieties have been 
introduced into Canada and since 1990 more than 70 varieties of 
seed crops resistant to disease, cold and stress have been 
released.
<P>
	One might say after all these years we must be getting very 
close to the perfect variety. It is much more complex than that. 
Our plant breeders have achieved wonders in developing 
varieties best suited for the full range of Canadian growing 
conditions and challenges. However, it must be remembered 
that the industry is constantly facing new crop threats. The pests 
and the diseases we fight do not always go away but when they 
do they are replaced by new ones.
<P>
	It must also be recognized that a variety that suited our 
purposes extremely well over five or ten years ago may no 
longer be in great demand in the marketplace.
<P>
	One of the key roles of today's scientists is to help develop the 
varieties that will enable us to meet the new and diverse 
international market demands. It is plant breeding research that 
gives us the ability to grow crops that can be made into the 
products such as frozen bread dough or into Asian type noodles 
with just the right consistency to beat out all of our other 
competitors.
<P>
	The costs of research extend beyond the need for a lab where 
trained scientists experiment in crossing two varieties of wheat. 
To find the required gene, such as a gene resistant to a particular 
strain of stem rust, the wheat breeder may have to find it in 
native wild grasses. Information is needed on the milling, 
baking and other qualities of potential plant breeding material. 
Above all, new varieties must possess the high quality milling 
and baking qualities which are the characteristics of Canadian 
wheat and which meet the needs of the end user.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Tests must be performed on new varieties to be recommended 
for registration. A new variety must perform for at least two and 
normally three seasons to the satisfaction of a committee of 
specialists recognized by my hon. colleague, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. All varieties must be registered 
prior to sale.
<P>
	Is it costly? Yes, it is. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Specialists in 
the field believe that a well co-ordinated and adequately funded 
research program over 10 to 15 years in all western wheat 
classes would bring significant results such as the development 
of varieties that are 15 per cent higher yielding and equal in 
protein content to current varieties. This would be above and 
beyond any yield increases resulting from existing research 
funds.
<P>
	If the price of wheat were $125 per tonne this would translate 
into $400 million annual increase in gross returns to prairie 
farmers. Perhaps this explains the foresight of Canadian 
producers who have asked for this check-off and who are quite 
willing to invest what amounts to less than one cent a bushel or 
about 20 cents an acre. I call it an excellent business decision on 
the part of producers.
<P>
	I strongly recommend that the Canadian Wheat Board Act be 
amended to allow voluntary wheat and barley levies to be 
deducted in support of plant breeding research.
<P>
	Support will give producers the research program they want, 
one directly accountable to the producers who fund it. Members 
will be supporting this government's commitment to continued 
research through a framework that includes the industry as a 
strategic planner or partner with a shared responsibility.
<P>
	In backing this legislation members will be recognizing the 
need for the Western Grains Research Foundation to continue 
the important work carried out by the David Fifes and the 
Charles Saunders of the country. Most important, members will 
be supporting the future of plant breeding research which offers 
Canadian producers a strong presence in the international 
marketplace.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate our colleague who has just spoken, so 
optimistically, to Bill C-50. Past events do not, however, 
warrant her boundless optimism today.
<P>
	Would the member indicate to this House the minimum 
number of producers needed to participate in this voluntary 
deduction scheme at 40 cents and 20 cents a tonne respectively 
for wheat and barley, in order to raise the $4.7 million 
anticipated by the Minister of Agriculture?
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture estimated that 90 per cent of 
Western grain producers will participate willingly, but there is, 
of course, a clause allowing grain growers to opt out if they 
wish.
<P>
	My question is as follows. If, five years down the road, only 
40 or 50 per cent of producers actually pay for research and 
development, while the others are benefiting from the fruits of 
the research, will voluntary participation still be tolerable?

<P>
	Another of my fears is that a future Liberal government might 
gradually withdraw from agricultural research and 
development. This is a constant danger, one we cannot ignore.
<P>
	I must tell you, Madam Speaker, that I do not have all that 
much confidence in the Liberal Party when it comes to 
agricultural research and development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Madam Speaker, that was an excellent 
question from the member across the way. He mentioned being 
optimistic. I want to remind the member that this is a new 
government on this side of the House.
<P>
	Of course I am optimistic about the future. I am a farmer. I 
come to this House with a long record of community 
involvement and have been involved in major farm 
organizations across the country developing agriculture policy. 
I know how important it is to have a voluntary wheat and barley 
check-off that will fund plant breeding research for western 
Canada.
<P>
	Farmers have been saying this for a long time and that is why 
it is so important that as a government we move ahead. As a 
Liberal government we are keeping our promise to those people 
out there producing that grain.
<P>
	In my constituency of Dauphin-Swan River, Jim Parker, one 
of my constituents from Gilbert Plains, was a pioneer in plant 
breeding. He was an optimistic gentleman and clearly an 
example of the producer-farmer involvement in plant breeding. 
Parker developed a more rust resistant variety of wheat. This 
illustrates how farmers are committed to the research and 
recognize its importance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
hon. colleague from Frontenac and critic for agriculture, has 
covered all the issues raised by Bill C-50 on the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I must say that I do agree with him that it is 
essential to support initiatives from people who want to take 
charge of their development, as in the case of western grain 
producers.
<P>
	Since last October's elections, we have heard the term 
consultation used to mean just about anything most of the time. 
It means meeting with many groups from a given sector, talking 
a lot and listing their recommendations in a neat document that 
will end up on a shelf. For once that bureaucracy does not get in 
the way of the public will, we are certainly not going to object to 
an initiative grain producers consider desirable.
<P>
	Two elements of the proposed legislation caught my attention 
however. First, the means by which the Canadian Wheat Board 
will pay the balance of research funds to the agency concerned, 
and second, the voluntary nature of deductions. The bill states 
that the Board must pay the research funding agency back no 
later than 180 days after the end of each pool period.
<P>
	In the present case, this would be the Western Grains 
Research Foundation as the agency that offered to raise the 
contributions. The Foundation, which represents 12 Prairie farm 
associations, seems the most logical choice. According to the 
Foundation, producers would derive a gross revenue of 
approximately $400 million from research. The bill also 
provides that the Board will decide which agencies will receive 
research funding. In that case, the choice appears to be 
unanimous. But, for the protection of the producers' money, it 
could be suggested that the bill be amended to provide for the 
selection of the agency to be made by a vote among 
representatives of the wheat and barley producers. In the event 
the Foundation were dissolved or new ones emerged, it would be 
better to have a consultative process than to let the Board decide 
alone.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	By the way, while board members come from the agricultural 
sector, all five of them are appointed by the minister. As for the 
voluntary nature of the 20 or 40 cent deduction, it would not get 
very far in Quebec, where mandatory deductions are favoured.
<P>
	I understand that a different approach be taken in the West, 
particularly given the different historical development of 
farming in the Prairies. The voluntary approach could be 
criticized for allowing individuals to benefit from research 
without having contributed to its funding. On the other hand, it 
also enables lower income producers who cannot afford to 
contribute to the research fund to benefit from it anyway. It may 
nonetheless be advisable to set a minimum participation rate 
below which the deduction mechanism will have to be reviewed 
or abolished.
<P>
	In addition, as the deduction rates are set by order in council, 
on the advice of the Canadian Wheat Board, it should be 
specified that could only be changed after consulting all 
agencies representing western wheat and barley producers.
<P>
	One last word of warning in closing. The research this bill will 
help finance should be geared towards meeting the needs of all 
producers. It would be unfortunate if it focused on problems 
peculiar to businesses of a specific size.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, I will now 
congratulate the first speaker from the Bloc, the member for 
Frontenac, on being appointed critic for agriculture and 
agri-food as we could not make comments after his first 
comments in the House today.
<P>
	I also want to comment on some of the concerns that the Bloc 
has raised. One is the statement made by the Bloc inadvertently 
that the wheat board buys Canadian wheat and barley. The wheat 
board does not buy Canadian wheat and barley. The wheat board 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6198"> 6198 </A></B>
<P>
sells Canadian wheat and barley on behalf of producers in 
western Canada. It does not buy the product at all.
<P>
	Regarding the other concern of some overlap or concern about 
spending taxpayers' dollars, one really tremendous thing about 
this amendment to the act which I want to clarify for them is that 
this will cost Canadian taxpayers absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The cost of administration within the wheat board and in the 
research foundation will both be subtracted from the fees 
collected voluntarily from the producers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Madam Speaker, we are always concerned 
about program overlap and duplication but I think it will not be 
the case here. At least, we hope not, so that Western grain 
producers will not be at a disadvantage. As it is, with their 
contributions of 40 cents and 20 cents, they already pay twice 
for research.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
deem it an opportunity to speak on Bill C-50 with a backdrop of 
optimism and accomplishment in this harvest season throughout 
our country.
<P>
	Our agriculture and agri-food sector is positioning itself to 
tackle the future with increased confidence and fundamental 
strength. We must ensure the decisions we make today and the 
initiatives we undertake in the future are part of a 
comprehensive long term plan for a modern progressive 
industry that is nothing less than the best in the world.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Research is fundamental to this government's goal of making 
Canada the world agriculture and agri-food leader. Without 
research the grain farmers of the Canadian prairies would never 
have gained their reputation as producers of the highest quality 
wheat in the world, a reputation that is well deserved and one 
that the government intends to preserve, protect and promote.
<P>
	In our platform outlined in the red book the government made 
a very strong commitment to research. Currently the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-food spends about $21.5 
million on wheat research and $8 million on barley research 
each year. The industry has recognized that we need to do more 
to keep up with our competitors and the industry has recognized 
that government cannot and probably should not do it alone.
<P>
	It has looked at what we need to maintain our international 
reputation and keep up with competitors like Australia and the 
EEC which have been investing heavily in their wheat and 
barley production and programs for several years. They have 
realized we need to spend additional money on research.
<P>
	This is why I am recommending the House support the 
proposed amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act that we 
are discussing today. These amendments are required to make 
way for a voluntary wheat and barley check-off that would help 
fund plant breeding research in western Canada. It is estimated 
that the proposed wheat and barley check-off will result in about 
$4.7 million additional cost per year added to the funds already 
mentioned earlier today.
<P>
	What do prairie producers hope to accomplish with the 
additional infusion of funding into plant breeding research? 
They hope to continue to develop new strains, to meet new and 
developing markets, and to better meet changing climatic 
conditions.
<P>
	As the minister outlined earlier this morning plant breeding 
research gives us new varieties to resist disease and insects, to 
increase yields and produce higher grades. The voluntary 
check-off program was brought to the government by the 
Western Grains Research Foundation. The foundation has a 
track record in supporting effective, purer research in the west.
<P>
	The idea for the check-off came about when the producer 
organizations making up the foundation were discussing the 
problem how to innovatively boost research funding. They did 
not come to the government asking for additional funding. They 
did not throw up their hands in despair because the money was 
not handed to them. They came with a plan of action. They said 
they wanted to place some of the responsibility squarely on their 
own shoulders.
<P>
	Since that time the Western Grains Research Foundation had 
been working with my colleague, the hon. Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, to develop the mechanism to make 
their proposal a reality. The proposal is being brought to the 
House today for additional member support. I believe that this 
legislation is indeed an excellent example of a partnership 
initiative which will benefit the entire sector.
<P>
	While the legislation before the House today calls for 
amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act, all funds will be 
managed by a third party with emphasis on funding work that 
will meet future marketing needs. The foundation will be 
accountable to the very producers who pay for it, accountable 
through an annual report to all permanent book holders and 
accountable to producers who have the ability to opt out at any 
time. Any producer who does not wish to participate may so 
indicate in writing and indicate that they are not supportive of 
the program.
<P>
	The projections however are that a 90 per cent participation 
will be in place because of the producer driven initiatives 
mentioned earlier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6199"> 6199 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, through partnership efforts such as this leading 
edge research and development will continue to receive support. 
The grain producers of western Canada may ask for your support 
of these legislative amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act, legislative amendments which will allow them to divert a 
portion of their income toward their future, a future that they can

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like the hon. member for Brandon-Souris to give me his 
opinion. In his speech, to which I listened very attentively, he 
talked about the importance of research and development.
<P>
	Does the hon. member for Brandon-Souris undertake today 
to put pressure on his good government to release funds?
<P>
	I would be satisfied with $700,000 or $800,000 a year for 
R&amp;D on maple syrup products which, fortunately or 
unfortunately, come almost exclusively from Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Madam Speaker, in relation to the 
components of the bill, we are talking only of wheat and barley.
<P>
	I would bring to the attention of the members opposite the fact 
that if we are talking about the $21 million that agri-food and 
agriculture have in place right now, I believe those allocations 
are put through the budgetary process from this department.
<P>
	If we are talking about the half cent, the $4.5 million that we 
are discussing here today, we are only talking about wheat and 
barley research. I can only comment that I would not support 
additional funding out of this allocation for anything other than 
barley and wheat research.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to speak on Bill C-50, especially as the bill 
relates to the Canadian Wheat Board, one of the superior 
marketing agencies not only in Canada but in the world.
<P>
	Much of my comments will be directed to the Canadian Wheat 
Board as it is this agency that will allow a check-off on board 
sales of wheat in the four western provinces and sales of barley 
in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and B.C.
<P>
	It is important to note that this check-off is voluntary. I as a 
member of Parliament oppose the idea of imposing on farmers a 
check-off that could be viewed as another form of taxation. In 
part in response to the previous question, we as a government 
must be committed to research and development from public 
revenues. The public of Canada as a whole benefits greatly from 
the increased economic spin-off of research and development 
and especially so in the agriculture sector.
<P>
	This voluntary aspect shows the principle of co-operation of 
farmers working together through the Canadian Wheat Board 
and other agencies in terms of achieving greater research and 
development as they already do in terms of marketing.
<P>
	It is designed as the wheat board was in the very beginning to 
challenge the inequities and the inefficiencies of the bare bones 
marketplace.
<P>
	It is significant to note that Alberta barley is not contained in 
the bill. I will have some questions later at committee stage on 
that point. I need to know and I will question whether there will 
be duplication of research. I need to know and I will question 
whether Alberta barley producers are given a choice in terms of 
whether their funds go to research in Alberta or through the 
Canadian Wheat Board system.
<P>
	Let me for a moment talk about the bill specifically. The 
purpose of the bill is to bring in additional plant breeding 
research. The plant breeding research funded by the proposed 
check-off is anticipated to improve farm income through two 
main mechanisms: first, by reducing unit production costs 
through improved field performance due to increased disease 
and pest resistant varieties and, second, by maintaining and 
increasing exports through the development of varieties with 
desired market qualities.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	A key point is exporting and marketing those improved 
varieties in a way that enhances and maximizes producers' 
returns. That is where the Canadian Wheat Board really comes 
in.
<P>
	It is important at this stage to review where the government is 
at in relation to the Canadian Wheat Board. I would like to go 
back to our policy announcement in May of last year. I will 
quote from the red book. I am sure members in the Reform Party 
will want to hear this. The book states: ``An effective and 
efficient agri-food strategy must provide policies and programs 
such as orderly marketing boards, the Canadian Wheat Board 
and stabilization programs to minimize the impact of market 
price fluctuations and ensure adequate returns to producers, 
processors and other efficient managers in the system''.
<P>
	I stand by that commitment and I fully support the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I used to be involved extensively in the west. I 
continue to get calls from farmers in the west emphasizing that 
this government should maintain that support with the onslaught 
from some of the industry at the moment.
<P>
	Yes, there are some who are attacking the Canadian Wheat 
Board and have been for a number of years. It should not 
surprise us. They are looking for short term personal gain at the 
expense of the industry as a whole. They are attacking Canadian 
institutions when they should be attacking the fundamental 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6200"> 6200 </A></B>
<P>
problem in terms of the grain industry, the use of the export 
enhancement program south of the border.
<P>
	In fact I would suggest that some of those groups have fallen 
victim to the American corporate interests and are fostering 
their agenda rather than a truly Canadian agenda.
<P>
	Yesterday I was shocked as members of the Reform Party 
stood in their places and condoned the illegal practices of those 
breaking the law in terms of Canadian Wheat Board marketing. 
It really amazes me that a party that talks about law, order, 
justice and following the law would condone those practices. All 
I can say is shame.
<P>
	The two key characteristics which distinguish the Canadian 
marketing structure which is focused on the wheat board are 
single desk selling and price pooling. I think I had better speak 
for a moment on those. Through single desk selling, the 
Canadian Wheat Board is the only accredited agent for the 
selling of Canadian wheat and barley in export markets. This 
ensures that the needed quality and quantity of grain is provided 
to the marketplace. It ensures that the Canadian Wheat Board 
has negotiated power and flexibility, enabling it to provide 
farmers with the best possible return. That is an agency that 
maximizes returns to primary producers, works in their interest, 
finds those markets and does the market intelligence on behalf 
of all wheat board area producers.
<P>
	The second major component is price pooling. Under that the 
Canadian Wheat Board ensures that farmers benefit equally 
from sales regardless of when and where their grain is sold. 
Returns are deposited into one of several pool accounts. All 
farmers delivering the same grade of wheat will receive the 
same return at the end of the crop year. The federal government 
ensures that any shortfalls are covered.
<P>
	The member opposite is raising funny questions here. The 
reason I feel so emphatic about that principle is that I come from 
the east coast and I can see those of us in the potato industry 
missing opportunities because we do not have an agency like the 
Canadian Wheat Board that maximizes returns and works in the 
producers' best interests. I have seen that concept operate. I 
realize that an agency like the Canadian Wheat Board works far 
better than the absolute bare bones marketplace that I talked 
about earlier.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	A very important component relative to the Canadian Wheat 
Board is the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee. I will 
just take a moment to explain. The advisory committee consists 
of 11 elected members who represent more than 130,000 permit 
book holders throughout western Canada. Elections are held 
every four years. The committee provides good advice to the 
Canadian Wheat Board in terms of its marketing initiatives.
<P>
	I think I am running out of time. I would have liked time to 
talk about the challenges, certainly the Americans. The Reform 
Party members seem to be the only ones out to attack the 
Canadian Wheat Board and try to do away with that really good 
structure of marketing. Members will note that in the four 
challenges from the United States we won every one.
<P>
	In closing, it is very critical the Liberal government stands 
behind our commitments to the Canadian Wheat Board, those 
commitments that we ran on in the last election across the west 
and won. Although I am from eastern Canada, I stand fully 
behind that board in terms of its ability to maximize returns to 
primary producers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with considerable attention and what surprised me is 
how strongly the hon. member for Malpeque supports the 
Canadian Wheat Board. Like him, I come from the East, from 
Quebec to be more accurate, and I have four questions to put to 
the hon. member for Malpeque. These questions could require 
long explanations but I would be happy with a short answer.
<P>
	Is the hon. member for Malpeque proud of the Canadian 
Wheat Board? Does the hon. member for Malpeque think that, in 
the past 12 months, the Canadian Wheat Board was dynamic 
enough in finding new markets? Could the hon. member for 
Malpeque tell us if he believes that the Canadian Wheat Board is 
democratic enough? Finally, does the hon. member for 
Malpeque believe that the appointment of members by the 
government, by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, is today, 
in 1994, a good thing, as it was in 1949?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. I have been fortunate enough to have 
travelled internationally. Farmers around the world look at the 
Canadian Wheat Board and wish they had an agency like it.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board over the past 12 years has been 
aggressive. It can be improved in terms of its aggression in some 
areas. We have to understand that one of the difficulties the 
Canadian Wheat Board has had is that we had a government in 
Canada for the past nine years that did not believe in the 
principles of the Canadian Wheat Board and did everything it 
could to undermine the ability of the board to operate as 
effectively as possible.
<P>
	In terms of democracy, I mentioned a moment ago the 
Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee. Looking at the 
record over the last nine years of the previous government, the 
one that lost the last election, it did not use the Canadian Wheat 
Board advisory committee which was the elected representative 
of farmers. It did not want to hear what those elected 
representatives of the farmers had to say in terms of support for 
the wheat board. The previous government undermined those  
democrati-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6201"> 6201 </A></B>
<P>
cally elected producers, the mass majority of which support the 
Canadian Wheat Board in the west.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	In terms of commissioners there are several concepts of 
marketing. If commissioners are appointed, they should sit at 
the pleasure of the government. I personally believe we should 
conduct an investigation to ensure that the commissioners 
appointed by the previous government are operating in the 
interest of the policies of strenghthening and maintaining the 
Canadian Wheat Board and are not trying to undermine it from 
within. The principle of appointing commissioners is that the 
government appoints those with expertise in marketing. It is not 
like an election where people are elected by popularity. They are 
appointed for their expertise in marketing, those who will do the 
best job of marketing on behalf of producers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have some 
questions for the hon. member for Malpeque.
<P>
	First I want some clarification. The member said we condone 
the law breaking that is going on by farmers shipping wheat over 
the border to the United States without a wheat board permit. 
This is absolutely untrue. He is deliberating distorting what 
Reform has presented.
<P>
	As well the member said that the Reform Party is out to 
destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. He knows he is distorting 
the truth. We are not out to destroy the wheat board.
<P>
	I have three questions. Does the member's party support him 
in his left wing purely socialist view in regard to the Canadian 
Wheat Board? Does the member believe that farmers should 
determine how they run their organization, the Canadian Wheat 
Board, or does he hold his strong socialist principles in such 
esteem that he refuses to give farmers control over their 
organization?
<P>
	My last question is with regard to the advisory committee 
representing 110 permit book holders. What power does it have? 
I will answer that one because he will not. It has no power 
whatsoever. Why not elect a board of directors that has power?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to keep my answer short. 
In response to the first question I may have misinterpreted the 
Reform Party. I hope that one of its members will get up on a 
point of order later today and ask that the government charge 
those people violating the laws of the land. Maybe that would 
clarify it specifically.
<P>
	These members have tried to talk about inefficiencies. I just 
want to make one point before I sit down. The Canadian Wheat 
Board has reduced its staff substantially over the last number of 
years. In fact, with a staff of 430 the wheat board transacts $4.5 
billion to $5 billion worth of business annually which translates 
into an administrative cost of less than 3.5 cents per bushel for 
wheat and 2.8 cents per bushel for barley. That is  amazing 
efficiency on the part of the wheat board in terms of operating 
for producers.
<P>
	As the member knows full well, the democracy is in the 
election of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee 
which advises the board on matters. Democracy also exists in 
terms of this party campaigning in the last election that it would 
strengthen and maintain the wheat board and stand by it. We 
intend to do that. We have been elected to do that and I stand by 
that commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to enter into this debate. I would like to make my 
points of view known with regard to Bill C-50 and possibly 
make some remarks on some of the issues that have been raised 
in this assembly.
<P>
	As we know the bill has as its main purpose to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. It allows members of the House to 
look at the Canadian Wheat Board in its broader sense and make 
some judgments and certainly make our points of view known in 
this assembly with regard to those matters.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-50 is set before us with one specific purpose. It allows 
a voluntary deduction from the final payment cheques of wheat 
and barley producers for the purpose of plant breeding research 
programs. That should be the focus of our discussion but 
certainly other items could be raised in the general arena.
<P>
	When we talk about a voluntary check-off we should also 
recognize that this is somewhat of a taxation on producers. The 
producers of the country should have some kind of right to 
determine whether they accept it or not.
<P>
	We know that in bringing the legislation forward a number of 
industry representatives have given support to the program and 
that is good. The farmers involved in those organizations have 
been consulted and we think that is good as well.
<P>
	We recognize the driving force behind the legislation has not 
been the government in total, even though it may take credit for 
it through its red book. Rather, the Western Grains Research 
Foundation has initiated it and through a variety of actions has 
made it possible that the amendment has come before us today.
<P>
	That research organization is made up of 12 prairie farm 
organizations. It certainly has done some excellent work in the 
area of funding research for Canadian farmers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6202"> 6202 </A></B>
<P>
	A number of successful WGRF funded research projects have 
already been undertaken at Agriculture Canada Research Centre 
located in my constituency of Lethbridge. I would like to 
recognize those here today.
<P>
	There is a communication to the hon. member for Vegreville 
from the chairman of the board of directors of the Western 
Grains Research Foundation. Mr. Roy Piper indicated that the 
Western Grains Research Foundation since its incorporation in 
1981 had been working toward improved funding of grains 
related research.
<P>
	He said: ``We now provide grants of about $1 million 
annually. An accumulative total of our grants paid and 
committed through 1996 is $11.5 million''. He goes on to say: 
``Of this amount, 50 per cent has gone into projects in plant 
breeding in wheat, barley, canola, pulse crops and plants. Most 
of this money has been paid to Agriculture Canada research 
stations and the Universities of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta''. I can only commend the organization for providing 
that support. A number of benefits have certainly occurred to us 
as farmers.
<P>
	In my constituency one project should be of note. Research 
funded through the research grants is going on in the area of 
biological control of the Russian wheat aphid, which if allowed 
to continue to spread could be very devastating to our grain 
production in southern Alberta and other parts of Canada.
<P>
	One of the other items of note is a funded project at the 
University of Alberta. They are applying biotechnology to 
reduce green seed in canola. We all recognize that having green 
seed in our canola certainly downgrades the canola and 
downgrades the net return to the Canadian farmer.
<P>
	The Reform Party is supporting Bill C-50 largely because of 
the support expressed for it by the major stakeholders in the 
grain industry and because of the excellent work since 1981 of 
the Western Grains Research Foundation and the projects it has 
funded.
<P>
	The central feature of the bill as has been recognized and 
outlined by the minister is the voluntary nature of the program. 
Western wheat and barley producers would voluntarily pay 
levies of 20 cents a tonne on wheat and 40 cents a tonne on 
barley. I do not think there is any necessity to go into detail but 
this then makes it incumbent upon the government in terms of 
accountability for this tax.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The request is 20 cents per tonne on wheat and 40 cents per 
tonne on barley. It is my hope there will not be an abnormal 
increase in that funding imposed by the government. If there is 
any kind of increase in funding it should be done with the 
co-operation of not only the farm organizations we have talked 
about today but also Canadian farmers as well, because it is a 
tax. It is a cost to us as farmers.
<P>
	There is also the inclusion of an opt out provision. That opt 
out provision is expected to have a number of beneficial 
outcomes. It introduces a degree of market discipline that is 
difficult to create in a bureaucratic setting. The voluntary aspect 
of the program-and I hope it does not change-allows farmers 
who disagree with how the WGRF operates or with how it is 
allocating its funds to effectively withhold their contributions 
until the research foundation responds to their objections. This 
should help to ensure that the research foundation acts in a 
responsible and a very responsive fashion.
<P>
	Another benefit provided by the voluntary nature of Bill C-50 
is that it provides a degree of flexibility for the farmers 
depending on their needs and their interests. Hard-pressed 
farmers would not be forced to contribute to the program nor 
would farmers who have had an unexpectedly bad harvest be 
expected to contribute. Likewise, if farmers do not feel they will 
benefit from the research being conducted, they cannot be 
compelled to participate.
<P>
	As my colleague from Vegreville explained earlier, the 
Reform Party will support Bill C-50 both because of the 
voluntary nature of the check-off and because of the support it 
has received from the farmer groups in the Western Grains 
Research Foundation. However, there are some aspects of the 
bill that raise concern in my mind.
<P>
	A potential problem is that Bill C-50 might be looked at by 
government as a way to shift the cost of its research and 
development responsibilities to the farmers. According to the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food the $4.7 million that 
is expected to be generated each year by the check-off for plant 
breeding research is in addition to what the government already 
spends on agricultural research and development.
<P>
	In other words this is not a reallocation of funds from within 
the current budget, but rather an additional research and 
development initiative controlled by a private sector 
organization that is designed to complement the existing 
government research efforts.
<P>
	When taking this into consideration with the effects of 
inflation government support for agricultural research has 
decreased in recent years. If the government makes further cuts 
to agricultural research programs then the impact on the 
research foundation program will be seriously undermined.
<P>
	Nobody is disputing that producers have a role to play in 
supporting agricultural research. They are the ones who benefit 
directly from such spending and it only makes sense that they 
bear some of the costs. However, Canadian farmers need 
government support to survive in a global marketplace that is 
awash in agricultural subsidies. At a time when governments of 
the United States, the European Community and Australia are 
all increasing their financial support for plant breeding 
programs, the Canadian government should not reduce its own 
support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6203"> 6203 </A></B>
<P>
	Any attempt to make the WGRF an alternative to publicly 
funded research rather than a complement to it will adversely 
affect the competitiveness of Canada's agricultural industry. 
Today in the House the minister assured us that the government 
will not reduce its present contribution in terms of research and 
development in the area of wheat and barley. I respect him for 
making that statement in the House. As an opposition member 
and a member from the farming community of Alberta I intend 
to hold him accountable to the commitment he has made to this 
assembly.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier one of the most attractive features of the bill 
is the voluntary nature of the check-off. The Reform Party 
would like to see this philosophy extended even further. We 
believe Canadian exporters of grain should not be forced to 
operate exclusively through the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Reform is encouraging the implementation of special opting 
out provisions for entrepreneurs interested in developing 
special niche export markets. If individual farmers believe they 
can get a better price for their produce, especially barley, than 
the price negotiated by the Canadian Wheat Board then we 
believe they should be given the freedom to do so.
<P>
	Instead of allowing farmers this freedom the present 
government has already demonstrated it will support the 
Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly. The best example of this is 
what happened when farmers this year tried to take advantage of 
high prices in the American market. Rather than encouraging 
such a growth of an entrepreneurial spirit, Revenue Canada and 
the Canadian Wheat Board instead worked together to impose 
heavy fines on all prairie grain farmers attempting to transport 
grain into the United States for direct sale to customers.
<P>
	When we in Reform talk about opting out provisions, be it for 
the plant research check-off in Bill C-50 or for the broader 
questions of farmers opting out of the Canadian Wheat Board 
pooling system of export of grain, what we are really talking 
about is choice. Farmers must be given the choice to control 
their own lives. The Reform Party has serious doubts about 
whether the Canadian Wheat Board as it is currently organized is 
capable of providing the flexibility and choice demanded now 
by Canadian farmers.
<P>
	A good place to start is to undertake a review of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I am not suggesting that the Canadian Wheat 
Board should be disbanded. There is a lot of support for the 
Canadian Wheat Board, but there is a lot of support for change as 
to how it operates.
<P>
	For many years now the Canadian Wheat Board has played a 
vital role in assisting individual farmers to penetrate foreign 
grain markets. However I am suggesting it has a virtual 
monopoly over all sales. This virtual monopoly is unnecessary 
and serves only to stifle the initiative of those farmers who wish 
to market on their own.
<P>
	Another aspect of the Canadian Wheat Board that should be 
reassessed is its undemocratic nature. Because the board of 
directors is appointed by the government there is no democratic 
way for producers who support greater freedom from the 
Canadian Wheat Board to influence its actions. Reformers 
believe that steps must be taken to democratize the Canadian 
Wheat Board. We have already had a discussion in the House 
about that.
<P>
	The people who are now on the Canadian Wheat Board are 
political appointments. Most likely most of them were 
appointed by the last government. I am sure it is going to be the 
intent of this government as soon as it is possible to take those 
people out of their appointed positions and appoint its political 
friends. But where do farmers stand in that kind of action? 
Farmers do not have a role in determining who represents them 
and one of the most important boards in this nation, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, has a monopoly.
<P>
	The present government appointment system should be 
changed to a board of directors consisting of producers elected 
through a fair and open electoral process. The first thing this 
would accomplish is to increase the legitimacy of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Farmers would know they have had a means of 
influencing wheat board policy through exercising their vote. 
They would also be more likely to accept wheat board decisions 
made by a democratically elected board.
<P>
	Flowing from this democratization would be the improved 
responsiveness of the wheat board. Not only would election of 
board members encourage candidates to listen to farmers' 
concerns but farmers would be in a position to hold wheat board 
members accountable at election time.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me quickly review the main points I have 
tried to make here today.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Reformers have decided to support Bill C-50 for two reasons. 
First, we believe that the voluntary check-off provides farmers 
with a degree of flexibility and choice in how their money is 
spent and invested in their future. Second, we are optimistic that 
this will encourage the Western Grains Research Foundation to 
be responsive to farmers' concerns. As well, we support Bill 
C-50 because it allows producer organizations, in this case the 
Western Grains Research Foundation, to have more say over 
their own destiny. Decisions on how to spend the moneys raised 
by the check-off will be made by the private sector 
stakeholders, not by the government.
<P>
	Finally I have argued today that much remains to be done to 
improve Canadian agriculture. Specifically there is need for a 
reform of the Canadian Wheat Board. By advocating the 
democratization of its board of directors we hope to encourage 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6204"> 6204 </A></B>
<P>
creation of a more flexible, more responsive Canadian Wheat 
Board for the farmers of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus I would like to 
join in making some comments on Bill C-50, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	The Liberal government is amending the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act to introduce the voluntary check-off program for 
wheat and barley research. I believe this is a very good move on 
behalf of the government and on behalf of the producers and 
those who support this move.
<P>
	It is reminiscent of the pulse crop producers in Saskatchewan 
who over the years have had check-offs on their crops, on their 
production for the purpose of research, for the purpose of 
enhancing their markets, for the purpose of providing greater 
returns for agriculture in the pulse crops that are produced in the 
province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	It has proven very successful there. I predict it will be very 
successful if it is managed properly by the government and by 
the administrators for the wheat and barley end of it as well.
<P>
	The proposed check-off has been debated by western farmers 
over the last few years. There is no major opposition to the 
concepts and the government is responding to a proposal from 
the Western Grains Research Foundation. The proposal was 
developed by producers and farm organizations, the research 
community and the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The Western Grains Research Foundation is proposing a 20 
cents per tonne check-off on wheat and a 40 cents per tonne 
check-off on barley. This could produce an estimated $3.8 
million for wheat and $900,000 for barley. The levies will be 
deducted from the CWB final payments beginning with those for 
the 1993-94 crop year. These funds would be automatically 
transferred to special accounts set up and administered by the 
WGRF.
<P>
	The bill excludes check-off on soft wheat and barley 
marketed at delivery points in Alberta. This is a point that 
requires further review and explanation. The Alberta 
government has introduced a long list of check-offs on farm 
products.
<P>
	It is our view in the case of barley producers that some of the 
money is being used in a permanent campaign against the 
Canadian Wheat Board. All farmers should be in the check-off 
as proposed in this bill. Alberta farmers will obtain the benefits 
of plant research financed by Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
farmers while the Alberta barley growers association uses its 
check-off to attack the Canadian Wheat Board which is trying to 
build its industry.
<P>
	If the Alberta barley producers want to maintain a check-off 
for political purposes, it would be their business. If the aim of 
the check-off is to foster plant breeding research to reduce the 
administrative costs of the check-off, since the barley growers 
association, including Alberta producers, members of the 
WGRF and others, there is no logical explanation to exclude 
them from this voluntary check-off.
<P>
	I have a question for the member for Lethbridge, a member of 
the Reform Party. How do the member and the Reform Party 
square their support for the bill and yet do not support the 
Alberta farmers from being involved in the check-off, 
contributing to the research and contributing to the benefit of 
their industry and using their money to contradict and campaign 
against the CWB?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly can 
only respond in a general sense rather than in a specific sense.
<P>
	My understanding is that the Alberta barley growers have as 
their purpose and function to promote their organization and to 
make contributions to research. To say that they are just a 
political body I would not agree with that. They are trying to 
make a case that the wheat board is not serving their purpose.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	More of a concern about the Canadian Wheat Board comes 
from individual barley producers who are financing their own 
campaign against the wheat board. They are entrepreneurs who 
feel that they can market on their own and can develop a market 
in the United States and other places in the world. They would 
like the opportunity and privilege to do so. What we should do in 
the Canadian Wheat Board legislation is allow for that to 
happen.
<P>
	We cannot have producers having their cake and eating it. 
There would have to be some kind of a provision that if a 
producer wishes to do it on their own and go out into the free 
marketplace as an individual producer then they have to take 
that risk and not be able to all of a sudden jump back into the 
Canadian Wheat Board when something looks better in that 
case. Therefore there has to be some kind of a trade-off done 
through the Canadian Wheat Board legislation.
<P>
	I believe that Alberta producers want to play their part in 
research and development, specifically in barley.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise in the House today to discuss Bill C-50, an 
act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to allow for a voluntary check-off on 
board sales of wheat in four western provinces and the sales of 
barley in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia. The 
funds collected, an amount estimated to be $4.7 million a year, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6205"> 6205 </A></B>
<P>
would be  administered by the Western Grains Research 
Foundation and would be used for plant breeding research.
<P>
	The research moneys would be directed toward improving 
farm income through two main mechanisms: by improving the 
field performance of barley and wheat through varieties with 
increased disease and pest resistance, and by developing 
varieties with specific qualities required by the marketplace.
<P>
	The CWB act is specific in the terms of the deductions that 
can be made from final payments. The bill would amend the 
CWB act to allow voluntary research check-offs to be made. 
There are a number of key provisions in the bill which are worth 
taking note of.
<P>
	The CWB would now be legally empowered to make 
voluntary deductions from final payments to producers of wheat 
and barley for the purpose of plant breeding and research. We 
are really talking about responsible legislation from the 
government that in essence is helping western Canadian grain 
farmers ensure the future and viability of the industry.
<P>
	The program is voluntary but I believe that participation will 
be high as most farmers, including myself, realize the 
importance of research and development. The program has the 
potential to bring in $4.7 million in additional plant breeding 
research. This figure is significant in light of the fact that 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research centres spent $18.7 
million on wheat research in 1991-92 and a further $10.5 
million for barley.
<P>
	Plant researchers have expressed the belief that a well 
co-ordinated and adequately funded research program over 10 
to 15 years in all western wheat classes could lead to the 
development of varieties that are 15 per cent higher yielding and 
equal in protein to current varieties.
<P>
	Based on a current price of $125 per tonne for wheat, the 
preceding implies that the gross total return for the research levy 
is projected to be worth approximately $400 million to the 
prairie farmers annually.
<P>
	Producer funded research programs are not new. This type of 
initiative is well established and conforms to our GATT 
obligations, as producer funded programs are not subject to any 
restrictions. Over 15 U.S. states have check-off programs on 
wheat. These are made at the state level and are deducted at first 
point of sale.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The levy can be refunded by request within 60 days. The 
check-offs are generally voluntary and have a high level of 
participation. In general most funds are used for market 
development activities and domestic production. Research also 
receives a small portion of the levy fund.
<P>
	There is also an Australian example. The Australian wheat 
board has a wheat industry fund levy that has been in place since 
the 1989-90 crop year. In this case a non-voluntary levy is used 
in part to fund plant breeding research. It is set at approximately 
1.5 per cent of the return price. As all hon. members can see, 
Canada is not breaking new ground here; we are simply catching 
up.
<P>
	Another key aspect of the bill is the provision made by way of 
order in council for fixing the rate of deductions and for 
excluding from deductions certain grains and/or classes of 
grains for certain regions within Canada. A study of the needs 
for enhanced plant breeding programs in wheat and barley has 
shown the need for an additional $3 million annually in wheat 
and $1 million in barley.
<P>
	The business plan of the WGRF proposes a check-off of 20 
cents per tonne or a half cent per bushel of wheat, and 40 cents 
per tonne or about one cent a bushel for barley.
<P>
	I believe this is a small price to pay. The world grain industry 
today has a high dependence on export markets. Consumers 
demand both stability of supply and the quality of the product 
for their end use requirements. The ability to meet these 
demands provides a competitive advantage for Canada.
<P>
	Satisfaction of both these demands depends to a large extent 
on the genetic make-up and the varieties grown by barley and 
wheat producers in Canada. It is expected that there will be 
significant growth in demand, not only in the heavily populated 
Pacific rim nations but around the world, particularly for the 
quality and quantities of grain that western Canada has so far 
been unable to supply.
<P>
	Canada must be able to respond rapidly to new demands for 
the varieties of wheat suitable for specific end use such as frozen 
bread dough and noodles. Meeting this challenge could mean 
significant new market opportunities for western producers.
<P>
	The bill also provides for the deposit of the amount of 
deductions from the final payments into a special account, by 
way of order in council providing for the ultimate distribution of 
those amounts to the account through the WGRF to the various 
organizations where needed.
<P>
	These would include governments, organizations, 
corporations, foundations, educational institutions and other 
bodies having among their objectives the support of scientific 
research to develop and improve wheat and barley varieties.
<P>
	The WGRF is made up of 12 major prairie farm organizations, 
including the United Grain Growers, the Manitoba Pool 
Elevators and the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. The board of 
directors is made up of these 12 organizations as well as one 
representative from the research branch of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada which will collectively set their priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6206"> 6206 </A></B>
<P>
	The program has been designed with its own checks and 
balances. There is accountability at the individual producer 
level since a person can flag their support or disapproval by 
opting out of the program. There is accountability at the 
institutional level since the WGRF is made up of such a broad 
base of farm groups.
<P>
	The WGRF which will be overseeing the research also 
represents the interests of its member organizations. There are 
costs associated with the program. The CWB has estimated a 
one-time setup cost of $56,800 and the annual costs of 
approximately $55,700. The WGRF has estimated its total costs 
at $50,000.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The total administrative costs are estimated to be less than 2 
per cent of the research funds generated and will be deducted 
from the levy funds. The proposed bill obliges the WGRF to 
provide annual reports to both the producers and the federal 
government of their activities.
<P>
	What we have finally is a recognition that producers have an 
important role to play in an activity that is directly related to 
their livelihood.
<P>
	Producer funding is increasingly important because plant 
breeding of wheat and barley has been eroded by so many years 
of inflation. By allowing producers to have such a direct role in 
this process they can contribute directly to ensuring the future 
and viability of their industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the main political issue of Bill C-50 would be the opening up of 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act. That is the view of the New 
Democratic Party caucus. We are a bit concerned about opening 
it up even though it is for a good purpose. Inadvertently this may 
have a negative effect on the wheat board and its operation.
<P>
	The reason I mention this point is that members of the Reform 
Party are demanding freedom to choose. They want referenda 
and other approaches to the wheat board and its orderly 
marketing process. It is my view and the view of some farmers I 
represent in the province of Saskatchewan that it poses a 
possible threat to the stability of the board.
<P>
	I want to ask the Liberal member if the government could give 
some assurance or a clear statement on the future of the wheat 
board and to confirm again the government's commitment to 
orderly marketing and its election promise to ensure that the 
Canadian Wheat Board is an ongoing strong, single desk 
marketing agency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand where the hon. 
member is coming from with this. First, the bill allows for more 
funding and is actually GATT responsive. That is one thing we 
have to look at here.
<P>
	To allay his concerns as to whether or not it is backed, I just 
want to read off some of the grassroots organizations that have 
already said they approved. The list includes the Prairie Pools 
Incorporated, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Manitoba Pool 
Elevators, the Alberta Wheat Pool, the Canadian Seed Growers 
Association, the Saskatchewan Seed Growers Association, the 
United Grain Growers, the Western Canadian Wheat Growers 
and Keystone Agricultural Producers.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member has anything to worry about 
concerning the Canadian Wheat Board in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
question for the member opposite. He spoke about the support 
the bill has from all of the different organizations. I believe he 
went on to list 12 organizations that had indicated support.
<P>
	Would he also have enough confidence to seek direct support 
from producers by making it possible for them to say when they 
apply for a permit book whether or not they support this type of 
check-off? I suggest to the member opposite that although there 
is a lot of institutional support, these people may not speak for 
the majority of farmers. The fact that they have to continually 
reapply to get this check-off back if they do not support it is very 
cumbersome.
<P>
	Let us give producers the option of indicating whether they 
support this when they apply for their permit book. Would he 
support that?
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Madam Speaker, the key here-we have to take a 
look at what is being discussed in the bill-is the word 
voluntary. That is exactly what we are discussing here.
<P>
	As a poultry producer, I have a lot of faith in my industry. I 
know what research and development means for the chicken 
industry. I hope that wheat and barley producers have that same 
commitment to their industry and that they want to put money 
into research and development.
<P>
	In looking at research and development in this industry, if the 
researchers see they have the backing of the people who are 
involved in the industry itself, they will go a lot farther in the 
development of wheat and barley for the world market.
<P>
	Let us face it. Canada is an exporting nation. If we have the 
best quality wheat and barley product to put forward on the 
world market, I know we can go farther. I will cite members an 
example in the chicken industry.
<P>
	In the 1960s, it took us 14 to 16 weeks to produce a 
four-pound chicken and we said: ``Wow, that is as far as we can 
go''. I do it in 36 days now and through research and 
development, they are also talking about a 30-day chicken. 
Wheat and barley is no different.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in favour of Bill C-50, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	I commend the minister of agriculture for the work he is doing 
to improve the prospect of the Canadian farmer. My riding of 
Oxford has a large variety of agricultural production. The north 
end of the riding is dominated by livestock, mostly dairy. Just 
north of Woodstock is the Western Ontario Breeders 
Incorporated which collects, tests, stores and sells semen 
around the world for the artificial insemination of cattle. Toward 
the south end of the riding, we have a predominance of tobacco 
production. Over the past decade as tobacco has decreased, 
these producers have looked for alternative crops to grow on the 
sandy soil of the tobacco belt.
<P>
	We have found that not many crops are successfully grown in 
this soil. As one moves throughout tobacco areas, one can see 
the occasional farm growing ginseng or peanuts. However not 
all farmers can afford to make this change, nor can we have these 
markets flooded by new producers.
<P>
	Another experimental crop which was successfully 
introduced this year on a limited acreage by Mr. Joe Strobel of 
Tillsonburg was hemp. This crop was harvested last month and 
will be used in the production of hemp clothing.
<P>
	This is why this bill is important to my region. The provisions 
in the bill for research and development of new crops is good for 
all Canadian farmers. It is hoped that this research may even 
develop a new wheat or barley variety that could be successfully 
grown on lighter land such as that formerly used for tobacco.
<P>
	We sometimes forget just how competitive the agricultural 
industry is world wide. With our shorter growing season in 
Canada, we must take full advantage of improvements in crop 
and livestock variety and quality in order to finish ahead of the 
competition.
<P>
	If research can develop new and better crops that can be used 
for human and livestock consumption, then we can forge new 
markets around the world. These new markets will not only 
develop income for our farmers but will generate employment 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	As this country has moved from a primarily agrarian economy 
to our present industrial and information age economy, we 
sometimes forget how important agriculture continues to be not 
only for the food it produces but for the jobs it creates. Jobs in 
our transportation networks, packing plants and food processing 
plants are all dependent on agriculture.
<P>
	As every farmer knows, the greatest resource we have is the 
land. This land is a farmer's capital. It is our basic resource and 
our goal has to be to preserve the land and to make it as 
productive as possible. The research that is called for in this bill 
is good for all Canadian farmers.
<P>
	I would like to address a few remarks to my hon. friends from 
Lethbridge and Peace River. I had the pleasure last week to sit 
with the advisory committee of the Canadian Wheat Board. This 
is an elected body of grain farmers from the various regions of 
the grain provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	To a man these elected representatives supported the 
Canadian Wheat Board largely because of its success in 
marketing our grain and because of its pooled selling. There was 
some discussion about the possibility of some entrepreneurial 
ventures regarding barley. I am sure that will be discussed by the 
board. There are farmers elected who give input to this board. I 
was pleased to meet with them and to know that they were 
satisfied with what was being done.
<P>
	When the bill becomes law we will be able to say to our 
farmers that we have passed a law that will improve the ability 
of the Canadian farmer to compete in international markets. 
This is a strong step forward for Canadian farmers and the 
Canadian agri-food industry as a whole.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member for Oxford, who represents his riding so well, just 
told us once again that he wishes western producers would pay 
40 cents and 20 cents per metric tonne for R&amp;D; he also 
expressed in the same breath the hope that tobacco producers 
who can no longer grow tobacco will benefit from research 
spin-offs.
<P>
	I wonder whether the hon. member for Oxford is not a little 
dependent on Western producers for his region's development. 
If it is good for his region, he should urge his government to rack 
its brains to find a way to make everyone-or at least those who 
may eventually benefit from agricultural R&amp;D-pay.
<P>
	In addition, I would like to ask the hon. member for Oxford, 
who also seems very happy with the Canadian Wheat Board, to 
enumerate some improvements that would make the board more 
active, vigorous and democratic. I must tell you, Madam 
Speaker, that the Canadian Wheat Board is far from enjoying 
unanimous support in the west. Most producers want to keep it, 
but most of them also want the Canadian Wheat Board to make 
major changes, in particular at the senior management level.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Madam Speaker, my hon. friend raises some 
interesting points. He might be encouraged to know that the 
wheat farmers of Oxford county and of other parts of Ontario are 
already paying a dollar a tonne into a fund for research.
<P>
	Probably he is also aware that the Flue-Cured Tobacco 
Growers Marketing Board takes a certain amount from each 
pound of tobacco that is sold through their marketing agency. 
The money is used for exactly what he  is concerned about, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6208"> 6208 </A></B>
<P>
research into varieties and improving the production of tobacco 
in Oxford, Norfolk and Elgin counties.
<P>
	I am not sure that Frontenac is any closer to western Canada 
than Oxford. I am sure that all farmers are interested in 
maintaining the best possible production in all parts of the 
country. Research is essential.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was looking for question period. I thought I would get 
out of this before that started.
<P>
	It is a privilege for me to address the bill and I am going to 
address it more or less in a way that a Reform farmer does, not a 
Reform politician.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Malpeque for all the free 
publicity for Reform he is giving us. We really appreciate that. It 
is good advertising.
<P>
	The spirit of Bill C-50 goes in the right direction. The spirit is 
good. The increase in private funding for research, pretty well 
every farmer supports. I am starting to wonder who drew up the 
bill. When I look at the body of the bill it looks very sick, very 
old and very decrepit. I do not think it is going to provide the 
incentive this money is supposed to give.
<P>
	To me it looks like it must have been a Liberal lawyer drawing 
it up, not a Liberal farmer because I am sure some of the clauses 
would be different.
<P>
	We take a look at clause 31(3) and all of a sudden I realize we 
have another agency. The agency is called the western research 
fund and if we look at the track record of federal agencies we 
know that they usually have deficits, not surpluses. When we 
look further on we will see that is exactly what the next clause 
says. It says the cost of collecting these moneys will be deducted 
from distributed moneys. What have we left over?
<P>
	I am becoming very suspicious that there will not be very 
much money for research which we originally intended.
<P>
	We go back down to the other clause, and all of a sudden we 
find out we have another fund, a reserve fund, more 
administration. How much cost is there going to be to the 
administration of this 20 cents a bushel levy? It does not end 
there.
<P>
	Then we go to clause 33(2) and it says there will be provisions 
made that certain projects are not eligible for this funding and 
certain research projects that do not pertain to research on these 
products could be funded. There is no clear direction in the bill.
<P>
	We go down further to clause 33(3) and we are talking of an 
annual report that will have to be made to the minister but there 
are no guidelines that say what kind of a report. It will be at the 
minister's discretion what kind of report. Is it going to be a 
report saying it is minus or plus? Or is it going to show us which 
projects were funded? Why is there no body to the bill? I want 
some body in the bill.
<P>
	Then we go further down and we find the door is left wide 
open to whatever we can think of. If it is at the minister's 
discretion to call the report, why call for something when there 
are irregularities in it, especially if the government of that day 
would not like the irregularities.
<P>
	Why not put out a bill that is simple and will direct these funds 
to the research that we want to target? It is very simple. As I 
mentioned the other day, give farmers the choice. In the next 
federal election the hon. member on the other side would be 
really provoked if he were forced to mark his ballot Reform and 
then ask for it back because he did not agree to vote for Reform. 
Let us try it and see what they will say. Maybe they all will vote 
Reform. Maybe it is going to be that impressive. If we want 
democracy let us have it everywhere.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I am not surprised, if I look at the bill, that we have problems 
in government. If bills about immigration and bills about law 
and justice are so vague and so unpredictable no wonder we have 
lawyers having the richest industry in the world today. To me as 
a farmer if I want to support something I want to have that right 
to say so. I do not want somebody to tell me you put this money 
in here and then if you have time, if you feel things are not right 
you can ask for it back. I want that money to go to research. That 
is why I suggest very strongly to the government, if it wants my 
support as a farmer, to give me that opportunity. I will guarantee 
that if farmers have that opportunity the government will get 
more money for check-off to research funding than it will 
otherwise.
<P>
	I have another suggestion for the government. If we really 
want to co-operate in the House why not ask some of the Reform 
members on this side to help draft the bill because I know it can 
be improved. The intent is tremendous. We want to co-operate. 
It is always suggested that we do not want to co-operate. Any 
member on this side could draw up a bill that would direct that 
money specifically to the research that we wanted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, I enjoyed the 
comments of the member for Lisgar-Marquette. I guess that is 
about as far as we can say, that they were enjoyable.
<P>
	I do want to point out to the member from the Reform Party 
that it keeps stressing that decisions like this by governments 
should be producer driven. There are already, as he and the 
Reform Party well know, 12 farm organizations and others 
requesting addition to the list. I do not really know what more 
they want than that type of thing. The legislation is producer 
driven and we as a government are responding to that at 
absolutely no taxpayer cost whatsoever other than providing a 
very efficient administrative process or availability to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6209"> 6209 </A></B>
<P>
	When I mention that it is clearly stated in the bill that Alberta 
barley producers will not be taking part. I would ask the member 
if he has any comments on the fact that since the Alberta barley 
growers through the Alberta barley commission have their own 
fund which they voluntarily submit money to, would he consider 
suggesting to the Alberta barley commission that it become part 
of this research situation?
<P>
	When we look at the figures of the amount of money that the 
Alberta barley commission collects, it collects $1.11 million 
and spends $270,000 or 24 per cent of the amount of money that 
it collects on administration. When it is done through the 
Canadian Wheat Board it will cost 2 per cent.
<P>
	Would the member for Lisgar-Marquette and his Reform 
Party colleagues consider suggesting to the Alberta barley 
producers who certainly want a good return on their dollar that it 
would be a much better return?
<P>
	The Reform Party is always talking about administrative costs 
and wastes. We see 24 per cent used on administration and less 
than 50 per cent of what it collects used on research, market 
development, producer servicing and policy development. That 
same organization is sitting on an annual surplus of farmers' 
money that it is doing absolutely nothing with after having 
collected it of $295,839.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not have all those 
figures available that readily. I do not know all the Alberta 
barley producers but I can guarantee the hon. member that if 
they are not paying their fair share in research, they will.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	He says they have representation from all farmers and that the 
wheat board is doing such a fantastic job for farmers. I remind 
the hon. member that in 1993 after staff reductions, after 
tremendous cuts, salaries to the Canadian Wheat Board 
increased by $1.4 million.
<P>
	Not only that, the advisory group spent $50,000 more on 
travel and sold 15 per cent less last week than the year before. 
They should not try to tell me that it is working for farmers. Last 
fall the wheat board and the provincial and federal governments 
told us there was no market for our tombstone wheat.
<P>
	Farmers in southern Manitoba marketed that wheat within 
hours. My son sold his whole crop of wheat in four hours. There 
was a good market for it and a good price. They should not tell 
me that all farm organizations are always supporting farmers or 
doing the best job because I get a little riled up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
question for the member for Lisgar-Marquette.
<P>
	I am a farmer in the Canadian Wheat Board area. We have 
heard a number of speakers on the other side who are not in the 
Canadian Wheat Board area extolling the values of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. A lot of these people who have spoken earlier 
belong to an area called the Ontario Wheat Board in which the 
directors are elected rather than appointed as with the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Does the member for Lisgar-Marquette agree 
that the Ontario Wheat Board model of an elected body rather 
than appointed is better than the current one we have at the 
Canadian Wheat Board?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
that question. If I read the Liberal red book on the fairness it is 
portraying that everybody will get under that government, I am 
sure the Liberals are going to give the western Canadian farmers 
that privilege to elect their wheat board just like they do in 
Ontario. If that is the case I applaud them for doing it. It shows 
democracy in real style, not democracy by region.

colleagues and all Canadians how this bill is consistent with this 
government's agenda for Canada's natural resource sector.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As well I will describe the importance of the natural resource 
sector to Canada's economic strength and job creation and the 
role of my department to ensure that the natural resource sector 
continues to be a cornerstone of our economy, of employment 
and of Canada's progress toward sustainable development.
<P>
	Bill C-48 will establish the Department of Natural Resources 
under one act. At the present time authorities for the minister 
and the department are set out in two acts, the Department of 
Forestry Act and the Department of Energy, Mines and Re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6210"> 6210 </A></B>
<P>
sources Act. According to the bill natural resources incorporate 
all of the resources covered in the two departmental acts. 
Specifically, these resources are mines, minerals and  other 
non-renewable resources, energy and forest resources.
<P>
	While we recognize the provincial responsibility for the 
management of natural resources in Canada, the federal 
government has the responsibility in partnership with the 
provinces to maintain and enhance the contribution of the 
natural resource sector to our economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	In essence, Bill C-48 provides a legal framework for the 
federal Department of Natural Resources to provide a national 
perspective on mining, energy and forestry issues and to provide 
leading edge expertise in research and development to help the 
natural resource sector meet current and future challenges.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of those challenges is Canada's progress toward 
sustainable development. Bill C-48 respects the federal 
government's commitment to encourage progress toward 
sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the bill states that to carry out the minister's 
assigned powers, duties and functions the Minister of Natural 
Resources is required to have regard to the integrated 
management and sustainable development of Canada's natural 
resources. While this requirement is contained in the present 
Department of Forestry Act there is no such reference in the 
Department of Energy, Mines and Resources Act. This provision 
will now be clearly stated and applied to all natural resources.
<P>
	Canada's natural resource industries are not sunset industries. 
Let me make that point today very emphatically. These 
industries provide a major portion of Canada's gross domestic 
product. For example, in 1992 the value of energy, forestry, 
mineral and metal production totalled $69 billion or 14 per cent 
of our GDP. In 1992 net trade in energy, mineral and forest 
products amounted to $40.5 billion and provided much of the 
basis for Canada's $15 billion trade surplus.
<P>
	One in every 13 members of Canada's workforce is employed 
in the energy, forest and mining sectors in all regions of this 
country. In fact natural resource activity provides the economic 
backbone for over 500 Canadian communities, many of them in 
remote areas.
<P>
	As well, our natural resource industries are high tech 
industries. Canada is a world leader in the development and 
application of technology to improve productivity and 
competitiveness of our mining, forestry and energy industries. 
This effort to develop new technology has resulted in the 
emergence of new industries and therefore new jobs.
<P>
	For example, Canada's requirements for accurate information 
about our resources has stimulated a new industry known as 
geomatics. This high potential, $1.3 billion industry employs 
over 12,000 Canadians. Furthermore Canada's geomatics 
industry contributes $100 million a year in exports.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Economic challenges face Canada's natural resource 
industries. Improved productivity and efficiency are essential to 
our country's ability to remain competitive in the natural 
resource sector. However the environmental challenges facing 
the sector are equally important. As a result, I believe that 
Natural Resources Canada will be a vital bridge between 
industrial and environmental concerns as we move to meet the 
challenges of the future.
<P>
	Fiscal restraint affects all orders of government in Canada. 
Therefore we must find new and innovative ways to work 
together. I believe that our ability to encourage the integration 
of economic and environmental demands will be enhanced 
through co-operative ventures and partnerships which involve 
all stakeholders.
<P>
	Throughout the years the department's research and 
technology expertise has built a solid reputation throughout the 
world. Its work has been geared to improving resource sector 
competitiveness and environmental performance. Natural 
Resource Canada's scientific and technological expertise has 
focused on all aspects of natural resource management.
<P>
	For example, in forest management the Canada forest accord 
and its action plan, the national forest strategy, represent a 
commitment to sustainable forest development in the country. 
Through partnerships between federal and provincial 
governments, environmental and aboriginal groups and other 
forest users, we are working together to test and apply new 
approaches to manage forests as ecosystems.
<P>
	Our mining industry is always moving forward, searching for 
innovations to become even more efficient and more 
competitive. As a result, the mining sector has one of the highest 
productivity levels in the world. The department's science and 
technology expertise has contributed to the development of 
many of these innovative processes. Many are linked to the 
challenge of meeting environmental concerns. Examples 
include acid mine drainage, effluents and promoting the use of 
metal recycling.
<P>
	The energy sector will continue to be an important part of the 
department. There is no question that oil and gas development is 
important to sustain jobs and to Canada's overall economic 
strength. We are committed to market based principles. We are 
committed to sustainable development. Therefore we will work 
closely with industry, the provinces and others to harmonize 
economic and environmental goals.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6211"> 6211 </A></B>
<P>
	Increased energy efficiency is widely recognized to have the 
greatest potential for short term contributions to our progress 
toward sustainable development. Moreover, energy efficiency 
can help Canada make a positive contribution to the 
government's goal of limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
	Energy efficient technologies also contribute to wealth 
generation and job creation. Many companies and businesses 
have discovered that energy efficiency makes business sense. 
Innovative, made in Canada technologies for new products, 
processes, systems and services can also be exported to a rapidly 
expanding world market.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada will therefore continue to address 
the economic and environmental concerns of the natural 
resource sector. Canada will continue to lead and be a model in 
all aspects of natural resource management and use.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will continue to work with the provinces, industry, 
environmental and aboriginal groups, and other stakeholders in 
the natural resource sector. The Department of Natural 
Resources will promote sustainable development practices and 
will apply its science and technological expertise to enhance our 
international trade, our competitiveness and the contribution by 
the natural resource sector to Canada's economic strength and 
job creation.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill will provide the Department of Natural Resources 
with the legal mandate and framework in which to deliver all 
these commitments as we move forward to the next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and I understand full well 
that the purpose of this bill is to ratify what is already a fact; a 
pure formality, it seems. I dearly hope that our colleagues in the 
Liberal Party do not expect us to ratify this bill establishing the 
Department of Natural Resources.
<P>
	It is easy for us to speak on the subject of natural resources. 
Quebecers elected us, members of a sovereignist party, both to 
defend Quebec's interests and to begin the dialogue with the rest 
of Canada in order to prepare Quebec's accession to sovereignty. 
It is essential for us to defend Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction 
over natural resources. We would be acting contrary to our 
mandate and the will of those who elected us if we did not speak 
out against this bill.
<P>
	All governments of Quebec have always demanded respect 
for provincial jurisdiction under the Canadian Constitution. The 
Constitution Act, 1982 describes provincial powers fairly 
precisely under section 92(a) with respect to the exploitation, 
conservation and  management of forest resources, including the 
rate of primary production.
<P>
	This position was maintained by the Government of Quebec 
when the former Minister of Natural Resources, Mr. Sirros, said 
in the National Assembly on May 25 that the full authority of the 
Government of Quebec for managing natural resources on its 
territory-

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
government took office 11 months ago it immediately took 
action to stop the waste of taxpayers' money. One of these 
actions was the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopters. These 
helicopters were the Lamborghinis of the helicopter world, 
sleek, fast and very expensive.
<P>
	They were not what was needed to modernize our helicopter 
fleet at a reasonable cost. Notwithstanding the commitment to 
modernize our fleet is something that must be done and be done 
soon. The present Sea Kings have done a marvellous job over the 
past 30 years. They are, however, near the end of their life 
expectancy.
<P>
	I ask that the government take a serious look at replacing our 
helicopter fleet with an appropriate made in Canada model 
reflecting our commitments to our armed forces as well as the 
Canadian aerospace industry, both of which are so important to 
the constituents of Erie.

from the Kingston city council a piece of land on which to build 
a French-language high school confirmed the Commissioner of

problem, which is related to finding a piece of land and is not a 
linguistic issue, will be solved and that a French-language 
school will be built in Kingston.
<P>
	It is sad to see how the Bloc Quebecois has a distorted 
perception of the reality. The Bloc should know that the million 
francophones living outside Quebec are alive and well.

	In my riding, we are proud of our French-language schools. 
Indeed, in spite of the fact that French-speaking people account 
for only 2 per cent of the total population, we have one high

	In Manitoba the child poverty rate and deaths during infancy

over the last 10 months? Why are charges of corruption and 
dishonesty on the part of the investigating officers not regarded 
as serious by the minister?
<P>
	Why have officers involved in this case not been suspended 
pending an outcome of the investigation? Why has evidence that 
would clear Patrick Kelly not been made available to his 
lawyers? Why has it taken eight months to contact the one single 
witness on which his freedom in this whole case depends? Why 
is the same investigating officer whose honesty and motives are 
under serious question involved in the new investigation?
<P>
	It is time the minister acted with some sense of urgency in this 
case. The Canadian justice system is under attack as a result.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after promising an action plan for social program 
reform, the Minister of Human Resources Development said 
yesterday that next week he would only table a discussion paper.
<P>
	He also made it clear that social program reform would again 
be postponed, when he said that the government's position 
would be presented next spring or next fall. In other words, a 
year from now.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: Should we see these 
successive delays as an attempt by the Prime Minister to put off 
the cuts his minister wants to make at the expense of the needy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are trying to find out what Canadians think about a reform 
that is extremely important. The paper will be released to the 
public, and a parliamentary committee will travel across the 
country to hear what the public has to say. That is democracy at 
its best.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this looks more like hesitation at its best than 
democracy. I want to ask the Prime Minister whether we are to 
infer from all this that postponing the reform was motivated by 
the Prime Minister's reluctance to take unpopular measures 
before a referendum is held on the sovereignty of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our job is to give Canadians good government, and that is what 
we intend to do. Good government involves consulting people.
<P>
	A few months ago, the Leader of the Opposition criticized us 
for going too fast, but now he says we are not going fast enough. 
We were elected for at least four or probably even five years, if 
we look at the precedent set by the Conservatives. So we have 
plenty of time, and we will take that time to do a good job, which 
is what Canadians expect from their government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, good government means a government that governs 
and does not spend its time consulting, publishing white papers 
and travelling all over the place and making speeches.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he realizes that by 
postponing social program reform indefinitely and restraining 
his minister's urge to make cuts, he is actually asking the 
unemployed in Quebec to wait at least another year until the 
training issue is settled.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6216"> 6216 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
anyone who says this government is not doing anything should 
look at what we have done since we came to power. The 
helicopters were out in half an hour. Then we dealt with the 
problems around article XI at GATT. We dealt with the problems 
around NAFTA. We dealt with the problem of fraud in the 
cigarette trade. We brought down a budget. We made cuts, we 
made changes and we intend to go on being an active and 
responsible government. I am sure that a year from now, if the 
Leader of the Opposition is as good as his word, when they have 
lost their referendum, he will no longer be a member in this 
House.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has intentionally not ruled out the 
possibility of taxing RRSPs in his next budget. This is what 
Alain Dubuc, an editorialist at the daily newspaper <I>La Presse</I>, 
had to say about this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``-a tax that would affect the living conditions of present and future retirees 
counting on this income in good faith is immoral.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It is the most outrageous idea conveyed by a minister of finance in a long 
time.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the interest of the already overtaxed middle class, I give the 
Minister of Finance another chance to end the speculation about 
taxing RRSPs. Can he undertake today not to tax RRSPs in his 
next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the idea was not 
conveyed by the Minister of Finance but by Bloc and Reform 
members who raised it many times here in this House. So if there 
is a ``trial balloon'', they are the ones responsible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, the simple 
fact that he does not automatically rule out this possibility poses 
an unacceptable threat to middle-income taxpayers.
<P>
	Does he not agree that it is totally immoral to change the rules 
in the middle of the game and create a kind of retroactive tax by 
taxing RRSPs in his next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that the 
Bloc Quebecois is afraid of listening to Canadians, of a 
pre-budget process that will be open and of making constructive 
suggestions. It is very clear that the Bloc has nothing to say to 
Canadians who want a chance to tell us what they want to do.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, details of 
the government's social policy review appeared today on the 
front page of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. It seems the only place the 
minister has not discussed details of his much delayed action 
plan is here on the floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of Human Resources Development 
insulting members of Parliament by leaking details of this 
action plan to the media before presenting it to Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is almost a historic moment 
that someone has accused me of actually talking to the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>.
<P>
	I caution the hon. member and all members that this is a 
period of time when there are going to be all kinds of speculative 
stories and reputed leaks. I suggest that the member be patient 
and simply wait for the real paper and real proposals which will 
be tabled in the House next week.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
appreciate that these are proposals and not just discussion points 
that the minister has referred to.
<P>
	The minister boasted at the beginning of this Parliament that 
he would be introducing an action plan to reform Canada's 
social program but we have seen this delayed again and again for 
months.
<P>
	Has the minister lost his nerve? We want to know, where is the 
action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the action really resides in the 
will and motivation of the Canadian people to make a 
fundamental reform and bring about a modern social system 
based upon real compassion and justice for Canadians.
<P>
	Presumably during the last election campaign opposition 
members made certain commitments to their electors ensuring 
that their points of view would be heard. Therefore I find it 
exceedingly strange they would be so opposed to any attempt to 
have real serious dialogue and consultation.
<P>
	I recommend that the hon. member change her position and 
turn around and use this as an opportunity to engage Canadians 
in a very serious debate about the future of this country.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course 
we are in favour of consultation. It is just that consultation must 
end sooner or later and then we must act on it.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	The social policy review was undertaken because as the 
minister knows, the status quo is simply unsustainable. Our 
social programs are too costly, too inefficient and in desperate 
need of reform.
<P>
	Knowing that social programs must be better targeted and that 
Canadians will have to take more personal responsibility to 
provide for their own retirement, will the minister tell the 
finance minister to keep his hands off Canadians' private 
pensions and RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I prefer to answer my own 
questions if you do not mind. In my experience the hon. Minister 
of Finance is a gentleman of great discretion and judgment and 
he knows exactly where he wants to put his hands.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, Ontario's finance minister proposed giving Ottawa 
exclusive control of a national sales tax that would replace the 
GST and all provincial sales taxes. In return, the provinces 
would receive a greater share of individual income tax revenues.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does he intend to 
follow up the Ontario finance minister's proposal and are we to 
understand that the GST reform he is considering will be based 
on this suggestion?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Before answering, Mr. Speaker, may I say I would 
like to see the <I>Hansard</I> blues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The treasurer of the province of Ontario telephoned me 
yesterday morning, just before question period, to let me know 
about the suggestion he made yesterday. The details were not 
provided and I think that our officials are going to meet. We are 
very open to any suggestion that will help us harmonize the tax. 
That said, we will certainly have many questions about the 
suggestion, but I think that any constructive suggestion is 
worthwhile.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the Minister of Finance think that to really simplify 
consumer taxes, eliminate duplication and reduce the huge 
administrative costs, he should instead abolish the GST as 
promised and transfer this tax field to the provinces in exchange 
for an equivalent reduction in transfers, as the Bloc Quebecois 
recommended in its  report on the GST to the finance committee 
in June? The minister wants suggestions-there is one.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will certainly 
consider the suggestion from the Bloc Quebecois with the same 
open mind as we received the suggestion from the Treasurer of 
the Province of Ontario. We did so when they presented their 
report. We discussed with the provinces and we must say that the 
provinces, including Quebec, are not unanimously in favour of 
it.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a 1992 internal report which examined mismanagement in 
the Department of National Defence and raised the spectre of 
abuse and cover up.
<P>
	The deputy minister's office was renovated at a cost of 
$327,000. This contract was awarded without tender and 
concealed under a completely different project in order, and I 
quote from the report, ``to hide the cost of the DM refit which 
would be considered excessive by the public''.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell the House what action the 
government has taken to correct this bureaucratic 
mismanagement within the defence department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the Minister of National Defence 
I will take the question under advisement for the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
problem is not just one of excessive spending; it appears that the 
department compounded its sins in trying to hide the report by 
classifying it ``protected C''.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	According to the Treasury Board guidelines ``protected C'' is 
reserved for extremely sensitive information which might cause 
extremely serious injury such as loss of life.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that this seems to place DND in a 
position of deliberately trying to conceal information?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, we are skating on a little bit 
thinner ice, ``deliberately conceal''. I would ask hon. members 
to please be very judicious in their choice of words. I will permit 
the hon. Secretary of State for Veterans to answer the question if 
he so wishes.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fisheries 
minister refused to admit in this House yesterday that he had 
encouraged Gaspesian fishermen to gear up for turbot fishing. 
Yet, at the very last moment, just hours before they were to cast 
their nets, the minister refused to authorize the transfer of turbot 
licences in addition to having slashed their quotas one month 
earlier.
<P>
	How can the minister explain his decision to grant a turbot 
fishing quota to Seafreez, a company located in his riding which 
hires Russian trawlers, when he refused to grant the same quota 
to the Gaspesian fishermen, thereby forcing them to live off UI 
or even welfare?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member really ought to try to be consistent.
<P>
	The issue here is cutbacks in quotas and whether or not new 
entrants would be allowed into the fishery. New entrants 
whether they were in Newfoundland, Quebec or anywhere else 
were not allowed into the fishery.
<P>
	With respect to the allegation made for the second day in a 
row, and I admire the member's persistence and also his power 
to take a punch, that allocations to Seafreez increased or that 
allocations to Russian vessels increased, let me read the 
numbers.
<P>
	The allocation in 1993 to Seafreez was 5,000 tonnes. In 1994 
it was reduced to 2,200 tonnes. The allocation caught by Russian 
vessels under charter with Canadian companies, and they were 
doing this for years in advance of this government coming to 
power, decreased by 60 per cent last year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt 
that quota cutbacks may become necessary for reasons relating 
to the biological environment. But what we want to know is why 
the minister gave part of the available quotas to a company 
located in his riding, a company that used Russian trawlers to 
fish its quota? That is what we want to know.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member knows the answer. Not a single pound, not 
an ounce, not even a sniff of that turbot has been processed in my 
constituency, not one single job. It is processed in the great 
historic community of Canso, Nova Scotia, which is in a 
different province.
<P>
	When all the members of the fishing constituency in every 
province in Canada recognize there is a resource crisis, when the 
world meets in New York and recognizes a fisheries crisis, when 
NAFO meets in Halifax and recommends a fisheries crisis, 
surely even the Bloc Quebecois should recognize a fisheries 
crisis.

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	Last week I asked the minister if he would release the 
Nordicity study which recommends a new tax for the CBC. His 
ministry received the study in early March, fully six months 
ago, and still we have not seen it. This document has now been 
leaked to the press, but the minister continues to say there will 
be no secrets regarding the CBC.
<P>
	When will the minister release the study his government has 
commissioned recommending a new tax for the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our colleague will be very pleased. The report will be 
released but there is no recommendation by the government to 
impose new taxes. If there are recommendations they are 
contained in that report which I have read.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to hear that the minister has now read the report. 
However through the Access to Information Act I do have a copy 
of the contract between the minister and Nordicity and I quote: 
``a report to examine a tax on theatre tickets, video rentals, cable 
fees, TV sets, VCRs, radios, satellite dishes, pay per view 
services''. This list goes on and on.
<P>
	We have the contract and the media has the complete report. 
How can the minister now deny that he is planning a new tax to 
pay for the CBC?

would ask all hon. members please not to use papers or anything 
to wave around to make their point. The point is very well made 
with just your voices.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our colleague does not seem to be able to tell the 
difference between having studies carried out and making 
policy. Studies are being carried out day in and day out. Policy is 
an act taken by the government. When policy is made she will be 
informed.

PCBs in the St. Lawrence River, across from the GM facility in 
Massena, New York, will begin in a few days. These sediments, 
which contain between 500 and 5,000 parts of PCBs per million, 
are a major threat to the environment. The clean-up will be 
carried out by GM and the American government.

Environment Canada will monitor this extremely dangerous 
operation during only 10 per cent of the total time required to 
complete it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

accurate. The hon. member should know that SVP may no longer 
exist as an organization since it was on the brink of bankruptcy 
two months ago. It was mentioned in just about every newspaper 
that SVP is now bankrupt.
<P>
	What the federal government did in co-operation with the 
former Quebec government was to develop an action plan 
precisely to solve, with the help of American organizations, the 
problem which exists in Massena. The previous Quebec 
minister, Mr. Pierre Paradis, was co-operative and I intend to 
write today to the new environment minister to make sure that 
we are ready to ensure that the clean-up is done properly. I

individuals, none of whom is involved with DFO. In fact three of 
the four are associated with agencies listed in the DFO phone 
book.
<P>
	Is this the minister's definition of independence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have no idea at this stage what the hon. member is 
referring to. If he is suggesting that these individuals have some 
involvement with fisheries management or have some expertise 
that has been called upon in the past and therefore because of 
their expertise are not qualified to participate at this time, I 
would be surprised. If an involvement in the fishery disqualifies 
one from commenting then I guess this fishermen critic would 
be disqualified from commenting for the Reform Party.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
In a very surprising statement last Tuesday, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of the Environment announced that the 
government would present a comprehensive reform of the 
Canada Labour Code and that the matter of anti-strikebreaking 
legislation would be looked at within this reform. It is the first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6221"> 6221 </A></B>
<P>
time such a reform is announced, although anti-strikebreaking 
legislation is sorely needed.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
that the government will undertake a reform of the Canada 
Labour Code as a whole and, if so, when?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member fully 
understands that having good industrial relationships in the 
country is one of the key elements in producing better growth, 
better productivity and having a prosperous economy.
<P>
	As part of that overall initiative of the government we have 
undertaken a series of discussions with a wide variety of groups, 
with labour groups, with labour professionals and with 
employer groups to begin discussing what changes we might 
make to the labour code down the road when we come up with 
the kind of consensus or agreement that we think would be 
appropriate.
<P>
	We are studying how we can modernize the labour code and 
move toward certain specific recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	At this time I cannot say specifically what they will be 
because we have not finished those discussions yet.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
intolerable situation faced by Ogilvie Mills workers, does the 
minister not agree that he must urgently table an 
anti-strikebreaking bill so that the workers who are covered-I 
should say who are unfortunate enough to be covered-by the 
Canada Labour Code have the same rights as those covered by 
75 per cent of provincial labour codes, including the one in 
Quebec, since 1977?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met last week with 
representatives of the unions involved in the dispute between 
ADM Ogilvie and themselves. Certainly as a result of that I 
agree that there is proper room for filing a complaint or a 
grievance against the way in which the bargaining has taken 
place.
<P>
	I have already sort of signed off a request so that they can go 
before the Canadian Labour Relations Board and table their 
grievance, which I think is a proper one. We have already taken 
action on that specific request and as part of the general 
examination I spoke about we are looking at the labour codes of 
other provinces and how they apply to replacement labour.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
commented that farmers exporting grain to the U.S. must obey 
laws that are in place.
<P>
	Under the Western Grain Transportation Act railways face 
financial penalties for non-performance. These railways have 
continually broken this law for years without consequences.
<P>
	How can the minister fail to enforce this law against 
non-performing railways and at the same time encourage law 
enforcement against farmers selling their own grain at the best 
prices available?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, in dealing with the situation 
pertaining to the railways to which the question refers, the hon. 
gentleman will know that while there are provisions in the 
Western Grain Transportation Act that deal with the 
performance standards of the railways, under the previous 
government the appropriate regulatory regime required under 
those legislative provisions was never implemented or enacted.
<P>
	We have the draft regulations being prepared at the moment so 
that those provisions of the Western Grain Transportation Act 
pertaining to railway performance can be implemented and 
utilized in appropriate circumstances. The hon. gentleman can 
rest assured that there is no double standard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for that answer.
<P>
	As the minister knows very well, last May the subcommittee 
on transportation recommended that back tracking of grain was 
illegal, disruptive and should be stopped. In June the minister 
guaranteed that action would be taken. Now he is delaying this 
action six months at a time.
<P>
	Would the minister explain to the House who is running this 
country, the railways or the Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, since May 16 I have been meeting on 
a very regular basis with not only representatives of the 
railroads but also their unions, the grain companies and all the 
governmental institutions involved in the transportation of 
western grain in order to ensure the backlog problems that 
occurred in the last crop year are minimized and hopefully 
avoided altogether in the current crop year and for the future.
<P>
	Those meetings through the spring and the summer have 
identified a range of actions, including the solution to the back 
haul problem that the hon. gentleman refers to, plus the matter 
of demurrage and storage charges on rail car, plus improvements 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6222"> 6222 </A></B>
<P>
in the efficiencies of the system, plus the addition of private cars 
to the fleet and so forth.
<P>
	All those measures are going forward and, as promised in the 
spring, those which require either a legislative framework or a 
regulatory framework to allow them to be implemented will be 
proceeded with in the House this fall.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs. Last February 25, 
the minister said, in answer to a question from the Official 
Opposition, that he would do his utmost to solve the problems at 
Davis Inlet and that he would support the relocation of the Innu 
community, which is experiencing a tragic and inhuman 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Now we are told that the whole relocation process has been 
put on hold. How can the minister explain this delay, on the part 
of his government, in relocating the Innu community other than 
by saying that it is to meet demands from the Newfoundland 
government, which wants to put pressure on these people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, tremendous progress has been 
made in Davis Inlet. Right now as a result of the agreements we 
have signed alcoholism is down 25 per cent; six houses have 
been built; the lodge has been reconstructed; they are working 
out agreements with Labrador Inuit College; we have agreed to 
the move to Sango Bay; and we are looking at a road pattern.
<P>
	I was very disappointed with what happened last month. Part 
of those agreements, at least the spirit of those agreements, was 
that an Innu court would be developed and an Innu policing 
system would be developed, only a small part of a major 
agreement.
<P>
	Most ministries are still working with the Innu, health, 
fisheries, coast guard. We will continue to work with the Innu 
people because they are making good progress. Hopefully Mr. 
Roberts and the Solicitor General will reach an agreement on 
policing within the next couple of weeks and progress will keep

<P>

answers and that is thoroughly inappropriate to these 
circumstances.
<P>
	Farmers in western Canada would tell the hon. gentleman that 
this is a critically important and vital subject. It is a subject that 
is exceedingly complicated in terms of the administration of 
world markets. I have undertaken that farmers will have the 
opportunity in a forum which I intend to commence this fall to 
explore all of the pros and cons of the issue so that all the facts

<P>
	Given that this year's quota of bluefin tuna on the east coast 
by the inshore fleet has been caught in near record time, 
resulting in the early closure of the fishery just last Friday, I 
have a question for the minister. Given that there still seems to 
be an abundance of bluefin tuna on the east coast and given the 
state of the Atlantic fishery, would the minister consider 
transferring some of next year's quota to this year's quota so that 
the fishery may remain open?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question. The short answer 
is, because this is run on a two-year quota cycle, that we are 
consulting with all the players in the industry. I met with senior 
officials today and once the consultation is completed, if such a 
transfer is recommended by the fleet itself, the majority of the 
fleet, we will look at it favourably. If not, we will stick with the 
current fish plan.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, during 
question period, my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
tried to put a question to the Prime minister, but you ruled that 
question out of order.
<P>
	I may have repeatedly been out of order and I would ask you to 
enlighten me because, like other members of  this House, I have 
on many occasions referred to remarks made by one member or 
another and asked, as is proper, the government, the ministers 
whether they rejected, supported, agreed with or wanted to 
qualify such remarks.
<P>
	My colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve did the same 
thing, making a very general reference to the remarks a 
government member made about the gay community.
<P>
	My question is as follows: What is the difference between 
referring to remarks made by the hon. member for Central Nova 
and asking the Prime Minister whether he rejected or supported 
her remarks and the questions we have being asking in this 
House so far, referring for instance to remarks by the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell or someone else on 
other issues?
<P>
	Why in this particular case did you rule the question out of 
order, while such questions have always been allowed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I may, according to the Standing Orders of the House 
of Commons, to citation 168 in <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary 
Rules and Forms</I> in particular, a member cannot appeal a 
decision by the Speaker nor consult the Speaker from the floor 
of the House.
<P>
	Second, Madam Speaker, acting this morning on behalf of Mr. 
Speaker, took a matter under advisement. If I remember 
correctly, the Chair has not yet ruled on this matter which was 
referred to the Speaker this morning.
<P>
	For these two reasons, I think it would be totally against the 
rules for anyone to question the Speaker's decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
whip has just spoken on a point of order I raised myself. I would 
simply like to remind him that, as the guardian of 
parliamentarians' rights, you have always agreed to provide 
guidance and information to ensure the smooth operation of this 
House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6224"> 6224 </A></B>
<P>
	The question I asked is very much in this spirit. I simply want 
to ask for the Chair's assistance in understanding the order of 
business and seeing that our behaviour is always in keeping with 
the letter and spirit of the rules and traditions of this House.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	As far as the second part of my comments is concerned, please 
note that my point of order and the question from the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve did not deal at all with 
the problem now under advisement that was in dispute the other 
day. It is simply a point of order saying this: Why should a 
member not be allowed to ask the Prime Minister to confirm or 
deny remarks when it has always been allowed? That is it. So 
one should not confuse the facts, as the Government Whip seems 
to be doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I simply want to support the point of order raised by the 
Bloc Quebecois House leader. This morning, I raised a point of 
order pursuant to Standing Order 18. This has nothing to do with 
the point of order now raised by the Bloc Quebecois House 
leader.
<P>
	The basic issue is whether or not a member of Parliament has 
the right to put a question to the Prime Minister regarding 
comments which are totally unacceptable and full of hatred. 
That is the issue. Mr. Speaker, I suggest you do not follow the 
Standing Orders during question period.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, we in the course of our debates 
and our questions sometimes use words that the Chair considers 
at the time to be inappropriate. The hon. member points out that 
at an earlier time some questions were permitted. I would hope 
that the hon. member at a later time will let the Chair know when 
there is this inconsistency.
<P>
	As for an explanation, I am loath to explain why the decision 
was taken. Yet so that the House can understand, if it has to do 
with the administrative responsibility of the government, in my 
view I have allowed the questions. Whether a minister will be 
responsible for any other member of Parliament or what the 
other member of Parliament said, I do not think this is 
admissible. That is why I ruled that question out of order, 
because it called on a minister to give an opinion with regard to 
another member.
<P>
	Again I would hope that members would not call upon the 
Chair at every turn when there is a statement or question that is 
ruled to be out of order. If the hon. member wishes to pursue this 
with me in my chambers I will be happy to hear him at that point.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STATEMENTSBYMEMBERS">STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order. Earlier today during members 
statements I was ruled out of order presumably based on 
Standing Order 18. If I am wrong in that  assumption I would 
appreciate your information to the contrary. Standing Order 18 
states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No Member shall speak disrespectfully of the Sovereign, nor of any of the 
Royal Family, nor of the Governor General or the person administering the 
Government of Canada; nor use offensive words against either House, or against 
any member thereof.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citations 485 to 492 of Beauchesne's talk about 
unparliamentary language. I would appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, 
that I did not use unparliamentary language in any portion of my 
speech.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is absolutely correct. I was 
referring to Standing Order 18. I would call this matter closed 
now.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	I know that many times hon. members would like to pursue 
and debate but at one point the Chair must rule. As I said to the 
member, I am referring specifically to Standing Order 18 and I 
would hope that in future all hon. members, my colleagues, 
would give the respect due to the other place and members in the 
other place.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to say that I have no intention of 
challenging the decisions which you may make in this House.
<P>
	However, you will recognize, as the leader says, that it is 
important in our role as members of Parliament to understand 
what kind of flexibility we have when it comes to asking 
questions. In my opinion, the issue raised by the point of order is 
this: When we tried twice to understand the comments made by 
an hon. member, we did so from a legal standpoint and in the 
context of the government's activities.
<P>
	You are well aware that the comments made were paving the 
way for a review of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Allow me 
to point to your attention the fact that the question asked is 
closely related to a governmental responsibility of the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Dear colleague, the question was 
deemed out of order because of the way it was phrased.
<P>

would have been permissible. That is what I based my ruling on

	The House resumed from September 22 consideration of the 
motion and the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. When 
you proceed with the vote may I request that the vote be taken by 
row as opposed to the traditional party vote, since this is a 
private member's item and there is no whip discipline.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the government 
whip for his intervention. That will be the case with this 
division.
<P>
	As is the practice, the division will be taken row by row 
starting with the mover and then proceeding with those in favour 
of the amendment sitting on the same side of the House as the 
mover. Then those in favour of the amendment sitting on the 
other side of the House will be called. Those opposed to the 
amendment will be called in the same order.
<P>
	The question is on the amendment.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Bill C-48 before the House today, the federal government 
assumes rights and powers that directly encroach on the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces over natural resources. 
This is unacceptable. Apparently, the federal government is 
unable to read what is said in the Canadian Constitution and 
refuses to listen to Quebec's demands.
<P>
	What we see in Bill C-48 is a federal government that 
continues to get involved in a jurisdiction that is Quebec's 
exclusively. It assumes the power to go over the heads of the 
provinces and Quebec, directly funding organizations and 
individuals.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The federal government prefers to ignore Quebec's demands, 
but I am willing to bet that many of my colleagues in the other 
provinces share my position. I would like to say the following 
for their benefit. These unwanted intrusions by the federal 
government lead to overlap between provincial and federal 
strategies for developing this sector, especially since many 
provinces have already set up their own strategies for 
promoting, regulating and developing their natural resources.
<P>
	Quebec's forest management strategy tabled last May by the 
Quebec government is a good example. The strategy is entirely 
independent from the National Forest Strategy developed by the 
federal government and the Canadian Council of Forest 
Ministers.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has to provide funding for both 
strategies. However, successive federal governments have 
ignored what is said in the Canadian Constitution as well as the 
legitimate demands of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Take, for instance, the report of the Standing Committee of 
the House of Commons on Forestry and Fisheries, in November 
1990, about the struggle of provinces to defend their jurisdiction 
over natural resources. The committee says that in the course of 
the twentieth century, the government had on several occasions 
tried to affect national policy in the forestry sector but had 
sometimes met with resistance by the provinces to any potential 
encroachment on their jurisdictions.
<P>
	The committee felt it was clear that the federal government 
had to play a more credible role to guarantee the success of all 
these national forestry strategies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6229"> 6229 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the committee suggests it is necessary to obtain the 
co-operation of the provinces, it is clear that the federal 
government has felt free to intervene in this area without the 
specific consent of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec protested, to no avail, against the creation of a 
Department of Forestry, quite properly seeing this as an 
intrusion in one of its jurisdictions. Quebec did not sign the 
National Forest Strategy. Since 1991, after the demise of Meech 
Lake, no Quebec ministers have been involved in the Canadian 
Council of Forest Ministers. Quebec has just released its own 
strategy for forest management, as is its right in matters over 
which it has exclusive jurisdiction.
<P>
	How can the federal government legitimately intervene in an 
area that falls under provincial jurisdiction? How can it claim to 
act in the best interests of Quebecers, when for years it has 
ignored both its own Constitution and the demands of successive 
governments of Quebec?
<P>
	Obviously, the Liberal government's stated desire to put an 
end to overlap and duplication would be a perfect excuse for 
getting rid of the Department of Natural Resources or letting 
provinces opt out of federal programs that involve natural 
resources.
<P>
	Perhaps I may compare the mandate of the Department of 
Natural Resources of Quebec with that of the Department of 
Natural Resources of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Based on the analysis of federal-provincial overlapping 
carried out by the Treasury Board of Canada in 1991, the 
activities of the federal Department of Natural Resources and its 
Quebec counterpart overlap to a large extent.
<P>
	That is why I would like to propose an amendment to Bill 
C-48, an amendment respectful of the Constitution of Canada 
and respectful of Quebec's traditional demands. Here is my 
amendment. I move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Frontenac:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That every word following ``that'' be struck out and replaced by the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>this House refuse to give second reading to Bill C-48, an Act to establish the 
Department of Natural Resources and to amend related acts, because the 
principle of the bill does not provide for granting the minister the power to 
compensate Quebec if the province decided to exercise by itself the exclusive 
jurisdiction over natural resources it was conferred under the Constitution Act 
of 1867 and 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Chair was consulted, 
and the amendment is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating the government for adopting Reform policy with 
respect to departmental consolidation. Since we are dealing with 
the legalization of a fait accompli I should probably be thanking 
the previous government for this recycled bill, a toast to absent 
antagonists.
<P>
	Having said that, the government is pretty unclear on the 
concept. As a matter of fact the government is pretty unclear on 
almost every concept, but I will leave that for another day.
<P>
	The object of consolidation is to increase managerial 
efficiency and save money. What has been accomplished? 
Instead of 10 assistant deputy ministers there are now seven, 
which is commendable. Minor economies have been made in 
human resources, accounting and so on, but the total decrease in 
corporate overhead has been only $16 million, 1.6 per cent of the 
department's annual budget. The elephant laboured and brought 
forth a mouse.
<P>
	The department has expressed pride in the fact that the 
amalgamation was done with only minor staff reductions. The 
act states in section 8 that all employees in the old department 
will occupy their same positions in the new department. Perhaps 
this makes some sense in the short term with respect to clerks, 
typists, technicians and other lower rank staff who would merely 
swell the massive ranks of Canada's already existing 
unemployed. Is there really no scope for reducing the number of 
middle managers and technocrats to conform with today's 
economic reality?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	This department, which deals almost exclusively with matters 
of provincial responsibility, has a $1 billion budget and about 
5,000 employees, of whom 3,000 are right here in Ottawa. How 
can that be rationalized?
<P>
	I know that the uncontrolled growth of bureaucracy is not a 
disease that attacks only governments. I have worked for or been 
associated with a few multinational resource companies and 
they have the same problems. They also have built-in safety 
valves which prevent such growth from destroying them, as it 
surely would if it went unchecked.
<P>
	Every few years the boards of companies like Exxon, Shell or 
Noranda become aware that the ratio of payroll to gross revenue 
is grossly out of whack. Department heads are summoned to the 
CEO's office and the word goes out: too many engineers, too 
many planners, too many people engaged in redundant 
programs, too many assistant managers, too many professionals 
who never leave their offices, and so on.
<P>
	The axe is swung and corporate survival is assured. It is not 
pretty and it is not nice but it preserves not only the company but 
also the jobs of the people who actually harvest the resources 
and produce corporate and national wealth.
<P>
	Up to now Canadian governments have not responded to these 
same economic imperatives. With no apparent limits to their 
capacity to increase income and no real motivation for cutting 
expenses, they simply raise taxes, or more recently borrowed 
unimaginably large sums of money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6230"> 6230 </A></B>
<P>
	I know perfectly well that streamlining government 
operations will not in itself get us out of the awful mess we are 
in. It has been said many times in this House that the entire cost 
of government operations is less than half of the annual deficit. 
If we do not start there, where will we start and when?
<P>
	Let me cite a couple of specific examples of where I believe 
that small but significant cuts could be made in departmental 
spending. The mining sector has 168 full time equivalent 
employees and a budget of just under $26 million. More than 
half of that budget represents contributions to mineral 
development agreements with the provinces, primarily with 
Quebec. These are sunset programs, most of which will expire 
next year.
<P>
	Planning, observing and studying these MDA programs 
requires a substantial investment in time and resources. If the 
federal government must participate in these programs as a form 
of equalization, and I question the wisdom of that, it would be 
much more efficient to just send cheques. We do not need two 
levels of bureaucracy administering the same programs.
<P>
	The mining sector's most essential functions are gathering 
statistics and helping to formulate government policy with 
respect to taxation, investment and trade. These duties could 
readily be handled by Stats Canada and by a few specialists in 
the various ministries responsible for the administration and 
execution of the policy.
<P>
	At the end of the day the usefulness of this small sector of the 
Department of Natural Resources is open to question. Certainly 
the possible cost benefits of dismantling it should be 
considered.
<P>
	Not all questionable department expenditures are related to 
overlap and duplication. The Atomic Energy Control Board is 
the sole agency in Canada which regulates the storage and use of 
radioactive material. This is fitting and proper. The agency 
suffers from a severe case of bureaucratic bloat. Between 1985 
and 1993 the number of licences to sell, store or use nuclear 
materials decreased by 17 per cent, from 4,543 to 3,743, while 
the number of AECB employees rose from 252 to 373, a 48 per 
cent increase.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This organization is supervising only 10 licensees per 
employee. Senior department officials attribute this ridiculous 
ratio to increased public concern for health and safety. Really, 
now.
<P>
	The AECB is now working on a partial cost recovery basis. 
All private licensees pay a fee for service. The AECB provides 
no service. It is a regulatory agency and its fees are therefore 
just another form of taxation targeted at small specialized 
industries that cannot duck. The system reminds me of the 
practice in China of requiring a condemned man's family to pay 
for the cartridges used for his execution.
<P>
	If the agency got rid of one third of its employees it would not 
have to proceed with its well known plans to increase fees by an 
additional one third annually until 1997.
<P>
	Before I conclude my remarks I want to tell the House my 
favourite civil service story. It concerns Charles Camsell, an 
early director of the Geological Survey of Canada. He and some 
young assistants were on a long canoe traverse of several weeks' 
duration. They came to a Hudson Bay post. They had been living 
on the usual diet of the day which was beans, bannock and fish 
for these many weeks. One of the young fellows got up the nerve 
to approach Mr. Camsell and ask him if they could get a little 
variety in their diet since there was a store near at hand. The old 
man reached down into his pocket, pulled out a quarter and sent 
one of the boys over to the Hudson Bay post for a can of 
tomatoes.
<P>
	If we had one or two guys like Charlie in the Department of 
Natural Resources today we might see some action in the 
direction which the people on my side of the House would like to 
see.
<P>
	In closing, the mandate in article 6 of this act is a motherhood 
mission statement which hardly anyone would disagree with. It 
looks great, but should there not be something in there about 
cost effectiveness?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Manicouagan-Canada Labour Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first three members on Bill C-48 had a limit of a 40 
minutes maximum. Now we will go into the next phase of debate 
during which members will have 20 minute interventions, 
followed by ten minutes of questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to address the House again today at the second 
reading of Bill C-48, an Act to establish the Department of 
Natural Resources and to amend related Acts.
<P>
	I would like to add to the statement by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Edmonton Northwest and Minister of Natural 
Resources. The natural resource sector is tremendously 
important to Canada's economy, and the Department of Natural 
Resources should ensure that this sector remains a cornerstone 
of Canada's economic growth as well as a significant source of 
jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6231"> 6231 </A></B>
<P>
	As indicated earlier, Bill C-48 will establish the Department 
of Natural Resources and provide the legal framework within 
which it will operate.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The department's mandate will be defined in one document 
rather than in the two acts now in effect, namely the Department 
of Forestry Act and the Department of Energy, Mines and 
Resources Act.
<P>
	Sustainable development is very important. My colleague 
from Edmonton Northwest has indicated that one of the 
challenges facing the natural resource sector is Canada's 
progress toward sustainable development. Our ability to 
integrate our economic and environmental goals at all levels of 
natural resource management is essential if Canada is to become 
more competitive in this sector. Bill C-48 confirms the 
government's commitment to this objective.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The natural resources sector is important. The statistics 
quoted earlier by my hon. colleague, the Minister of Natural 
Resources, proves that natural resource industries provide a 
major contribution to Canada's gross domestic product, our 
trade surplus and job creation in our country. Over 500 
communities depend on natural resource activity to sustain their 
economy. As well, our natural resource industries are high tech 
industries. Canada has a well-deserved reputation as a leader in 
the development and application of technology to improve the 
productivity and competitiveness of mining, forest and energy 
industries. It is through our expertise in this area that new 
technologies have emerged.
<P>
	New technology has also created new industries in Canada. 
For example, as the minister has pointed out, Canada's 
requirement for accurate information on our land mass, such as 
maps of our geography, has stimulated new industries like 
geomatics. Already, this burgeoning industry employs 12,000 
Canadians and exports $100 million each year.
<P>
	The role of Natural Resources Canada. The Department of 
Natural Resources has developed a solid reputation for its 
research and technology expertise over many years. It is this 
expertise that has and will continue to bridge industrial and 
environmental concerns facing natural resource industries. Over 
the years the work of Natural Resources Canada has led to 
improved resource sector competitiveness and environmental 
performance.
<P>
	Earlier, my hon. colleague the minister described some of the 
department's work in forest development, innovative mining 
processes and energy efficiency. These examples demonstrate 
how Natural Resources Canada is positioned to bridge the 
industrial and environmental concerns facing the natural 
resource sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In summary, the Department of Natural Resources will 
continue to promote sustainable development practices, will 
apply its scientific and technological expertise to the 
enhancement of our international trade and will increase the 
natural resource sector's contribution to economic growth and 
job creation.
<P>
	Bill C-48 will establish the Department of Natural Resources 
and help Canadians understand the department's role as an 
intermediary-that word is extremely important-in bridging 
industrial and environmental concerns.
<P>
	Under Bill C-48, the Minister and the Department of Natural 
Resources will have a mandate to work with the provinces, 
industry, environmental and aboriginal groups, and other 
stakeholders to ensure that Canada's natural resource sector 
continues to prosper now and in future years.
<P>
	I listened earlier to the speech by my colleague from 
Matapédia-Matane and I was very surprised, to say the least, 
by how he approached the presentation of this bill. First of all, 
he limited his comments almost exclusively to the constitutional 
aspect, that is, the Constitution as it applies to this bill. He 
accused the federal government of meddling in Quebec's 
business.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to put that allegation in 
context. To start with, there was the 1992 Canada-Quebec 
Agreement on Forest Development providing for $136 million 
over five years. The hon. member for Matapédia-Matane said 
that Quebec had never signed such a document. We are talking 
about an amount of $136 million made up of equal contributions 
from each government, that is $68 million.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In the case of the Eastern Quebec Development Plan, the total 
amount of $68 million was paid by the federal government, as 
was also the case with the $10.5-million Indian reserve land 
program.
<P>
	My point is this: under the Charlottetown accord, the forestry 
sector was to become an exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. 
But as you know, the province of Quebec rejected the accord.
<P>
	The second point I want to make is that the two existing acts, 
namely the Forestry Act and the Energy Administration Act, 
remain almost intact. In other words, the federal government 
participates in the financing of management activities related to 
those two natural resources sectors, but does not in any way 
interfere with the actual administration of the two programs.
<P>
	I have a message for the hon. member, who might want to 
transmit it to the new Quebec government. If the federal 
contributions which I just mentioned are unacceptable and are 
perceived to be a form of interference, then the Quebec 
government can send them back, because we can certainly use 
them elsewhere. I know what I am talking about; while Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6232"> 6232 </A></B>
<P>
received  $136 million, Northern Ontario only got $30 million, 
that is $6 million per year.
<P>
	Consequently, last year, 45 million small trees were not 
planted because there was no money available. So, if Quebec 
does not want those federal contributions, I will be very pleased 
to accept them on behalf of my constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the Charlottetown accord, if that is what my hon. colleague is 
referring to, we did ask for total jurisdiction over forests. That is 
why we are going to have to hold a referendum: to obtain it. 
Quebec receives federal funding. It needs that money, and as 
long as we are part of this country, that is our money too.
<P>
	As I said, Quebec did not sign the national strategy. We did 
not sign it. Sometimes deputy ministers travel. The fact remains 
that we did not sign. My hon. colleague from Ontario says that 
Quebec received millions of dollars, but then Ontario received 
transfer payments for regional development. So, there is 
compensation on both sides.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. colleague this: does he agree with 
me that the federal government has very long arms when it come 
to grabbing, controlling, strangling the provinces even more? 
We in Quebec object to that. We do not refuse the money. We 
need it. It is just that we should be compensated and that is 
precisely what Quebec has been asking for since Lesage and 
Johnson. That is what we are asking for, and we have been 
asking for this for over 30 years.
<P>
	It seems to me that this bill goes beyond the purview of the 
Constitution. I would like him to comment on that.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> With pleasure, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I would 
like to say that the amalgamation of two existing acts as in this 
case is always subject to Section 92(b) of the Constitution Act, 
1867, which provided at the time that natural resources 
belonged to the provinces. That is exactly the point I was 
making earlier: these resources still belong to the provinces, but 
the federal government reserves the right to provide financial 
support to those provinces that want some.
<P>
	Quebec benefits greatly from this, with the $68 million it 
received from the federal government corresponding to the 68 
Conservative members it used to have in this House. Quebec 
received a very fair share indeed. Again, if my hon. colleague is 
convinced that when Quebec gets its independence, its will no 
longer need federal funds, by all means send the money back!
<P>
	Coming back to the Charlottetown Accord, Quebec rejected 
it, with all the implications this had.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> So did Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> That is right, but we are talking about Quebec 
here. We are not talking about Ontario but Quebec. My 
colleague also raised the issue of regional development. This 
bill is not about regional development, it is about agreements on 
forestry. The figures just quoted were derived exclusively from 
forest resource development agreements.
<P>
	Regional development is a different matter altogether. Must I 
add in closing that, with respect to regional development, 
Quebec's share is about $600 per capita, as compared to $133 for 
northern Ontario?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-48 is a bill which in principle I support and the New 
Democratic Party caucus supports in-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I would 
like to hear all the statements, everyone in turn. We are now 
listening to the comments of the member for Regina-Lumsden.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to share 
with the House and the members that the New Democratic Party 
caucus supports in principle the taking of the bill to committee.
<P>
	The bill when it becomes law will amalgamate, as I 
understand it, under one minister the powers, duties and 
functions of the minister in the Department of Forestry Act and 
the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources Act.
<P>
	The bill defines natural resources to include all areas covered 
in the Department of Forestry Act and the Department of 
Energy, Mines and Resources Act. The definition clause 
contains a definition of sustainable development, the same 
definition apparently as in the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act.
<P>
	There is a requirement under the general duties clause for the 
minister to consider the integrated management and sustainable 
development of Canada's natural resources in carrying out the 
minister's duties and functions. The general duties clause of the 
bill reiterates some modifications to the duties in the 
Department of Forestry Act to make these duties apply to all 
natural resources. It also describes current activities of the 
department and is consistent with federal government 
responsibilities and priorities in the natural resources area.
<P>
	A reorganization bill usually has many objectives and 
opportunities: either amalgamation, centralization, efficiency, 
streamlining, expansion or in many ways hiding budgetary 
expenditures. During the report to the committee I will be 
looking at some of these objectives of the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6233"> 6233 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a couple of concerns I want to raise with the member 
for Cochrane-Superior. The minister in her remarks today said, 
and I quote: ``Economic and environment concerns will 
continue to be addressed''. She also said in the same statement 
that she will be committed to the market principles. It is my 
sense that these are contradictory, that you cannot be carrying 
out on behalf of the people of Canada an economic and 
environmental study to ensure that these are addressed yet 
leaving all of the elements of the responsibilities of the minister 
up to market principles.
<P>
	I wanted to make the above point and I also have two 
questions. First, does the member not believe that these are 
contradictory, that the minister has indicated this previously? 
Second, has there been any provincial government response 
other than the members from the Bloc with respect to possible 
encroachments of provincial responsibilities in the energy 
sector, the forestry sector or some of the other natural resources 
sectors with specific reference to the province of Saskatchewan 
which is a province that I represent in this House?
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Mr. Speaker, to address the member's question 
directly, it is unavoidable today that the environment and the 
economy be together. We should strive to protect our 
environment while not being a nuisance to economic growth.
<P>
	We should strike a balance between the two. We have seen 
many instances where environmentalists were representing an 
extreme point of view and industry was representing the other 
point of view.
<P>
	I was really surprised and pleased that finally in the hearings 
of the natural resources committee, there seems to be movement 
on both sides. Industry has finally said publicly that, yes, there 
are environmental problems in Canada. The environmentalists 
are also saying that some progress is being made.
<P>
	This is the object of the bill. It is the power and the duty of the 
Minister of Natural Resources to try to conciliate these two 
extremely important parts of our Canadian way of doing things. 
She will strive to do so.
<P>
	The second part of the question concerned provincial 
jurisdiction. As I said a while ago to my colleague from the 
Bloc, amalgamating the two existing acts, the Forestry Act and 
the energy, mines and resources act, is totally in accordance with 
section 92(b) of the Constitution Act of 1867.
<P>
	It is almost status quo, although it may not be the right thing to 
say at this point. Nothing has changed. The federal government 
still wants to be able to invest in provincial projects. They still 
want to establish those partnerships with the provinces, 
industries, recreational clubs, anglers and hunters, everybody as 
a matter of fact. It is doing so by financing those projects and is 
not directly involved in the administration of those projects.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I support the proposal of my colleague, the 
hon. member for Matapédia-Matane, to delete some words 
from the proposal of the Minister of Natural Resources and to 
add to Bill C-48 the amendment presented in this House.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to show this House that 
the changes that these amendments make to the minister's 
proposal will simply make her proposal comply with the many 
requests expressed by all the successive premiers of Quebec for 
many decades, which this government is again trying to flout.
<P>
	Indeed, we can go back to Premier Jean Lesage in the early 
1960s who said, ``Resource development is in provincial 
jurisdiction. It is among the priority rights and needs of the 
provinces, who are better able than the federal government to act 
effectively and in a lasting way in this field''. He added: ``It 
must be clearly established as a basic rule of our federal system 
that Parliament's exceptional powers must remain just that, 
exceptional, and must not be used to invade fields that are 
normally in provincial jurisdiction''.
<P>
	Daniel Johnson, Sr., who was also a premier, continued in the 
same direction as his predecessor and said that exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction includes ``the exploration, conservation 
and development of resources'' in particular.
<P>
	Continuing with Jean-Jacques Bertrand, another premier, 
who in the same spirit said that Quebec also had to have 
jurisdiction over underwater mineral exploration, adding that 
Quebec could not accept the federal government acting 
unilaterally to manage provincial waters and control pollution 
in them, or acting with the provinces on the basis of the national 
interest, a concept which is very often invoked.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Even former Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa, who was a 
staunch federalist in Quebec, said that ``in the energy sector, 
neither unilateral action by the federal government, nor 
unco-ordinated measures by provincial governments will 
enable us to reach the necessary goals. This can only be achieved 
through concerted action from both levels of government and 
from all governments''.
<P>
	In its present form, Bill C-48 merely increases the federal 
government's role in an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Former Premier René Lévesque said that the Canadian 
economy was not an homogeneous thing which could be 
successfully controlled and regulated with a single policy or 
program. Provincial governments are in the best position to act, 
since they know better than anyone their own economic context 
as well as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6234"> 6234 </A></B>
<P>
all the relevant factors such as resources, industrial structures, 
domestic market, social climate, etc.
<P>
	More specifically, Mr. Lévesque argued that provinces have 
the sole right of ownership over their natural resources, adding 
that ``as regards minerals and other resources located outside 
the immediate provincial territory but within the 200-mile 
economic zone, Quebec favours a joint jurisdiction whereby a 
province's legislative authority would prevail''.
<P>
	Mr. Lévesque also pointed out that since mineral resources 
and their management come under provincial jurisdiction, it is 
up to the provinces to find the best way to ensure the survival 
and growth of their mining industry.
<P>
	Even in the days when federalism was perceived as a <I>beau 
risque</I>, and those days are certainly gone, Mr. Lévesque 
suggested that each province should have exclusive legislative 
power over its natural resources and interprovincial trade. In 
that latter sector, provincial laws would have superseded federal 
legislation so that the federal government would not have been 
able to use its general power to oppose a provincial law.
<P>
	As you can see, the bill before us does not comply with the 
wishes expressed by the numerous premiers who have 
represented Quebec over the last few decades. That is why I 
support the amendment proposed by my colleague from 
Matapédia-Matane, because that is the only way of ensuring 
that this government respects the will of the provinces, 
especially of Quebec, as it should under the relevant provisions 
of Canada's Constitution.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has always been opposed to the 
federal government's spending power, that is, its power to use 
Quebecers' taxes. Canada is not doing us any favours. What it 
gives us comes mainly from our own pockets. What we object to 
in this bill is this ability to spend, to take our money and manage 
our economy in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
according to all the laws of Canada and to Canada's 
Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Once again the federal government is going to extremes in its 
willingness to centralize everything in Ottawa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is what Mr. Bourassa used to call domineering 
federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In its willingness to centralize everything in Ottawa, in 
attacking the exploitation, concentration and management of 
natural resources, a sector which is exclusively in provincial 
jurisdiction, we cannot endorse a federal process to which 
Quebec in particular does not entirely subscribe.
<P>
	For us federal intervention in natural resources is totally 
illegitimate if the provinces are opposed to the project. Quebec, 
of course, and we have said it before, has always opposed the 
creation of a ministry of forests, for example, rightly viewing 
this as an intrusion into one of its exclusive jurisdictions.
<P>
	As well, Quebec is not a signatory to the national forest 
strategy and no Quebec minister has participated in the work of 
the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers since the Meech 
failure. It is Quebec that must exercise its full jurisdiction to 
determine its own policies, programs and priorities in the area of 
natural resources.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To convince this House of the challenge facing us, I would 
like to close my remarks by repeating a statement made by a 
former Quebec premier, Adélard Godbout-this goes way back; 
we did not start fighting for our causes yesterday-who 
expressed this somewhat prescient or prophetic opinion at the 
time: ``Full respect for provincial rights is essential to Canada's 
unity and progress. Any infringement on provincial rights would 
inevitably weaken Confederation''. That is obviously a reality 
which this government and its predecessors have always refused 
to understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a simple question. When the forest management plan for 
Indian lands expires in 1995, when the Canada-Quebec 
agreement on the development of forestry resources expires in 
1996 and the plan for Eastern Quebec expires in 1996 as well, 
will the hon. member for Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies 
recommend to his caucus and their colleagues in Quebec City 
that they should not renegotiate and should turn down all 
potential funding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is very apt, and I 
hope the answer will be as well. As long as we are part of 
Canada, as long as we pay our taxes and provide 25 per cent of 
Canada's income, we will insist that 25 per cent of any funding 
that is made available should go to Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Most Canadians actually believe in two assumptions 
concerning Quebec. We see it every day in the House. Most 
Canadians believe that we are a bunch of troublemakers who are 
never happy with what we get.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Well, you can see it is quite true.
<P>
	The second assumption is that Quebec receives much more 
money from Canada than it puts in. Most Canadians believe that 
assumption. If it is really the truth, then what is the problem? Let 
us go. You are going to make money and you are going to solve 
the problem. That is what we want. But until that time, demo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6235"> 6235 </A></B>
<P>
cratically speaking, we are going to stay here and we will ask to  
have 25 per cent of what is necessary for us because we give 25 
per cent of our revenues to Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
region I come from in metro Toronto we look at natural 
resources in terms of attachment because we have so few of 
them.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in many municipalities we have a 
department of urban forestry. We do have a regional 
conservation authority of great significance. We have citizens' 
participation and action in the cleaning up of our rivers. In other 
words, we have an attachment to water, soil and the natural 
resources probably because we are urban Canadians.
<P>
	We do not have obsessions about jurisdiction. We think that 
the few trees and the few rivers we have belong to us as 
municipal dwellers, as provincial dwellers and as Canadians as a 
whole. However, we have in common with everybody across the 
country the preoccupation about the future of these resources. 
This is what my intervention will focus on this afternoon.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I congratulate the minister for introducing this important bill. 
I praise her for including a reference to sustainable development 
in clause 6(d) under the powers, duties and functions of the 
minister.
<P>
	I would urge the minister to consider a better treatment of the 
concept of sustainable development. In this bill it comes after 
the minister's duty of co-ordinating, promoting and 
recommending certain policies with respect to natural resources 
and explosives. It comes after assisting in the development and 
promotion of Canadian scientific and technological capabilities. 
It comes after participating in the development and application 
of codes and standards. It finally appears as the fourth item. It is 
in clause 6(d) in having regard to the integrated management of 
Canada's natural resources. That is where we find sustainable 
development.
<P>
	I urge the minister, the parliamentary secretary and the 
committee to take a page from Bill C-46, the bill to establish the 
Department of Industry which we debated yesterday. Look at 
clause 5 of that bill where the concept of sustainable 
development is outlined in the first part under the powers 
exercised by the minister. It says that the minister shall exercise 
the powers and perform the duties and functions in a manner that 
will promote sustainable development. It comes as the number 
one overall consideration.
<P>
	It would make sense because in clause 2 of Bill C-48 there is a 
very good definition of sustainable development. Actually, it is 
the word for word definition given in the 1987 Brundtland 
report. We applaud the minister and the government for having 
done so. This definition has become the turning point in our way 
of thinking, in our way of placing the environment and the 
economy in a new context.
<P>
	Therefore it would make sense that in a bill of such 
importance relating to our natural resources that sustainable 
development would not rank as an afterthought in the fourth 
clause dealing with the powers of the minister. It should be 
elevated to the first and stand on its own without any reference 
to words like integrated management, the meaning of which we 
really do not know. There is no definition of integrated 
management in clause 2 but there is a definition of sustainable 
development. In that sense it is hoped that a suitable amendment 
will be moved in committee and the matter resolved along these 
lines.
<P>
	What does sustainable development mean? It is important that 
we enter into this debate with some principles on what will be 
guiding future ministers and officials over the next 10 or 20 
years when they apply this legislation.
<P>
	Reduced to its basic elements, sustainable development is a 
concept that stresses the importance of integrating the economy 
with the environment. It means that when we pursue growth, we 
pursue it with environmental, economic, social and even 
cultural concerns in mind. That is what sustainable development 
is intended to imply.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	From that general concept we would want to know what are 
the principles which come under that general heading. How 
should we be guided in the management of our resources when 
we say: ``We accept the concept of sustainable development; it 
is in the act. We have a general definition. Now what does it 
really mean? Could you tell us?''
<P>
	In search of these elements the first principle would be to 
integrate the economy with the environment and make those 
goals convergent rather than in conflict. They can be convergent 
and mutually reinforcing rather than in conflict.
<P>
	Also, it would require applying accounting practices that 
would indicate to the nation that when we cut down a forest or 
when we fish, in other words when we reduce our stock of 
natural resources, that shows up in our national accounts as a 
loss and not just as a revenue. While there is definitely a revenue 
when a forest is cut down, that asset is gone for the next 95 or 
110 years. Therefore, we must know of the loss in our national 
accounting of that asset. This form of accounting is badly 
needed.
<P>
	Another principle that could be adopted is to ensure that the 
stock of natural resources is not drawn down from the present 
acceptable and desirable levels. The stock of our natural 
resources should not only be maintained but also improved. Its 
quality should also be improved wherever possible. This is not 
just for us and our requirements but for future generations. It is 
this preoccupation with the long term, this preoccupation with 
the years 2050 or 3000 which makes the concept of  sustainable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6236"> 6236 </A></B>
<P>
development so important and so politically attractive. It looks 
at the long term, the future.
<P>
	Another principle is an operative one. In the application of 
this act everything within the power of the minister should be 
done to prevent climate change. Why? Because we know that 
climate change means also a change in our natural resources. It 
would mean a change in the location of agriculture. It would 
probably mean a shift toward the north of our forests. It could 
have a profound effect on our fisheries. It impacts on our natural 
resources. I cannot think of another principle as important for 
the Minister of Natural Resources than that of preventing 
climate change.
<P>
	If we look at the policies of today, it is legitimate to ask 
ourselves: Are our energy policies sustainable? If we look at the 
way we spend our public funds in terms of energy, we find that 
for every dollar the Government of Canada spends to promote 
energy efficiency, it spends over $100 in support of the fossil 
fuel industry. This support increases pollution and supports 
dependence on non-renewable resources. This support has a 
negative impact on climate change.
<P>
	If we look at the 1990 accounts, the latest for which figures 
are available, what do we find? We find that the value of tax 
deductions by the oil and gas industry in Canada amounted to 
some $5.8 billion. With these deductions the government lost 
some $1.2 billion in revenue. The current expenditures by the 
Government of Canada to the energy sector are close to $700 
million. Of that amount only 5 per cent goes to research and 
development on alternative energy sources.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I do not need to stress the importance of research and 
development in alternative energy sources and the importance 
of changing our dependence in energy from non-renewable to 
renewable sources. Everybody knows that.
<P>
	That means that under this act and the new minister's 
commitment to sustainable development it is desirable to have a 
profound shift in the department's budget. It should move 
rapidly from a budget on which the emphasis is on 
non-renewable to renewable sources of energy and should move 
more rapidly to the implementation of policies that reinforce 
and accelerate the movement toward more efficient use of 
energy.
<P>
	I am not talking of a carbon tax, although we all know that one 
day the concept of a carbon tax will have to be tackled if we are 
serious about the question of climate change. However, the 
political moment has not yet arrived.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Thank god.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Well, that may be an expression of relief for the 
present, but the chickens are coming home to roost sooner or 
later and we will have to cross that bridge at the proper time.
<P>
	Moving into forestry, we can ask ourselves: Are our forest 
policies sustainable? This is a sector in which we must apply the 
concept of sustainability. There is a considerable debate in 
Canada on what constitutes a forest and a sustainable forestry. Is 
the volume of forest really the best indicator of the state of our 
forest resources, one can ask. Does increasing the cubic metre 
figures make up for loss of forest and species diversity? Is 
volume really the only criterion we should be examining? Or 
does the loss of area of old growth forest not represent an 
important factor if we think of future generations, if we think of 
biodiversity?
<P>
	All of us know that one tree does not make a forest, of course. 
Today many Canadians and many regions of the world are 
undertaking alternative and sustainable forestry practices. In 
that respect British Columbia is a fascinating example of new 
ideas. All of us know there are alternatives to large cuts which 
destroy forests. There are much better alternatives to clear 
cutting. There are alternatives which would permit the 
protection of wildlife habitat. There are alternatives which 
would permit the retention of biodiversity.
<P>
	Perhaps this is not the time nor the place to open the debate on 
clear cuts, especially when one has only 20 minutes. However, 
we know that our past performance with clear cuts has earned us 
a very bad reputation abroad.
<P>
	If the purpose of the new department as it is spelled out in 
clause 6(f) on page 3 is to participate ``in the enhancement and 
promotion of market access for Canada's natural resources 
products and technical surveys industries, both domestically 
and internationally'' then we must pay very close attention to 
our forest practices. Those practices are being watched from 
abroad and our future export opportunities in forest products 
hinges on them.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	In that respect, I would like to pay homage to the forestry code 
introduced last spring I believe by the Government of British 
Columbia. I want to express the hope that this forestry code will 
not only be given the necessary regulations soon but also the 
necessary funds to be enforced effectively because it is through 
measures of that kind that we can establish for Canada a good 
reputation abroad with respect to forestry practices.
<P>
	We can also ask ourselves what is the role of the forest 
services of Canada. Is it one to perform only scientific research? 
Is it one to look for industrial opportunities only? Is it one that is 
also to give guidance and leadership in forest practices for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6237"> 6237 </A></B>
<P>
rest of the nation? Suddenly after all these years the time has 
come to examine the mandate of forestry Canada and to 
determine whether it  is still adequate in a changing world as we 
approach the 21st century.
<P>
	Moving on to mining, we can also ask ourselves whether our 
mining practices are sustainable. Obviously this matter needs to 
be given some close attention. It seems to me that instead of 
having policies that encourage our production and consumption, 
our policies should be focused on resource reduction, the 
development of new materials and greater momentum to 
recycling so that the results will be in decreased mining 
activities, mining wastes, water consumption, pollution, 
deforestation and erosion.
<P>
	In this respect, in recent years the car industry in particular 
has made enormous progress with new materials and in general 
Canadian industry has made considerable progress, although not 
as good as other nations, in achieving energy efficiency in the 
consumption of energy per unit of production. We have come a 
considerable distance but we still have a long way to go if we 
want to emulate and do as well as Japan and other OECD 
countries. Compared with those countries we are not doing as 
well.
<P>
	Having attempted to set out some principles that could guide 
us in the management of our natural resources and in the 
implementation of this bill once it is proclaimed, the 
Department of Natural Resources has a very important role to 
play. It would be desirable if it were to apply principles and 
practices that are sustainable and that apply the concept of 
sustainability for the long term.
<P>
	We are, after the Rio conference of 1992, coming around the 
corner in an effort to ensuring that we have a sustainable 
development that takes into account the economy and the 
environment. We must make sure that this agreement by the 
global community which took place in Rio de Janeiro two years 
ago is implemented and brought into the legislatures of this 
country.
<P>
	I will conclude by again congratulating the minister for 
having introduced this bill. It is of paramount importance. It is 
good to see that the concept of sustainable development has 
somehow found its way into it but it must be given greater 
prominence; actually, it should be given primacy. Once that is 
done important principles of the application of that concept will 
need to be fleshed out so as to give direction to the department in 
the decades ahead.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to 
questions and comments I would like to remind all hon. 
members that as mentioned this morning Private Members' 
Business will be delayed by 20 minutes due to minister's 
statements. Proceedings on Private Members' Business will 
therefore commence at 5.50 p.m. this evening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to recognize the hon. member opposite, the member for 
Davenport. I recognize his very longstanding, very real 
commitment to the environment and to sustainable 
development. This is not a recent conversion. This is as we know 
a very real, longstanding and very genuine commitment to 
conservation.
<P>
	Given the position of stature of the member opposite within 
his own caucus and given the gravity of the consideration of 
fossil fuels to that part of the country that I represent, I would 
like to ask the member to respond to this question specifically.
<P>
	Would the member recommend an immediate tax on fossil 
fuels to ensure conservation and to induce consumers to shift 
away from fossil fuels? Because of his influence within his own 
caucus, if the hon. member for Davenport had his way today 
would we have a tax on fossil fuel to conserve energy and to 
induce people to switch to other fuels tomorrow?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member for Davenport were 
on an ego trip he would certainly want to tackle this question 
fully and give a very comprehensive answer.
<P>
	We do already have taxes on fossil fuels. Every time we buy 
gasoline at the pump we pay some hefty provincial and federal 
taxes; those taxes already exist.
<P>
	If the thrust of the question of the hon. member is whether I 
would recommend policies related to the introduction of a 
carbon tax then we are talking of something completely 
different. A tax on gasoline or on coal or on gas as I said exists 
already and it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. An 
additional tax would not be a carbon tax. It would be a fake 
carbon tax. It would be more of the same. It would be nothing 
new.
<P>
	A carbon tax is a massive change from the present system of 
taxation that we have on income and labour and investment and 
flow of capital to a system of taxation that would be taxing 
consumption and mainly anything that relates to consumption of 
fossil fuels.
<P>
	It is an enormous political somersault, if I may use that term. 
It would be a big step for which we are not ready and so since we 
are all more or less realists, and in my caucus I do not have the 
reputation of being a great realist but I still have my feet on the 
ground, to recommend a carbon tax would be asking for 
something for which we are not equipped politically or 
otherwise.
<P>
	Sooner or later we will have to cross that bridge if the trend 
identified by scientists continues. These are not Marxist or 
left-wing scientists, these are meteorologists at the United 
Kingdom University of East Anglia, for instance, who have 
recently produced a map indicating that over the last 30 years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6238"> 6238 </A></B>
<P>
there has been a change in annual temperatures. There has been a 
change in average winter temperatures.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I would be glad to show the hon. member a map to that effect, 
which in essence shows that the increase in average 
temperatures that has taken place over the last 30 years shows a 
considerable warming in certain parts of the world.
<P>
	This warming has led to the melting of the Arctic and 
Antarctic caps. This melting has produced a certain flow of cold 
water into the northwest Atlantic and some other oceans, which 
could be an explanation for the fact that certain fisheries have 
disappeared.
<P>
	I am saying that if this trend continues and we have over the 
next 30 years another +1.5C as an average increase-thus 
amounting to +3C-we will be in for some big problems because 
the water levels of our coastal cities will be higher. We will have 
to do some basic coastal public works.
<P>
	The livelihood and the survival of millions of people in 
certain parts of the Pacific where the islands rise only a metre or 
a metre and a half above sea level will be in serious danger. 
Scientists are speaking about the flooding of some one-quarter 
of Bangladesh.
<P>
	We will see the movement toward the north of agriculture and 
of forests. In other words, we will have a completely different 
set of natural resources and of problems resulting from that. It 
may be for the next generation of politicians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for Davenport for his comments regarding sustainable 
development. The member talked about the important need for 
sustainable development, particularly in the industry of 
forestry.
<P>
	I wonder if he would consider that one of our most important 
natural resources we have in this country is our resource of top 
soil for farming. Top soil gives us the ability to produce food but 
is being eroded at an alarming rate.
<P>
	Since the beginning of organized agriculture on the great 
plains we have lost about one-half of our top soil. Yet we have 
government farm policies that encourage this practice to 
continue. Where would the hon. member rate this in his overall 
scheme of sustainable development?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be treated as an expert 
when you are not one. Coming from the great agricultural riding 
of Davenport, one would perhaps expect more from me. The 
most important natural resource we have is the human resource 
in this country. We all agree on that.
<P>
	Whether top soil for farming should be the next one-it may 
be so-I do not know. I know that the Senate in 1983, 
particularly Senator Sparrow, produced a very interesting report 
on the losses in top soil. That report has been languishing since 
1984. He even went so far as quantifying the yearly losses in 
dollars in top soil, which was a unique feat by our historical 
standards.
<P>
	I should urge the hon. member to get a copy of Senator 
Sparrow's report and perhaps ask questions of the minister 
tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-48 has been described by many as a housekeeping bill, to 
combine the federal Department of Forestry with the 
Department of Energy, Mines and Resources.
<P>
	In my opinion Bill C-48 is far more than that. Today I want to 
begin by praising Bill C-48 while also raising a few concerns. 
First, I wish to praise the government for continuing with this 
integration started by the former government, both from a 
standpoint of tax dollars saved and new understandings included 
in Bill C-48. From a recent departmental briefing I see that this 
amalgamation is expected to save something in the range of $41 
million over a four-year period starting in 1994-95 primarily 
through streamlining at the corporate level, including such 
things as putting together financial services and human 
resources of what formerly were two cabinet level departments.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The jobs of the rank and file public service generally were 
spared the axe although the downsizing did remove a cabinet 
minister and three assistant deputy ministers.
<P>
	The preservation of those other jobs is perhaps due to the fact 
that the Canadian Forest Services-and I would like to comment 
on the forest services here-is already one of the most 
decentralized of all in the federal government with some 90 per 
cent of the people not in Ottawa.
<P>
	Another reason for praising this legislation is the new 
understanding presented by Bill C-48 of what principles and 
methods should be used to manage the nation's natural 
resources. For example under ``interpretation'', Bill C-48 
defines sustainable development as ``development that meets 
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs''.
<P>
	The bill's list of the minister's duties in clause 6, items (d), 
(e), and (f) are as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister shall:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) have regard to the integrated management and sustainable development of 
Canada's natural resources;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) Seek to enhance the responsible development and use of Canada's natural 
resources and the competitiveness of Canada's natural resources products;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6239"> 6239 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(f) participate in the enhancement and promotion of market access for Canada's 
natural resource products and technical surveys industries, both domestically and 
internationally;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Although day to day management of natural resources falls 
under provincial jurisdictions these directives in Bill C-48 
should lay to rest many longstanding public concerns that the 
federal government might either encourage the so-called rape 
and destruction of our natural resources on the one hand or 
collapse before extremists advocating only recreational and 
tourist use of natural resources on the other hand.
<P>
	The legislation makes clear that the minister must have regard 
for integrated management and sustainable development. That 
is good for everybody.
<P>
	Another reason to praise Bill C-48 is that it will help 
counteract an unfortunate tendency by some people to speak of 
our natural resource industries as though they were so-called 
sunset industries, as though their time had somehow come and 
passed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	The role of science and technology in the Department of 
Natural Resources is widespread with the scientific 
establishments at numerous sites from Victoria to Resolute Bay 
to St. John's as part of a science and technology budget at 
Natural Resources Canada in the order of $432 million projected 
for 1994-95.
<P>
	Among the minister's duties are that the minister shall, and I 
quote clause 6, sections (b), (c) and (i):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) assist in the development and promotion of Canadian scientific and 
technological capabilities;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) participate in the development and application of codes and standards for 
technical surveys and natural resources products and for the management and use of 
natural resources;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) gather, compile, analyse, co-ordinate and disseminate information respecting 
scientific, technological, economic, industrial, managerial, marketing and related 
activities and developments affecting Canada's natural resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another indicator that our natural resource industries are 
continually elevating in addition to the specific growth in 
science and technology is the modernization of their insights, 
their principles and the managerial techniques as the world 
moves toward sustainable development, in part pushed by the 
new wave of green consumerism.
<P>
	As a prime example of such integrated resource management 
the federal government has been a major participant in the 
Whitehorse mining initiative whose report presented September 
13 included a set of more than 150 recommendations in light of 
16 principles and 70 goals voiced by more than 140 individual 
participants in the process.
<P>
	For all these reasons I applaud the government for uniting 
these departments into one through Bill C-48. However, I also 
want to voice some concerns.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-48 helps to spell out the federal role and relationship 
with provincial jurisdiction over forestry and mining. Despite 
much talk about the so-called new economy, the $40 billion 
forest industry remains number one in Canada, providing some 
777,000 jobs or one in every 16 in 1993 with approximately 350 
Canadian communities dependent on forestry for their financial 
existence. It also adds a $19 billion contribution to Canada's net 
balance of trade, by far the largest of any industry in Canada.
<P>
	Although the mining industry has been hard hit in recent 
years, there are some 150 communities across Canada that 
depend on mining and mining related activities. This 
contributes 4 per cent of our GDP, 17 per cent of our exports and 
a net $11 billion surplus to our balance of payments as well as 
being the source of 60 per cent of rail freight and 55 per cent of 
port traffic. Directly and indirectly, mining provides some 
300,000 jobs.
<P>
	Clearly, forestry and mining are two of the most essential 
contributors to our national economic health. Therefore I would 
have preferred to see clause 7 of Bill C-48 say that the minister 
shall co-operate with the provinces and municipalities rather 
than may as it now does. These economic sectors are simply too 
important for us to tolerate government duplications or 
squabbles regarding jurisdiction. As a Reformer I am especially 
concerned that there should be as little overlap as possible 
between the levels of government and that no activity be 
undertaken by the federal level if the provincial level can handle 
it.
<P>
	I also have questions on clause 35, subclauses 7 and 8, which 
detail other things the minister may do.
<P>
	Subclause 7 says that the Minister of Natural Resources may 
make grants and contributions and, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, provide other forms of financial 
assistance. I am told that Parliament can exert control here by 
simply refusing to appropriate money to the minister for such 
purposes. But once the funds are voted, the minister does not 
even need to consult with cabinet before making grants and 
contributions.
<P>
	I believe Bill C-48 should have included some procedure to 
build into the granting process public accountability and 
transparency as well as requiring at the minimum consultation 
with cabinet.
<P>
	Subclause 8 provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The Minister may co-ordinate logistics support and provide related 
assistance for the purposes of advancing scientific knowledge of the Arctic 
region and contributing to the exercise of Canada's sovereignty in that region 
and its adjacent waters.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Minister may</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) make grants and contributions; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6240"> 6240 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) make recoverable expenditures on behalf of any other department, branch or 
agency of the Government of Canada or a province or any university, organization 
or person in respect of its share of the cost of any logistics support or related 
assistance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have the same concerns as mentioned above about the 
authority for grants but I would would like to ask some 
additional questions.
<P>
	First, is this Bill C-48 the appropriate place to authorize a 
minister regarding contributing to the existence of Canada's 
sovereignty in the Arctic? If there is doubt regarding Canada's 
sovereignty in that region, it seems that a so-called 
housekeeping bill on natural resources is at best an 
inappropriate place to bolster such authority.
<P>
	Second, in view of the tradition that natural resources north of 
60 degrees latitude fall under the jurisdiction of the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, why is the Minister 
of Natural Resources given this twin function of asserting 
Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic and authorization to recover 
costs from groups performing exploration or research, maybe 
filming a movie or leading a tour group?
<P>
	I look forward to hearing the government's explanations for 
what look to me to be shortcomings in a bill which otherwise 
deserves the praise and support of the House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, in listening 
to the hon. member's intervention, I was wondering about his 
thoughts on the future of Canada's forests since he comes from 
an area where the forests are so well managed and where an 
experiment was carried out by the Vernon provincial district in 
the marketing of lumber.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, until 1985 the forestry department 
was part of the Environment Canada department. It was put in 
that department because it was felt that forestry seen from an 
environmental perspective is managed with concerns also for 
wildlife, water and biodiversity considerations. That holistic 
approach was valid then as it is today.
<P>
	Would the hon. member favour a move whereby the 
department of forests would again become part of Environment 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take 
what little time is left to congratulate the minister on this bill. I 
hardly think that it is merely housekeeping. By defining 
sustainable development in accordance with the Brundtland 
report and by putting it into the part of the bill under the clause 
which says ``the minister shall'', it has given this principle of 
sustainable development some validity. The other aspects of the 
minister's duties should be considered in light of that statement. 
I want to refer to one or two of them. Subclause 6(c) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister shall participate in the development and application of codes and 
standards for technical surveys and natural resources products and for the 
management and use of natural resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subclause (d) as we have noted and as my hon. colleague from 
Davenport pointed out so well states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Having regard to the integrated management and sustainable development of 
Canada's natural resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subclause (c) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To seek to enhance the responsible development and use of Canada's natural 
resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It seems to me that it makes it pretty clear that the minister has 
a twofold purpose and that they must be integrated. Further in 
the bill we get to subclause 3(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The minister may enter into agreements with the government of any province 
or with any person for forest protection and management or forest utilization and 
for the conduct of research related thereunto or for forestry publicity or 
education.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It seems to me that this allows the minister considerable 
leeway in assisting all Canadians who desire to preserve or 
enhance or continue our natural resources to be accommodated.
<P>
	Personally, 24 years ago I entered into an agreement with the 
province of Ontario, the Ministry of Natural Resources, under 
its Woodland Improvement Act and established forest on my 
property. It was a joint venture. I must say it is a pleasure to walk 
through those trees now, 24 years later.
<P>
	The minister is also empowered to collect and publish 
statistics for the mineral explorations development and 
production of the mining and metallurgical industries of 
Canada. The words `exploration and development' have been 
added. I think that suggests that the minister has some 
responsibility for not only maintaining that industry but for 
maintaining it in a sustainable way.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect to some of the comments of my hon. colleague 
opposite, I find in clause 6 that the minister must co-operate 
with persons conducting applied and basic research programs 
and investigations. I have had concerns for some time that much 
of our research money tends to go to applied research and not 
basic research. We need to pay some attention to basic research.
<P>
	My colleague from Davenport talked about biodiversity, old 
growth forests and some of these rather intangible and not fully 
understood benefits of the conservation of our natural resources. 
I notice that again in clause 6(b) the minister can keep under 
review and consider recommendations with respect to 
transportation, distribution, sale, purchase, exchange and with 
respect to matters relating to the sources of these resources 
within 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6241"> 6241 </A></B>
<P>
or outside Canada, which hopefully would mean that disasters 
such as the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> might be prevented in future.
<P>
	In clause 7(1) the minister may formulate plans for the 
conservation, development and use of resources specified in that 
section and for related research. The word related has been 
added and it adds a world of meaning to that clause.
<P>
	I mentioned the woodland improvement act. Our forest 
resources need protection, development and sustainable 
development if we are to continue to be a world leader in these 
things.
<P>
	With respect to a carbon tax I have a few comments. If we 
adopt green accounting in the resource industries, it might serve 
the same purpose. It might put in the hands of the captains of 
industry the kind of techniques, the kind of information that they 
need in order to make the kind of decisions that will continue to 
sustain us in the fields of forestry and mining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the member for Oxford on his speech and the points 
that he raised in his rather brief address. I realize he was trying 
to give other hon. members an opportunity to speak.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a couple of questions. First, what is his 
opinion of the inclusion of a definition of sustainable 
development in the legislation? Second, maybe he could 
confirm the rather strong position taken by the Prime Minister 
with respect to a carbon tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that the definition of 
sustainable development is in the bill. It would be very 
shortsighted at this juncture not to include that definition in the 
bill.
<P>
	If we do not move wholeheartedly in that direction, and I 
mean at this level of government as well as provincially and 
municipally, we are going to be in a bad way.
<P>
	I must apologize, I did not catch the hon. member's second 
question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.50 p.m. the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North)</B> moved that Bill 
C-229, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act (registration 
of political parties), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, first I wish to thank the House for 
allowing me this opportunity to speak on Bill C-229. I also want 
to say that I am a bit disappointed that this bill will only have 
one hour of debate and will not have a chance to be voted on. 
However, that is how the system works and that is what we have 
to live with.
<P>
	Before I speak about the changes I want to apply with Bill 
C-229, I want to briefly describe to members of the House the 
present situation existing in the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	The law reads that if 50 candidates are nominated in any 
region of the country they qualify as a national party. That is a 
very narrow definition of the law. It has to increase in order for 
democracy to work.
<P>
	The changes I would like applied to the act are the following: 
first, to be a national party, that party should be running 
candidates in seven provinces at least. Second, representation 
should be from 50 per cent of the population of Canada. Third, 
50 per cent of the candidates should be from each of the seven 
provinces in order to qualify as a national party.
<P>
	In last October's election we had 15 political parties running 
for office. At the top of the list were the two national parties, the 
Conservatives and the Liberals who had 295 candidates 
nominated, next were the NDP, followed by the Natural Law 
Party of Canada which nominated 231 candidates, and the 
lowest party was the Marxist-Leninist Party which nominated 
51 candidates.
<P>
	Some people will argue that Bill C-229 restricts Canadians 
from practising their right to become a candidate or to form a 
political party. This is far from being true. In effect, what this 
bill does is it allows people in all regions of the country to 
participate in the change. For example let us take one of the 
principles of this bill. It states that the party must run 50 per cent 
of its candidates in seven provinces in accordance to population.
<P>
	Today in the House we have an opposition party that ran 75 
candidates in only one province. Out of the 75 candidates it won 
54 seats and became the official opposition. By tradition the 
official opposition is the government in waiting and the leader 
of the official opposition is to be the Prime Minister in waiting. 
Can you imagine this country and this House which has a 
political party whose sole purpose is to break up this country and 
a Prime Minister in waiting whose sole purpose is to implement 
that break-up? That is not democracy.
<P>
	I live in Ontario. I am the member for Don Valley North. 
People in Don Valley North never had a chance to vote on who 
the opposition is in this House. That is not democracy. We in 
Ontario have the right to decide, as much as the people in 
Quebec have the right to decide, who will be the opposition 
party. People in B.C. have the same right as do the people on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6242"> 6242 </A></B>
<P>
east coast. The way it is, this right is denied to the citizens of 
this land.
<P>
	Two opposition parties is the way it is today. One of them is 
headquartered in Quebec City claiming to be a national party. 
The other party is headquartered in Calgary again claiming to be 
a national party. If a national party is to be in this House of 
Commons, their headquarters should be located in the nation's 
capital in order to facilitate their activities.
<P>
	Seventy-five per cent of Canadians did not participate in 
choosing this opposition party. It is only fair that we would also 
be asked. Twenty-five per cent of the population in this case 
should not decide the opposition party of this House.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	When I was campaigning in the 1993 election campaign I saw 
a big sign, 4 by 8, in front of the Reform Party candidate's 
headquarters which said: ``We will run the country the way we 
run the campaign''. The Reform Party ran the campaign without 
Quebec.
<P>
	I am very happy that Reformers are thinking of expanding into 
Quebec. This is very good and I commend them for it. I also 
hope that with the changes I am proposing in this bill the Bloc 
Quebecois will have a chance to run candidates in other 
provinces, in other regions, next time around. I am sure they are 
going to be here and I hope to be here so we can have 
constructive discussion about the future of our country.
<P>
	I return to the point I made about the 15 political parties that 
ran in this election. One of the benefits of being a national party 
is that you get reimbursement from the federal government.
<P>
	For example the Conservative Party spent $10,398,101. They 
received $2,339,752.72. The Canada Party had the lowest 
expenditures in the last election campaign and had 56 
candidates. They spent $172.72.
<P>
	Surely today's opposition party spent more than $172. Surely 
it can spend more than that in order to have a proper opposition, 
a good opposition in this House, so the system can work and 
function.
<P>
	Without implementing these changes I think we will lose the 
unity of this country.
<P>
	I want to conclude my remarks for the time being, but pick up 
again toward the end. If we intend to have strong central 
government we have to change the law in order to achieve it. 
When we change the law we can achieve a united, indivisible 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-229, which would amend the Canada 
Elections Act with respect to registration of political parties.
<P>
	This bill, which would oblige a political party to put forward 
candidates in a minimum of seven Canadian provinces that 
have, in the aggregate, 50 per cent of the population of all the 
provinces, is, in our opinion, undemocratic and contrary to one 
of the provisions of the Parliament of Canada Act.
<P>
	The least that can be said about Bill C-229, introduced by the 
hon. member for Don Valley North, is that it targets the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party, among others. In our opinion, 
it is an insult to democracy, as it denies Quebec, a distinct 
society, the right to its own representatives in the House of 
Commons. It must be pointed out that the people of Quebec are 
true believers in democracy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Don Valley North, in introducing such a 
bill, shows a very poor knowledge indeed of the Canadian 
political scene and of its diversity. The social, economic and 
cultural make-up of Toronto, where the member hails from, 
does not apply to every part of Canada, to Quebec in particular. 
It must be pointed out that Quebecers do not, any longer, feel 
comfortable with the old national parties, the Conservative 
Party and the Liberal Party, whose policies always sought to 
champion the interests and pursue the objectives of a mythical 
Canadian nation, with a total disregard for regional specificity.
<P>
	Quebec chose to be represented by the Bloc Quebecois, and it 
is certainly not a member from the Toronto region who is going 
to stand in the way of the political representation of one fifth of 
the citizens and taxpayers of Canada in the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	This bill is completely inconsistent and does not respect 
Canadian political tradition. Since the passage of the new 
Canada Elections Act in 1970, there has been provision for the 
registration of political parties. However, the multi-party 
system appeared in Canada well before then. As early as 1920, 
members of other parties began to be elected to the House of 
Commons in sufficient numbers and with sufficient support and 
credibility to influence the system.
<P>
	I would remind the members that, in the 1930s, Social Credit 
and the Commonwealth Co-operative Federation represented 
very special interests, with demands and hopes that were not at 
all national in scope. They were movements formed by Western 
producers to protest the excessive taxation authority of a highly 
centralizing federal government. None of them were 
represented in seven provinces or by a total of 50 per cent of the 
population of Canada. This is an important point to remember.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6243"> 6243 </A></B>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, these movements, which evolved into 
political parties, became important elements in Canadian party 
politics, hence the inconsistency and irrelevance of Bill C-229.
<P>
	In the past, a number of political parties that sprang up on the 
Canadian scene were limited to a single province. Why then, 
today, is there a wish to take extreme action and amend the 
Canada Elections Act, except to stop the democratically elected 
Bloc Quebecois from demonstrating its repudiation of the old 
national parties and thus seeking to attain political autonomy. 
Nothing in the existing elections act mentions the need for a 
political party to nominate candidates in more than seven 
provinces to qualify for registration.
<P>
	The act mentions only that in order to be registered and thus 
officially recognized nationally, a party must nominate more 
than 50 candidates, whether in one province or in the whole 
country, for the purposes of consistency, credibility and 
visibility.
<P>
	This bill is a flagrant contradiction of the Parliament of 
Canada Act regarding the official status of political parties in 
the House. May I remind the member for Don Valley North that 
there is a rule whereby a political party must have at least 12 
members elected to be recognized in this House.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the hon. member: How is it possible to 
recognize, in the House of Commons, a party which might not 
even be registered at the next general election? Even if the 
Elections Act requires that a given party nominate at least fifty 
candidates to be registered-which increases the probability of 
it being present in at least seven provinces-we consider that 
Bill C-229 is in net violation of the Parliament of Canada Act 
and the Canada Elections Act. In 1990, although the House had 
by then 295 seats, 12 members were still enough to be 
recognized as a party. The New Democratic Party's current 
status is a case in point: it wanted to be recognized, but it failed.
<P>
	Let us be clear, the inclusion of such provisions in the 
Elections Act would mean the end of the multiparty system 
within the Canadian electoral system and the emergence of a 
``one-way'' political system in which two parties, largely 
dominated by two parliamentary executives, would alternate 
serving the same interests and the same vision of a highly 
centralized Canada.
<P>
	I should add that this bill lends credence to the argument that 
Canadian diversity is just a myth and that the distinctiveness of 
the Quebec society is gradually eroding. This is what we read 
recently in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. That editorial said that Canadian 
society was one of the most homogeneous in the world. This is 
not what was reflected in the results of the last general election. 
In fact, the real myth is the notion of Canadian nationhood; to 
believe that one day there will be only one culture from coast to 
coast is ludicrous.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	We could say that somehow the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois are the political arm of Quebec's culture, fighting to 
protect its originality and distinctiveness.
<P>
	We believe that Bill C-229 introduced by the member for Don 
Valley North is a sham since it does not take into account 
cultural diversity or the legitimate position of the party forming 
the Official Opposition. I will remind you, Mr. Speaker, that as 
the opposition we have behaved in a responsible manner and 
according to parliamentary rules. We have dealt with issues of 
interest to Quebec and Canada and used question period with 
efficiency and respect, no matter the issue. We have proven to be 
efficient, transparent and respectful of fundamental democratic 
principles.
<P>
	Therefore, we strongly denounce the bill introduced by the 
member for Don Valley North as being undemocratic in its very 
intent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
those who are watching the parliamentary channel instead of 
<I>Wheel of Fortune</I> or <I>Jeopardy</I>, the purpose of this private 
member's bill is to change the Canada Elections Act so that a 
party can only be a legitimate registered party here in Canada if 
it is running candidates in at least seven of the ten provinces, one 
of which has to be either Quebec or Ontario.
<P>
	Of course, the purpose of this bill is very clear, and that is to 
knock the Bloc. I suppose there would be a lot of Canadians who 
would have a sneaking sympathy for the intent behind this bill. 
A lot of Canadians I have talked to, a lot of Canadians all of us 
have talked to are pretty ticked that we have in this House, 
making laws for our country, deciding or helping to decide how 
our money is spent, shaping the future of our country, a group of 
people essentially intent on the destruction of Canada as we 
know it.
<P>
	A lot of people are asking is there not a way we can stop this. 
They are particularly exercised, particularly angry, when a 
group of people in this House who call themselves Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition have interests in mind, have an 
agenda in mind, which again is adverse to the interests of the 
national unity of our country.
<P>
	A lot of Canadians would sympathize with the member for 
Don Valley West and the intent behind this bill to try to stop 
regional parties from forming and coming forward.
<P>
	Sometimes the cure is a lot worse than the disease. Although 
the disease is bad, this cure is a whole lot worse. It is kind of like 
those ancient dragons. You cut off one head but two worse heads, 
more fierce with larger teeth, spring up in its place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6244"> 6244 </A></B>
<P>
	What this bill really does is abrogate a lot of democratic rights 
in this country. Canadians should be aware that the reason a 
party has to run 50 candidates somewhere in order to be 
registered as a party is really designed to make sure that 
taxpayers' money is not totally and frivolously spent. What 
happens, as most of us know, is if a candidate is successful half 
the candidate's election expenses are returned to them courtesy 
of the taxpayer. A lot of people think that is an abuse of 
taxpayers' money but it would be a lot more of an abuse if 
anybody could run and expect to have half their expenses paid 
by the rest of society.
<P>
	The law was designed so that there had to be at least some 
threshold of support for a group or a party before they could 
expect to receive some funding from the taxpayer. That is the 
real reason why the present act says that a party must run 50 
candidates somewhere in Canada in order to qualify as a 
registered party.
<P>
	The law was not designed to limit the right to association of 
Canadians and limit the right of Canadians to get together for 
purposes of political activity.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest that it is very important that we not limit the 
right of Canadians, not make it more difficult, not put onerous 
requirements on Canadians who want to participate in the 
political process. This is a subject that obviously is very near 
and dear to my heart because for the last seven years of my 
young life I have spent building a new political dynamic to 
inject into a hidebound and reactionary system. We need change 
sometimes in democratic society and democratic politics.
<P>
	That change usually starts small. It starts with a vision and 
support for it grows. It does not sort of arrive full blown from the 
soil. I am here to tell members that because I have participated 
in that kind of exercise.
<P>
	If we insist that a political movement, a political dynamic, 
only has legitimacy if somehow it has instant support so that it 
can have registered candidates right across the country, and lots 
of them, it simply is going to limit the change, the newness and 
the renewal that we allow in our political system which is very 
unacceptable in a democracy.
<P>
	The hon. member for Don Valley North when he spoke made 
two statements that I take very grave exception to. First of all, as 
a westerner I am absolutely outraged that he would say that you 
are only legitimate as a political party if you have an office in 
Ontario.
<P>
	Somehow the arrogance of certain assumptions just 
overwhelms me. To say that only something rooted in Ontario 
has legitimacy in our political system is outrageous. I would 
suggest to the hon. member that the political renewal that has its 
base in western Canada is every bit as useful to this country, is 
every bit as positive a dynamic in our political system as a 
political party that has its roots in Newfoundland, Montreal or in 
Yukon. It does not matter where your head office is, it matters 
where your head is and that is the important thing.
<P>
	I also take exception to the continual distortion by members 
opposite of the Reform Party and its policies. Here is another 
example that we just heard a few minutes ago. The member for 
Don Valley West said that the Reform Party signs during the 
election campaign said this we will run the country the way we 
run our campaign. Then he went on to say since we ran our 
campaign without candidates in Quebec, obviously we would 
run the country without Quebec.
<P>
	What an abuse, what a distortion of what Reform really said. 
For the record, the Reform signs said, and I hope everyone is 
listening, that we will run the country the way we run our 
campaign, debt free. I challenge the member to indicate whether 
his party ran the campaign debt free. We sure know it is not 
running the country debt free. It is running this country into debt 
$110 million every single day. To it, success is placing a debt on 
our shoulders of another at least $100 billion in its term of 
office.
<P>
	I would like to have less distortion and more facts from the 
other side about what the Reform Party has to offer this country.
<P>
	The real problem in this country is not political parties and 
who they represent and where they have their head offices. The 
real problem in this country is that the status quo, the old 
system, the old thinking, the old way of approaching issues does 
not work for us any more. We need renewal. We need change.
<P>
	What we see in this House with a party which represents only 
one province and whose agenda is to break up this wonderful 
country is not something that should be corrected by 
suppressing legitimate political concern and discontent, but by 
addressing the root of the problem that caused this situation to 
begin with. The root of the problem is that status quo federalism 
does not work. We are faced with an opportunity staring us in the 
face to fix this system, to acknowledge that changes are needed 
for the benefit of all Canadians. It is not just the province 
represented by the members beside us that are discontent with 
the way this country has been run. There are people in all parts of 
the country who are saying we need change.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	We need to serve notice that there has to be an honest debate 
about renewing our federation so that it works better for all of 
us. We do not need bills to suppress legitimate political 
expressions and democratic involvement. We need a 
government that will put ideas on the table to renew the way we 
operate as a country.
<P>
	We need solutions and we need a resolution of this problem, 
not to hide it, not to suppress it, not to make it illegal, not to push 
it under the rug but to say we need change and the kind of 
changes we need.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6245"> 6245 </A></B>
<P>
	We need changes where governments live within their means. 
Not only the province represented by the Bloc but all of us are 
staggering under the load of a huge mortgage on our country 
which is getting bigger every single day. We need a federal 
system that lives within its means, where we pay for our 
programs today and we do not offload our spending on to our 
children. That is what is needed in this country.
<P>
	We need a country where citizens are treated equally 
regardless of race, language and culture or where they have their 
head office. We need a system where all Canadians are treated 
equally. It is very important that we get those kinds of systemic 
changes.
<P>
	I challenge the hon. member not to bring forward bills that 
suppress legitimate democratic participation but really have 
solid proposals to get to the root of the problem, fix the system, 
renew our federation and let us go on together as a country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I support my colleague from Don Valley North 
wholeheartedly in this most welcome legislative initiative, Bill 
C-229, a bill to amend the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	We did not have a mechanism like C-229 in place last 
October. Now we have a situation in this House where the 
Official Opposition party is dedicated to a proposition which 
can tear Canada asunder and whose agenda can monopolize this 
Parliament and eventually paralyse this government.
<P>
	The Bloc members have been given all of the privileges and 
power that go with such a status. This party could 
constitutionally be called upon to govern the entire nation. How 
many nation states no matter how democratic or tolerant would 
accept as their official opposition, even as a legitimate national 
party, a party whose sole purpose is to rupture the country?
<P>
	The answer of course is very few unless they have a collective 
national death wish. Surely it is not too much to ask that any 
party that aspires to represent Canadian citizens in this federal 
Parliament should reach out beyond the narrow parochial 
confines of its regional power base or of its own special 
interests.
<P>
	My voters in Nova Scotia elected me to represent the interests 
of Cumberland-Colchester here in Canada's Parliament. They 
also expect me to bring a perspective to this job that extends far 
beyond the boundaries of my riding. After all, the voters of 
Cumberland-Colchester realize that my salary is paid by all 
taxpaying Canadians and that as their member of Parliament in 
this national capital I also have to serve the larger national 
interests.
<P>
	In 1982 the former member of Parliament for Hull, Mr. 
Gaston Isabelle, with incredible foresight introduced Bill C-661 
that would have required any party to receive registration in 
Canada to nominate at least 50 candidates in a majority of the 
provinces.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill was to, as he put it and I quote: 
``remove any trace of ambiguity as to the national character of 
political parties desiring to operate at the federal level''.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	At second reading in March 1983 Mr. Isabelle noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is easy to understand why a political party, if it wants to operate at the 
national level, should be obliged to field candidates in a majority of the 
provinces, that is in five out of six. These are candidates who will be working on 
the federal scene- Without this obligation, regional or provincial groups, which 
I prefer to qualify as local, will use Parliament as a platform for their own special 
interests.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately Mr. Isabelle's bill disappeared and died inside 
a parliamentary committee and 11 years later what he 
prophesied has come to pass.
<P>
	We have a chance once again to redress the great deficiencies 
he saw over a decade ago in the Canada Elections Act. The Bloc 
Quebecois got its present pre-eminence in this Parliament 
simply because it received 1.8 million votes that were 
distributed across the electoral landscape of Quebec only.
<P>
	It won 54 seats in this Parliament, 54 seats of Quebec's 75, 
and yet the Bloc did not win the majority of the Quebec vote. 
There were over 3.7 million valid ballots cast in Quebec and the 
Bloc won less than 50 per cent, 49.3 per cent in one province 
only, yet they form the official opposition to the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	Compared to other parties in this House, the Reform Party 
received over 2.5 million ballots from Canadians in 9 out of 10 
provinces and yet won two fewer seats. The Progressive 
Conservatives received more than 2.1 million votes across 
Canada yet won only two seats. The Bloc Quebecois based 
solely on the number of seats won has formed the official 
opposition of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	It seems to me that the Bloc's claim to pride of place in the 
opposition benches based solely on the first past the post 
outcome is far from secure in terms of either ideal democratic 
practice or equitable electoral outcome.
<P>
	No, I am not preaching for some kind of proportional 
representation to elect our MPs. Given our expansive geography 
and scattered population it is just not practical. Moreover it has 
been tried in various forms in various places in Canada in the 
past and each time has failed as too exotic a graft on the trunk of 
the Canadian body politic.
<P>
	My daughter who is a master of political science tells me I 
must stress the importance of natural democracy rights. That is 
that we do have rights of the individual to mobilize parties in 
this country and to participate in government.
<P>
	However, we must recognize the fact that Canada is very 
regionally diverse. Extensive country breeds regional political 
parties. At the last election we had 14 or 15 registered political 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6246"> 6246 </A></B>
<P>
parties and our tendency is to divide and distinguish ourselves 
regionally.
<P>
	This is not a trend we should encourage in a national 
Parliament. Yet we have as our official opposition the regional 
party the Bloc Quebecois whose sole purpose in being here is to 
take its one province out of this Canadian family.
<P>
	I believe we should also have the humility as parliamentarians 
to recognize that many of us as individuals got to this place not 
as a result of any sweeping mandate from the voters but, given 
the multi-party nature of Canadian politics, through the grace of 
plurality.
<P>
	During the Liberal sweep of Canada I got 42 per cent of the 
votes cast in Cumberland-Colchester and my next closest 
opponent took 36 per cent. In the Reform heartland a member 
from Calgary had a 44 per cent plurality. The list goes on across 
the country.
<P>
	There are many of us in the same situation. We are not only a 
regionally diverse nation, our electorate is also very diverse. We 
mislead ourselves and do them and this country a disservice 
when we see our constituents as distinct little tribes.
<P>
	There is no such thing as a homogenized Nova Scotian, nor is 
one in Quebec where one size fits all. I take great pride and 
satisfaction in knowing that there is unity, there is oneness in the 
diversity that identifies Canadians.
<P>
	We should recognize our duty as parliamentarians to provide a 
focal point for Canada here in this House. We can best do that by 
ensuring those who enjoy this House's privileges do so as 
members of registered parties who reflect the entire Canadian 
spectrum and not narrow regional interests.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill in no way impedes the right of any member of any 
party to sit in this House now or in the future. What it does 
ensure, however, is that if they want to sit in this House as a 
member of a registered party enjoying the benefits that flow 
from registration their party must nominate candidates in at 
least seven provinces representing an aggregate of 50 per cent of 
the population.
<P>
	That is not an onerous requirement for any party that aspires 
to run this country. As an Atlantic Canadian, I have a vested 
interest in regional special interests. However, I feel that this 
country and Atlantic Canada benefit from a strong national 
government.
<P>
	We are best served by a strong national Parliament and this 
bill is intended to live up to the diversity and the 
multiculturalism of Canada. It is intended to represent the 
national character of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the intended purpose of this bill is to stop single interest parties 
from being established.
<P>
	The manner in which it is written could also stop multiple 
interest regional parties from forming. There is a realistic 
purpose in establishing a restriction on financial assistance in 
the form of a rebate or a portion of the election expenses.
<P>
	However, this restriction now exists by way of a requirement 
to field at least 50 candidates in order to qualify for that election 
expense rebate. On one hand, it is understandable to want to 
prevent the emergence of political parties that advance the 
interests of a single province. This bill, however, is not a very 
democratic way to achieve that goal.
<P>
	Many people have suggested that democracy really only 
exists for about one minute every four years when one enters the 
polling booth. That is not good enough. This country clearly 
does have different regions and from time to time problems in 
those regions give birth to new political movements.
<P>
	Sometimes those regional parties disappear early in their 
existence, such as the Progressive Party. At other times, a party 
such as the Reform Party of Canada which saw its start in a 
region grows to become a contender to form the next 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	I would point out to members that this can also work in 
reverse as we saw in the last election when the Conservative 
Party went from being the government to a non-party status in a 
single election.
<P>
	Forcing political bodies to run in areas where they have no 
interest is more likely to create regional alienation than it is to 
present it. A far better solution would be to create a more 
responsive political system that would tend to address these 
regional problems before they could spawn a new local interest 
party.
<P>
	Consider the problem created by a single issue like fiscal 
responsibility. The have provinces are having their financial 
resources stripped from them to finance irresponsible 
government spending while the have not provinces are getting 
less from the concept of wealth sharing because of that same 
lack of federal financial responsibility.
<P>
	In this case, provinces on either side of the equation could 
spawn a regional party when the real solution should be found in 
a new sense of financial responsibility on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	An issue could be much smaller, like the firearms legislation. 
Ill conceived legislation such as that currently proposed by the 
justice minister could conceivably result in the emergence of a 
group from a particular area wishing to ensure that we focus on 
control of criminals instead of persecution of law-abiding 
citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6247"> 6247 </A></B>
<P>
	A combination of issues could cause problems that might 
cause non-federalists in a particular party or province to form a 
party, such as what happened in Quebec.
<P>
	My discussions with the Bloc Quebecois suggested that its 
biggest issues are the financial ruin of this country and its desire 
not to go down with the ship and the need for a province, the 
Bloc's, to have more say over policies and issues that affect it in 
a different way than it does other provinces.
<P>
	Had the federal government addressed these genuine concerns 
which affect all provinces and the people in them, the Bloc may 
never have emerged. As members can see, it is not hard to create 
an environment in which the emergence of a single interest or 
regional party can happen.
<P>
	There is another aspect to this bill that must also be examined. 
If passed, this bill would tend to ensure that no new parties ever 
got started again.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Given that the emergence of the Reform Party wiped out one 
old line party of the past and threatens to continue the existence 
of the one remaining party of the past, it is not too difficult to see 
the real reason for this bill. That is neither fair nor democratic. 
At any time if the party of the day loses touch with the people it 
is supposed to be serving, the capability of the system to give 
birth to a new political movement to replace outdated ones must 
not be suppressed.
<P>
	There is yet another flaw in the drafting of this bill. The 
requirements for registration of a party include the number of 
provinces in which the party must nominate candidates, seven, 
and the need for those provinces to comprise at least 50 per cent 
of the Canadian population. It would be possible for a party to 
run in Ontario and east, including one of the territories, without 
any representation in any of the four western provinces. If that 
did not create regional alienation I do not know what would.
<P>
	The hon. member from the government side of the House 
would be better to withdraw this bill. He should concentrate 
instead on getting his government to get on with addressing the 
real reasons for regional alienation and general dissatisfaction 
with the way the old line parties of the past have run this country 
into the ground.
<P>
	The governments should deal with the pressing issues of 
runaway spending, out of touch immigration policies, an out of 
control criminal justice system, and social programs that are 
facing financial ruin. If it does not know how to do this, we do, 
and you know who we are. We are the party that started off as a 
regional party and grew to our current national status because 
the other regions were fed up with the old line parties just as the 
west was.
<P>
	If the real needs and desires of the people of Canada were met 
there would be no reason for this bill to be discussed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to pay special tribute to my colleague from Don 
Valley North. I commend him in this House where we have 
members opposite with simplistic answers to some very 
difficult questions.
<P>
	I hear the proposals they put forward, that there is no vision. 
The people of Canada spoke in the last election and they elected 
175 Liberals. They asked us on behalf of all of Canada to come 
forth with a vision.
<P>
	This private member's bill is there specifically to deal with 
the problem that has arisen in this House. Never in the history of 
Canada have we ever had the arrangement where the Leader of 
the Opposition did not want to be Prime Minister of this country.
<P>
	We are reviewing this bill today, a bill that puts forth a 
challenge to our democratic process. However it does not 
challenge the definition of what constitutes a party in a federal 
election and the obligation that party carries to all Canadians.
<P>
	Members opposite may say to be careful of regionalism. I say 
that perhaps we should challenge the definition of a party in a 
federal election. After all the taxpayers carry a heavy burden for 
the election and the benefits the official parties are allowed.
<P>
	Presently the system allocates a spending level for parties 
which directly relates to the number of candidates in the field in 
any given election. If that party spends more than 10 per cent of 
its spending limit it is entitled to 22 per cent return.
<P>
	Should the taxpayers pay for parties which either fail or refuse 
to represent themselves on a national scale? How can we ask the 
entire country to support a party that has no desire to represent 
the views of Canadians from coast to coast? Our Parliament 
assembled here in the House today strives to achieve the best for 
all Canadians, or at least that is how it is supposed to work.
<P>
	It leads us to ask the question: What is an effective 
Parliament? Does an effective Parliament have an opposition 
that fails to effectively scrutinize the government's actions in 
the interests of the majority of Canadians? I would say no, no 
indeed. There is an important role to be played by the opposition 
to any government. The government needs to be asked tough 
questions and be made to answer them.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	However what happens when the questions being asked are 
continually only for the benefit of one interest group and not in 
the interests of all Canadians? In that scenario I do not think the 
Canadian people get a fair bang for their buck.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6248"> 6248 </A></B>
<P>
	In this proposed amendment a party or an individual can 
certainly enter into the political process, which was mentioned a 
minute ago as not being the case. The fact is that they can, but 
they must be obliged to offer up their ideas to a majority of 
Canadians if they wish to be supported by the taxpayers' money 
as well as receive all the benefits of the House of Commons.
<P>
	This bill proposes that if a group applies for party status in an 
election and cannot fulfil the requirements as stipulated under 
the amendment, then that said group cannot enter into the House 
of Commons as an official party and subsequently will not 
receive the rights and privileges normally ascribed to official 
parties. That does not preclude the fact that parties can begin.
<P>
	In summary, we have to ask: Can regional parties be permitted 
to dominate a national Parliament? Can our country remain 
united if the presence of single issue parties grows in size and 
consequently further hinders the chance for effective 
consensus? Finally, can the government continue to afford the 
money it provides through political taxation deductions to those 
parties which fail to provide a national platform?
<P>
	I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak in favour of this 
bill. I believe these are changes that will benefit our national 
process and better the value of government to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rather amazed at some 
of the commentary I have heard today and the great naivety of 
some of the members opposite when they talk about starting off 
with a full-blown political party that can go out and do battle 
from sea yea unto shining sea.
<P>
	I worked for seven years trying to build a party. We started 
with a few hundred members and pulled it up to 120,000. If we 
had the type of legislation that is proposed in this bill, the 
Reform Party would not exist. It is just absolutely impossible. It 
is not physically within the realm of possibility to do this.
<P>
	I am also a little surprised at the rather tenuous grip on 
Canadian history which is held by members opposite. All of the 
parties in this country, save the two old parties, the 
Conservatives and the Liberals, grew out of small beginnings, 
usually because people felt disenfranchised and angry in small 
areas of the country.
<P>
	I could cite first the Progressive Party, which was at one time 
by the way the official opposition here and was founded under 
those principles. There are also the CCF, Social Credit and of 
course Reform. None of this could ever possibly have happened 
if this bill had been in place 40, 50, 60 years ago, depending on 
the particular political movement we are looking at. It is 
absolutely out of the question.
<P>
	Finally, I am sorry that the hon. member for Souris-Moose 
Mountain has left because I did want to comment specifically-
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I want to remind 
colleagues of the practice of not mentioning the absence of 
members. Each one of us recognizes the demands on our time, of 
course, whether here on duty or from interest.
<P>
	Given all the other demands on our time, we do not reflect or 
make mention of the absence of members. I want to make sure 
we are all cognizant of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure you there was no 
pejorative intent. It is just that I wanted to speak to my 
opponent, if you will.
<P>
	One of the justifications for this bill, if I understand correctly, 
is that taxpayers' money is handed out to officially recognized 
political parties and candidates of officially recognized political 
parties.
<P>
	To me, the solution is quite obvious and quite simple. We do 
not kill the democratic process. We do not do away with the 
parties. We do away with the grants. We do not have to use 
federal money to support politicians. Let each support his own. 
Let 10,000 flowers bloom, if you will, but if a political party 
does not have the stature to get people, to give them money to 
pay for their election expenses, then it does not deserve to exist.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Not seeing other members 
wishing to speak there has been an indication from the mover of 
this private member's bill that he wishes to speak. I recognize 
him to close off debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take a few minutes to respond to some of the questions 
and points put forward by the opposition members.
<P>
	First of all, the member from the Bloc Quebecois says the bill 
is not democratic. I do not understand what his definition of 
democracy means. If he means democracy is decided by 25 per 
cent of the population, certainly he is right. Democracy for me 
means the majority of the population.
<P>
	He also accuses this bill of being Draconian. I wonder which 
is more Draconian, the bill itself or the intention of the 
opposition party here today to separate Quebec from Canada. 
The answer is very simple. All you have to do is walk around the 
country and find out how Canadians feel.
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform Party said that the bill restricts 
individuals from running for any political office. That is not 
true. You can run for a political party or a political office, 
whatever you want. Nobody can take that away from you. That is 
in the charter. What I am saying in this bill is you cannot be 
recognized as an official party during the campaign.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6249"> 6249 </A></B>
<P>
	I never said the nation's capital must be in Ontario. I said this 
nation has one capital. That capital happens to be Ottawa. 
Ottawa happens to be in Ontario. So I invite the federal parties to 
join us and other parties by bringing their headquarters to 
Ottawa.
<P>
	Recently there was a property for sale. The NDP was selling 
its national headquarters. I hope one of the parties will take 
advantage of that and purchase the property so it could be here.
<P>
	I have one more point. If anybody is worried about our 
representation to this House, we won election in October 1993 
by 41 or 42 per cent. Today we are 60 per cent. Obviously we are 
doing something right. People in the west, people in the east and 
in central Canada approve of our position. We are very happy for 
it. We thank them and will continue to provide the best 
government we have ever had in the last 127 years.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have closed debate on 
this private members' bill. If there should be any doubt or 
questions in your mind, we followed Standing Order 44(2) and 
(3) giving the final word or the final reply to the mover of the 
motion. Consequently the order is dropped from the Order 
Paper, pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADALABOURCODE">CANADA LABOUR CODE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
January 14, I denounced the fact that more than 300 employees 
in my riding were locked out by a mining company which was 
deliberately using overlapping federal and provincial 
jurisdiction in Quebec on the issue of anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	Quebec law forbids the use of strikebreakers, but federal law 
does not cover this very important aspect of collective 
bargaining and allows companies to hire strikebreakers to do the 
work done by those with whom the companies do not want to 
negotiate.
<P>
	I have already referred to my statement on January 14. 
However, on April 21, I asked the Prime Minister in this House 
whether he agreed that the lack of federal anti-scab legislation 
was the reason negotiations with the companies were 
deteriorating, in particular with QNS &amp; L at the time, which was 
negotiating with the union in my riding. On April 21, I did not 
get an answer.
<P>
	However, on May 5, concerning the same question, the 
parliamentary secretary responsible for the issue was kind 
enough to answer me, but in his answer he said that more than 90 
per cent of collective bargaining negotiations are settled without 
a work stoppage, so a law was not really necessary.
<P>
	An anti-scab law is not made for the 90 per cent of cases 
where things go well but for the 10 per cent where things break 
down and the danger in the negotiations rises enormously.
<P>
	On April 29, the President of the Public Service Alliance, Mr. 
Bean, wrote to me that he agreed. According to Mr. Bean, the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada recognizes the importance of 
this kind of legislation, and as it found in Quebec, which has 
some people experienced in this area, it feels this bill will have a 
beneficial impact on labour management relations in the federal 
public service. That is quite a testimonial.
<P>
	On June 17 at a regional meeting of the Steelworkers Union in 
Sept-Îles, delegates demanded anti-strikebreaking provisions 
that would apply to federal jobs. Regional co-ordinator 
Jean-Claude Degrasse said that the harsh conflict to which his 
members were exposed following the lock-out at QNS&amp;L-I 
referred to this in my first example, January 14 in 
Sept-Îles-demonstrates the urgent need for 
anti-strikebreaking legislation. The company's use of 
strikebreakers disturbed the industrial peace that had lasted for 
16 years, since 1978. The union's demand is supported by the 
entire population of Sept-Îles.
<P>
	Quebecers working under federal jurisdiction and all 
Canadian workers are affected by this serious gap in the labour 
code. The government has a national responsibility to provide 
for healthy labour relations. It is in the regulations.
<P>
	On June 21, I presented a petition signed by many people who 
asked for the introduction of anti-strikebreaking legislation at 
the federal level, in order to do something about labour relations 
in the case of the 10 per cent where things do not always work 
out.
<P>
	Today, I repeat my question because I feel I was not given a 
satisfactory answer. I hope to get one, however, and my question 
is this: Does the minister intend to introduce in this House 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code and the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act that will bring employees under the 
jurisdiction of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, and 
introduce anti-strikebreaking provisions at all federal levels, in 
order to improve labour relations which are so important to the 
well-being of this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the question of restricting the use of replacement workers during 
legal work stoppages raises a number of complex issues, includ-
<P>

<B><A NAME="6250"> 6250 </A></B>
<P>
ing the need to ensure  that necessary services are provided to 
the Canadian public.
<P>
	Protecting the public interest is of particular relevance in the 
federal jurisdiction, as the Canada Labour Code governs many 
industries which are essentially public interest in nature. 
Although the code does not prohibit the use of replacement 
workers, it does provide protection for workers engaged in legal 
work stoppages. The code prohibits an employer from 
disciplining an employee for engaging in a legal work stoppage. 
As well, an employer cannot discipline an employee for refusing 
to perform the duties of another employee who is involved in a 
legal work stoppage.
<P>
	Once a work stoppage is terminated, employees are entitled to 
return to their employment in preference to any persons hired to 
replace them.
<P>
	The existing system generally works as intended. Most 
collective bargaining negotiations are settled by the parties in 
direct negotiations. Of those that do require conciliation officer 
assistance, more than 90 per cent are settled without a work 
stoppage.
<P>
	This said, the minister is currently reviewing all aspects of the 
Canada Labour Code, including the issue of replacement 
workers, with a view of modernizing and improving it so it can 
better reflect today's realities. There are also ongoing 
consultations with employee and employer groups to seek their 
views.
<P>
	With reference to the dispute between ADM Agri Industry 
Limited, formerly Ogilvy Flour Mills Limited and the Syndicat 
national des employés des minoteries Ogilvie Ltée, the minister 
recently gave his consent for the union to file a complaint with 
the Canada Labour Relations Board alleging that the company 
has failed to bargain in good faith.
<P>
	The minister also met last week with union representatives 
from the company and will continue to closely monitor the 
dispute so it can be resolved as quickly as possible.
<P>
	The union and the company recently agreed to meet with the 
assistance of the mediator on October 12 and 13, 1994. The 
minister is encouraging both parties to take advantage of that 
opportunity to settle their differences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
