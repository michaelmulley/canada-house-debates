	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House today to pay 
tribute to Mr. Dwight McMillan, longtime coach of the Weyburn 
Redwings.
<P>
	For 35 years, Mr. McMillan has brought the community of 
Weyburn, Saskatchewan a great deal of national honour and 
recognition in the sports arena. Both in hockey and in baseball, his 
contributions have brought him two national titles and he has 
participated in other national finals on several occasions.
<P>
	As both a player on the original Redwings hockey team and later 
as the most successful coach in the history of the team, Mr. 
McMillan has shown all of Canada the expertise and fine character 
of Weyburn's sporting teams.
<P>
	Congratulations to Mr. McMillan as he is honoured by the city of 
Weyburn on December 29.

Speaker, Tuesday, December 12, 1995 will go down in history as a 
day of achievement and hope in the fight against AIDS.
<P>
	Yesterday, Health Canada's Drugs Directorate approved, as part 
of a priority review process, the use of 3TC with Retrovir in the 
treatment of AIDS infections.
<P>
	3TC was discovered by Biochem Pharma in Montreal and 
developed by Glaxo Wellcome. This is a Quebec achievement of 
which the whole scientific community can be proud.
<P>
	I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Biochem Pharma for its 
research efforts of the past few years. They have not been in vain. I 
hope that this breakthrough will open the door to other discoveries 
that will not only significantly improve the quality of life of people 
with AIDS but also cure them.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the chair of the Reform family caucus tabled a 
dissenting opinion to the national AIDS strategy report. She says 
that the Liberal government's education and prevention programs 
actually increase the health risk of Canadian youth by promoting 
sexual activity.
<P>
	Research conducted in the United States by the U.S. naval 
research laboratory revealed that the HIV virus is 60 times smaller 
than a syphilis bacterium and 450 times smaller than a human 
sperm.
<P>
	Analysing test results conducted by the U.S. Centre for Disease 
Control, which tested leakage rates of latex condoms, doctors have 
discovered a 78 per cent HIV leakage rate. As one U.S. surgeon put 
it, the HIV virus can go through a condom like a bullet through a 
tennis net.
<P>
	It is the height of stupidity for the government to be spending 
millions of dollars to spread the lie that condoms protect Canadians 
from contracting AIDS. Its politically correct approach is actually 
aiding and abetting the spread of this deadly disease.

would like to draw the attention of the House to the journey of a 
young man from Toronto, only 12 years of age, Craig Kielberger, 
who left this week for the Far East to visit India, Pakistan, Thailand 
and other countries that use child labour.

<P>
	Very often countries in the western world are appalled at human 
rights violations and the denial of political freedom in these 
backward countries.
<P>
	Labour standards, and especially the abuse of young children in 
nearly slave-like conditions must be of serious concern for all 
Canadians. As a trading nation, and as consumers of products 
manufactured under uncivilized conditions, we must somewhere 
draw a line in the sand against those who profit from such 
practices.
<P>
	Today, let us salute Craig in his crusade, Free the Children 
Campaign. Hopefully all of us can join with him in his venture.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian soldiers who served in Burma and elsewhere in Southeast 
Asia in World War II have had to accept the fact that most of these 
conflicts have been forgotten in the annals of our war effort.
<P>
	While other battles made headlines, the fighting in Burma and 
Malaysia went almost unnoticed. This, however, does not take 
anything away from the heroism of the Canadians who served in 
those countries. Our soldiers were brave and courageous. They had 
to face not only the enemy but also scourges such as malaria, 
dysentery and many other tropical diseases.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is with great pride that I note the exploits of these brave young 
Canadians which are now being commemorated in ceremonies 
across Asia. Their heroism is an inspiration, as is their commitment 
and faith in Canada. They served in the hope that when they return 
they would be granted the liberties that other Canadians enjoyed.
<P>
	Fifty years later, we know that their hopes were not misplaced. 
Those young Canadians contributed not only to our freedom, but to 
our dignity as a nation.
<P>
	In a country that prides itself on equality and tolerance, there can 
be no better loyalty than that-

tomorrow members of Parliament will leave this House and return 
home to celebrate the season that has become around the world the 
symbol of peace on earth. Yet one of our NATO partners continues 
to plan and execute the obscenity of testing nuclear weapons.
<P>
	In 1982, the award winning film called ``If You Love This 
Planet'' shocked the world by revealing that there were already 
enough nuclear weapons to destroy us all 14 times over.
<P>
	This Parliament and this government face some difficult 
questions. Should this country be selling uranium to countries that 
produce and unleash nuclear weapons on the world? Should it be 
allowing the planes of countries doing these things to land and use 
our country on the way to their missions?
<P>
	Seven years after the end of the cold war, the doomsday clock is 
in danger of again being moved forward. I ask us all to take this 
season of peace to consider what we can do in this House to make 
sure that the doomsday clock does not take that disastrous leap.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
she tabled her master plan to reduce tobacco use in Canada, the 
Minister of Health indicated that broad consultations would be 
taking place with a view to introducing legislation in the spring.
<P>
	Unfortunately, before tabling her plan, the minister did not see 
fit to initiate serious consultations with the tobacco industry on her 
government's plans to severely regulate its activities.
<P>
	First of all, the minister would not discuss the code of ethics to 
be adopted by the manufacturers or the thrust of her master plan.
<P>
	She missed a great opportunity to make her intentions perfectly 
clear to the industry, thus avoiding another court challenge on her 
upcoming legislation. If that were to happen, Canada would once 
more find itself without a strategy to reduce tobacco use.
<P>
	In the meantime, following the Supreme Court's decision, the 
tobacco industry would resume actively promoting its products 
through advertising. What a mess.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the closing of Radio Canada International was 
announced in Montreal.
<P>
	This means an end to the Canadian Forces Network, which 
brought Canadian programming to our peacekeepers around the 
world. It means an end to the English and French language 
shortwave services which kept Canadians travelling, working or 
living overseas in touch with Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The end of shortwave broadcasts in eight languages, which are 
the voice of Canada around the world, will have an even more 
devastating effect.
<P>
	In 1995, the foreign policy review conducted by the government 
concluded that RCI was in a perfect position to promote Canadian 
values abroad.
<P>
	The Business Council on National Issues itself pointed out that 
the station was creating a demand for Canadian goods and services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	The Broadcasting Act requires the CBC to provide an 
international service. I call on the Liberals to reverse this shameful 
decision and ensure continued support for Radio Canada

	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on November 28 
I had the pleasure of hosting another workshop, this one a 
pre-budget consultation in my riding of Lincoln. Many constituents 
felt that the government had taken decisive action in prior budgets 
but we need to stay the course. However, the reduction in 
government spending must not be done in the slash and burn 
fashion of Mike Harris.
<P>
	Three major themes were developed and discussed: 
unemployment and job creation, concerns of small business, and 
debt and deficit. I am pleased to state that progress has occurred in 
all three areas.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development introduced 
employment insurance programs. The Minister of Industry's Bill 
C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, will continue 
to provide access to debt capital for small businesses that need it to 
expand and to create jobs.
<P>
	Last week the Minister of Finance stated that the deficit for the 
1997-98 fiscal year will be brought down to 2 per cent of GDP. The 
goal is to eliminate the deficit based on a measured and responsible 
strategy.

French language survived in America thanks to Canada. Yet, the 
rate of assimilation of French speaking British Columbians 
exceeds 75 per cent, while that of French speaking Ontarians is 
close to 40 per cent. French speaking Canadians outside Quebec 
must constantly fight to keep control of their institutions. Their 
rights are still violated in several parts of the country.
<P>
	How, in all decency, can anyone claim that the survival of French 
in America is due to anything other than the strong will of our 
ancestors to perpetuate their culture? French survived in America 
thanks to our parents, who fought so that their society could thrive 
in French, despite the many injustices condoned by Canada 
regarding the French language.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Quebec Minister of Finance made an excellent 
suggestion regarding social programs. She asked that the federal 
government transfer tax points to the provinces, instead of money, 
and give them greater autonomy regarding the management of 
these programs.
<P>
	The minister would like to change a system whereby Ottawa can 
withdraw its financial assistance, while continuing to impose 
federal standards. That proposal is already included in the 20 point 
decentralization plan of the Reform Party, and several provinces 
support such changes.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	The federal government should contemplate such a reform, 
instead of wasting its time on symbolic measures such as 
recognition of the distinct society. The irresponsible refusal of the 
federal Minister of Finance does not mean that federalism cannot 
be reformed and that Quebecers must separate. On the contrary, 
Quebecers have allies all over the country, as regards this issue. It

economic and political strata of society, focussing on only one 
goal: the public interest. The government has already shown its 
colours in relation to recognition of Quebecers, and that is one 
important step taken.
<P>
	Members representing all parts of this country have just given 
recognition to Quebec as a distinct society. Let us continue to focus 
constructive efforts on entrenching that recognition in the 
Constitution of our country when the time is right. It is more 
important than ever for us to pool all of our talents, all of our 
minds, but most importantly all of our hearts to make our country,

PQ leaders' lack of firmness in this respect points to a profound 
malaise within the Quebec separatist movement.
<P>
	How can there be any hope that the PQ, which is currently 
involved in exorcising its own racism, will take any energetic 
measures to distance itself from the racist and pro-violence views 
of the MLNQ? The weak protestations of the PQ and the Bloc are 
insufficient, to say the least, and do nothing to help reassure the 
public about the intentions of Mr. Villeneuve and his group of

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMSFINANCING">SOCIAL PROGRAMS FINANCING</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a speech he made in Verdun at the very end of the 
referendum campaign, the Prime Minister made a formal 
commitment to decentralize the federal system, in response to 
Quebec's demands. Yesterday, his finance minister indicated this  
commitment was doomed when he refused to so much as discuss a 
proposal from his Quebec counterpart for replacing Ottawa's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17627"> 17627 </A></B>
<P>
contribution for social programs with an equivalent transfer of tax 
points to Quebec.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can he 
reconcile his formal commitment to decentralize the federal system 
with his finance minister's refusal to discuss even the principle of 
the proposal made by the Government of Quebec to replace 
Ottawa's present contribution to social programs financing with a 
transfer of tax points?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I answer the question put by the Leader of the 
Opposition, I would like to say that we are sorry to see him go. We 
enjoyed the past two years during which he was Leader of the 
Opposition. In politics, there is a certain amount of confrontation, 
but there are also moments that we appreciate.
<P>
	I wish him good luck, and if, as he said in his speech in Laval, he 
intends to work hard to get the economy going and put public 
finances on a sound footing, we will be there, ready to co-operate. 
So I wish him good luck in that respect. If the other agenda 
predominates, there will again be confrontation. As for the 
question put by the Leader of the Opposition concerning tax points, 
it is a matter of one type of transfer rather than another. The amount 
is exactly the same.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	However, for the purposes of public administration and to ensure 
that people know the money is transferred from the central 
government to the provincial governments, I think the Minister of 
Finance is right. People are aware of this in the case of a transfer 
payment, as opposed to tax points. In the case of tax points, people 
tend to forget. After a few years, they forget that no more funds are 
transferred, but that the federal government has withdrawn and lets 
the province collect taxes.
<P>
	As a result, the central government's participation becomes 
invisible. I think the Minister of Finance wants all citizens in every 
province to know exactly what the federal government contributes 
towards the cost of administering social programs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say the leader of the government took some of the 
wind out of my parliamentary sails.
<P>
	In a word, I would like to tell him that I will leave this place, 
respecting its members and the opinions of those members, even if 
they do not coincide with ours, and with every respect for these 
institutions as well as a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to 
become more experienced in the ways of a truly exceptional 
parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I would like to ask the Prime Minister how he 
can dismiss out of hand the proposal made by Mrs. Marois, which 
in fact would respond to what Quebec has maintained since the 
Victoria Conference in 1971, and I am referring to Quebec's 
insistence on the need to control all the levers of its social 
programs.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whether transfer payments are made in the form of tax 
points or cash, it boils down to the same thing.
<P>
	As far as decentralization is concerned, we have made it clear 
that we will withdraw from manpower training. However, we want 
the money collected for that purpose to be used for our clients, in 
other words, for people who across Canada contributed their share, 
added to their employer's share, to give them some security if they 
lose their jobs. This money is to be used for workers who have lost 
their jobs.
<P>
	As for decisions on the administration and nature of training 
programs, that is under provincial jurisdiction. The provinces can 
decide what kind of training they want to give, but we must be sure 
the money transferred is used to train people who are unemployed, 
because they paid their contribution to the federal government so 
they would receive this service if they lost their job.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is considerable confusion afoot, but if anyone knows 
what is at stake here, the Prime Minister does.
<P>
	In fact, it makes all the difference in the world to have tax points 
that leave a government free to proceed as it wishes and will 
increase in value with total tax revenues, as opposed to having 
financial contributions which the federal government reduces at 
will and controls by imposing national standards. It makes all the 
difference in the world.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he would not agree that 
what we have here is an entirely odious strategy that consists in 
making the Quebec government pay an increasingly larger share if 
the cost of social programs, and meanwhile Ottawa collects more 
and more taxes from Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we formed this government two years and some 
months ago, the federal government's transfers for social programs 
and equalization payments totalled more than $11 billion. Today, it 
is even more and next year it will still be more than $11 billion.
<P>
	There have been no cuts. Some payments may be down, but 
equalization payments for the poorest provinces in Canada 
inevitably increased during this period. In fact, there were no cuts 
in transfers to the Government of Quebec or to other provinces that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17628"> 17628 </A></B>
<P>
receive  equalization payments according to the balancing system 
that exists in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite the 
Prime Minister's referendum commitments to decentralize the 
federal apparatus, the Minister of Finance yesterday rejected out of 
hand the request of the government of Quebec that it transfer the 
tax resources the federal government invests in health, social 
assistance and post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Since he is reneging on his referendum commitments on 
decentralization, will the Prime Minister acknowledge that his 
government's hard-line approach to Quebec is a return to the tried 
and tested recipe to slow his decline in popularity with English 
Canada, which is to put Quebec in its place?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the recipe is a very old one. Transfer payments used to be 
simply cash payments. We subsequently gave a number of tax 
points. It is very important we continue to make visible transfers 
like these so that the people in all the provinces will see that the 
federal government helps pay for the social programs the 
provincial governments manage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of 
the Minister of Finance's attitude toward the legitimate request by 
the Government of Quebec, will the Prime Minister acknowledge 
that his referendum commitments to decentralize were nothing 
more than window dressing and the only decentralization he

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said very clearly that we have withdrawn from job 
training. As for the bills, I have to say, and I already made it quite 
clear earlier, that the amount of transfers the federal government 
makes to the provincial governments receiving equalization 
payments has not decreased in the past three years. Some of the 
cash transfers for programs were cut, but equalization payments 
were increased. In the case of Quebec, the amount was over $11 
billion when we formed the government. It remains unchanged 
today and, as far as I know, it will remain unchanged next year.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister was unable or unwilling to 
answer a simple question. The question was: How does the Prime 
Minister propose to use the federal power of peace, order and good 
government to ensure a fair and clear question in the next Quebec 
referendum.
<P>
	Now the Prime Minister has had another 24 hours to reflect. The 
Deputy Prime Minister has whispered in his ear. He has had a 
chance to consult his legal advisers and the answer is probably on 
the front page of his briefing notes.
<P>
	In the interest of national unity, will the Prime Minister now give 
an answer? How does the Prime Minister propose to use the federal 
power of peace, order and good government to ensure a fair and 
clear question in the next Quebec referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not have to read my notes. The leader of the third 
party should just read yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a clear answer appears to be beyond the capacity of the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	After the last referendum Canadians demanded change and some 
new ideas for national unity. Reformers responded to that call by 
putting forward proposals for changes in the federation and terms 
and conditions for dealing with separation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, on the other hand, has borrowed from Brian 
Mulroney's distinct society clause, gone back to a 1971 veto 
proposal and gone back to an 1867 clause in order to deal with the 
referendum.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Where are the new ideas, the imagination and leadership needed 
to keep this country together? How will distinct society, 
constitutional vetoes and vague references to peace, order and good 
government ever convince Quebecers to vote for Canada in the 
next referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people of Quebec have voted twice to stay in Canada. 
We should remember that. The leader of the Reform Party seems to 
be very disappointed that they have chosen Canada but that is not 
my case. When the Leader of the Opposition tried to teach us some 
lessons he should know the ridiculous move he made.
<P>
	I guess the party was too long yesterday. The leader of the third 
party does not know that 52 members of Parliament is nothing 
compared to 177 on this side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the Prime Minister is doing on the national unity 
front makes Brian Mulroney look good, and you have to go a long 
way to make Brian Mulroney look good.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has cobbled together a national unity 
package without consulting the nation, without consulting the 
premiers, without consulting his own caucus and without even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17629"> 17629 </A></B>
<P>
submitting it to parliamentary debate. He even uses closure, the 
most undemocratic tool  of all to push parts of a national unity 
package through the national Parliament.
<P>
	Why would anyone follow the Prime Minister's lead in the 
national unity area when there is no consultation, no mandate, no 
rationality, no democratic legitimacy behind his proposals?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> First, Mr. 
Speaker, we had three discussions in caucus about this matter 
before I went public with it. Second, I do not know if the people 
will follow the leader of the third party. Last week he was asking us 
to give a veto to the province of British Columbia and-
<P>

<P>

<P>
	When questioned in the House yesterday, the heritage minister 
suggested that the future of Radio Canada International would be 
determined by the Juneau report, which will be submitted to the

of Radio Canada International told his 125 employees that RCI 
would shut down in March.

	Can the heritage minister clearly state that, when he was eluding 
our questions yesterday in the House, he did not know that, 20 
minutes later, the director of Radio Canada International would 
announce that his service was going to shut down?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that I know what goes on at the 
CBC. What I said yesterday, and my answer is the same today, was 
that Radio Canada International is the international component of 
the CBC. It is part of the CBC's overall mandate.
<P>
	Therefore, the future of Radio Canada International will be 
decided when we review the CBC's mandate, along with the 
recommendations made by a special committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister knows what goes on at the CBC, why did he tell us 
yesterday that the CBC's mandate would not be changed before the 
Juneau report is submitted, considering that 20 minutes later it was 
announced, without waiting for the Juneau report, that Radio 
Canada International would shut down?

	The finance minister says that freedom 67 should be his choice.

seniors by cutting pensions, raising the age of retirement and

<P>
	The truth be damned. It was siege mentality all the way. The

cancelling it. A glossy bound report bigger than my riding's

this process did nothing to bring out the truth and in fairness to all

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians from coast to coast to coast have made up their 
minds on the Pearson deal. It appears that the only people who are 
not convinced that the Pearson deal had to be cancelled in the best 
interests of Canadian taxpayers and in the best interests of 
Canadian travellers are the Conservative members of the other

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister keeps saying that the Pearson deal was not in 
the public interest and it was not good value for the Canadian 
public. One cannot help but wonder if the minister has financial 
studies to prove this or if he is just talking through an empty hair 
follicle.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to prove his claims by tabling a cost 
benefit analysis of cancelling the contract, if one exists? Failing 
that, will he admit that the latter alternative was true?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

authority. I guarantee him that not only will the facility which those

the bottom line return to the taxpayers of Canada will be

it is the principle of the government to foster family life and to

realize that a child's right of access to his or her family has been

the government is well aware of the role of the United Nations in

negotiations, the Government of Canada insisted that the Official 
Languages Act be complied with.
<P>
	I am convinced that, had the hon. member followed the 
negotiations and taken a genuine interest in the outcome of an 
unprecedented co-operative effort in the Canadian air transport 
industry, he would have realized that the French language and the 
needs of the people who use this language at work, not only in 
Quebec but across Canada, are well represented on 
NAVCANADA'S board of directors.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year 
Mr. Callum Scott, a Canada Customs agent at the Ottawa airport, 
was reprimanded and subsequently left in employment limbo 
because he was wearing a poppy on his uniform on Remembrance 
Day.
<P>
	The mismanagement by the minister and his department officials 
has cost Mr. Scott his job and his dignity over the course of this 
past year.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of National Revenue and taxation, customs 
and excise how this could possibly have happened. What measures 
has he taken to ensure Mr. Scott receives a fair hearing from senior 
management, as he has been promised over the course of the year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I assure the House that the wearing of a poppy is no 
ground for any concern with Revenue Canada. The rules are clear 
for senior managers. Wearing a poppy by people in uniform is 
perfectly acceptable.
<P>
	If in Mr. Scott's case there was any suggestion or concern, it was 
against the policy of the department. I do not have any information 
as to whether it was a failure of policy in this instance.
<P>
	Mr. Scott has a number of opportunities to proceed with various 
grievance procedures. Under the circumstances it would be 
inappropriate for me at this time to comment any further on this 
case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr. Scott 
has phoned the minister 37 times. This individual has used the 
procedures but has been stonewalled every time he turns around by 
the management of the minister's department. The poppy issue is 
over but what is at stake is that over the course of this year this 
gentleman has been put into forced unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	The gentleman is suffering severe stress. The department has put 
this gentleman, who has received many commendations of good 
employment, under such duress and stress that he has had a medical 
certificate given to him. This is the kind of work this minister 
considers efficient and effective.
<P>
	Why does he not return his phone calls? Why does he not give 
this gentleman what he promised and what his department has 
promised over the last six months?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman in question has had his 
communications returned. There are procedures in place for 
handling the complaint that he has. I believe it would be 
appropriate that this take place and I certainly will not comment on 
his medical condition.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	British Columbians are outraged at the suggestion that the 
Liberal government, supported by the Reform Party, is going to 
privatize Ports Canada police in the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	In view of the negative impact this is going to have on smuggling 
and other crime control in the port of Vancouver and the 
overwhelming opposition to this plan from the communities 
affected, will the minister assure the House that he will not proceed 
with his shameful plan to privatize Ports Canada police in 
Vancouver, a plan which the Reform Party of British Columbia has 
supported?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find the hon. member's question incredible, being from 
British Columbia and knowing the importance people in that 
province attach to being able to operate the port of Vancouver, the 
biggest, most important port in Canada. They have been asking for 
years to have the right to operate the port, to make decisions in 
British Columbia, in Vancouver, about the operation of that port.
<P>
	It is a multimillion dollar operation with enormous potential. 
The hon. member now stands in the House as a member of 
parliament from British Columbia and says to the Government of 
Canada ``give up the port, develop an autonomous organization that 
is responsible for all the decisions related to the port'', but he 
would have us keep responsibility for 43 port police in an operation 
of that size.
<P>
	I believe that if the people of British Columbia and the people of 
Vancouver wish to operate the port of Vancouver, they are more 
than competent to be able to take care of the policing 
responsibilities that go along with the port.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	On November 21 a peace plan to end the fighting in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina was signed, yet many individuals are still 
suffering the effects of the conflict.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House how his department has 
responded to the crisis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. It is well known and recognized  in Canada and 
internationally the role that our peacekeepers have played in that 
part of the world.
<P>
	In addition to the peacekeeping forces, in addition to the 
financial help extended by Canada, Canada has also played a role in 
the immigration and refugee front. Relaxed criteria have allowed 
people from the former Yugoslavia who were visiting to be 
reunited with their families. Since 1992 we have been able to land 
7,000 individuals. Through private and government sponsorship, 
18,000 refugees from this part of the world have been landed in 
Canada.
<P>
	Last August when the UNHCR made an international appeal for 
some 5,000 settled individuals, Canada pledged 10 per cent or 500 
on top of the other measures taken. It shows in a very clear and 
powerful way that Canada continues to lend a helping hand to those 
who are in need.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This brings question period to a close. I had notice 
earlier today of a question of privilege. As you know, I hear 
questions of privilege as soon as possible after question period.
<P>
	I address myself to the member for Ottawa West. Because it was 
not the full time allotted, I will hear her question of privilege 
tomorrow.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-364, an act to amend the Criminal Code (no parole 
when imprisoned for life).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, this bill amends certain provisions of 
the Criminal Code that relate to life imprisonment. It ensures that 
when a life sentence is handed down, it means imprisonment 
without any access to parole for the remainder of the natural life of 
the offender.
<P>
	Currently under section 745.5 of the Criminal Code, after 
serving 15 years, those sentenced to life have access to judicial 
review to determine whether or not a reduction in sentence is 
warranted. This is a miscarriage of justice. Many life sentences 
have been given because they are the maximum penalty within the 
Canadian judicial system.
<P>
	No matter how compliant or well behaved a prisoner is while 
incarcerated, a barbaric crime was committed. All the remorse and 
compliance in the world cannot bring the victim back to life. It is 
imperative that the prisoner serve the entire sentence which has 
been handed down. For the families, it is a sense of closure. For the 
Canadian public, it is service of justice. For the criminal it is 
paying a debt to society.
<P>
	Let there be no misconception. If you take a life, you spend the 
rest of yours behind bars. Life means life.

<P>
	The Reform Party's ultimate objective always has been true 
Senate Reform, a triple E Senate, elected, equal and effective. We 
can change the method of appointing senators so that they are 
elected.
<P>
	This bill will change the method of appointing senators through 
an election process without constitutional revision. It will require 
that the Prime Minister wait to receive the expression of opinion 
from any province with a senatorial selection act similar to the 
Alberta senatorial selection act which resulted in Senator Stan 
Waters being appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	The current Senate has not been able to perform its role 
effectively because the selection process has undermined its 
legitimacy. There is considerable urgency for the introduction of 
this bill now because the Government of Canada is cramming 
through veto legislation which will create constitutional gridlock.
<P>
	I am introducing this bill today as a result of the forced vote to be 
held this afternoon on Bill C-110. The long range interests of 
Canadian federalism will truly be served by Senate reform.

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved that 
Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional amendments, be read 
the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased and proud to 
take part in the debate in the Chamber this afternoon on third 
reading of Bill C-110, an act respecting constitutional 
amendments.
<P>
	It will be very difficult for all of us in the short time allocated to 
each speech to capture the essence of how members feel about 
Canada and our shared future. However allow me to try 
nonetheless.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I listened carefully to the members opposite who told us what we 
cannot or should not do. I want to tell you about what we should do, 
can do and will do. With the support of all Canadians, we are going 
to unite Canada, and this is precisely what this debate will be all 
about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17639"> 17639 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have listened to the ideologues of the Bloc Quebecois who 
would rather tear down than build. I have listened to Reformers 
who, despite all their loud noises, shouts and grunts, are really the 
couch potatoes of national unity. They would rather second guess. 
They would rather criticize than encourage. They would rather 
watch than participate as they did during the last referendum.
<P>
	Participation is one of the two issues I should like to talk about 
for a moment. We have all heard the word participaction. Perhaps it 
is now time to talk about citizaction. Just as participaction is about 
exercising the body, citizaction should be about exercising our 
responsibilities and obligations as citizens of this great country. 
Good citizenship is not only about sitting on your hands and 
criticizing, like the third party, but it is also about getting out and 
doing something.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Good citizenship also means making a difference. At the end of 
the referendum we witnessed in a very moving and a very powerful 
way how average Canadians across this land answered that call and 
defined what citizenship is and should be all about.
<P>
	I am talking about the unity rally in Montreal. I am talking about 
the candlelight vigils on the Pacific coast. I am talking about the 
march by tens of thousands of Canadians across the bridges 
between Hull and Ottawa. I am talking about the raising of the 
Canadian flag on Signal Hill in Newfoundland; all of these and 
many of the other demonstrations where people came together in 
the sense of collectivity, in the defence of a sense of community 
and demonstrated their affection not only for their country but for 
the kind of deep rooted commitment they have to good citizenship 
from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	This is a country of doers and not whiners. This is a nation of 
home builders and not home wreckers. The October 27 rally in 
Montreal for me and many others was a day like very few. We shall 
never forget that day for those who either watched it or participated 
in it. It was a day when the Canadian family showed what it was all 
about, considering the jammed buses and trains and planes that 
created that incredible movement to Montreal.
<P>
	The Toronto caucus in metropolitan Toronto and area was able to 
facilitate on two days notice 100 buses of committed Canadians 
who wanted to do something about this country, about the inability 
to facilitate any other coach in the Ontario system because they 
were all gone.
<P>
	We had to rent buses from Pennsylvania because of the lack of 
buses in the Ontario system. The Finch West Bakery in my riding, 
because people were getting up and lining up at 4.00 in the morning 
to get on one of these coaches, provided croissants and muffins and 
orange juice as its contribution to this movement.
<P>
	We have to consider people like John Campion who said: ``We 
cannot go but we would like to fundraise for those who want to go 
but may not be able to afford to go on their own''. We had an 
outpouring of Canadians coming forward with financial 
contributions.
<P>
	We had strangers who could not get on the bus and who car 
pooled with other strangers. All of a sudden, through that exercise 
we had instant friendship and instant family that tied us together 
quite naturally.
<P>
	It sounds simple, and maybe it was, but it really was about 
ordinary Canadians doing extraordinary things. Farmers from 
Quebec shook hands with those farmers who travelled from 
western Canada. It was about a schoolgirl who sang the national 
anthem next to me, who was beside a gentleman who was born 
thousands of miles away in southeast Asia but who now proudly 
calls his home Canada.
<P>
	It is the kind of thanks and appreciation, without being 
patronizing, we received from our fellow family Quebecers on the 
streets of Montreal who said thank you for coming down in 
solidarity, thank you for not abandoning the concept of community 
and of family, despite the attempts of some in the media to portray 
things clearly that were not the reality on that day.
<P>
	One of the lessons that rally taught all of us, particularly the 
political class on both government and opposition benches, is that 
unity requires inclusion. That was the strong message of the rally. 
It showed Canadians also need to get involved and be part of the 
solution. Canadians must be able to sing the song and not only hold 
the song sheet in order for the country to continue to be the kind of 
society that is recognized not only by us but, more important, by 
those across the globe.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	On that day in Montreal there were thousands of individual acts 
by ordinary Canadians that epitomized what good citizenship is all 
about. Sometimes as the minister of citizenship I am called to 
define citizenship, what active and engaged citizenship means. 
Sometimes we have these speeches that try to articulate that. Yet 
how powerful and eloquent instead of those speeches was the act on 
that day that gave expression to what active and engaged 
citizenship should be and is all about.
<P>
	We have also heard from our friends in the Bloc mutter about the 
federalist plots and the discount fares which were the real reasons 
people came together in Montreal. Does the leader really think a 
cabal of schemers and plotters as well organized as it may be could 
have produced such spectacular events without the willing, 
enthusiastic participation of those Canadians? I think not.
<P>
	Does he subscribe to the politics of exclusion, to the politics of 
marginalizing people on the sidelines of our country? That is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17640"> 17640 </A></B>
<P>
second issue I would like to touch on  this afternoon, the attempt by 
some to marginalize segments and people in Canadian society.
<P>
	Canada cannot and will not survive in a climate of tribalism or of 
attempting to push certain groups to those dark corners, to those 
margins. This initiative today is not and cannot be only about 
history. It cannot be restricted or limited in debating only the 
English and French reality in the country.
<P>
	This debate has also to be about our present and about our 
tomorrows. We must be inclusive and talk about today and a future 
that includes the French and the English facts that gave rise to the 
country. We must also embrace without reservation, without 
qualification the reality of the aboriginal people in Canada and the 
millions of Canadians whose origins span the globe.
<P>
	It is only when we speak of these four pillars, the French, the 
English, the aboriginals and the Canadians who have adopted this 
country as theirs, does it give full expression to Canada. Only then 
will it be inclusive and only then can Canada be entirely whole.
<P>
	Let me be very clear to those across the way who would want to 
dance neatly through the politics of exclusion by attempting to 
shrug off too many statements that were nothing more than veiled 
ethnic slurs, slurs that really try to appeal to people's darker sides 
and lowest instincts. It was not only a case of pure campaign 
gimmickry to alienate and marginalize individuals in the province 
of Quebec; it continues today, after the referendum was fought and 
won by Canada.
<P>
	It continued this week when elements of that separatist 
movement suggested ethnic communities in Quebec were enemies 
of Quebec. It was articulated by Pierre Bourgault, who had the 
audacity and the courage to suggest that those Greeks, Italians and 
Jews were racist because they voted for Canada.
<P>
	The separatists across the way and those beside them who 
participate in the politics of division would want to stratify our 
province of Quebec, our nation of Canada into different classes of 
people. They would want us to talk about them and us.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	I find it exceedingly ironic that the separatists would try to chide, 
castigate and humiliate those communities which in large numbers 
have always supported the quest for the French Canadian identity 
in Quebec and across the country, those which largely have always 
supported the quest for that French Canadian language not only to 
be preserved and protected but to be enhanced, those which in the 
late sixties and early seventies supported the battle for bilingualism 
which Mr. Trudeau and the current Prime Minister fought tooth and 
nail for.
<P>
	They did so willingly. They did so because they believed in that, 
because it defined what Quebec in Canada is and should be about. 
They also did so because  they identified with that kind of quest for 
themselves, which is also part of Quebec and part of Canada.
<P>
	We have the maturity and the foresight in this country such that 
when immigrants come through our airports we do not ask them to 
check their cultural baggage at Revenue Canada, Canada Customs 
and Immigration Canada. We say they are no less Canadian for 
believing in who they had been for the past 30 years or in the forces 
that shaped them in Europe, in Africa, in South America.
<P>
	Now because those ethnic communities, as they are referred to, 
have the temerity to choose Canada, they are ridiculed. It is the 
separatists who are wrong because there does not have to be a 
choice. Those members in the Canadian family labelled ethnic 
want both and can have both because the two concepts are 
compatible. One can be fiercely loyal to Canada and our flag while 
at the same time aggressively promoting that which is the very 
essence of Quebec or our other provinces and territories.
<P>
	That is their mistake, that they push for that either/or, when in 
fact those members of the Canadian family labelled as ethnic have 
always supported both, the search for the French Canadian identity 
and the eloquence of being a member of the Canadian family, the 
best membership the world knows.
<P>
	When we cast our minds back to October 27 on the streets of 
Montreal, there were also immigrants at that rally. There were 
ethics at that rally. There were people whose skin tone was 
different from ours and there were people whose mother tongue 
was different from ours. However, we should never forget, let alone 
castigate them, that they were there because they too love Canada 
and Quebec, because they too helped build Canada and Quebec and 
because this is not just our home; this is also Quebec and Canada, 
their home.
<P>
	The government will never play that ugly game of exclusion 
because that is a game that quite frankly breeds racism, hate and 
division. If we were to go down that dark ally which some want us 
to travel it truly would be the beginning of the end, without 
exaggerating.
<P>
	All we have to do is notice on our television screens every night 
the kinds of wars and division this so-called world of ours is 
engaged in. If we think of the root causes which regrettably give 
life to the kinds of acts of one against the other, it is always found 
in the very divisions these statements would have us propelled into, 
the game of exclusion that does breed racism, hate and division 
between brothers and sisters.
<P>
	We also know or should know in our souls that unity is certainly 
not exclusively built around constitutional amendments, 
constitutional discussions or constitutional conferences. I think 
Canadians know this very well. It is much more than that. 
Constitutions do not necessarily build countries. Constitutions do 
not necessarily give  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17641"> 17641 </A></B>
<P>
countries greatness. Constitutions do not necessarily provide 
countries with momentum. People do.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Unity is bound by how we treat each other. On this score, 
Canadians and the very essence of Canada as I define it have 
always valued generosity, inclusion and a sense of compassion for 
one another. That is one of the reasons our country has been able to 
prosper over the years. This is not the time to abandon those values 
because those same values are needed the most at this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must make these values part of our daily lives, perhaps even 
celebrate them in special events such as National Citizenship Week 
and Flag Day. This coming year, the two events will be combined 
into a week of celebrations around the theme Canada: take it to 
heart.
<P>
	We have recently begun to note in Canadians throughout the 
country a growing desire to show their great love of Canada and 
their concern for the state of the nation in some concrete way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was with this in mind that the Canada take it to heart initiative 
was developed by the citizenship and immigration department 
working with the Canadian heritage department. Together we 
created a special week of activities where Canadians can come 
together to celebrate their commitments as fellow citizens and their 
pride in being Canadian and the remarkable heritage and future we 
all share.
<P>
	This is just one very modest way of expressing that sense of 
Canadian community. For that concept of community to survive 
and indeed thrive, it will need the help and co-operation of the 
entire Canadian family, of all Canadians in all regions of all ages 
and of all backgrounds. We should never forget that it is only 
through the participation of Canadians and the inclusion of all of 
her people that we can make Canada grow, thrive and flower.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill 
C-110 is a big mistake. It not only fails to respond to Quebec's 
expectations but even makes future constitutional amendments 
impossible, for all practical purposes. When everyone has a veto, 
the obvious and inevitable conclusion is that on any given proposal 
for a constitutional amendment, there will always be one holder of 
a veto who will use it to block such proposals.
<P>
	Although the Prime Minister hinted to the House that 
recognition of the distinct society concept would eventually be 
included in the Constitution, the veto powers he is now distributing 
left and right will make it impossible to make any further 
amendments to the Constitution. It would be a joke, if it were not 
so tragic.  However, this is symptomatic of a far more fundamental 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	When provinces and First Nations insist on each having a veto 
on any constitutional amendment, this can mean either that all 
parties are so pleased with the Constitution as it stands that they 
want to give each other assurances they will never change it, or 
they are showing a considerable distrust of the federal system. I am 
afraid the answer is obvious.
<P>
	The present Constitution of Canada does not fit the economic, 
social and cultural realities of Canada today. The profound 
constitutional malaise in our societies today has many 
consequences for our daily lives, because of the combined impact 
of the federal government's legislative and spending powers.
<P>
	That is why we are now saddled with an incredible deficit, why 
employment policies always were and still are formulated from the 
top down without any real regard for the provinces and why the 
spectre of national standards irrelevant to regional situations can 
only mean institutionalized chaos.
<P>
	In this respect, the Quebec government's desire to establish a 
new partnership with the rest of Canada was and still is a unique 
way to start the 21st century with a process that would make for a 
new relationship and a new solidarity between the populations 
residing in the Canadian economic space. Unfortunately, 
traditionally federalist forces have stubbornly distorted Quebec's 
blueprint and made it out to be the opposite of what it really is.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Even the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration a few 
moments ago could not resist doing exactly that. The minister and 
this government must realize that when a majority of Quebecois 
voted no in the last referendum, it was in the hope that the Prime 
Minister would deliver on his promises.
<P>
	The bill now before the House is not what was expected and is 
not what is needed. Therefore, no one should be surprised if in due 
time those who voted no shall want to reconsider through another 
democratic referendum.
<P>
	In view of this, it is most unfortunate that the Reform Party 
proposes using legal force to oppose the legitimate will of the 
people of Quebec to reconsider democratically their future. 
Furthermore, it is also most unfortunate that the Reform Party has 
stated that shall the people of Quebec decide in favour of 
sovereignty, it should be denied this outcome using armed forces. 
Even the Prime Minister let it be known that he would object to the 
unfolding of this democratic process. This is intolerance and it is 
unacceptable in any democratic country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17642"> 17642 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Nor do we need the kind of statements that are spread around by 
the Liberal Party of Canada and repeated by the anglophone media, 
that Quebec is living on handouts from the rest of Canada and is not 
capable of taking full control of its tax system, legislation and 
international relations.
<P>
	The exact opposite is true. In fact, Quebec contributes one 
quarter of federal revenues and also carries one-quarter of the 
federal debt, but unfortunately, it receives significantly less than its 
share of federal spending that creates jobs.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	This unfortunately, but unavoidably, leads to proportionately 
greater unemployment insurance and social security expenditures. 
So that each federal transfer reduction measure wreaks even greater 
devastation on Quebec. This is exactly what has been happening in 
recent years. Per capita federal transfers in constant dollars have 
dropped significantly in the past few years.
<P>
	This is why Quebec must take back control of its economic and 
tax levers at the earliest opportunity. To this end, serious and 
doubtless difficult negotiations will be required for the needed 
modernization of the constitutional framework. In the meantime, 
however, the very last thing we need is a bill that is both a bogus 
overture to Quebec and a straitjacket that will preclude any 
constitutional change in the future.
<P>
	Traditionally, Quebec has always demanded a constitutional 
veto, and I repeat, constitutional, as protection against amendments 
to the Constitution which are contrary to its interests.
<P>
	Let us take a quick look at history and remember that, in the 
early 1960s, the Fulton-Favreau formula arose out of a 
constitutional conference. It provided for a veto for the provinces 
on any constitutional amendment affecting their rights, powers and 
privileges. In 1971, the Victoria conference proposed a 
constitutional veto for Quebec, Ontario, two of the maritime 
provinces and at least two of the western provinces whose 
combined populations constituted a majority.
<P>
	The mechanics of Bill C-110 are oddly similar to the Victoria 
formula, with one exception. In 1971, fourteen years ago, they 
were talking about a constitutional veto and not a simple legislative 
measure. It was the former Liberal premier of Quebec, Robert 
Bourassa, who turned down the Victoria accord, because it did not 
satisfy Quebecers.
<P>
	Then, in 1979, the Pepin-Robarts report proposed four regional 
vetoes, including one for Quebec. In 1982, then Prime Minister 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, with the help of the current Prime Minister, 
tore up the 1867 Constitution, replacing it with another one, 
without Quebec's consent. Ever since that time, there has been a  
crying need for a constitutional veto allowing Quebec to protect 
itself against amendments that would hurt its interests.
<P>
	The famous Meech Lake accord, which was supposed to achieve 
reconciliation between Quebec and the rest of Canada after the 
1982 patriation episode, would have given Quebec a veto. We 
know what happened next. The current Prime Minister torpedoed 
the accord with the help of Clyde Wells and his associates.
<P>
	In 1991, Beaudoin-Edwards recommended four regional 
constitutional vetoes, including one for Quebec; in 1992, 
Beaudoin-Dobbie also recommended a constitutional veto for 
Quebec.
<P>
	Even the Charlottetown accord, which was found clearly lacking 
by the vast majority of Quebecers in a referendum, would have 
given Quebec a veto.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	As we can see, the constitutional veto demanded by Quebec is a 
constant political aspiration that has always been at the heart of its 
minimum requirements. That is why, when the Prime Minister 
portrayed the Constitution as a path to change and promised a veto, 
as he did in Montreal, Quebecers were clearly expecting a 
constitutional veto, since Quebec always talks about this as a 
minimum.
<P>
	As we know, giving Quebec a constitutional veto would require 
the consent of the federal government and the 10 provinces. Yet, 
according to a recent poll, barely 10 per cent of people in the rest of 
Canada support a veto for Quebec. The Prime Minister must know 
that he is in no position to give Quebec a constitutional veto. He 
also knows that, as he keeps telling everyone in the rest of Canada, 
a legislative veto is not worth much.
<P>
	That is why the government performed mental gymnastics to 
create the illusion that it is offering Quebec a real veto. In fact, 
nothing could be further from the truth. What the Minister of 
Justice is proposing to this House is not a real veto. In fact, his bill 
would give Quebec no constitutional protection against 
constitutional amendments.
<P>
	Bill C-110 is not a constitutional guarantee that would ensure 
that Quebec will be protected in the future. You and I know that the 
government in place could repeal this bill at will. In fact, that is 
exactly what the Reform Party said it would do upon taking office. 
This goes to show how tenuous the protection offered by Bill C-110 
would be.
<P>
	The federal government has some gall to talk about a veto when 
in fact what it is offering Quebec is all wind, an illusion. Worse yet, 
it actually guarantees that no constitutional change benefiting 
Quebec will ever be approved, since all it will take is for another 
veto right holder to object to nip any reform attempt in the bud. 
With Bill C-110, we can be sure that the federal system  will be 
even more impossible to change than ever before, until such time 
as the government grows tired of resisting and finally decides to 
repeal the miserable act.
<P>
	What this government has come up with is at best a sort of 
self-censorship that is only binding on this government, if at all. In 
fact, with this stroke of inspiration, the Prime Minister will have 
managed, if only briefly, to make the Canadian federal system even 
more inflexible by taking the dangerous step of protecting the 
status quo at his own risk.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17643"> 17643 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In reality, Bill C-110 is intended solely to convince Quebecers 
that the Prime Minister is making good on his referendum 
promises. No one in Quebec will be taken in, as recent surveys 
prove quite well.
<P>
	Half of Quebecers opted for sovereignty-partnership and the 
rest, the majority, pinned their hopes for renewed federalism, but 
the bogus veto proposed by the Minister of Justice will not satisfy 
even his erstwhile referendum allies who, let us keep in mind, have 
always called for a constitutional veto for Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government ``knows best'' attitude has been, is and 
will remain totally counter productive in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the debates on this bill this House has had a chance to 
appreciate the Prime Minister's talent for improvisation-I have 
chosen that term deliberately-in para-constitutional matters, by 
granting the province of British Columbia its own veto. But we 
must be well aware that adding to the number of vetoes ends up 
watering down their value, by diminishing the concept and thus its 
effect as well.
<P>
	It must be realized that, although having a veto reassures each 
veto holder that Canada could not go against its interests 
constitutionally, this does not in any way make it possible for a 
province to go where its interests dictate. In short, it is our feeling 
that not only does the formula proposed by the Minister of Justice 
run contrary to the higher interests of Quebec, it is also contrary to 
the higher interests of Canada. For this reason, I and the Bloc 
Quebecois will be opposing passage of this bill, in accordance with 
the convictions of the large majority of Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to commence my speech today on behalf of the Reform 
Party with regard to Bill C-110 by speaking about the attitude there 
seems to be on the part of people in the government.
<P>
	This attitude is led by none other than the Prime Minister. People 
in the House have learned, they have  listened and understand well. 
The attitude is that if there is vacuousness, in other words, nothing 
to talk about and nothing to offer, then attack the other person's 
motive.
<P>
	I was deeply dismayed yesterday and I quote the Prime Minister 
when he said: ``There has not been one day since we have been 
talking about this problem that he''-referring to the leader of the 
Reform Party-``has not been in bed with the Quebec separatists. 
There has not been one day he does not want to try to make life 
difficult for a government that is trying to save Canada. There has 
not been one day that he is not causing some disturbance in Canada 
because he has no interest in keeping the country together''.
<P>
	I find that kind of personal attack beneath the dignity of the 
person who has the title of Prime Minister of Canada. It is 
exceptionally unfortunate that he is setting that kind of a tone for 
the people in his party when he has absolutely no content, no idea 
of what he is doing. He is running this country from the back of an 
envelope. He attacks the motives of the leader of this party or 
anyone else who does not go along with his flavour of the day.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	His flavour of the day apparently has now changed and we are 
going to have a veto for the province of B.C. While there are few 
things said by the Block Quebecois I agree with, I agree with the 
last speaker that this veto for the province of B.C. is nothing more 
than an additional piece of chewing gum to add to the chewing gum 
and baling wire that has been used to put together this concocted 
Bill C-110 in the first place.
<P>
	How did we get there? Contrary to the remarks of the Deputy 
Prime Minister who apparently has taken the comments and the 
direction of the Prime Minister to heart to the point of ending up in 
tears here in the House of Commons, contrary to her point of view 
and the way in which she chooses to express it, there are people in 
Canada, including members of the Reform Party, who are avowed 
federalists and believe in the concept of keeping this great nation 
together. The chewing gum and baling wire effort at this point is so 
absolutely and abjectly inadequate as to make my stomach turn.
<P>
	Why do we have this bill? It is, first, because the Prime Minister 
panicked. Obviously the ``don't worry, be happy'' attitude he had 
when he came to British Columbia saying everything is fine, did 
not work. ``I am really pleased that nobody in British Columbia, 
nobody in the west, has been panicking over the fact that we have 
not really been running in this referendum debate. It is really nice 
that you have not been running and creating any problems, 
therefore don't worry, be happy''.
<P>
	That was approximately two weeks before October 30 when the 
first string quarterback, Jacques Parizeau, decided to replace 
himself with a backup quarterback, the leader of Her Majesty's 
official loyal opposition as the  person who was going to lead the 
province of Quebec out of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17644"> 17644 </A></B>
<P>
	When that happened, the people of Quebec started to listen to the 
siren songs and the abject lies of the separatists. They listened to 
them and actually believed that by voting yes, this group to my 
right were talking about making a better place for Quebec in 
Canada. What the people of Quebec did not know at that time was 
that the leader, the vice-premier of Quebec, was actually at that 
time circulating to four embassies saying that on October 31 you 
will recognize us as an independent state. The people of Quebec did 
not know that.
<P>
	The leader of Her Majesty's official loyal opposition that the 
Liberals want in the position of Her Majesty's official loyal 
opposition decided that he would continue with those lies. He 
obviously got away with it to the extent that 38 per cent of the 
people who voted yes in the referendum actually believed those lies 
and that they were going to be a part of Canada.
<P>
	What did the Prime Minister do? He absolutely panicked. He 
turned around and said: ``Let's see, what do I have in my grab bag 
of tricks? What have we tried before? Why do we not take a whack 
at distinct society? Hey, that is a good idea. Let's do distinct 
society. What about veto? Yeah, crumb, let's do veto too. That's a 
good idea''.
<P>
	That is how we are in this House today with the government 
having rammed distinct society down Canadians' throats and 
tonight ramming veto down Canadians' throats.
<P>
	Why did we get here? Some of the responses from my province 
are indicative of the kind of rage there is not only in British 
Columbia but around the nation. I will read a paragraph from a 
letter from Jack Weisgerber who is the leader of the third party in 
British Columbia. It is dated November 28 and addressed to the 
Prime Minister. He says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If your aim is to truly keep Canada united from coast to coast, as I certainly 
hope it is-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I might parenthesize that there are some people in Canada who 
would question the Prime Minister's motives. Because I find that 
act reprehensible on the part of the Prime Minister and the Liberals, 
I will not do it. Then he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-you must have the courage to articulate a vision of Canada that is consistent 
with the views of most Canadians in every province. From British Columbia's 
perspective, the only vision of Canada that is acceptable is one where all 
provinces and all Canadians are equal, with special status for none. Surely that 
should have been the lesson learned from the referendum on the Charlottetown 
Accord, which is being entirely ignored by your government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	It is really telling the way in which this government has chosen 
to bring this legislation forward with a complete  ignorance of the 
fact that the people of Canada rejected these provisions in the 
Charlottetown accord. Yet it is jamming it down their throats in 
spite of what the people have said.
<P>
	The Reform Party is very clear and unequivocal. If there is to be 
any change to the Constitution, the Constitution must be approved 
by the people of Canada, not the provincial legislatures, not this 
assembly, but by the people of Canada because the Canadian 
Constitution belongs to Canadians.
<P>
	We currently have an amending formula in our constitutional 
law. It is called the seven and fifty formula. That is the formula 
where seven provinces representing a total in excess of 50 per cent 
of the population of Canada would be able to ratify most changes to 
the Constitution. For the sake of time I will not go into the detail of 
the exceptions to that. That is a broad enough statement.
<P>
	An interesting comment was written in the column ``The write 
stuff'' by constitutional experts David Bercuson and Barry Cooper. 
They say in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, remember that we do have a Constitution in Canada; it contains an 
amending formula. Mr. Chrétien surely knows that. Given his pivotal role in its 
adoption back in the early 1980s, he must have once believed that the current 
amending formula is a good thing. But now, with Saint Lucien about to become 
the great helmsman of the separatist cause in Quebec, the Constitution is no 
longer convenient.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What then, can Chrétien do except to pretend the Constitution doesn't exist? 
Hence his proposal of wholesale change to the structure of government without 
following the rules. It is a plan that, if successful, will allow Chrétien to avoid 
the minor inconvenience suffered by Brian Mulroney of having his proposals 
for constitutional change thrown back in his face.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chrétien's proposals are, in our view, more dishonest, more divisive, and far 
more repellent than anything the Mulroney gang ever dreamed up.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They go on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no such thing as a ``region'' in the Constitution, or anyplace else in 
Canadian law. So, giving a constitutional veto to a ``region'' isn't much 
different than giving a veto to all red-headed, left-handed, green-eyed women 
in Canada. Both entities are equally recognized in the Constitution and both 
have the same status as constitutional players, namely none.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These experts, in looking at these things, are very incisive in 
their comments. They reveal the fact that the government and 
indeed the whole country of Canada are currently being run by a 
Prime Minister and his cabinet from scribblings on the backs of 
used envelopes.
<P>
	In a column by Joan Bryden, entitled ``Veto for B.C. fuels 
constitutional uproar'' I read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although B.C. will now be recognized as a fifth region with its own 
veto-along with Ontario, Quebec, the prairies and the Atlantic 
region-Premier Mike Harcourt complained the move will make it even harder 
to amend the Constitution in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17645"> 17645 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It means, effectively, that seven provinces representing at least 92 per cent of 
the population must approve any constitutional change before the federal 
government will consider giving its own stamp of approval.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That's a stiffer requirement than the seven provinces with 50 per cent of the 
population currently needed for most constitutional changes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Forest Minister Andrew Petter, B.C.'s point man on the unity package, said 
Chrétien is putting a ``straitjacket on Confederation'' and accused him of 
making up his unity strategy ``on the back of an envelope''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Truly that is exactly what the Prime Minister is doing. Yet the 
Liberal members, like sheep, will come to this House tonight, fall 
in line and vote for this straitjacket on the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	We have a situation where we are giving a veto. Perhaps I should 
stop for a second here and just detail my concept of what a veto is. 
Simply, if someone being one of many has a veto power and that 
person's vote was negative then that person would be able to stop 
the process in spite of the fact that the majority of the vote was 
positive. That is my understanding of the word veto.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	What this Prime Minister has done is to give Canada's federal 
government constitutional veto over Canada's Constitution to the 
separatist government in Quebec. It is absolutely unbelievable. It is 
so unbelievable I have to repeat it: The Prime Minister is giving 
Canada's federal government constitutional veto over changes to 
Canada's Constitution to the separatist government in Quebec.
<P>
	It goes beyond exasperation to think that those people would 
come back into this House tonight and actually vote that way 
simply because their Prime Minister says so. I should explain that 
there is a lot of embarrassment on the part of Liberals in the 
province of British Columbia because they have the misfortune of 
having the name Liberal. I will read from a column by an MLA 
candidate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government has made its spectacular move. In an effort to 
appease the disgruntled Quebec separatists, the Prime Minister is putting the 
true union of Canadian provinces at risk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The thinly disguised `veto to all' will leave Quebec in the position of 
stopping any constitutional changes, no matter how logical they may be. British 
Columbia, the fastest growing and third largest province has been pushed aside 
once more.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I say in parenthesis that this was written immediately prior to the 
extra inclusion of the veto for British Columbia, but the sentiments 
are exactly the same. This B.C. Liberal is trying to distance himself 
from the crazy federal Liberals. He goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The unity committee, as designed by the Prime Minister, has one western 
Canadian representative-and she is from Edmonton. This committee now 
should be disbanded because Chrétien's latest move has made it redundant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The `distinct society' clause will enshrine a special status for a small section 
of our society and will inflame relations with Quebec for years to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Liberals, this is a Liberal speaking.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Prime Minister has no inkling as to what makes Canada tick! He is 
completely out of touch!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Charlottetown accord of 1992 was defeated because of the inclusion of 
this type of special treatment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I wonder who the minister of western alienation is? This individual is doing a 
commendable job!</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was said by a B.C. Liberal candidate. But what does the 
B.C. Liberal leader say? When he was interviewed on December 6 
the questioner asked: ``You have no embarrassment though that 
they are Liberals and you are a Liberal in name?'' The B.C. Liberal 
leader wanted to distance himself from these people over here 
because he said: ``Our party is totally separate from the federal 
party. I am embarrassed for British Columbia that they are not 
standing up in Parliament and speaking up for the interests of 
British Columbia, which is what I believe their task is''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is a different story if you are trying to get 
elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> It is absolutely amazing. I think it would be even 
more instructive if we were to take the words of the self-declared 
constitutional expert, the man from Vancouver Quadra. I will quote 
from an article dated November 30 where he acknowledges the 
regional veto system was resurrected from a constitutional 
conference in 1971. It may have come about for no other reason 
than because ``someone in the Prime Minister's office mentioned it 
and nobody happened to point out that what worked in 1971 would 
not work now. I think it is as simple as that''. That is what the 
member for Vancouver Quadra said to a reporter in Vancouver on 
November 30. It will be very instructive to visualize how this 
member will end up voting later in the day.
<P>
	Why do we get there? Because the Prime Minister panicked 
because he had a totally worthless plan for trying to fight the 
referendum. That is the only reason we get there. We have a Prime 
Minister who has no vision and is out of touch. Quite frankly, it is 
my judgment and apparently the judgment of all of my colleagues 
in the House that the Prime Minister should seriously reconsider 
his future in the role of Prime Minister of Canada. He has no 
vision.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I will quote from another authority. I consider this person to be 
an authority because as the former premier of Newfoundland from 
1979 to 1989, Brian Peckford went through a tremendous number 
of constitutional wars. He points out something very subtle here:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Furthermore there are other problems with what is being proposed. In a ruling 
in September 1981, the Supreme Court of Canada said about a federal unilateral 
initiative to patriate and  change the Constitution that it was inconsistent with the </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17646"> 17646 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>conventions of the Constitution which required the substantial consent of the 
provinces. This ruling is significant for at least two reasons:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will give one:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The concept of ``conventions'' of the Constitution. It can be argued that the 
present federal proposals involve a process that is really backdoor constitution 
making, given that it is possible in the future for the high court to rule that these 
proposals form part of the conventions of the Constitution. Therefore you 
actually have the likelihood that these will be viewed in a constitutional way 
even if they are not specifically put into the written Constitution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He summarizes and submits that ``the present federal proposals 
use a process which is contrary to what Canadians wish to see as 
the process for constitutional change''. As a matter of fact, I would 
parenthesize again and say that this process is totally outside 
constitutional law. The Prime Minister is tinkering with the 
Constitution outside of constitutional law.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Supreme Court ruling of '81 casts serious doubt on the legitimacy of the 
process being used, in as much as what is being effectively done is tantamount to 
a constitutional change disregarding the convention of first obtaining 
substantial consent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That raises a whole host of questions. Where is the substantial 
consent to these changes? Nowhere, except with 177 sheep. That is 
where the substantial consent is.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These federal proposals if passed could be viewed by the supreme court in the 
future as part of a convention of the Constitution and hence carrying more 
weight than is currently being ascribed to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is scary stuff. Very scary stuff. What is going on is that we 
have a fundamental subversion of the constitutional process, of the 
very document on which Canada and the relationships not only 
between the provinces, but between us as Canadians are founded. 
These are the rules under which we live together. These are the 
rules under which our various jurisdictions function.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, out of a sense of panic, has gone ahead and 
made these changes. He is oblivious to the fact that according to the 
expert I just quoted, because these changes will form part of a 
convention and a part of the way things are done, they could be 
viewed by the Supreme Court of Canada as being substantive 
changes to the Constitution.
<P>
	Who has the Prime Minister consulted? No one. That is who. Let 
us briefly look at the consultation process. Did the Prime Minister 
go to members of his Liberal cabinet? If he did go to those 
members, what did the Minister of National Revenue say to him? 
Or did he totally disregard the fact that the Minister of National 
Revenue is supposedly touted as being the minister representing 
the viewpoint of the province of British Columbia?
<P>
	He cannot have it both ways. Either he did not go to the revenue 
minister and the rest of his cabinet and did this thing on the back of 
an envelope with chewing gum and baling wire, or he did go to the 
Minister of National Revenue and chose to disregard the advice of 
the Minister of National Revenue. I suppose one could even ask if 
the Minister of National Revenue was awake that day and realized 
what a major problem we are stumbling into in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	The second question: Did he go to his caucus? He said today in 
the House that he went to his caucus. I would suggest that he 
probably went to his caucus well after the fact, well after it was 
etched in stone, and caucus members were too embarrassed to 
stand up and be counted, as they should stand up and be counted on 
behalf of Canadians.
<P>
	Did he go to provincial officials? Clearly not. We have received 
copies of letters from the premiers to the Prime Minister. I read part 
of a letter from the premier of British Columbia: ``I am writing in 
regard to the bill currently before the House of Commons entitled 
an act respecting constitutional amendments. The Government of 
British Columbia strongly objects to the fact-'', and it goes on and 
on. Where was the consultation?
<P>
	We are led to believe by the news media that the Prime Minister, 
just by happenstance, may be calling some of the premiers to say: 
``Guess what we are doing today?''
<P>
	In the Calgary <I>Herald</I> today the premier of Alberta is quoted 
going on about the fact that the Prime Minister was completely out 
of touch and had not contacted him. In fact, the premiers are still 
being told, probably by an aide to the Prime Minister, what is going 
on. Where is the consultation?
<P>
	That is the crux of it. The blatant disregard which the Prime 
Minister and his party have for the people of Canada is appalling. 
He has not gone to the people of Canada at any point and he is 
talking about substantive changes to their Constitution. It is their 
Constitution and he ignores them. He does not consult them in any 
way.
<P>
	Why would the Liberals vote for this egregious piece of 
legislation? I suppose it is because they like being parliamentary 
secretaries or chairmen of standing committees. Maybe they like 
the privilege of being able to travel around the countryside or on 
international junkets. I believe this is where the whip comes in.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Mississauga West was on television a 
few weeks ago she said: ``Look at the number of free votes we have 
had in the House of Commons''. Sure, there have been free votes in 
the House of Commons for Liberal members, but every single, 
solitary one of those free votes was on private members' business. 
There was no exception. The whip has been on when it came to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17647"> 17647 </A></B>
<P>
government business. Any member who voted against the 
government whip, against  the wishes of the Prime Minister, has 
been banished, chastised and disciplined. It is absolutely and 
totally contrary to what the red book told Canadians. It said that 
this government would be different and there would be free votes.
<P>
	Why vote? It almost leaves me to ask: Why have a House of 
Commons? Why do we come here, as we have today, realizing that 
the debate which started at approximately 3.30 this afternoon will 
be terminated by the Liberals at 5.15 p.m.? The bill will 
substantively change the Constitution of Canada. I say: Shame on 
the Liberals. There is no excuse for this kind of pile-driving and 
ramrodding of legislation.
<P>
	I suspect that my words have fallen on deaf ears on the Liberal 
side. They just do not understand. They do not even show up for the 
debates. I cannot comprehend where their head space might be.
<P>
	What can I say? When the Reform Party is elected to 
government in 1997 it will repeal this bunch of legislation, which is 
so divisive, so discredited, so damaging and, I suggest, so 
deceitful. The Reform Party will ensure that any future changes to 
constitutional law will include the provision that the people of 
Canada will have a say over their Constitution by way of one 
person, one vote. That is democracy. That is the Reform way.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
honoured to participate in the final moments of debate prior to what 
is, in my opinion, an historic vote.
<P>
	What a difference almost four weeks makes. It is very easy to 
speak here today knowing the result of the vote on October 30. I 
would first like to thank the hundreds and thousands of Canadians 
who came from all corners of Canada on October 27. In my 
opinion, this bill is their bill. It responds to the wishes of Canadians 
as does the distinct society recognition that we voted on earlier this 
week. It is a response to Canadians who on October 27 
demonstrated clearly their love and affection for Canada.
<P>
	I am appalled that the member for Kootenay East insinuated that 
the only reason we Liberals are going to vote in favour of the bill is 
because of junkets, of freebies. It shows a lack of respect for 
Canadians when he denigrates the bill and the vote to that degree. It 
also slows a lack of understanding. If the member for Kootenay 
East would only listen to us and read the red book for a change 
instead of just referring to it, he would know that the Liberal Party 
has always respected the right of veto for Quebec and has for over 
30 years recognized its distinct character.
<P>
	The member for Kootenay East and others have criticized the 
Prime Minister for not having consulted Canadians. On the 
contrary, the people of Canada spoke on October 27, and when he 
saw the testimony by all Canadians, the Prime Minister read the 
people correctly. That was true democracy.
<P>
	He promised the people of Canada and on their behalf promised 
Quebec prior to October 30 to recognize Quebec for what it is. If 
Canadians cannot accept the fact that Quebec has a unique culture, 
unique language, a unique civil code and other institutions, then we 
are truly in serious trouble.
<P>
	Reform Party members are falling into the trap that has been laid 
for them by the current Leader of the Opposition by saying that 
they will repeal the legislation. I can say that hindsight is 50:50. 
Imagine if the result had been different on October 30. I wonder if 
the members who have spoken on the bill would speak the same 
way.
<P>
	The Prime Minister could not consult Canadians. He could not 
telephone Premier Harris or Premier Harcourt or even Premier 
Klein. But these same premiers spoke to Quebecers.
<P>
	I remember the appeal by Mr. Klein to Quebecers saying: ``We 
love you Quebec. Stay in Canada''. I remember the appeal by Mr. 
Harris who said to Quebecers: ``Your demands for the revision of 
the decentralization devolution of responsibilities are our demands. 
We will work hand in hand with you in Quebec because your 
aspirations for a renewed federation are our aspirations''. The 
Prime Minister could not take the time to consult the premiers. He 
had to make a decision. He relied on his experience, on his 
knowledge and understanding of the country and of the great 
province of Quebec and made three promises which tonight we will 
uphold. Those promises were the recognition of the distinct 
society, the regional veto and decentralization.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	If we recognize, as it seems to have been generally accepted 
across Canada, Quebec's distinctiveness, then we must also 
recognize that Quebec needs all the tools to protect and promote its 
language and its culture.
<P>
	An Albertan, a British Columbian or anyone else living in the 
rest of Canada is not threatened with the loss of culture or the 
English language. On the contrary, it is in use worldwide. However, 
as a co-founding people of this great country it has to be recognized 
that the French language and the French culture that exists in 
Quebec must be protected. The only way to protect that is to give 
the people of Quebec the veto. That veto is of utmost importance.
<P>
	The current Constitution says that seven provinces representing 
50 per cent of the population can amend the Constitution. That 
means seven provinces could gang up on British Columbia, seven 
provinces could gang up on Quebec, as happened in 1980, seven 
provinces could gang up on another province. That is why the veto 
is so important for Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I do not agree with what the member for Portneuf says about 
these three promises being far from sufficient and  not what 
Quebecers wanted before the referendum. The veto proposed by 
our Prime Minister protects Quebec even more; from now on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17648"> 17648 </A></B>
<P>
Constitution cannot be changed without the consent of the province 
of Quebec, as was the case in the past.
<P>
	I totally agree, the cornerstone of a country is its constitution. I 
also agree with the member for Kootenay East when he says that 
the Constitution is the property of the people who live in a country. 
However, the fact that Quebec has gone without signing the 
Constitution since 1982 has not prevented us Quebecers from 
developing and flourishing along with other parts of Canada.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that Great Britain does not even 
have a constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Think of the great powers and influence Great Britain has had 
over centuries. The fact that it does not have a Constitution has not 
prevented that country from developing. Quebec and Canada have 
evolved together and we can continue to evolve together.
<P>
	The member for Portneuf said that the veto is a watering down, 
but that is false. The veto protects Quebec right now. If his leader, 
the current Leader of the Opposition and future premier of Quebec, 
would agree to enshrining it in the Constitution we would be the 
first to embark on that process. However, his own chef de 
l'opposition has already gone on record saying that he does not 
want constitutional change. We all know what the Bloc Quebecois 
want. It will settle for nothing short of a separate Quebec.
<P>
	I defy the current Leader of the Opposition. When he occupies 
his new position in Quebec City as the premier of that province he 
should remember the words he spoke today in the House. He 
espoused that Canada is one of the most democratic countries in the 
world. He above all should know that in the position he occupies.
<P>
	Therefore, when I hear the Bloc Quebecois members speak of 
democracy and criticize the government for not respecting 
democracy I find it a bit strange. Their version of democracy is-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
If the vote is yes, they accept it as a yes. If it is no, they will accept 
it democratically, but the very night of the no victory, the Leader of 
the Opposition was threatening us with yet another referendum. A 
funny way of accepting democracy.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister has made a commitment on behalf of all 
Canadians to keep his promises.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A promise made by the Prime Minister is a promise kept. 
Tonight we will vote on that final step of his three promises. Yes, 
they must eventually be enshrined  through the constitutional 
process, hopefully as early as April 1997.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made a promise on behalf of Canadians and I 
am proud to be able to vote on it today, contrary to the statements 
of the member for Kootenay East who said that I should be 
ashamed to vote for this process.
<P>
	I have sat in the House this week and seen three different 
members of the Reform Party rise on points of order to indicate that 
certain members of the House were or were not absent. It shows the 
level to which Reformers will stoop for political gain.
<P>
	When it counted, the leader of the Progressive Conservatives, 
the hon. member of Parliament for Sherbrooke, was there. Madam 
Speaker, he was in the trenches with you and me in Quebec 
defending Canada during the delicate moments. I find it despicable 
that Reform Party members stand day after day to question the 
participation of the member of Parliament for Sherbrooke.
<P>
	Where were they on October 27? Where were they during the 
referendum? Today they have the audacity to stand here and again 
criticize the government for its initiatives. The Prime Minister 
responded to initiatives after listening to representations from 
caucus members and other people on B.C.'s regional veto. It is very 
important for British Columbia. It is also very important for 
Ontario to have its veto.
<P>
	When we talk about the distribution of population we have to 
respect regional differences in Canada. The member for Kootenay 
East has the audacity to criticize the way I vote when 50 per cent of 
his members yesterday voted against recognition of the veto for 
British Columbia.
<P>
	It is very easy to criticize. It is very easy to get involved in the 
debate of always giving into Quebec's demands. However I ask 
hon. members what it is Quebec has demanded over the past 30 
years that it has received.
<P>
	We have made sacrifices. We have made concessions in the past. 
I remind members from British Columbia that when British 
Columbia entered Confederation we made a concession uniquely 
for British Columbia. We honoured the concession to build a 
national railway from coast to coast. Otherwise British Columbia 
would not have entered Confederation.
<P>
	I remind colleagues from Prince Edward Island that we made a 
concession for Prince Edward Island. The concession was to 
recognize that island by granting it four members of Parliament 
and four senators.
<P>
	In terms of making a concession to Quebec, Quebecers do not 
want any more or any less than the rest of the provinces. They want 
to be recognized for what they are. They want to be given the tools

to develop and protect their language and culture. If that means 
making a  concession, it is well worth making it in order to keep 
our country united and strong.
<P>
	I will conclude to give another member a chance before we vote 
at five o'clock by saying it is easy to criticize. It is much harder to 
be constructive. It is easy, as some members have already stated in 
the House, to demolish. It is a lot more difficult to build.
<P>
	It is much easier to criticize, but it takes a lot of the leadership 
and courage for the Prime Minister to deliver on his commitment to 
Canadians of October 27.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	We could have consulted all the premiers of the provinces but we 
have seen what consulting the premiers does. The Mike Harrises 
and the Ralph Kleins of the world who loved Quebecers prior to the 
referendum will fall into the trap that the future premier of the 
province of Quebec will set for us. The Reform Party is falling 
hook, line and sinker into that trap. I appeal to all the premiers of 
the provinces to work hand in hand with the Prime Minister who 
has only taken the first very important step.
<P>
	The Chinese have a saying: the journey of a thousand miles starts 
with the first step. We have to take the first step. The Prime 
Minister has shown leadership today. I ask the future premier of the 
province of Quebec to respect his commitment and the democratic 
will expressed by all Quebecers, not only the 51 per cent that voted 
not but also the 15 or 30 per cent of those who voted yes, expecting 
to remain a province of Canada and work with us to build a better 
and stronger Canada.
<P>
	I appeal to the premiers of the provinces to work with the Prime 
Minister over the next 18 months or whatever time is allotted to 
respect the will and desire expressed by Canadians on October 27. I 
appeal to the premiers of all provinces not to let that tremendous 
show of affection go to waste. That is what will happen if we 
cannot come together and work hand in hand. Whether Reformers, 
members of the Bloc Quebecois or NDPers, all of us owe it to 
Canada to work hand in hand to make sure our country remains 
united and strong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thought the member for Vaudreuil had a lot of 
nerve when he indicated that somehow Reformers should be 
castigated because they were not involved enough in the 
referendum campaign, when he and his colleagues in the House and 
outside the House told us we should not get involved at all, that we 
should stay out of the referendum.
<P>
	It so happens that we got involved as much as the legislation 
would allow us to become involved. In fact many pollsters indicate 
that the Reform played a positive role in the outcome of the vote, in 
determining a no vote.
<P>
	Then the member and his colleagues have the nerve to say 
afterward that we should have been more involved. That is not 
right. It is beneath the dignity of this place to play those types of 
political games.
<P>
	I was expecting to ask the member a question. I hope he will be 
in his seat to respond during this question and comment period. I 
noticed in Doug Fisher's column in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> today that he 
commented on the Liberal caucus meeting where the whole issue of 
peace, order and good government was raised. He said it sent shock 
waves through the Liberal caucus meeting on December 5.
<P>
	He mentioned a couple of members' names and of course I 
cannot do that. Canadians can guess who these members are. He 
wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A senior member of the cabinet, so far successful as a minister and neither 
given to public philosophizing nor a publicity hound-stunned the gathering 
with the argument that the time had come for the government to unveil Plan B.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Of course the plan has to do with the peace, order and good 
government proposal. He went on to write that it would be a dose of 
tough love for the province of Quebec and that a lot of the 
proposals put forward in the Liberal caucus were similar to the 
proposals put forward by the leader of the Reform Party in the 
answers to the 20 questions.
<P>
	Then he wrote that a jock would call this playing hardball. He 
continued: ``The first doubt about such hardball begins in 
appraising'' the Prime Minister as he seems.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And that is ``bushed''. Tired out after 32 years of hustling and partisan 
hassling. As an example, take one his lines on Monday: ``I have a very good 
cabinet''. Tripe!</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This pretty accurately reflects what a lot of Canadians are 
thinking about the Prime Minister's approach on these 
constitutional issues: ram Bill C-110 through the House as though 
it is a national emergency, ram the distinct society concept through 
the House even though it has been rejected in the past by Canadians 
in a referendum. They have no regard for Canadians, the provinces 
or the failed concepts of the past.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Given the lack of support for the Prime Minister's proposals and 
given his suggestion that he would ensure a fairly worded question 
in a future Quebec referendum through the powers afforded him 
under peace, order and good government, how will the Prime 
Minister use the powers under his jurisdiction with regard to peace, 
order and good government to ensure the next referendum 
question, should there be one, will be fair and not subject to the 
criticism of the last question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the member I respond 
to a comment he made before about our invoking closure and this 
not being a national emergency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17650"> 17650 </A></B>
<P>
	The member does not live in Quebec as I do. He has not lived 
in Quebec as I have. If ever he visits Quebec, I invite him to come 
to my riding. If he had lived in Quebec he would understand 
clearly that there is an urgency.
<P>
	A commitment was made by the Prime Minister to make the 
necessary changes. He had to respond, not with a sense of urgency 
but with clear leadership, and this is what the Prime Minister has 
done.
<P>
	If we take a look at what is happening on the island of Montreal, 
sadly we see a large number of unemployed and one of the highest 
rates of poverty. Constitutional bickering since 1976 has put our 
region in a very sad state.
<P>
	The Prime Minister had to respond by giving leadership to 
ensure, as he said in Toronto, a certain amount of political stability 
not only for Canada but, more important, for Quebec.
<P>
	An awful lot of colleagues from Quebec have horror stories 
about small businesses by the twenties or thirties or even larger 
corporations establishing plants, not as they did in 1976 in other 
areas of Canada such as Toronto but unfortunately in places like 
Plattsburg and Florida. I recently spoke to a VP of Northern 
Telecom who is now opening up a plant in Southeast Asia because 
of the uncertainty. The Prime Minister had to react.
<P>
	On the question of veto, we are lending our veto. In all 
constitutional amendments the federal government has a right of 
veto on all aspects, whether there are three or four amending 
formulas. All we have done is simply lend our veto to each of the 
five regions. Therefore we were able to bypass the delicate process 
of constitutional reform doomed to failure in the past.
<P>
	I hope Reformers put aside their partisan politics. After the new 
year when, after you have had time to celebrate with your families 
in peace and love, as Canadians always do, I hope you will come 
back in February and work hand in hand with the government and 
the premiers to achieve the unity we deserve.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind hon. members to address the Chair rather 
than one another.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe we have 
only five minutes left in the debate this afternoon, and I will try to 
be brief. It may be the last time we have a chance to speak this year. 
I listened carefully to the hon. member for Vaudreuil, who raised 
quite a few points. He is also aware of the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois on the veto.
<P>
	I may recall that from what I read and what I heard from the 
Minister of Justice, this is not a constitutional veto but a veto for 
the guidance of the Parliament of Canada. That is why Quebecers 
realized this was not  what they wanted. I may also recall that what 
we say in this House reflects the views of the Quebec people.
<P>
	I may remind the hon. member-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> So we are not Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> No, but I would like to remind the hon. 
member that if he still reads Quebec newspapers, he will realize 
that hardly 24 per cent of the population of Quebec believes that the 
Prime Minister's proposals are a response to their expectations.
<P>
	So if we are talking about barely 24 per cent, I think we still have 
the right to rise in the House to say: ``Listen, this is an empty 
shell''. And we must not forget the 94 per cent of Quebecers voted 
in the last referendum. I will conclude with this. This means that in 
Quebec, 9.4 out of 10 understood the question. And I do not 
understand why the Quebecer from Saint-Maurice did not.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Thirty seconds for a short reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Thirty seconds. Very well, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	We are prepared to entrench the veto in the Constitution, but his 
own leader is preventing us. It is his fault.
<P>
	If he ever changes his mind, which he has done several times 
before, we would be willing to discuss entrenching the veto in the 
Constitution. However, with the means at our disposal, we decided 
to recognize their veto in this House, in the decisions made by the 
various departments. We lend our veto, as a government, to the 
various regions, including the province of Quebec.
<P>
	However, if your leader decides to change his mind, come and 
see us.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A nice little trinket for Christmas.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> No, dear colleagues, but I have good news.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yesterday afternoon we welcomed to the Table of the House of 
Commons a new table officer. It does not occur often in Parliament 
that we have new table officers but we have a new one today, Carol 
Chafe.
<P>
	Carol, in the name of my colleagues I welcome you.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A Christmas present.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, a Christmas present for the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to an order made Tuesday, December 12, 1995, in 
accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 78(3), it is my 
duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the third reading stage of the bill now 
before the House.

	She said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to split my time with my 
colleague from Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That would require unanimous 
consent. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to have the 
opportunity to begin debate on Motion No. 461. I believe it is 
especially appropriate to speak to this motion today.
<P>
	Earlier this afternoon I introduced to the House a petition that 
had been collected by the Melanie Carpenter Society. The 
petition had over half a million signatures, to be exact, 506,285 
names. The petitioners ask Parliament to enact legislation that 
would keep dangerous offenders, especially dangerous sex 
offenders, off the streets of our country. The first of the nine 
items on the petition states: That dangerous offenders and 
pedophiles should be locked up for life.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	As fate would have it, that is what we are debating today. The 
motion that I introduced jointly seconded by my colleague from 
Calgary Southeast, is targeted against sexual predators. It is an 
effort to get these offenders off the streets after their first 
conviction, not the second or third conviction which is often the 
case now.
<P>
	The motion asks that once an individual has been convicted of 
aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon or 
sexual assault that has been proceeded with by way of 
indictment or any sexual offence where the victim is a child, the 
convicted offender must be examined by two psychiatrists.
<P>
	If the two psychiatrists conclude that the offender is likely to 
commit a similar crime in the future, the attorney general shall 
direct that a dangerous offender application be initiated. The 
convicted offender would then have a dangerous offender 
hearing where the crown would have to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the offender was likely to reoffend.
<P>
	This motion carefully balances the rights of the offender and 
the protection of society. The motion only applies to convicted 
offenders. Two psychiatrists have to conclude that the offender 
is likely to reoffend. Then the  crown has to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt before a court that the offender is likely to 
reoffend.
<P>
	Society is protected by having early identification of 
dangerous sex offenders. Some may ask if this is possible. Not 
only is it possible but science is moving quickly in this regard.
<P>
	While I was conducting research on my private member's bill, 
Bill C-240, I came across the work of Professor Robert Hare of the 
University of British Columbia. Professor Hare teaches in the 
psychology department and is the leading authority in the subject 
of psychopathy. Professor Hare and his colleagues have developed 
tests to identify psychopaths for Correctional Service Canada as 
well as the prison systems in Washington and California states.
<P>
	It is generally accepted that these tests have an 85 per cent 
accuracy in identifying psychopaths. Some may argue that not all 
psychopaths are sex offenders and that is true. With this motion we 
would only be concerned with those psychopaths who were 
convicted of a serious sexual assault or pedophilia.
<P>
	If two psychiatrists conclude that someone who has just been 
convicted of one of these offences is a psychopath, then if our 
society values its protection he must be found to be a dangerous 
offender.
<P>
	In this instance we are talking about people like Clifford Olson, 
Paul Bernardo and Fernand Auger. I would like to use Auger as an 
example. We all know Auger as the man who kidnapped Melanie 
Carpenter from her place of work in Surrey, B.C., drove her out to 
the Fraser canyon where he sexually assaulted and murdered her. 
Auger was on parole at the time of this crime not for a sexual 
offence, but for robbery.
<P>
	However 10 years earlier Auger was convicted of sexual assault 
or more precisely, two instances where he committed extremely 
violent sexual assaults. One instance involved a 17-year-old 
prostitute, the other involved a 14-year-old prostitute. In both cases 
Auger picked up these girls, drove to a secluded location, put a gun 
to their heads, threatened to kill them and the raped and sodomized 
them.
<P>
	Arrested and convicted for both crimes, Auger received the 
remarkably lenient sentence of two years less a day and served his 
time in Ontario's provincial system. Why such a light sentence? As 
a Correctional Service Canada spokesman stated to a CBC reporter 
last March, Auger's crimes were not viewed as being violent 
because the victims were prostitutes and this implied a level of 
consent.
<P>
	However, after a subsequent conviction for robbery Auger ended 
up receiving a sentence in a federal institution. He submitted 
himself to a psychological review as part of a parole application. It 
was at this time that the true nature of Auger's personality came to 
light. Auger's psychological assessment reads as follows:  
``Appears to employ defence mechanisms, such as minimization, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17656"> 17656 </A></B>
<P>
rationalization and displacement to justify his criminal activity. He 
has a fairly advanced anti-social personality disorder''.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	In August 1994 the National Parole Board denied Auger parole, 
stating he was a high risk to reoffend. Unfortunately, because of the 
way the Corrections and Conditional Release Act is written, Auger 
was required to be released a few months later and because of this 
Melanie Carpenter is no longer with us.
<P>
	I am confident that had Auger been examined by two 
psychiatrists for his assaults on the two teenage prostitutes in 
Toronto, his anti-social personality would have been uncovered at 
that time. Had he been found to be a dangerous offender, he would 
have received an indefinite sentence.
<P>
	Contrary to what some may think, an indefinite sentence does 
not mean to lock them up and throw away the key. What it does 
mean, however, is that the offender is kept in custody until the 
parole board is convinced that the offender does not pose a serious 
risk to society.
<P>
	It is mainly up to the offender to determine how long the 
sentence will be. If the required treatment is taken and shows real 
progress, it need not be a long incarceration. Parole eligibility is 
after three years and then every two years thereafter.
<P>
	The greatest value of the indefinite sentence is twofold. First, for 
those offenders who show no inclination of rehabilitation, there is 
no pressure on the correctional system to get them ready for 
release, whether they are prepared or not.
<P>
	Second, for those who are released, the justice system can 
closely monitor their activities in the community. If this had 
happened in Auger's case, maybe two people would still be alive, 
Melanie Carpenter and Fernand Auger.
<P>
	I believe this motion is sound. It satisfies not only the Reform 
Party's objectives for public safety, but the red book objectives of 
the Liberals to protect women and children.
<P>
	Similarly, the justice critic for the Bloc Quebecois has frequently 
expressed her concern for the safety of women and children. I only 
hope that she is equally concerned about protecting them from 
sexual assault, sexual predators, as she is from protecting them 
from firearms.
<P>
	This motion targets only a small percentage of the Canadian 
population, sexual predators. I fully agree with the over half a 
million individuals who signed the Melanie Carpenter Society 
petition, who believe that dangerous sex offenders and pedophiles 
belong behind bars, not on our streets.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak today in support of  the motion of my 
colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. It is 
unfortunate, in fact an abysmal comment on Canadian society, that 
we require this kind of legislation. However, I am heartened by it 
and am honoured to second the motion.
<P>
	Under current law, a sex offender cannot be detained beyond a 
jail sentence. We may ensure their stay beyond their statutory 
release date only if a psychiatrist signs a certificate saying that the 
inmate suffers from a mental disorder that would likely result in 
serious injury to others.
<P>
	The motion before us today provides the point of difference that 
Reform brings to the debate. Rather than attempt analysis at the 
end of a sentence, an offender should be subject to analysis by a 
psychiatrist before sentencing and then, if need be, deemed a 
dangerous offender. This supports reasoned argument to keep 
incarcerated those who pose a threat to society.
<P>
	This is exactly the kind of legislation that this country needs. 
This issue should be non-partisan. I believe all of us in this House 
want to safeguard the rights of victims and, in this instance, the 
rights of victims of sex offences.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the law of the land should not only 
safeguard those who already have been victimized, but the law 
should also endeavour to protect us from further victimization by 
those who demonstrate a dangerous propensity to commit sex 
offences.
<P>
	Currently, we sit in the House listening to a great deal, possibly 
too much debate on national unity, when under our noses other 
important problems need to be addressed. We can do something 
positive here. Instead of splitting apart, instead of limiting debate 
on issues of importance, we can join together today on an issue that 
concerns us all. I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support 
this important motion.
<P>
	The motion we are debating today specifically addresses the 
issue of protecting society from sexual predators, people who are 
driven to inflict harm on women and children in our society. Sexual 
predators are people like Clifford Olson, like Paul Bernardo. They 
prey on the weak and vulnerable and they enjoy it. They have been 
psychologically profiled as deviants who repeat their crimes and 
even enjoy them. These are the people who will be affected by this 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	By passing this motion we will be saying that yes, we believe 
that we have a moral obligation as parliamentarians to protect 
society from those who seek to prey on its weak and vulnerable; 
yes, we believe that for the safety of society certain offenders 
should be required to undergo psychological evaluation and under 
certain circumstances should be deemed to be dangerous offenders. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17657"> 17657 </A></B>
<P>
This allows us the freedom and opportunity to keep those 
individuals in prison, those who pose an unacceptable threat to 
society.
<P>
	In this instance, to some extent we are talking about locking the 
door and throwing away the key. That statement unto itself may 
sound unduly harsh; however, when it is rephrased it may become 
more palatable and perhaps better understood. Does anyone here 
believe that someone like Clifford Olson or Paul Bernardo should 
ever be allowed to walk the streets again? I do not think so. It 
would take a tremendous amount of convincing to dissuade me of 
this opinion.
<P>
	The criminal must have served many years in prison. Treatment 
must have been completed and demonstrated to have had a positive 
effect. Remorse must be clearly demonstrated. Compensation of 
some kind would have to have been made to the victims of the 
crime by the criminal. Then and only then would I even entertain 
the notion of allowing the individual the opportunity to undergo 
further psychological assessment to determine the possibility of 
recidivism. This is not an issue of being harsh; this is a basic 
human issue about protecting the most vulnerable.
<P>
	Protection of society will not be accomplished solely by the 
provision in the motion under debate today, but it does go a long 
way. Clearly, the preference would be to treat sexual offenders and 
to cure them of their illness. However, when this effort has failed 
we have a moral obligation to protect society. What we are 
debating today is whether the House sees this moral obligation; 
whether the House feels this moral obligation so strongly that it 
will make the moral obligation a legal obligation.
<P>
	Some may ask why we need this legislation. Allow me through 
the use of an anecdote to demonstrate why this kind of legislation is 
necessary. There are times when my colleagues opposite are 
critical when we cite real life stories. However, unfortunately, they 
abound. They do represent a body of anecdotal evidence which 
cannot be ignored. If we can introduce legislation at little or no cost 
which will inconvenience few in society and by doing so save lives 
or prevent the commission of crimes, then we must commit to that 
effort. On that note, allow me to share with the House a sad story.
<P>
	On November 18, 1984 Wray Budreo became a free man and 
every parent's nightmare. For days his face had been plastered on 
newspapers throughout southern Ontario. Budreo had a 32-year 
history of child molesting, including 22 convictions for sex 
offences. However, because he had served his full six-year term, 
there would be no parole or probation, no restrictions on his 
movements, no conditions for mandatory treatment. He was 
bundled into the trunk of a police car and spirited past the 
protesters who awaited him outside Kingston Penitentiary. I do not 
know if this man has reoffended. I pray that he has not. What 
concerns me greatly is that a known sex offender who was expected 
to reoffend was released from one of our jails.
<P>
	I hear a familiar refrain all too often from people who doubt their 
own ability to shield their children from sexual abuse, especially 
without being overly paranoid or obsessive. We must first know 
some of the facts.
<P>
	Not every child is equally at risk. Offenders target especially 
vulnerable children: lonely kids, those with disabilities or who 
have difficulty communicating, youngsters with absent dads who 
may be looking for a father figure, and those whose behavioural 
problems make it unlikely they will ever be believed if they do 
speak up.
<P>
	Of course, the biggest risk factor is contact with a potential 
abuser. Here the facts contrast with the headlines. The dangerous 
stranger is the exception rather than the rule. A 1992 Statistics 
Canada survey found that in cases of child sexual assault, 48 per 
cent of the abusers were a parent or family member. Another 43 per 
cent astoundingly were friends or acquaintances. Only 5 per cent 
were strangers.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Whoever the offender, the offence is clear. It is always illegal for 
an adult to engage in sexual contact with a child under the age of 
14. It is also illegal for an adult who is in a position of trust or 
autonomy to engage in sexual contact with a young person under 
the age of 18. The law recognizes what adults know. Children can 
be manipulated especially by the people they trust. Whether they 
say yes does not matter because the adult is the one who must say 
no.
<P>
	There are no national statistics on the number of children 
molested every year but whatever the figure, it is too high. It can 
only be reduced one child at a time. That means we must make an 
effort to deal with potential abusers by ensuring that dangerous, 
repeat sexual offenders remain in a place where they cannot 
threaten our children or society as a whole.
<P>
	Even the term ``potential abusers'' is quite misleading in this 
context because we are referring to people who have already been 
convicted of a criminal offence but who we strongly suspect will 
have the potential to reoffend. Suggesting that dangerous offenders 
of this kind are only potential abusers gives them too much credit.
<P>
	An important component of this debate revolves around the issue 
of our ability to rehabilitate the convicted sex offender. One of the 
reasons for this legislation is the widespread disagreement about 
the success or even the possibility of rehabilitating a sexual 
offender.
<P>
	Two centuries after the birth of modern psychiatry there are 
numerous treatments for sex offenders but as yet no consensus on 
the results of such treatments. A forensic psychologist at the Oak 
Ridge Facility for the Criminally Insane in Penetanguishene, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17658"> 17658 </A></B>
<P>
Ontario states:  ``We do not seem to be having much of an impact 
on sex offenders''.
<P>
	What are the costs to society? An argument is made that the 
annual cost to supervise an offender while on parole is only $9,400 
whereas the cost of incarceration for a year is reported to be close 
to $70,000. Simply put, I believe there are times when social 
protection is worth the price. This may just be an instance where 
we have to swallow the costs. If it means saving 22 people from 
being victimized by a man like Wray Budreo then $70,000 a year is 
worth it.
<P>
	Canada spends about $11 million per year on dozens of programs 
for sex offenders. About 5,000 of the 23,000 convicts in the federal 
corrections system have sex crimes on their record. The 
government proudly points to the statistics that only 6 per cent of 
sex offenders repeat their crimes within three years of their release. 
However, researchers who study sex offenders say that the 
recidivism rate jumps to about 50 per cent when the criminals are 
tracked over a decade. It is always the part that is left out that is the 
most startling.
<P>
	There is little evidence, or at least there is lots of contradictory 
evidence, that therapy reduces recidivism. I am concerned by this 
contradiction. Until we are more certain of treatments that will 
reduce recidivism, I am uncomfortable in allowing potential 
predators back on the streets.
<P>
	Belatedly, it is important that those who commit sexual offences 
be categorized as to whether or not they are psychopaths. Experts 
agree that the recidivism rate for psychopaths is triple that of 
non-psychopaths.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me reaffirm my very strong support for this 
motion. I believe that if we could encourage the justice minister 
and the government to pass this motion, we would go a giant step 
toward making our country a safer one in which to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the two hon. members who contributed to this 
debate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley has 
introduced a motion at the same time as her private member's bill 
is before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs for 
further consideration. Admittedly, Bill C-240 pursues a somewhat 
different angle on the subject. I want to commend her for her 
dogged determination to change the dangerous offender legislation. 
It is obviously a subject with which she feels very deeply. She has 
done a lot of work in making her presentation both on the present 
motion and in respect of the private member's bill.
<P>
	Does the dangerous offender procedure need improvement? 
Quite possibly it could be improved. I will start by addressing one 
proposed change with which I disagree, a proposal that is central to 
this motion.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The motion provides that every time two psychiatrists determine 
that in effect an offender poses a high risk of reoffending, the 
attorney general of the province in which the offender was 
convicted shall direct that the dangerous offender application be 
brought. I do not believe it is appropriate to eliminate the discretion 
of prosecutors in bringing dangerous offender applications.
<P>
	The criteria for a dangerous offender finding are contained 
within the Criminal Code. That is a concept created by criminal law 
and supported by criminal procedure. It is certainly true these 
criteria rely heavily on psychiatric prediction of risk, but medical 
standards are not the only ones that have to be met.
<P>
	Section 753 of the Criminal Code requires that the likelihood of 
an offender causing further harm must be established to the 
satisfaction of the court. This is not entirely or even primarily a 
matter of medical or statistical prediction. Indeed it is a legal 
decision made according to criteria legislated by Parliament. The 
crown should possess the discretion considering all of the evidence 
available to it to estimate whether an application will be strong 
enough to meet this legal standard. I will return to the subject of the 
role of prosecutors in this process.
<P>
	I would like to review the history of part XXIV of the Criminal 
Code in order to understand why the law is structured the way it is. 
I am not saying that part XXIV should never be changed, but the 
evolution of the dangerous offender concept and the restrictions the 
charter of rights imposes on that concept indicate that we should 
proceed cautiously in broadening it or oversimplifying it.
<P>
	The dangerous offender provisions have their origins in the 
habitual criminal provisions added to the Criminal Code by 
Parliament in 1947. A person found to be such a habitual criminal 
could be sentenced to preventive detention for life. The state had to 
prove the offender on three separate occasions had been convicted 
of an indictable offence for which he was liable for imprisonment 
for five years or more and was persistently leading a criminal life.
<P>
	If this sounds vague and ripe for abuse, it was. In 1969 a report 
by the Canadian Committee on Corrections, the Ouimet 
committee, found that a substantial number of these habitual 
offenders constituted a social nuisance but were not really 
dangerous. In 1948 Canada tried out the concept of a criminal 
sexual psychopath law. In 1958 it was thrown in with the habitual 
offender provisions under the name of dangerous sexual offender. 
Once again the Ouimet committee found in 1969 that the dangerous 
sexual offender legislation was capturing many non-dangerous 
sexual offenders and was missing the dangerous ones.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17659"> 17659 </A></B>
<P>
	These provisions were repealed in 1977 and replaced with the 
dangerous offender provisions we see now in the Criminal Code. 
These amendments were designed to be more precise, to target 
the most dangerous serious offenders and similarly to avoid 
widening the net too much. In essence Parliament was saying: 
``Let us target the worst offenders without sweeping in the low 
risk or nuisance cases''.
<P>
	The dangerous offender legislation contained in part XXI, now 
part XXIV, passed a major hurdle in the Supreme Court of 
Canada's decision of R. v. Lyons in 1987. The court ruled that the 
dangerous offender provisions did not violate the protections in the 
charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I mention this case not so much for its support of the current law 
as for the firm indication by the Supreme Court that any law that 
seeks to sentence one of its citizens to an indefinite term in a 
penitentiary must be well tailored and confined to the most serious 
circumstances.
<P>
	I offer one example from the judgment upholding the dangerous 
offender legislation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The legislation narrowly defines a class of offenders with respect to whom it 
may properly be invoked, and prescribes quite specifically the conditions under 
which an offender may be designated dangerous. The criteria in Part XXI are 
anything but arbitrary in relation to the objective sought to be attained; they are 
clearly designed to segregate a small group of highly dangerous criminals 
posing threats to the physical or mental well-being of their victims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The existing dangerous offender system contains three 
components: a focus on the most serious offences, a focus on the 
pattern of the offender's conduct, and an assessment of the 
likelihood of the offender's continuing his serious offending. These 
criteria have to be met if they are to justify locking up individuals 
indefinitely.
<P>
	In broadening the target group so much, the motion before us 
runs a serious risk of conflicting with the decision of R. v. Lyons. It 
would broaden Part XXIV to capture any sex offence against a 
child. This would include cases of sexual interference under 
section 151 and an invitation to sexual touching under section 152 
of the Criminal Code. While these crimes carry a maximum 
penalty of 10 years imprisonment, individual offences usually do 
not receive such lengthy sentences, nor do they typically involve 
the degree of violence envisioned by Part XXIV.
<P>
	I doubt the Supreme Court would tolerate this net widening, 
particularly when, given the new rules prescribed elsewhere in this 
motion, crown attorneys would be forced to launch so many more 
applications. The court, as in the Lyons case, is vigilant to the 
potential for abuse in the overall structure of the procedure.
<P>
	Returning to the issue of prosecutorial discretion, the Supreme 
Court in the Lyons case also stated it was important for the crown 
to have some discretion in bringing dangerous offender 
applications and that the absence of any such discretion could lead 
to a conclusion that the law was arbitrary.
<P>
	I have raised several objections to the concept in this draft. In the 
interest of perspective, I point out how successful Part XXIV of the 
Criminal Code has proven. Between 1977 and 1995 approximately 
143 offenders were found to be dangerous offenders and sentenced 
indeterminately to Canadian penitentiaries. Of that number, 134 
remain incarcerated.
<P>
	There are signs now that the provinces are using the procedure 
more often. Successful applications usually average eight or nine a 
year. In 1993 there were 15 successful cases; in 1994 there were 13, 
and we will all remember the recent designation of Paul Bernardo 
as a dangerous offender.
<P>
	We can improve the dangerous offender legislation but not with 
the elements in this motion. I look forward to the review of the hon. 
member's private member's bill the standing committee, to which 
this motion is quite similar.
<P>
	I would like to deal with this private members' bill and I am 
hopeful this motion will not be successful to allow us the 
opportunity to deal with these things one at a time.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to 
express my support for the private members' bill from the member 
for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. It is timely, the right bill 
at the right place at the right time. I cannot imagine that anyone 
would not accept that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is not a bill, it is a motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> A heckler across the way.
<P>
	In my life I dealt with sexual predators. This motion is exactly 
what we need and I express my support for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I speak to the motion as someone who is not a lawyer, 
someone not involved in police work and never has been. Perhaps I 
can offer a slightly different viewpoint and hopefully a constructive 
one.
<P>
	The member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley tended to 
mix together two types of offenders, the sex offender, a paedophile 
and so on, and the psychopath. These are two very different types 
of people with different problems.
<P>
	In the cases of the sex offender and the psychopath it is 
acknowledged that both know right from wrong. However, some 
sex offenders, no matter how horrendous their crimes, feel 
remorse. They may be driven by a form of compulsion. The 
difference between that type of  person and a psychopath is there is 
no remorse. Sometimes there is no compulsion either.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17660"> 17660 </A></B>
<P>
	I cannot accept that a Paul Bernardo necessarily will offend 
again. I cannot accept that he is necessarily driven by compulsion. 
There are instances of people driven by compulsion who know 
remorse and are a danger in the sense that they will repeat the 
crime. However, it may not be a crime as horrendous as we saw in 
the Bernardo case.
<P>
	The motion is deficient and does not serve as an adequate 
deterrent factor. We run the risk by giving so much power to 
psychiatrists of incarcerating some sex offenders indefinitely. 
However, we still will not stop the Paul Bernardos of this world. 
These people commit those crimes because they lack any basic 
human compassion. Whatever the crime, it may be for fun, not 
compulsion.
<P>
	Passing a law which increases the probability of putting people 
away indefinitely is not the way to deal with the Paul Bernardos of 
the world.
<P>
	My Reform colleagues may be surprised when I suggest that in 
the case of the genuine psychopath, the serial killer and the person 
who stalks and kills children deliberately for games, for fun, the 
only deterrent is a capital punishment deterrent.
<P>
	These are the people who must be defined very carefully. I do not 
want to see capital punishment come galloping back into the the 
House as an issue. However, This type of legislation does not get at 
the type of person I believe the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley is really after.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The genuine serial killer, the person who does it for fun, is not 
worried about going to jail indefinitely. This will not stop the 
person at all, whereas capital punishment very narrowly defined for 
this type of person would fit the bill perfectly.
<P>
	When we look at it that way we have to question whether to 
bring in legislation that addresses the type of sex offender who does 
know remorse but can reoffend. As we heard from the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, the current 
legislation does not address that type of person. He is required to be 
judged by the courts about whether he reoffends.
<P>
	It is very dangerous when one starts to look at people who have a 
genuine sense of wrongdoing, a genuine sense of remorse. We run 
the risk of giving them no hope whatsoever of coming back to 
society. The motion goes too far in one way and not far enough in 
the other.
<P>
	If it were possible to define capital punishment that narrowly, as 
in the Paul Bernardos of the world, I do not think the member's 
motion would be sufficiently constructive at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr.  Speaker, 
this motion is typical of the Reform Party and the nonsense we 
have had to put up with from this group and its obsession with law 
and order issues. It is obsessed with the notion that if we lock 
people we will solve the crime problem of the country; lock them 
all up and we will not have any crime.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have lots of experience in world affairs in the 
last 300 or 400 years, and probably a good deal longer, indicating 
that policy does not work.
<P>
	The Reform Party, however, sticks its head in the sand, goes 
back to the middle ages and takes the view that if we lock people 
up, whip them, chain them and beat them to death, somehow we 
will solve the crime problem.
<P>
	Crime has been a problem throughout human experience. It is 
not something that just happened in 1995. It is not something that 
just happened in 1993 or whenever it was the Reform Party formed 
itself. It has been a problem with human existence since Cain and 
Abel.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite might have forgotten the story of Cain 
and Abel, but I will not recite it for them tonight. There was a 
murder then. There was no death penalty. I do not recall that Cain 
got the death penalty. He got punished but he did not get the death 
penalty.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite rant and rave about locking people up 
and throwing away the key. The hon. member for Wild Rose stood 
up this morning to introduce a private member's bill that would 
take away the right of parole, the right of statutory release and all 
kinds of things that are what we call carrots to try to get people to 
improve their behaviour while in prison. He wants to take that 
away, lock them up for the maximum time we can lock them up and 
hope that when we spring them on society after 12 or 25 years in 
prison somehow they will be reformed and that society will not 
suffer.
<P>
	Some of us happen to know better than the hon. member for Wild 
Rose. If he would listen to some reason once in a while instead of 
spouting the constant nonsense he does from his seat he might learn 
something from the experience others have had with the criminal 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Not from the likes of you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> He says he will not learn it from me. All right. 
Never mind taking it from me. Take it from the experts, the people 
who work in the system. If the hon. member would listen to them 
he would not be spouting the nonsense he is spouting now and that 
he was spouting earlier.
<P>
	He has obviously convinced the very gullible member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley who has swallowed his line, 
hook, line and sinker. The poor soul has been totally distracted by 
the hon. member for Wild Rose and his silly nonsense on locking 
people up and throwing away the key. That is all we ever get from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17661"> 17661 </A></B>
<P>
the  Reform Party. We had it earlier today. Now we have got it in 
this motion.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	Let me turn to the motion before the House. What we have now 
is a system where under the Criminal Code if a person has 
committed a particularly serious offence and is known to be a 
dangerous offender or there is some risk that the person may be a 
dangerous offender, we give a discretion to the attorney general of 
the province in which the prosecution is taking place to bring an 
application to have the offender declared a dangerous offender.
<P>
	That discretion is given to the attorney general of each province 
who is an elected official, a member of the cabinet in the province. 
Presumably, he or she is a person who has won the trust and 
confidence of the people, and a lot more trust and confidence than 
has been earned by the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley. The hon. member's party has not been 
elected as a majority party anywhere and is not likely to be, so she 
may not have the advantage of being elected attorney general. I 
must say I would pity the people in the province in which she ever 
became an attorney general.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the discretion is now given to the attorney general 
of the province to decide whether to bring this application. The 
hon. member wants to take away that discretion. She wants to put 
the discretion in the hands of a group of psychiatrists and if the 
psychiatrists say the person cannot be cured or has a particular kind 
of problem, bango, you lock him up and throw away the key.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast wags her head. I am 
correct in what I am saying. The hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley is not wagging her head. She knows I am 
right. She knows I have accurately described the motion she has put 
to the House. Frankly, it is a very sad commentary in this day and 
age, considering that the age of enlightenment which took place 
200 or 300 years ago came upon mankind and gave us some notion 
of justice and fairness, that members of Parliament are now giving 
this idea that locking up people solves the problem.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Justice will likely come out with some of 
these figures in his speech a little later. However, I want to point 
out to the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
that the United States take the policy that she advocates fairly 
seriously. They lock people up and they throw away the key.
<P>
	The hon. member will find, if she looks at the figures and I know 
she does not like to do this because facts are always a problem for 
the Reform Party. Mr. Speaker, you know that as well as I do. There 
is nothing worse than a set of facts to face some of the hon. 
members opposite. It makes them quail and shake because facts are 
something they do not want to know about.
<P>
	In the United States the imprisonment rate for persons convicted 
of criminal offences is four times what the rate is in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Do you mean like Carpenter and Dailey and 
Cameron?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Clifford Olson. Paul 
Bernardo. Think about what you are saying, Peter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> If the hon. members opposite would stay quiet for 
a minute and listen to some facts, they might learn. Instead, when 
they are confronted with facts they yell and shout and try to pretend 
that they cannot hear them because it hurts them to hear facts.
<P>
	Let me reiterate what I said. I said that in the United States the 
imprisonment rate is four times what it is in this country. Their 
crime rate is significantly higher and is rising. Our crime rate has 
gone down in the last few years, thanks in part to the magnificent 
efforts of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Oh, oh. And we have got gun control now too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Hon. members opposite oh and ah. I know they 
would love to see the crime rates go up to bolster their arguments 
that people should be locked up. The fact is the crime rate has gone 
down.
<P>
	We have had people locked up for longer periods, it is true. You 
can ask the solicitor general about the fact that our prisons are 
overcrowded, but I am saying to the hon. members opposite-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> We are not talking about parking ticket 
violations. We are talking about violent sexual offenders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I wish the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster would listen to what I say. If he would 
listen to the facts instead of yelling all the time, he might learn 
something. By constantly yelling he does not gain anything.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> It is not worth listening to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Southeast is 
exactly the same. How can I continue with this constant yelling? 
Could you please call for some order, Mr. Speaker. I leave it to you.
<P>
	As I am trying to say with all this yelling that is going on, the 
fact is the crime rate of the United States is higher than ours in spite 
of the lock up policy and it is rising. In other words, any reasonable 
person who approaches these facts would conclude that the policy 
of locking people up and throwing away the key, as is advocated by 
the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, would 
result in an increased crime rate and more recidivism. That is 
exactly the American experience.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17662"> 17662 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member wags her head now. Confronted with facts, 
she says no, that cannot be right. But the fact is it is right. All 
she has to do is look at the figures. Why does she not read these 
figures? I have never heard her cite these figures in one of her 
speeches. I have never heard the hon. member for Wild Rose talk 
about this. I also do not hear the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast bother herself with facts in her speeches either. All we 
hear are these opinions made up out of the air.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	What I am convinced the Reform Party members-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In a 
filibuster, does the member not have to use some reasoned 
argument at some point?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is not a point of order, but I would 
ask the hon. parliamentary secretary, who is an experienced 
member, not to associate the Chair with his remarks as he did 
earlier. The Chair neither agrees nor disagrees with remarks of any 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to address the Chair. I cannot 
address hon. members opposite. I would not want to break the rules 
by referring to hon. members and asking them if they agree. I can 
only assume, Sir, that you have the good sense to agree with my 
arguments because I have to put my arguments to you and not to 
them. I cannot expect much on the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> What arguments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says he is troubled because I 
am not dealing with facts in my speech. If he had only listened he 
would have heard facts. However, he did not listen. He was busy 
yelling at me.
<P>
	The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley in 
her remarks has blatantly ignored all the facts that deal with the 
incarceration of inmates.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I first want to acknowledge the 
very significant interest shown by the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. For many months she has 
expressed a great deal of interest here in the House and generally in 
finding a way to protect society from the very highest risk 
offenders. Her private member's bill is cogent evidence of her 
commitment to that cause. She is to be congratulated on that 
commitment.
<P>
	May I also say that the hon. member for Calgary Southeast who 
spoke to today's motion has also demonstrated that she is most 
committed to finding ways of dealing with this risk to society.
<P>
	I hope it is apparent from the speeches made on this side of the 
House in this debate that the members of the government share that 
commitment.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. parliamentary secretary, has developed at 
some length the rationale behind present part XXIV of the Criminal 
Code and its purpose. Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, the 
dangerous offender provisions, is a unique advantage which we 
enjoy in Canada and which sets us apart from many states in the 
United States.
<P>
	The question is what about the bill? Would the bill be an 
effective way of improving public safety when it comes to high risk 
offenders? Much as the government is in agreement with the 
objectives stated by the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley, the government is not able to support this 
motion. We have concluded that the means contemplated by the 
hon. member's bill and by this motion would not be valid 
constitutional legislation.
<P>
	What efforts is the government taking to try to meet the 
perceived need in a fashion that we believe would be valid or 
effective? Let me spend a few moments in the sense of reporting to 
the House what steps we have been taking in that regard.
<P>
	The solicitor general and I have been working for some months 
to develop proposals that will both improve part XXIV and add 
other provisions to the criminal law which will equip our system to 
deal more effectively with the highest risk offender.
<P>
	In May of this year the solicitor general and I convened a 
meeting here in Ottawa to which we invited officials of the 
Correctional Service of Canada, high ranking police officers, both 
from the RCMP and provincial forces, and psychologists who are 
trained and experienced in dealing with the psychopathic 
personality referred to by the hon. member. We also invited 
representatives of the Ontario provincial attorney general's office, 
police officers, defence lawyers and crown prosecutors. Involved 
in the meeting as well was an attorney from Washington state who 
has experience dealing with the sexual predator law in place in that 
jurisdiction. We spent much of the weekend looking at the present 
facts in Canada, the state of the law and the American experience in 
trying to identify specific steps we would take by statutory 
amendment or changes in practice to make society safer when it 
comes to high risk offenders.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	We came to a number of conclusions. I hope that many of them 
will come forward in the near future in the form of statutory 
proposals.
<P>
	I would like to explain the general direction which we plotted at 
that time and in the months since in order to assure the House that 
we are both aware of the problem and working in good faith toward 
solutions.
<P>
	First, we concluded that part XXIV can be improved, for 
example, by removing the requirement for the testimony of two

<P>

<B><A NAME="17663"> 17663 </A></B>
<P>
removing the prospect of a definite term of incarceration, leaving 
only indefinite imprisonment as an option available to the court.
<P>
	We felt that the whole process of identifying and assessing 
accused persons to determine whether they might be the subject of 
a dangerous offender application could be improved with better 
protocols or assessment. We are developing specific proposals in 
that regard.
<P>
	Furthermore, it was felt that if part XXIV or the dangerous 
offender provisions were to be effective, a flagging system should 
be put in place throughout Canada so that police officers who are 
investigating or charging and crown attorneys who are preparing 
for trial and determining whether to ask the attorney general's 
consent to bring a part XXIV application could identify on the facts 
of any given case whether a specific suspect or accused is 
appropriate for such a disposition.
<P>
	The solicitor general introduced a national flagging system 
which became effective in September of this year, which is 
intended to achieve that purpose. So far the flagging system has 
been well received. It seems to be working smoothly and 
effectively. No doubt it will be improved operationally as time 
passes, but I believe it is a significant improvement in the system.
<P>
	Other proposals were discussed on that occasion which have 
been under review since that time. I hope and expect they will form 
part of the legislation which the government will put before the 
House at an appropriate time. For example, earlier this year there 
was a report delivered by a federal-provincial-territorial task force 
on high risk offenders which made a proposal that we find very 
attractive.
<P>
	As the House knows, for a crown prosecutor, with the consent of 
the attorney general, to bring a dangerous offender application and 
for a court to declare someone a dangerous offender, with the 
consequence that they face indefinite incarceration, requires that a 
certain evidentiary threshold be crossed. Obviously, it is an 
exacting one because the consequence is very significant.
<P>
	However, there are those cases in which the public safety is at 
risk because of the high likelihood of an offender re-offending and 
yet the prosecution does not feel that it can meet the high threshold 
now provided for in part XXIV. The federal-provincial-territorial 
task force proposed that in circumstances such as those, there 
should be a second category to which crown attorneys and courts 
can resort to protect society, but which involve a threshold of proof 
which is less exacting than part XXIV. They describe this as the 
long term offender category.
<P>
	In circumstances that were appropriate for such applications, the 
crown might ask the court, when dealing with someone who has 
some risk of re-offending, not only to impose a term of 
incarceration for the original offence, but also to impose at the end 
of that term a  mandatory period of supervision for a duration as 
long as 10 years after they are out of prison, during which time the 
person would be obligated to comply with stated conditions, 
whether they be complying with the reporting requirements, taking 
treatment as specified, wearing electronic bracelets or whatever the 
case may be. There would be some reasonable measure of 
continuing knowledge and control of people after they are out of 
prison when there is a real risk they will reoffend.
<P>
	That suggestion from the FPT task force strikes the government 
as constructive and practical. I hope to put legislation before the 
House at the appropriate time which would codify that kind of 
provision.
<P>
	We have examined provisions already in the Criminal Code such 
as sections 161 and 810.1 which empower the court to make either 
restraining orders-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> How come these guys keep getting out? How come 
they keep getting out to reoffend?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> The hon. member asks why people get out and 
reoffend. Right now the orders provided for in sections 161 and 
810.1 of the Criminal Code are very narrow in scope. They provide, 
for example, that where someone has been convicted of a crime 
involving sexual violence or interference with a young person, the 
court can make an order prohibiting the person from going near a 
playground or a school yard or some other such place. That is very 
narrow and circumscribed.
<P>
	We are examining the prospect of taking that jurisdiction and 
broadening it so that if someone is released from prison where 
there is a demonstrated high risk of reoffending, the court will be 
empowered to make orders of more general application.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> I have a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member on a point of order, but 
I indicate to her that the debate ends in 35 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister has already spoken for 
10 minutes and there is still a minute left in the debate, from my 
calculations.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I always appreciate it when members tell 
me the time is faster than it was otherwise. According to my clock 
the time expires in 10 seconds. If the minister wants to get up for 
another nine seconds, he is welcome to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I will conclude because 
obviously the time has run out.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 93, the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.45 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
