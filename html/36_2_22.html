this week in Ottawa, as part of the International Co-operation 
Days, the Canadian International Development Agency is meeting 
with over 1,200 representatives from all sectors involved in 
international development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meetings will enable the minister responsible to outline her 
priorities and to hear from Canadians and overseas partners about 
their work in Africa, Latin America and Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through CIDA and its partners, Canadians can be proud of our 
contribution to creating a more secure and prosperous world for 
us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Kitchener Centre, organizations such as the 
Mennonite Central Committee have worked with CIDA and have been 
able to assist individuals who are in need and living in 
devastated areas such as Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to represent a community that has a long and 
distinguished tradition of helping the citizens in the world in 
times of crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne, the government indicated that we 
will do more.  For example, CIDA will support programs that 
educate young girls in Africa, assist women in Asia to start—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, five self-proclaimed skinheads, convicted in the 
murder of Sikh Temple caretaker Nirmal Singh Gill, were given 
prison sentences of 15 to 18 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These prison terms were already reduced by three years and will 
probably be further reduced in the Liberal's soft criminal 
justice system.  Life should mean life, but criminal penalties 
are routinely watered down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want tougher penalties for violent crime.  Racism has 
no place in our society.  Our diversity is our strength and a 
valuable asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey have shown tolerance throughout this entire 
episode.  We can also commend our local community leaders for 
keeping things calm.  Our media treated this matter fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we can commend the work of our RCMP despite limited 
resources for successfully bringing this matter to justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the Minister of Labour for her efforts to come to grips 
with the diverse problems of homelessness.  I commend the 
government for its support of regional forums and research 
projects designed to identify the real local problems in places 
like Toronto and Peterborough. The federal government must get a 
good handle on these matters across the nation before allocating 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has now come to act.  In provinces like Ontario there 
is no one but the federal government that can make a real impact 
on homelessness.  Where provincial governments are not willing, 
we must work directly with municipal governments and NGOs to make 
real changes.  Federal resources and know how, in partnership 
with local groups, can make a huge difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us act now to help the homeless and those in fear of 
becoming homeless.

Team Canada 1972 is the Canadian team of the century according

Soviet Union's elite team.

to play.

<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

there for stated priorities where there are not funds available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have used those for a number of priorities such as youth 
services projects in British Columbia and in the riding of West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, the riding of a Reform member, for the 
west coast railway heritage project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These funds are there to focus in areas of high unemployment, or

perhaps she has her funds mixed up.  I do not think that is the 
case.  The minister seems to have trouble grasping the format 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked a question.  She is supposed to answer with an answer. 
Maybe she would like to, on this one, call a friend or ask the 
audience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the question.  The transitional jobs fund minister's 
reserve is (a) a multimillion dollar ministerial slush fund, (b) 
a way for ministers to get around the rules, (c) a way for 
ministers to scratch each other's backs, or (d) a special brand 
of cognac.  Which would it be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the transitional jobs fund was there for 
areas of high unemployment, to help get Canadians back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding there were real challenges.  If the hon. member 
would like to look at it, the region of Brantford was decimated 
by the closure of plants like White Farms and Massey Ferguson. 
We had an unemployment level that was extraordinarily high and 
not coming down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case in all regions where the transitional jobs fund 
has been used, Canadians are working.  The unemployment levels 
are coming down, and the government is working with communities 
together to make sure that this happens.

both the questions and the answers today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
was that her final answer?  The unemployment was at 6.5%, as far 
as I know.  That answer is wrong, I am afraid.  She should have 
used a life line, maybe, when she had the chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cabinet ministers do not need to play by the rules so maybe we 
could give her another chance. 
She got a half million dollars from the minister's special 
reserve.  That needed more than 12% unemployment, and she knows 
that hers was 6.5%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find in this circumstance, as well as in other 
circumstances across the country including in Reform ridings, is 
that there are pockets of very high unemployment in particular 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transitional jobs fund is precisely for those areas of high 
unemployment.  Indeed, our unemployment levels are coming down in 
Brant and in other ridings where the transitional jobs funds have 
been used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is because of the approach of the government to work in 
partnership at the community level to focus on the issues that 
will make a difference for citizens in those ridings to use their 
skills and abilities to diversify the economy.  That is what it 
is about and that is what is happening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a multimillion dollar annual fund within the 
Department of Human Resources Development called the minister's 
reserve.  There are $5 million in this reserve.  In other words, 
the minister has been handed her very own multimillion dollar 
slush fund to spend any way she wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund really is not about creating jobs, is it?  Is it not 
really about creating special privileges for certain highly 
placed Liberal ministers and their friends? 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

Vancouver—Sunshine Coast with moneys from the minister's 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact that is why we invested $250,000 of reserve funding in 
the area of British Columbia where there was a strong need for 
youth employment programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would just talk to some of her own caucus

helping the citizens of those communities:  young people and 
people who have not been able to find employment.  That is what 
it is all about.  It is a way of managing funds so that we can—

<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

spending millions by overtaxing Canadian workers on EI on the 
so-called jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months now we have seen misuse and abuse of these public 
moneys for political purposes in the Prime Minister's riding, and 
now we find the HRD minister had a cool half million given to her 
riding even though she could not meet the criteria.

accept the fact that the government invested $300 million in the 
transitional jobs fund and turned it into $1.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They accept the fact that for every dollar we put into it we 
leveraged $9 to create work in ridings of high unemployment 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They accept that this money does not just go into the ridings of 
Liberal members of parliament but into ridings of members of the

his own budgets.  It is time he read them.

of an imminent crisis in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, all of the country's ministers of finance sent a 
clear message to the government: We want our money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Finance realize that, in making drastic 
cuts to transfer payments to the provinces for health care, he 
has created a situation that is about to explode?  Is he waiting 
to see victims before finally consenting to listen to us? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again I repeat, at the request of the provinces, we have 
restored transfer payments as far as health is concerned.  We 
did so in last year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the question is this: Do the provinces intend to restore to 
the municipalities what they have cut from them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
comes a time when enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, this Minister of Finance has cut $21 billion from 
health care and social services.  That is a fact.  And he is 
going to cut another $12 billion by the year 2003.  That too is 
a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this minister, who has accumulated $8 billion in surplus in

have brought forth the number of programs we have.  We have 
brought forth the increase in the child tax benefit, the increase

Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general says that he does not 
micromanage CSIS and he hides behind a technicality that he is 
under no obligation to contact the head of SIRC when a breach of 
national security occurs.  CSIS director Ward Elcock obviously 
has no respect for SIRC at all or for any parliamentarians or 
even for the minister.  The director, aided by the minister, has 
undermined the role of SIRC and it appears that he deliberately 
covered up the theft of the CSIS plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

conducting an investigation, that CSIS was conducting an

a mandate from this House, would be conducting a review.  That is 
exactly what is happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we know it is a serious matter, but when will the 
minister get smart?  He refuses to take any responsibility for 
what has taken place, for himself or his employees.  The CSIS 
board has had vacancies since this summer and the inspector 
general's role was only filled days before this fiasco at the 
Leaf's game.

process.  I heard him on CBC Radio yesterday morning when he 
indicated that SIRC was an independent body and could do the job.

quit playing politics and trying to score cheap political points 
in this House.

Speaker, when the Supreme Court of Canada rendered the Marshall 
decision last September, the minister of Indian affairs sent 
shock waves through resource industries in this country by 
suggesting that the judgment gave natives treaty access to 
forest, mineral and natural gas resources.  This morning the 
court clearly stated that these other resources were simply not 
addressed by the Marshall decision.

withdraw his irresponsible and inaccurate statement?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reality of it is that 
the courts did say very clearly that we should be negotiating 
with first nations people.  That is the position of the 
government, not the position of the opposition, and we will 
continue to negotiate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, regardless of what the minister says, the Marshall 
decision applies only to a Mi'kmaq treaty right to carry on a 
small scale commercial eel fishery.  Most importantly, it 
acknowledges non-aboriginals' right to fish.  Will the minister 
of fisheries acknowledge the right of all Canadians to fish and 
develop one set of regulations for all Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and

use of the surpluses.

the truth of the matter is that the defence minister is not

that the existing armoury was viable until the year 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister insisted that the new armoury was necessary 
in 1997 when he was facing a tough election campaign.  He knew

not politically, it was put back on by the army which said it 
needed it because of the six units.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, an 
elections act should be politically neutral, supported by the 
public, the chief electoral officer and all the parties in this

politically biased, opposed by the official opposition and 
criticized by the chief electoral officer as unfit for a third 
world country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not modernizing the elections act, making 
it more democratic, instead of persisting with a patronage 
ridden, gag law contaminated piece of yesterday's legislation?

again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Lortie commission in 1991 did not recommend changing 
from the present formula of appointing electoral officers in 
ridings.  Second, this is the same formula utilized in six 
provinces in addition to the one used by the House of Commons at 
the present time.  Third, the Chief Electoral Officer of Ontario 
has indicated that it would take an additional 19 bureaucrats in 
Ontario alone, probably 50 at the national level, to administer 
that which he—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister was not paying attention to the questions yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 slaps a gag law on voters, prevents the Chief Electoral 
Officer from testing new voting technologies, reinstates an 
illogical 50 candidate rule, perpetuates an offensive system of 
patronage appointments by the Prime Minister and cannot prevent 
cats and dogs from being registered as voters and candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill fails every reasonable test for political neutrality

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across the way 
can make accusations where he likes in his usual partisan way, 
but for him to accuse all returning officers in Canada of putting 
cats and dogs on the voters list is an unjustified and 
unwarranted attack against hundreds of civil servants who are 
doing a great job for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last evening Premier Klein went on TV to tell Albertans 
that he will openly defy the principles of medicare by allowing 
the development of a private, for profit hospital system. He said 
he intends to allow public tax dollars to be siphoned off 
directly into the pockets of private health corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that was not the intention of the architects of medicare. 
Surely this is not Canadians' interpretation of the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the health minister, does he believe that for 
profit private hospitals are consistent with the principles of 
the Canada Health Act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the premier spoke last night and today we received a policy 
statement which we are looking at right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make something crystal clear so that I can remove any 
doubt from the member's mind.  We will protect the Canada Health 
Act.  We will protect the Canadian system of medicare.  We will 
protect its letter and we will protect its spirit.  Neither this 
government nor this Minister of Health will ever permit the 
development of a private parallel system of health care in this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whenever the minister answers a question on health care 
I am always tempted to ask, is that all there is?  There is lots 
of talk but no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are depending upon the government to protect public 
health care.  The health minister has options.  If he is really 
serious about protecting health care he could and he should use 
the process set out by the social union agreement to challenge 
that kind of approach.  He can do that now.  Will he do it?  Will 
he use the social union agreement to fight for public health 
care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
fighting for public health care is my full time job.  I do little 
else.  I will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals that came from Alberta arrived today.  We are 
looking at them.  We will examine them.  Our perspective is very 
simple.  We will not allow the development of a private parallel 
system of health care in this country, not in Alberta and not in 
any province.  This government is committed to public medicare in 
Canada.

specifies that persons are not to be convicted of offences 
committed outside of Canada.  There are a few exceptions, such as 
war crimes, hostage-taking and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would amend section 7 to provide that everyone who 
commits an act outside Canada that if committed in Canada would 
constitute an offence under the criminal code, shall be deemed to 
have committed the act in Canada if he or she is a Canadian 
citizen, a permanent resident or present in Canada after the 
commission of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragic inspiration for the bill was the true case of a 
husband and wife vacationing on a Caribbean island where the 
husband assaulted the wife.  They were both Canadians living in 
Canada.  They returned to Canada and the husband was not brought 
to justice for the violent act against his wife because it 
occurred outside Canada.

this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, this bill received widespread support 
and garnered praise from many different sectors.  It has been 
mentioned on a continent-wide syndicated radio program.  It has 
been endorsed by the Canadian Police Association and has the 
support of the Ontario Provincial Police child pornography unit, 
Project P.

telephone poles but has never had telephones.  This affects 
families in situations of emergency or their children accessing 
the Internet, as so many other children are doing, and so on.

plans to export 50 billion litres of Canadian lake water per

lake water no limit can be placed on the amount exported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners say this water belongs to the people of Canada, 
not to private corporations.  Exports of such water bring 
environmental devastation.  Therefore they call upon parliament

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make the greatest contribution to peace and human rights 
abroad by making sure that we have a co-ordinated approach right 
here at home.  For example, we need the efforts of organizations 
such as CIDA to build the foundations for stability and 
development around the world.  We need the involvement of human 
rights organizations to ensure that basic values are recognized 
and basic standards are preserved.  We need the diplomatic and 
trade efforts of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade to open markets, to extend the benefits of 
liberalized trade and to bring Canada's unique perspective of 
security, peace and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need strong Canadian forces.  History teaches us that we 
cannot hope to maintain peace and security without the ability to 
back up our commitments, if necessary with military strength.  It 
is vital that we strike the right balance as a country between 
the soft power initiatives needed to advance human security and 
the hard military capabilities needed to back up this commitment, 
with action when necessary.  It is not a question of either/or; 
Canada must have both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were reminded of this reality most recently in Kosovo.  This 
was an important engagement, not only for the objectives that 
were realized, but also for the message that was sent.  Our 
actions declared in no uncertain terms that mass murder and mass 
expulsion of citizens are acts of moral repugnance, not the 
prerogative of a sovereign state. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our words condemn such action, but it is military force that 
puts a stop to it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Canadian forces, in partnership with our NATO allies, 
using the tools and training we have given them, who risked their 
lives to defend the values that we as Canadians espouse.  It is 
the Canadian forces, along with many other countries and aid 
organizations, which are now working to restore stability and 
rebuild peace and a civil society in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  Those who would advance human security must be 
able to fight to protect the human rights and values we espouse, 
where necessary, keep the peace once it is attained, help rebuild 
societies on the ground, and lay the seeds of democracy and the 
rule of law on what are often very fragile democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we must renew the Canadian forces on two fronts:  in 
our ability to fight when necessary and in our ability to build 
peace.  Let me touch on both of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of military operations has changed fundamentally in 
recent years, as we saw in the gulf war and more recently in 
Kosovo.  Rapid technological change is having a dramatic impact 
on the kinds of weapons that are used, the equipment, the 
communications and the principles that guide our operations, our 
military doctrine as it is known.  The instruments we employ are 
much more sophisticated and the training of our people is much 
more complex than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our greatest challenges is to improve our ability to get 
personnel and equipment to trouble spots more quickly and 
efficiently anywhere on the globe.  Fighting alongside our allies 
now requires the highest level of training and sophistication. 
The military calls this being interoperable.  It simply means 
that we must mesh our personnel and our equipment.  We must work 
together seamlessly.  This in turn is leading to more sharing of 
resources and more strategic partnerships among our allies, 
particularly in the NATO alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are having a dramatic effect on how we train, how 
we plan and what we procure in the way of equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to maintain our combat capability, we have to adapt to 
these new realities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our traditional military role in peacekeeping operations has 
changed dramatically.  Peacekeeping no longer simply involves 
patrolling ceasefire zones.  It means becoming involved in what 
are really combat zones, combat zones such as Bosnia, Kosovo and 
East Timor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our forces land in these kinds of situations they have to 
have the equipment and support they need to make a difference on 
the ground, unencumbered by concerns over the quality of the 
equipment they have.  They must have the training they need to 
work not only with other armed forces, that interoperability, but 
they also have to work with local officials, civil police, the 
media, non-government organizations and a slew of organizations 
such as Doctors Without Borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly the men and women of the Canadian forces find 
themselves at the centre of a large network of players trying to 
co-ordinate peace enforcement, law and order, emergency relief 
and aid, and all this while seeking to build peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, our men and women in uniform must have the support they 
need back home for their families.  They should not have to worry 
about their children or spouses or how they are coping while they 
are away.  Put simply, they must operate in a more complex 
environment than has been the case in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of our role in peacekeeping and peacemaking is 
changing.  We must prepare ourselves and the men and women of the 
forces to be able to meet these new challenges.  Ironically, all 
of these changes have occurred during a period when defence 
spending has been declining, and yet since the end of the cold 
war the number of Canadian operations has increased dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 40 years, ending in 1989, of the cold war era our forces 
were involved in 25 missions.  Since 1989, the last 10 years, we 
have been involved in 65 operations.  Quite simply, our forces 
are being asked to do more with less and to do far different 
types of activities and far more complex activities than ever 
before.  I can assure the House that the Canadian forces will 
continue to change to meet the new demands of a new time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we have already taken action to reinvest in 
their quality of life.  The good work of the Standing Committee 
of National Defence and Veterans Affairs has led to a series of 
recommendations to help ensure that.  The government is committed 
to that kind of reinvestment in our people, our greatest 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, more than 300 institutional reforms are 
being implemented to strengthen leadership, recruitment, 
accountability and openness, and to change the military justice 
system.  These reforms represent the most sweeping program of 
change ever undertaken by the Canadian military. Defence is 
making these changes while meeting its commitments to protect 
Canada, to contribute to the defence of North America and to 
support international peace and security.  That is a lot to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meeting these commitments day in and day out at home and abroad 
should never be underestimated.  These people should never be 
underestimated for the good work they do.  It is a significant 
undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that we have begun the process of 
upgrading our equipment in recent years.  Every piece of 
equipment is being replaced, modernized or upgraded.  We have a 
plan.  The government has a plan to do that.  We recently 
purchased new submarines.  We have new frigates and new coastal 
defence vessels.  Our new search and rescue helicopters are on 
order, and we have new light armoured vehicles.  The addition of 
this state of the art equipment and the upgrading of other 
equipment will serve us well as we move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking ahead to the decisions we need to make to 
continue to strengthen the Canadian forces for the future.  To 
prepare for the 21st century, defence has developed a long term 
strategy called “Strategy 2020”.  Its intent is to position, as 
our vision statement says, the Canadian forces as a modern, 
combat capable, task tailored and rapidly deployable force that 
can respond to emergencies either at home or abroad.

must continue to reinvest in the men and women who are the 
lifeblood of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, no credible Canadian contribution to the human 
security agenda, as it is described in the Speech from the 
Throne, can be made without forces that are able to meet the 
challenges of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line, and the government has recognized this in the 
Speech from the Throne, is that we will continue to ensure that 
the Canadian forces have the capacity to support Canada's role in 
building a more secure world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the next century the Canadian forces will continue 
to play a vital role as an instrument of our resolve, the resolve 
of Canadians and of our values.  They will continue to work for 
peace around the world.  They will continue to make a vital 
contribution to the national life of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will take resources.  This will take commitment.  It will 
take leadership based on a clear vision of the future.  That is 
the commitment that comes from the Speech from the Throne.  That

that I will honour as the Minister of National Defence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
very pleased to hear the minister's comments this afternoon, in 
particular his comments concerning human security and the role of 
the Canadian forces in ensuring human security right across the 
globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned, in particular, that acts of mass murder 
are morally repugnant.  They are things that we should all be 
concerned about and our Canadian forces play a very important 
role in dealing with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the worst instances I can think of involving mass murder 
was the recent slaughter of 800,000 people in Rwanda.  This was 
certainly of moral repugnance to all of us.  When we find that 
kind of situation taking place, certainly we want to do what we 
can to prevent it from taking place in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister whether what was recently 
reported—and he can comment as to whether the report is 
correct—would support our troops as they attempt to combat these 
morally repugnant deeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that there was a conference being held, which finished 
yesterday, to deal with the genocide in Rwanda and to look at 
means of trying to prevent this from happening in the future.  It 
has been reported that Lieutenant General Roméo Dallaire was due 
to speak at this conference.  However, according to the report, 
he was called out or not allowed to speak, reportedly on 
instructions from the minister and/or the justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister how that kind of action, if it did 
take place, is supporting our troops, because the minister said 
that our troops must have the support of people back home and 
their families.  I would say that the troops also need the 
support of the political leaders of our country if they are going 
to make a meaningful impact in dealing with these issues.  We 
need to have the truth come out in instances such as this.  We 
need to have those instances examined in the fullest so that we 
can prevent those kinds of disasters in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the 
hon. member that Rwanda was a terrible tragedy.  I think the 
international community failed to come to the support of the 
people of that country at a time when it was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country, Canada, did its utmost to help.  General Dallaire 
was the commander who was there. 
He was putting forth the best effort he could with very little 
resources and very little support from the United Nations in New 
York.  He cared a great deal about what was happening in Rwanda, 
so much so that it has affected him and his health very 
significantly.  A fine officer, a man who is dedicated to this 
country has paid a fair price in terms of his health as a result 
of this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was he who decided not to attend this conference.  He did 
consult the department.  He did not consult me personally, but he 
did consult.  He has gone in other cases for example, to the 
United Nations and to other tribunals of a more legal nature and 
has testified about Rwanda.  This is not an easy thing to do for 
a man with the memories that he has of Rwanda. However, he has 
made every effort to be helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think his initial instinct when he was asked about this 
conference was to do it because he wants to be helpful.  That is 
the nature of the man.  However, on further reflection he decided 
that it perhaps was not advisable to do. That was a decision he 
had to make, but please remember that what happened and what he 
saw in Rwanda has had a very profound effect on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country wants to do everything that is possible, whether it 
is Rwanda, or Kosovo, or East Timor to try to prevent that kind 
of human suffering, to try to help people get respect for their 
human rights, to make sure that their human security is looked 
after.  Canada will continue to play a major role in doing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think it is a lot of bravado that the defence minister is 
bringing to this debate.  It is quite astounding because it has 
been consecutive Liberal governments that have cut and cut and 
cut the national defence budget.  Now he tells us that everything 
is fine.  Now he tells us that we have his personal commitment 
that everything is going to be fine, that there are going to be 
the resources for our very brave men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is his Prime Minister who said that Canadians really like 
getting involved in different peace operations because as 
Canadians we see ourselves as Boy Scouts. Our armed forces need a 
whole lot more than the equipment of Boy Scouts.  In fact, if we 
look at the shameful way in which this government and its 
cutbacks have robbed our proud, sincere, dedicated men and women 
of the resources to get the job done, it is an absolute shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest with as much respect as I can possibly muster to 
the defence minister that indeed his promises and the promises of 
his government are exceptionally shallow.  His government should 
be ashamed of itself for the way in which it continues to 
underfund and under-resource the brave people in the armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in talking about 
empty rhetoric, I think we just got a bit of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member seems to have forgotten that the cuts first of all 
started back in the years of the Progressive Conservative 
government.  We did take further amounts from all budgets. I 
understood what the hon. member's party wanted us to do and what 
we of course wanted to do and promised to do was to eliminate the 
deficit.  We had to cut costs to do that, so yes, we did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We organized the budget in a way that makes it as efficient and 
as effective as it possibly can be.  We have got great value for 
the taxpayers' dollars out of what we are doing.  We are meeting 
our commitments. There is no doubt that we are squeezed for 
funds, that we need additional funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would not be giving us any additional funds if 
we followed what it suggested and promised in the last election. 
I take it the Reform Party stands by its promises from the last 
election. It said it would put a freeze on any additional 
expenditure for three years and that all of the money in 
surpluses would go for debt and tax reduction.  On the formula 
that it promised in the last election campaign, not one penny 
would come from the Reform Party to help defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year this government increased the defence budget.  The 
Minister of Finance stood in the House in February, and he 
received a standing ovation, when he indicated that for the first 
time in a dozen years additional money was being provided for our 
troops.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also give one other illustration of where we have 
improved and we have made it more efficient and more effective. 
We played a major front line role in the Kosovo air campaign.  No 
one likes to talk about bombing and about the need to attack, but 
when it came to putting our resources and our people on the line, 
we were able to do that.  We could not even do it to that extent 
in the gulf war because we did not have the equipment that was 
necessary to play that kind of a front line role. However, we did 
it in the Kosovo air campaign. I think that quite clearly 
indicates, as the chief of defence staff has clearly indicated, 
we are more combat capable.  Our troops are more combat capable 
today than they were in the early nineties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have managed to get the deficit eliminated.  We have managed 
to buy new equipment.  We have managed to change many parts of 
the Canadian forces with over 300 changes and reforms.  We have 
managed to make our troops more combat capable so that they can 
operate in defence of peace and in the building of peace.  I 
think that is greatly to the credit of the government.  It is 
certainly not a position we would be in if the Reform Party were 
managing the budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary 
to the rhetoric that has been coming from the Reform Party for 
the last six years the United Nations has declared Canada as the 
best country in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne outlined the government's commitment 
to achieve an even better quality of life for all Canadians. This 
includes increased resources for early childhood development and 
targeted assistance for low income families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister outline and expand a little on what is being 
done to improve the quality of life of members of Canada's armed 
forces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for that question.  Of paramount importance to us is the 
quality of life of our men and women who serve this country. They 
put their lives on the line. They have what is called unlimited 
liability. They do get injured and they do lose their lives in 
many circumstances.  We have had over 100 peacekeepers in the 
time that we have been involved in peacekeeping who have lost 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to them to make sure we do the best we can to improve 
their quality of life and that we support them and their 
families.  That is an absolute number one priority. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me a great deal of pleasure to stand and respond to the 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the Speech from the Throne said.  “The 
government will work with Canadians to ensure that our 
communities continue to be safe”. Another point was, “The 
government will combat drug trafficking”. We looked at that and 
we thought perhaps an amendment might be in order.  The amendment 
we proposed was “That this government has failed to seriously 
deal with the problem of drug trafficking, youth crime and child 
pornography”, which in our judgment is a statement of fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the throne speech was generally imprecise, with fluffy 
generalities signifying little or nothing, in the case of 
criminal justice, the government outlined inaccuracies and total 
distortions of truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the Liberals' rhetoric against their record. They 
say, “The government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP 
and other agencies to address the threats to public security in 
Canada and work with enforcement agencies in other countries”. 
So say the Liberals. That is their rhetoric.  Here is their 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lead story in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> two weeks ago puts a 
lie to their statement.  It said, “RCMP halt fraud 
investigations blaming lack of money and staff.  A Kamloops 
couple complained that they had been duped out of $450,000 U.S. 
in a stock scheme.  Call your MP, the Mounties say”.  They did 
not have to call me and certainly they did not have to call any 
of the Reform MPs because that is precisely what we have been 
shouting at the Liberals about for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a further quote from an RCMP officer in that article, 
“It is not a message we want to send, but we don't want to give 
the public a false belief that we will pursue their complaint if 
we don't have the resources”. That, as I say, was from the head 
of the RCMP commercial crime section in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just B.C.  I have been following a case in Edmonton 
where investors have been ripped off for $3 million in a stock 
swindle.  They have been waiting three years for the RCMP to 
complete their investigation and for charges to be brought 
against the perpetrators of the swindle. 
The police have evidence coming out of their ears but they simply 
do not have the resources to get on with their job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I failed to mention that I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Calgary Northeast.  My apologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jason Cowan and Barb Trosin had an inventive product they wanted 
to bring to market but as with most entrepreneurs, they required 
capital.  Unfortunately for them as with the case in Kamloops, 
they fell into the clutches of unscrupulous stock swindlers. 
Their case also has a Vancouver component where some of their 
stock was deceptively and fraudulently passed to another 
unsuspecting investor in a switch which took its inspiration from 
the Paul Newman movie <I>The Sting</I>. The offices used for the 
switch involved a well-known Canadian investment firm without the 
firm having any knowledge of the scam that occurred right at the 
front desk in its office. Like in the Kamloops story, the RCMP do 
not have the resources to pursue this obvious criminal fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Bre-X, the $6 billion ripped out of investors' 
pockets and the RCMP already shutting down the investigation? I 
have a couple of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the RCMP give approval for unsupervised destruction of 
documents in the Bre-X office in the days immediately following 
the confirmation of the fraud?  The answer seems to be lack of 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has there been no investigation into the responsibility that 
Nesbitt Burns had in dispatching their geologist on multiple 
trips to the mine site in Indonesia?  He consistently reported no 
problems while the firm raked off millions of dollars in 
brokerage fees, yet within five minutes of an Australian 
geologist arriving at the mine, he detected serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious answer is gross under-resourcing of Canada's 
national police force.  Yet the Liberals have the gall to make 
statements in the throne speech as if they really cared about 
protecting Canadians.  The bottom line is Canadian and 
international investors can be fleeced by swindlers and due to 
the government's intentional under-resourcing of the RCMP, our 
national police force can do nothing about it. The drastic result 
is that investment capital in Canada is becoming scarce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to ask the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights to have the commissioner of the RCMP appear and explain 
his force's actions on the Bre-X file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of international concerns and commitments, let me talk 
about organized crime.  This is what the Liberals say.  “The 
government will also continue to work closely with the U.S. to 
modernize our shared border for the 21st century”.  That is what 
the Liberals say; that is their rhetoric.  Here are the results. 
It is as if they have not had the responsibility of running 
Canada for the last six years.  Wake up and smell the coffee. The 
government has no vision to lead Canada safely into the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the United Nations declared transnational crime as its 
highest priority.  Members of the G-8 affirmed that it is one of 
the major challenges facing the world on the threshold of the 
21st century.  Organized crime has emerged as the number one 
threat to Canada's overall security, yet the government has cut 
the legs out from under Canada's security committee.  How?  This 
is how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend it was revealed that a top secret planning document 
was stolen. It was a planning document for next year and to all 
accounts should never have been removed from CSIS property. 
Unbelievably, it was in a briefcase in the back of a car in a 
parking lot in Toronto.  The bright light from CSIS was at the 
Toronto Maple Leafs game.  She left the briefcase in the back of 
her car.  Druggies smashed the window, took the case and we were 
told it was thrown into a dumpster, but we are not sure. If we 
think a smash and grab drug addict is a reliable source for 
information, then perhaps we will have no trouble also believing 
in the tooth fairy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know there has been a serious breach of security in 
Canada's Hong Kong trade office.  What happened?  There was a 
cover-up.  When the RCMP officer revealed documents that clearly 
showed a cover-up, he was suspended.  Meanwhile, we have also 
learned that a special operation to get intelligence about Asian 
gangs called operation Sidewinder was suspended in 1996.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not only suspended but all of the data was removed from 
electronic storage, including e-mails, and all hard copy was 
shredded.  Why?  As a matter of fact, the members of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, who are civilians and who oversee 
Canada's spy agency, learned about the shredding and the turning 
down of the Sidewinder operation as a result of picking up the 
newspaper a couple of Fridays ago.  They were never told by the 
solicitor general and never informed by the agents at CSIS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that report, we would have information on the people 
smuggling gangs that hit Canada's west coast this summer.  At 
least we would have a starting point to understand the 
infiltration into Canadian businesses by organized crime.  But, I 
repeat, the report was shredded.  My question is:  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it have anything to do with the other big story this 
weekend?  That story revolves around the fact that the RCMP and 
CSIS are having a turf war.  They do not share vital information. 
They investigate each other.  There is constant bad blood that 
inhibits their ability to protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government delayed and delayed the appointment of civilian 
oversight for CSIS.  For years the spy service of Canada has run 
without the checks and balances set out in legislation.  It has 
led to an unhealthy culture in CSIS.  CSIS exhibited that culture 
through the director of CSIS when he came before the 
parliamentary standing committee on justice last May 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fault the Liberal government, the government elected in 1993. 
The SIRC positions were vacant for years, that is years. There 
was no proper oversight of Canada's spy agency as a result of a 
deliberate omission by the Liberal government.  All law 
enforcement and national security agents must, at the very least, 
be able to maintain the ability to target threats to national 
security, and the Liberals are badly failing the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no strengthening of RCMP resources.  Each year 
the RCMP face more and more challenges as the potential for 
technological crime increases.  Its equipment and resources are 
rusted while organized crime goes on a buying spree of new 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just had a very tiny glimpse at the difference between 
the Liberals' rhetoric and the Liberals' reality.  Canadians 
deserve better from the government.  They want the government to 
resource our people who are charged with the responsibility of 
maintaining our national police force and our national security. 
Canadians deserve better than this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to be able to speak today on a defence matter as it 
relates to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a long and very busy year for national defence as 
DND has had to defend itself against one scandal after another. 
There have been various gaffs and a steady decline in resources 
and equipment.  I by no means want to pick on the military itself 
because ultimately it all comes back to a political answer, which 
is with the defence minister himself and the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Speech from the Throne referred directly to 
the Canadian forces only once and in very vague terms.  Even 
worse, and with rare exception, the Minister of National Defence 
has been unavailable, unaware and unseen through this summer's 
military meltdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we have had to view the repeated and unwarranted sight 
of military officers facing interrogation by the national media 
demanding answers to the glaring problems in Canada's military. 
These problems are political in nature and should be addressed by 
their creator, namely the defence minister and ultimately the 
Prime Minister who appointed him.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will offer just a brief recapitulation of those problems that 
have plagued his department over the last four months because it 
is important to analyze these issues separately as each indicates 
severe systemic rot within the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summer began with the discovery, via an access to 
information request, that unknown numbers of Canadian 
peacekeepers had probably been exposed to toxic soil in Croatia. 
Hundreds were experiencing severe health problems, ranging from 
the loss of eyesight to stomach afflictions.  Though the issue of 
exposure was unsettling enough, what was even more disturbing 
were the measures taken to cover up the exposure back in Canada. 
We learned that a medical document attesting to the exposure had 
first been altered and then shredded.  We learned that despite 
the blustering from the minister that the matter would be 
thoroughly investigated, a ministerial briefing note had 
mentioned the issue in 1995.  The board of enquiry established to 
investigate the scandal was itself marked by conflict of interest 
and the first chairman and one legal advisor quickly resigned 
amid criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The toxic soil controversy has highlighted two disturbing 
elements of military culture in Canada supported by the 
government, namely, dirty tricks and appalling health care for 
military personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hierarchy within DND, no doubt driven by the minister's 
office and his powerful civilian mandarins who have effectively 
controlled the day by day decision making of the Canadian forces 
for 25 years, is more interested in denying scandal than exposing 
it and cleaning it up.  It would much rather bury the truth than 
expose it.  It seems unwilling or unable to admit that mistakes 
have been made, but will go to extraordinary lengths to change 
the facts.  Individuals who attempt to fight for full disclosure 
are often harassed, intimidated and ultimately driven from the 
military ranks.  This perverse and destructive atmosphere of 
character assassination must be purged from our military culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever happened to military leadership?  In a Canadian 
military culture now long forgotten, generals and admirals 
possessed a military bearing that outshone the brass on their 
uniforms.  They did not seek to anticipate the political 
direction of the day.  They did seek to maintain discipline and 
honour in the profession of arms.  There has to be a clear 
distinction between the bureaucrats and the military decision 
makers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Croatian scandal also gave Canadians some insight into the 
deplorable quality of health care in the military.  Where else 
could confidential medical files simply disappear from a person's 
medical history, yet document tampering has occurred at other 
times and dozens of former and serving military personnel have 
written to my office describing examples of it in their careers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rank and file military personnel cannot see a doctor when they 
so desire, unlike all other Canadians.  They are often 
administered drugs contrary to their desires.  Their illnesses 
are often misdiagnosed and mistreated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the radar technician aboard the HMCS <I>Vancouver</I>, 
Petty Officer Kevin Simon, who suffered from lung cancer for six 
months and was told that he had a lingering cough and cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was retired Sergeant Mike Kipling whom DND persecuted 
and in a supreme example of vindictiveness initiated court 
martial proceedings against him because he refused a mouldy 
anthrax vaccine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, too, is a scandal.  It is scandalous that our serving sons 
and daughters must first accept third rate health care and then 
be subjected to wilful desecration of their medical histories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask the minister to allow military members to have 
full access to civilian health care facilities where available, 
that their medical files are viewed and approved by military 
members on an annual basis and that the role of military doctors 
be focused on deployments rather than on domestic medicine.  The 
current system is quite clearly not working.  It is leaving the 
Canadian forces open to abuse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also witnessed over the past three months what I call a 
military meltdown within the Canadian forces.  Quite simply, our 
military is imploding, rotting from the inside due to a lack of 
funding and genuine government neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air force talks about phasing out the Snowbird aerobatic 
team in a weird attempt to shock Canadians into economic reality. 
Here is some food for thought.  If the military needs $30 million 
required to run the Snowbirds every year, why not examine the 
bona fide white elephant, the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre?  This 
school of academic pretension was established as a rest home for 
recycled DND and Liberal cronies, proving that the public trough 
is always replenished for some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we sending military officers who have already been 
deployed on peacekeeping missions, to a school that requires four 
to six weeks to teach the obvious, how to keep the peace? Maybe 
then we can leave the Snowbirds in peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though the Snowbird threat may either be a hard bargaining 
position or fancy, the air force is preparing to sell off its 
Tutors and T-33s, both of which have just received upgrades. 
Squadrons are being disbanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More dangerously, we are told that the maintenance to the new 
Cormorant helicopters will be contracted out, or in the catch 
phrase of the new DND, provided for by alternative service 
delivery, ASD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though we support the notion of contracting out where cost 
savings can definitely be realized and the impact on combat 
capability is unaffected, hard operational support services must 
be deployed on military missions and should remain as military 
trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the increasing broad application of alternate service 
delivery has been unsettling to hundreds of maintenance 
technicians who have proven that they can provide maintenance at 
a cheaper cost than any civilian contractor.  They know the 
nature of the work.  They can be deployed with a squadron in an 
hour's notice and they certainly do have the capability of 
fulfilling that trade requirement because of their dedication. 
Now they are being betrayed and told that their expertise is 
unwanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can either ignore reality or accept the need to find 
solutions. I would hope that the minister could see beyond his 
lack of interest in defence and his need to play politics with 
the Canadians forces to acknowledge this fact.  I would pose the 
following questions to him and demand answers on behalf of 
hundreds of military personnel who write to my office insisting 
that the government is not doing enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit himself to a full disclosure of the 
Sharp board of inquiry into the toxic soil?   Will the minister 
examine the military health care system so that they too can 
receive the treatment that they so richly deserve by serving the 
country?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a quick question for my colleague for Calgary Northeast who 
arrived in this place at the same time I did back in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not fully understanding how serious it is in terms of the 
democratic processes that take place in this particular place, I 
am wondering if the member could tell me if I am wrong or if I am 
right, and what we can do about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had many debates in the House with regard to our 
military placements.  For example, I remember the debate on 
whether we should we send troops to Bosnia.  At different times, 
we have had different debates on what we were going to do in 
regard to the use of our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thoroughly convinced that decisions are made before they 
are ever brought to the House and that the debate is absolutely a 
futile waste of time just simply because the decisions have 
already been made by the government.  We are simply going through 
the motions.  We do not have a democratic discussion about the 
placement of our troops throughout the world. 
It is simply run by the front line people on that side of the 
House.  Then there are the little puppets who jump up and vote 
according to what they are told.  They are called the rest of the 
Liberals.  Is my analysis all wet, or how close to being accurate 
am I?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member 
for Wild Rose for his question.  It is a very positive question. 
It reflects the reality of what happens in the House with the 
government and how it expands beyond into the departments that 
are represented by ministers in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have a problem when it comes to top down government, and 
everyone in the House should be involved in addressing that 
particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen bills come from the government that go to a 
committee, where they are subject to scrutiny with substantial 
debate.  However, there really is no opportunity to change what 
exists in the top down process.  The decision has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is born somewhere, maybe in the bureaucracy, or in the 
minds of the various departments, or in some minister's office. 
Then it goes through a process within the bureaucracy or within 
the minister's office.  It is very much confined to that realm. 
There is no consultation in the broader context.  Then it is 
tossed out for the opposition to look at, to discuss and debate 
without any opportunity for real honest debate to change what 
proposals may have been made.  In fact, before it even hits the 
committee room or the opposition has a chance to scrutinize it, 
it is already decided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that a democratic process?  No, it is far from democratic. If 
we were looking for honest and true debate in the House to 
formulate law and policy, it would be from the bottom up, with 
broad consultation.  Then it would be formulated in a final sense 
in the various departments.  That does not happen.  Unfortunately 
we have more of a dictatorship in that regard than a democratic 
process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I pointed out earlier today to the defence minister that it has 
been successive cutbacks, first by the Trudeau government, then 
by the Conservatives and now by the Liberals, which have created 
the tremendously desperate situation with respect to resources 
for the armed forces.  He implied that the Reform Party would 
have cut further and would have done even more damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague, who is the defence critic, would care 
to comment on the minister's statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question and 
one worthy of a good clear answer as far as the position of the 
Reform Party, the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made it very clear that the defence budget has been cut 
to the bone.  In fact, it has almost destroyed the military 
completely because of a lack of good proper funding and moneys 
directed to the proper areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has clearly advocated that there should be a $2 
billion infusion into the military budget so that it can meet the 
very basic of needs of looking after our troops, buying the 
necessary equipment, and looking after the operational end so 
that proper training can be conducted.  One of the most urgent 
issues right now is supplying our forces with good combat 
clothes.  That program is long, long overdue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We Canadians have proven to be a very determined people.  We have 
established a distinct Canadian model.  Accommodation of 
cultures....a partnership between citizens and state.  A balance 
that promotes individual freedom and economic prosperity while, 
at the same time, sharing risks and benefits.  An understanding 
that government can be an instrument of collective action—a 
means of serving the broader public interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an instrument of collective action government has a crucial 
role in the lives of the people of our nation.  As members of 
this place we have a heavy responsibility to ensure that we make 
decisions and laws that serve the public interest.  As Liberals 
we take a balanced, sensible approach, one that understands that 
not only must risk be shared, but benefits as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some in this House who do not believe that government 
can be a positive force in society.  They cling to a dogma of 
less government, not good government, a dogma which ignores the 
public interest in favour of narrow self-interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can never forget our role.  We must continue to work 
diligently to advance the health and well-being of Canadians, 
particularly our children and youth, to preserve and restore the 
health of our natural heritage, to build stronger communities, to 
foster a sustainable and viable economy, to continue as prudent 
fiscal managers of the nation's financial assets and to advance 
our outward looking vision as a country by continuing our 
contributions to world security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A society that respects and honours its children has its 
fundamentals right.  These fundamentals are a society with strong 
environmental laws and regulations that are enforced; a society 
with strong progressive social and economic values that allow for 
such things as income support measures to ensure that all of its 
citizens have access to nutritious food, safe shelter and human 
dignity; a society that respects human rights and opportunities 
for education for all Canadians.  This is the kind of society 
that Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an active member of the Liberal children's caucus since its 
inception in 1995, I am very pleased to see such a child centred 
throne speech.  Extending parental benefits from six months to 
one year is crucial in providing support for young families.  No 
more will new families have to make a choice between a job and 
the personal care of their young baby.  I am also pleased to see 
the federal government take leadership in making federal and 
federally regulated workplaces family friendly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also hopeful that the government's plan to negotiate early 
childhood development programs with the provinces will be 
fruitful.  I think that as a first step in these negotiations 
this must be reflected in a commitment for funding in the federal 
budget to be delivered next February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A focus on the zero to six years is crucial for the healthy 
development of our children.  A fund to provide for early 
childhood development programs is an initiative proposed by the 
national Liberal children's caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to children clearly includes initiatives to 
protect and restore the natural environment.  The throne speech 
points out that a clean and healthy environment is important to 
our long term economic and social well-being.  It is central to 
our quality of life.  Our ability to adopt innovative 
environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be 
part of Canada's strength in the 21st century.  I could not agree 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colin Isaac in the <I>Gallon Environment Letter</I> found that 
the 1999 throne speech contained more mention of the environment 
than almost any previous throne speech.  Sixteen per cent of the 
speech referenced the environment and it also identified 21 
environment related commitments, such as cleaning up contaminated 
sites on federal lands, strengthening the government's science 
capacity for environmental research, extending Canada's national 
parks system, addressing the structural weaknesses that have been 
identified in the management of toxic substances, and protecting 
species at risk and the critical habitat.  These commitments make 
up some of the more significant ones.  The government has also 
restated its commitment under the Kyoto protocol to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also goes on to emphasize the need for tough 
pollution standards to better protect the health of children, 
seniors and residents of the north.  These initiatives are 
necessary to address the nation's fundamental environmental 
problems.  Our desire to act on these commitments and our ability 
to successfully implement them will be the yardstick against 
which future generations will measure us.

something in there about it, because I looked at it over and over 
again and it was not there.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I purposely 
mentioned the first nations community, the Chippewas of Georgina 
Island and their successful work toward achieving self-government 
because they were one of the 13 communities across the country 
who were the sponsors, creators and promoters of Bill C-49, which 
the Reform Party opposed and delayed for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I rose in the House on numerous occasions to debate the bill, 
I felt a great deal of shame at the comments that came from the 
other side.  Members of my constituency, people that I represent 
here in the House of Commons, including the chief, his band 
council and other people from his community that I worked very 
hard with on this particular issue had to sit and listen to the 
comments from the members opposite. It was with a great deal of 
shame that I had to listen to these things and know that those 
people heard those comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is with respect to 
children.  Why is it that members of the Reform Party want us to 
repeal our ratification of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child which clearly protects the fundamental human 
rights of children, including protection from child pornography. 
Answer that question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the throne speech provided Canadians with a framework for 
government initiatives for the second session of the 36th 
Parliament.  Rarely does a throne speech articulate specifics of 
any initiative, but rather the objectives and directions that the 
government plans to pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this throne speech there was a specific commitment to extend 
parental leave to a full year for new or adopted children, and to 
implement it no later than January 1, 2001. This is no small item 
in itself.  It is, however, a small item with regard to the 
children's agenda.  It is an important signal with regard to the 
evolution of our child and family policy.  I would like to spend 
my time elaborating on why this specific initiative is so 
important to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 Statistics Canada national longitudinal survey on 
children and youth found that 25% of Canadian children enter 
adult life with significant emotional, behavioural, academic or 
social problems.  In the words of Dr. Paul Steinhauer of Voices 
for Children, “With one in four children entering adult life 
significantly handicapped, we can look forward to a society that 
will be less able to generate the economic base required to 
supply the economic supports and services needed by one in four 
adults unable to carry their own weight”. In that context, 
investing in children particularly in the early years is an 
imperative, not an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Dr. Fraser Mustard, childhood outcomes are not a 
question of being rich or poor, but rather of other factors 
related to the quality of care during the formative years.  This 
view was supported by Statistics Canada research presented in 
November 1998 which found that the quality of care during the 
early years can overcome the damaging impacts related to family 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Carnegie task force on meeting the needs of young 
children published a report entitled “Starting Points”. Its 
research observed that good physical and mental health, the 
ability to learn, to cope with stress, to relate well with 
others, and to have a positive outlook, were all rooted in the 
earliest experiences of life. 
The task force concluded that where, how and with whom children 
spend their early years of life are the most significant 
determinants of lifelong physical, mental and social health.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 there was a conference at the White House on early 
childhood development.  One of the principal findings announced 
was that the neurological foundations for rational thinking, 
problem solving and general reasoning appear to be established by 
age one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998 Dr. Mustard appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development and described the health impact of 
the rapid development during the first year as being dynamite. 
At birth the human brain is far from fully formed.  In the days 
and weeks that follow, vital neural connections are formed that 
create pathways along which learning will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that 80% of the lifetime development of the 
human brain occurs during the first three years of life.  These 
connections do not however form automatically.  The quality of 
nutrition, caregiving and stimulation determines not only the 
number of these healthy connections but how well they are wired 
for both cognitive and emotional intelligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998 the Canadian Institute of Child Health announced 
its concurrence.  It reported that at birth the parts of the 
human brain that handle thinking and remembering as well as 
emotional and social behaviour are remarkably undeveloped.  The 
fact that the brain matures in the world and not in the womb 
means that children are deeply affected by their early 
experiences, that relationships with caregivers, the sights, the 
sounds, the smells and the feelings they experience actually 
determine brain structure and thus shape the way we learn, think 
and behave for the rest of our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also deals extensively with the importance of 
responsive care which addresses the child's needs when the child 
signals us rather than when the caregiver can provide for those 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1997 the report of the National Forum on Health also 
concluded that there was an urgent need to invest in children. It 
reported that deprivation during early childhood can impair brain 
development and permanently hinder the development of cognition 
and speech.  It further stated that the impact on children's 
physical and mental health is very significant and can only be 
partially offset by interventions later in life.  It concluded 
that the failure to invest in the early years of life increases 
the remedial cost to our health, education, social services and 
criminal justice systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No family should have to choose between the job it needs and the 
child it loves.  Attempting to balance the responsibilities of 
work and family is difficult and may compromise the quality of 
child care.  For many parents their children come first and they 
seek more flexibility, options and choices to allow them to put 
the interests of their children ahead of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social policy should presume that parents and not governments 
should be making decisions affecting the caregiving of their 
children.  They are in the best position to choose what 
constitutes the best possible care arrangement for their 
children.  We should therefore seek to provide as much 
flexibility and as many options and choices to parents in the 
best interests of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to the importance of breast feeding.  In April 
1998 Dr. Christopher Ruhm of the University of North Carolina 
published a research paper entitled “Parental Leave and Child 
Health”.  This researcher studied 25 years of population data in 
nine European countries.  He found up to a 29% reduction in 
infant mortality where parental leave of at least 50 weeks was 
taken.  That is very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research also highlighted the significant benefits of breast 
feeding and found a lower incidence of sudden infant death 
syndrome, accidental deaths, and sicknesses causing death. 
Exposure to a broader range of environmental risks, travel risks, 
risks associated with public places and risks associated with 
exposure to other persons, in particular children, were all 
contributing factors to the overall findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health benefits of breast feeding cannot be overstated.  In 
1998 the Canadian Paediatric Society announced its unanimous 
endorsement of the World Health Organization's new recommended 
guideline that mothers should breast feed for at least one year 
for optimal health outcomes of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research on breast feeding clearly confirms the importance 
for optimal infant health.  It also enhances the bond between 
mother and child which is a significant factor affecting healthy 
outcomes.  In addition, a family can save up to $4,000 in the 
first year in the cost of baby formula alone, which significantly 
affects the economics of the decision to provide direct parental 
care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the comprehensive research, there is a need to promote, 
protect and support breast feeding in Canada.  Extended parental 
leave options could help to achieve these objectives.  According 
to Dr. Fraser Mustard, breast feeding can provide a perfect 
nutritional and emotional nurturing to endow an infant with the 
important capacity needed for a full and productive life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be the criteria for policy development?  Obviously, 
our policy should be child centred and promote the best interests 
of children to the best extent possible.  It should presume that 
parents are the primary caregivers.  It should provide 
flexibility, options and choices.  It should be inclusive and 
responsive to the social realities.  That is why we need more 
choices.  Finally, the policy should be fair and equitable and 
neither penalize nor compel caregiving choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first year of life is the most important period during which 
a caregiver can influence the future physical, mental and social 
health outcomes of children.  It is vital that this opportunity 
for either parent to provide direct parental care to a new child 
or an adopted child during that first year should be made 
available.  Therefore, extending parental leave from the current 
10 weeks to 37 weeks to allow one full year for one of the 
parents to provide direct parental care is an important option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in children, particularly during the formative years, 
represents a sound preventative strategy to improve the physical, 
mental and social health of children.  Even the most conservative 
research estimates show that for every $1 invested in children, 
there are $2 saved in health, social program, educational and 
criminal justice costs.  The studies have even estimated cost 
savings to be as much as $7 for every $1 invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by repeating the most important fact. In Canada 
25% of our children enter adult life with significant emotional, 
behavioural, academic or social problems.  The monetary and 
social costs are enormous and therefore investing in children is 
an imperative, not an option.  Research has consistently found 
that the most significant determinant of child health outcomes is 
the quality of care provided during the first years of life. 
Therefore, if we value our children, we must also value our 
caregivers.  In my view, extending parental care is in a small 
way showing that we do value our children and their caregivers.

Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Employment Insurance; the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North Centre, Tobacco. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to commend the hon. member on making some very good 
points with respect to children and the importance of caring and 
nurturing children and investing in children.  He touched upon 
some very important issues, breast feeding, proper nurturing of 
the child, the bonding between parent and child, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek his comments on another topic which is very closely 
related and that is homelessness.  Today we saw on the Hill what 
in my view was a very sad commentary upon the state of our 
society.  Numerous homeless people and people supporting them 
came to the Hill to make their concerns known to the nation's 
capital and to those who are leading this country.  There were 
riot police lined up in riot gear, dogs, and police with batons. 
There was even the use of pepper spray against these unfortunate 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious problem. What does the hon. member see in 
the throne speech that addresses that issue?  We know a minister 
was appointed to deal with the homelessness issue.  She has been 
travelling across the country and gathering information, but it 
is time now to stop travelling and stop studying.  The answers 
are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that the federal government needs to reinvest 
in the social housing program, reinvest in support services for 
those who are released from institutions and so forth, yet the 
throne speech did not address those issues.  Does the hon. member 
have any comments on that problem?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of homelessness is 
a very serious and important priority for the government.  The 
member will well understand that homelessness is a complex 
problem that needs more than a simple solution.  There is no 
simple solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Golden report on homelessness found that 35% of homeless 
people in Toronto had mental illness, 28% were youth who were 
alienated from their families of which 70% had experienced 
physical or sexual abuse, 18% were aboriginals off reserve and 
10% were abused women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will well understand that this does not paint a 
picture of economic poverty and homelessness due to economic 
causes.  It is social poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right that there have to be solutions.  But 
I can tell the member that finding a solution to mental illness, 
to family breakdown, to youth who are alienated from their 
families, to domestic violence and to aboriginal issues will take 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member would concede that the government has covered 
the bases in terms of putting the framework in place so that all 
members in this place can work together to deal with 
homelessness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to try once again because I have known this gentleman for a 
few years and I totally respect his values, his understanding of 
family and of young children.  I know he has his heart in the 
right place.  We have also served on committees together to try 
and resolve some of the problems that young children face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the child pornography issue and hundreds of 
thousands of signatures and letters from the Canadian public and 
many more on its way, can the member explain to me why the 
government is reluctant to do something about the issue today by 
invoking the notwithstanding clause as some of the member's 
backbenchers have suggested prior to this date?  Let us stop the 
perversion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand the member's 
question.  The Sharpe case has certainly challenged Canadians to 
deal with the very serious issue of possession of child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was simple possession alone.  The member knows that the 
effect of that case was to basically deal with the laws as they 
stand in B.C.  Throughout the rest of the country, the member 
knows that the laws of Canada remain in place and continue to be 
in force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has asked a specific question and I will give him an 
answer.  I am advised by justice officials that if the 
notwithstanding clause was invoked it could not be applied 
retroactively, in which case Sharpe would get off.  I do not want 
Sharpe to get off. I want the laws of Canada to be defended in 
the courts to the fullest extent.  I do not want anybody in 
Canada to get away with possession of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notwithstanding clause is only a perspective instrument.  We 
have to go back and make sure that all of the cases and all of 
the charges that have been laid since the Sharpe case, get dealt 
with by the laws of Canada that protect our children from those 
who would seek to abuse them.

to take part in today's debate on the throne speech and to 
respond to a number of statements made in that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out first off that the session started four weeks 
late. According to the government, that time was used to prepare 
the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should let you know at this point that, like my colleagues, I 
will be sharing my time. I will be sharing it with the hon. 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. We will both speak for 
ten minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, it is unfortunate that the government delayed 
the beginning of the session by four weeks in order to draft 
this Speech from the Throne which, as we all know, could have 
been prepared over the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech is timid and lukewarm in terms of substance. While it 
is rather lengthy, the speech does not have much substance. It 
lacks substance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are a few interesting things in there, but 
there are also serious omissions. Take telecommunications for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to telecommunications, the throne speech says that 
the government will adapt its programs to reflect the 
socioeconomic realities of rural communities and that it will 
intensify its efforts to ensure that those communities and all 
regions of Canada can take advantage of the opportunities 
created by the new global, knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand what that means. It means that the government 
wants to connect all rural communities. I am all for it, because 
it is important. 
Between you and me, many people still use the phone to talk. 
Computers are not the only ones to use phone lines. In our rural 
communities, there are still ordinary people made of flesh and 
bones who like to pick up to phone to have a conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing for these people? Let me tell you 
what it is doing, or rather what it is not doing for them. In 
urban areas, the government allows for competition to decrease 
the cost of local residential phone services. In rural areas, 
the phone bill has been going up year after year. In some cases, 
it increased twofold over six years. This represents an 
impressive inflation rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that? The problem is simple. Businesses operating in 
rural areas have higher telephone bills than those operating in 
urban areas. 
The message to these businesses is very clear: if you want to 
save on communication costs, get out of the rural areas and into 
the city.  I am sorry to say that is an unacceptable message. 
Rural communities have a right to life as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a company or individual in a rural area wants to have 
telephone service, the first thing needed is quality service. 
There are some areas in Quebec, Ontario and elsewhere that are 
still in the party-line era, with two households to a line and 
with exchanges that cannot handle electronic signals.  In short, 
they are still in the dark ages, telephonically speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the long distance costs.  There are big savings 
to be made by major companies with high calling volumes. 
But an individual—a man or woman who is not just a single user 
but a rural user on top of that—may find, believe it or not, that 
he or she is in a municipality where calling city hall is a long 
distance call. Imagine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech has nothing to say on any of this, but I would 
go even further.  Very recently, just a few weeks ago, the CRTC 
brought down a decision on high service-cost areas, which to all 
intents and purposes means the rural areas.  The assumption was 
that telephone companies charge reasonable amounts to their 
subscribers and therefore there was nothing to worry about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The telephone companies have raised their monthly rates for 
local calling beyond a reasonable level. 
Some families have discontinued phone service.  Others, however, 
cannot and will not, but will give up some other essential 
instead or will deprive their children of some other essential. 
It seems that the Speech from the Throne has no consideration 
for these circumstances, which are worsening poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the Minister of Industry, in particular, 
through the CRTC, have totally abandoned the rural community. 
In Quebec the situation is even more tragic.  Most of rural 
Quebec is served by Québec Téléphone, known as Quebec Tel.  This 
company is 51% American owned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, the CRTC has denied Quebec Tel the right to 
expand within Quebec or Canada, but is permitting Canadian firms 
and even new companies from the United States—AT&T and Sprint— 
to eat away at the territory of Quebec Tel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, Quebec Tel is being eaten away from the inside by 
this competition, which, to all intents and purposes, is unfair. 
The Minister of Industry could, with a simple decision, accord 
Quebec Tel the rights the other telephone companies, including 
the American companies, enjoy on Canadian soil.  This puts both 
the company and its subscribers, including myself, at a 
disadvantage.  The situation is intolerable and unacceptable and 
is not even mentioned in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This speech does not deal with the real challenges in 
telecommunications, challenges that concern the rural community. 
The country is big.  Quebec is big, it is vast.  There is air 
and great open spaces, but the government is literally mocking 
the people who live in these spaces and who need telephone 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wherever I am in Quebec, my hydro bill is always the same: 
distance is not a factor. 
The cost of my car registration is the same for a given class of 
vehicle.  My drivers' license costs the same, whether I live in 
Montreal, Quebec City or Portneuf.  So why, tell me why, does 
the cost of my telephone vary according to where I live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the choice for the telephone of the hydro approach or the 
airline route approach.  The choice was the airline route 
approach, and the cost has become prohibitive for those who live 
far away.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wanted to follow my colleague; in fact, what I have is more of a 
remark than a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is entirely right.  In the throne speech, we have the 
government talking about the Internet and about connecting many 
municipalities in Quebec with the world.  This is all very 
lovely, but since I too am a member with a rural riding, I can 
confirm that, in 1999, on the eve of the next millennium, there 
are taxpayers in Quebec—and in Canada as well, I am sure—who have 
party lines, and even some who do not have any telephone service 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to invest in impressive programs 
such as the Internet, but does nothing about what is happening 
just outside major cities. 
Bell Canada and other telephone companies have come up with this 
wonderful concept of areas without service.  I urge all members 
of the House to examine the legislation and to look at all the 
definitions.  They will realize that, ultimately, the telephone 
companies are the big winners.  All they have to do is sit 
tight. That is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government should take some very tough action.  When 
the CRTC looked into this, the government was strangely quiet, 
while the regions all got together to bring to light the fact 
that, in 1999, there are, as I said, families without any 
telephone service at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, Bell Canada has allocated telephone numbers to 
families—they are listed in the directory—that do not even have 
service because their homes are perhaps 10 or 15 metres beyond 
the last telephone pole. It is as ridiculous as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite sit back, go on about the Internet and want 
to see the whole world connected.  All these political speeches 
are very impressive, but the regions are being left to fend for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask my colleague if this is a situation he 
sees in his riding, on the outskirts of Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague raises an 
important point. Let me tell you about my riding of Portneuf and 
in particular the Portneuf RCM. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Portneuf RCM, there are a lot of exchange areas. And 
within some of these exchange areas, there are long distance 
charges to call from one community to another, even if there are 
no long distance charges to make a call to Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you see what impact this has? The Portneuf RCM is a social 
environment. People have lived in these communities for 
generations now. And since there are long distance charges, for 
instance, from Saint-Raymond to Saint-Marc-des Carrières, some 
people will forgo making phone calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some older people who have lived all their lives in the 
Portneuf area, who have worked there, have raised their families 
and are now retired. These people can no longer afford to call 
their children, who live in another community only 20 or 30 
kilometres away, because of the long distance charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the CRTC regulations not ensure that the people living in 
a social environment like Portneuf have the opportunity to call 
members of their own family? Or is their only purpose to allow 
major corporations to lower their long distance charges? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something does not make sense here ,and the government is not 
addressing the issue, and I think my colleague shares my 
concern. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
will be very short. I think the member for Portneuf will be able 
to answer it immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he just mentioned clearly explains one reason why more and 
more people are leaving our regions. What does he think the 
federal government should do to stop the exodus to the large 
urban centres? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, young people are indeed 
leaving our regions and people who need medical care are moving 
to the city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is simple, however. Let us give the regions 
affordable telephone access everywhere. Let us eliminate long 
distance charges within an area that forms a single social and 
economic environment, such as the Portneuf area. That would 
solve a lot of problems. It is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Feasible proposals have been made by Quebec Tel and Télébec, 
among others. One such system has been implemented in the United 
States. The government must take action in this regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is now my turn to take part in this debate on the Speech from 
the Throne. I must say that I am not doing so with much 
enthusiasm, because, as many observers pointed out when it was 
read in the other place, I found it was very dull and lacked 
substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not the fault of our new governor general, who read it 
very well, but it was so dull that I saw people who were nearly 
falling asleep, even though they had taken the precaution of 
standing while it was being read. They did not find it very 
lively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the first three throne speeches delivered by 
this government since I was elected in 1993 were not very lively 
either.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this dull and vague speech, which makes no real 
commitments, is a screen for a certain government strategy. I 
think the government intends to tinker with the rules under 
which the next referendum will be held in Quebec. It has raised 
the issue of the majority; it has challenged the principle of a 
simple majority, which is accepted throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland joined the Canadian federation, after two 
referendums, with a majority of 52%. Several countries joined 
the European Economic Community with 51% of the vote. This 
principle is universally accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was even confirmed in Mont-Tremblant, where the 
intergovernmental affairs minister hosted a seminar. Several 
experts confirmed this principle, including some from Scotland. 
But the minister still wants to review the rules concerning the 
majority needed in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, there is talk about a clear question. In 
the referendum on the Charlottetown accord, in 1992, voters had 
to vote without having seen the accord. How is that for a clear 
question? Voters were asked whether they supported an accord 
they had never seen. Many voters had never got a copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the hon. member for Portneuf said, however, it does not 
take a great deal of time to examine this speech. The main 
problem with it is what it does not say. Just like the member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, I was disappointed not to find 
in this speech a single word on shipbuilding. 
Yet, 160,000 people sent the Prime Minister a postcard asking 
for a new shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, I heard industry officials acknowledge the fact 
following an emotional outburst from a Reform member who was 
wondering why this sector should be supported. We will deal with 
this Reform member in due course. The department official's 
reply was “No, we are not doing anything special in support of 
shipbuilding”. This prompted me to say that was exactly what we 
were criticizing the Liberal government for: not doing anything 
special for shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one country in the world that is blessed with the largest 
marine area, three oceans and the longest interior seaway in the 
world, a country that does much trading, the shipbuilding 
industry currently accounts for only 0.4%. Yet, our country is 
among those with the heaviest marine traffic per capita. There 
is something wrong with this picture. At any rate, I will have 
the opportunity to pursue the matter when a private member's 
bill comes up for debate in the House next Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the speech from the Throne is “Building a Higher 
Quality of Life for All Canadians”. What about the quality of 
life? While 62.7% of Americans are employed, only 59.5% of 
Canadians are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, the unemployment rate has decreased, but only 40% of 
Canadians who lose their job qualify for EI. 
What a beautiful country. The other 60% have to rely on social 
assistance, which, as we know, is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members addressed transfer payments. Let me quote a 
startling figure: since the Liberals took office, there are 
500,000 more children living in poverty. These children live 
below the poverty line, which means that their parents are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, our productivity rate is only 81.3% that of the United 
States. Over the past 20 years, the average actual income has 
shrunk by about $142 annually.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are not getting better. I can see why the government is 
saying that we must build a better quality of life. That 
statement may mean that the government has finally realized that 
there is a problem. If so, then the Prime Minister should stop 
saying that Canada is the best country in the world, because it 
is not necessarily true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the actual per capita income was $29,000. This figure 
includes high income earners. In the U.S., it is $46,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any country where the quality of life is generally good should 
invest in training its workers. Canada ranks 13th in that 
regard. 
As for research and development, we are dead last among the G-7 
nations. The government boasts about a knowledge-based economy, 
when in fact scientific research institutions and centres have 
suffered such deep cuts that they have not yet made it back to 
the 1995 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance managed to achieve a zero deficit. He 
even generated surpluses. I do not know what his objective is 
for the next five years. It may be that he is aiming for a 
surplus of close to $100 billion, this at a time when there are 
more and more poor and middle-income families. When we talk about 
middle-income families, that includes of course some high-income 
earners. This means that the situation is even worse for 
low-income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, there was a demonstration on the front lawn of parliament. 
There has never been so many homeless people in Toronto, 
Vancouver, Montreal and all the other major cities across 
Canada. Those people have nowhere to go. They have to rely on 
soup kitchens. It does not make any sense to keep on repeating 
that Canada is the very best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This speech does not talk about matters over which the federal 
government has full jurisdiction. What little substance there is 
in the throne speech deals with matters of provincial 
jurisdiction. It is a shame, and we can never denounce it 
enough. 
I sometimes tune in to open line shows. People seem to think 
that it is only in Quebec that waiting rooms are crowded. The 
situation is the same everywhere, in Ontario and elsewhere. Why? 
Because of drastic cuts to transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questioned, the minister of Finance suggests that fewer 
cuts are being made and he even tries to pass these off as 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bland and unsubstantial speech, but the little 
substance that can be found in it is indeed very subtle. It 
reflects an increasing invasion of provincial jurisdictions. The 
will to impede Quebec democracy by interfering in the referendum 
rules is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Liberals have to do is mind their own business. It is up 
to Quebecers, and Quebecers alone, to decide their future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, when my 
colleague spoke about a dull speech that lacked substance, I am 
sure he was not talking about his speech but about the throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate him and to take this opportunity to 
commend him for his work on shipyards and also to point out the 
fact that he has the full co-operation of our party on this most 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member is always serious and very sensible, I would 
like to benefit from his expertise. I noted that he talked a lot 
about poverty.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is somewhat hidden because people believe it is linked 
to the unemployment rate, at present. One must never forget that 
the unemployed who are no longer eligible for EI benefits become 
welfare recipients, and then we lose track of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think poverty has become the biggest problem in the country. A 
lot of people are suffering, people who work part time, people 
who have temporary jobs that pay very little, less than the 
minimum required to make a decent living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague, in this the international year 
of action to fight poverty, if he would seriously consider 
implementing a guaranteed minimum income program in Canada. 
Canada is said to be a rich country for a few people. 
Would the fact of being Canadian not justify having access, at a 
certain age, to a guaranteed minimum income to be able to meet 
one's basic needs, which a very large part of Canada's 
population cannot do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if he knows of a study on the validity 
of the concept of a guaranteed minimum income for all Canadians 
at age 18 or 21, which would allow them to get by until they can 
get a better paying job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé: </B>Mr. Speaker, I almost turned red—in spite of 
myself—at hearing a member of another party compliment me. I 
thank him for his compliments. I did not expect this kind of 
comments from him, but I am greatly honored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked me an interesting question. I remember that, when I was 
sitting on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, several people had indeed raised this issue with 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to speak on behalf of my party. I want to express 
a personal opinion. Because of shared jurisdictions in a federal 
system, the issue is very complex. On the social union agreement 
alone, there are differences of opinion between Quebec and the 
other provinces. 
Whether one is a sovereignist or a federalist, the hon. member 
for Chicoutimi knows well that, when Quebec's interests are 
close to one's heart, one cannot ignore certain things on the 
federal level when the government wants to interfere in 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, in the current context, a guaranteed minimum 
income in a confederate state or a federation would be very 
difficult because there must be a lot of consultation and 
co-ordination between the different governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sovereign Quebec, this would be possible and I would be one 
of the main proponents of this. Following the by-election in 
Hull—Aylmer, if he wants to keep his seat in Chicoutimi, the hon. 
member should consider joining the Bloc Quebecois to ask for the 
same thing as we have been asking. Perhaps a guaranteed minimum 
income under a sovereignist government in Quebec would then be 
possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Forget, who was a Liberal minister 20 years ago, made a 
study on a guaranteed minimum wage. This study said that such a 
program was possible. As my colleague for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière said, it would be very much easier 
for us if we were sovereign. Even in Canada, however, it surely 
is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière a question. It is true that 
there are poor people everywhere, including 1.5 million 
children. In our regions, it is even worse. What could the 
member say to the government to convince it to listen up, to 
open its heart and to help the poor in our regions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer would be that 
government members should do what the member for 
Matapédia—Matane does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should do what he does. He brings the problems of his 
constituents before the House. We should not do like the Liberal 
members, who try to sell indefensible Liberal policies, such as 
employment insurance cuts, in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable. They should do what my colleague does and 
stand up for their constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
distinguished member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul.  It gives me 
great pleasure to address the House in reply to the recent Speech 
from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a proud member of the club of 1988.  November 21 will mark 
my 11th anniversary as a member of the House, representing the 
voters in the west end of Winnipeg first for the riding of 
Winnipeg—St. James and now, following redistribution in 1997, 
the riding of Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those 11 years I have witnessed much change, most of it for 
the better.  I spent my first five years on the opposition 
benches during the Mulroney years.  I am quite sure you remember 
them well, Mr. Speaker, even though you were not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the letters and phone calls I received in those days. 
People were down on their federal government, and some of them 
were even down on their country.  There were issues like the 
divisive constitutional changes proposed at Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown, the bitter debate over free trade, the soaring 
deficit and debt, and an economic recession thrown in for good 
measure.  All those issues left many Canadians feeling 
pessimistic about their futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In late 1993 the country changed for the better with the 
election of a new government, bringing in a new approach and some 
new directions.  The new Liberal government embarked on an 
ambitious plan to put Canadians back to work and to restore 
stability and credibility to the nation's finances.  We have 
worked hard to rebuild the foundations of Canada.  We have worked 
hard to restore the confidence of Canadians in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that in short order the government transformed 
the record deficit of $42 billion that we inherited from our 
predecessors to two consecutive balanced budgets, with a third on 
the way, and a growing budget surplus.  As a result interest 
rates have fallen sharply, driving the economy to create, it is 
hard to believe, nearly two million jobs since we took office in 
the fall of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Manitoba the federal government's economic 
policies have helped push the unemployment rate down to 5.4%. 
That is one of the lowest in the country, if not the lowest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the nation's finances firmly under control and the economy 
growing, the government has been able to make key reinvestments 
in social and economic programs.  That is something Canadians 
want us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, research and development funding has been boosted 
significantly.  Health care funding has been increased by $11.5 
billion, of which my province of Manitoba will receive $425 
million.  We have improved support for those pursuing 
post-secondary education through changes to the tax system and by 
introducing the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our infrastructure renewal programs have seen some $6 billion 
invested across the country improving everything from community 
centres to highways, including a number of projects in my riding 
of Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the opposition may want Canadians to believe, we 
have begun cutting taxes in the last three budgets, or 
effectively over the past three budgets, to about $16.5 billion. 
Average families in my riding earning $50,000 will see their 
federal taxes fall by $550.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only the beginning.  We stand today before a new century 
confident in the future of our country.  All Canadians can be 
proud of our achievements as an independent and prosperous 
country with a dynamic economy and a strong and democratic 
society.  As the United Nations consistently reminds us, Canada 
is the best place to live in the world.  That declaration has 
come from the United Nations for the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are confident that despite a rapidly changing world 
where technology, knowledge and creativity are the driving forces 
of the new economy, Canada will succeed.  Maintaining and 
enhancing our standard of living require a comprehensive strategy 
to take us into the 21st century.  The throne speech boldly sets 
out that strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's vision for the future includes a commitment to 
Canada's children and youth, which is a very good start; the 
building of a dynamic economy; further strengthening our health 
care system; ensuring the quality of our environment; building 
stronger communities; improving the relationship with aboriginal 
peoples; and advancing Canada's place in the world.  It is large 
order.  It is an ambitious agenda, but it is something that we 
simply have to do on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan for the next two to five years is comprehensive: first, 
increase maternity and parental leave benefits; second, a federal 
provincial agreement on more supports for early childhood 
development, which is very important; third, more after tax money 
in the hands of families; fourth, more family friendly 
workplaces; fifth, modernization of family law; sixth, a third 
significant investment in the national child benefit; and 
seventh, strengthened learning opportunities through an expanded 
SchoolNet.  That is real support for Canadian families in the 
Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While hon. members opposite profess to offer so-called solutions 
to the country's woes, the government has delivered and is 
preparing to deliver even more.  I think Canadians recognize 
this.  The phone calls and letters I receive these days are much 
more optimistic and much more positive about our future than the 
ones I received 10 or 11 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very frank.  This is not to say that all is well 
and that the government can afford to rest on its laurels.  That 
is not the truth.  There are all kinds of things to do to keep on 
building this great country.  There is a lot to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in my home area of Canada in the west, prairie 
farmers find themselves in the midst of one of the worst 
agricultural periods since the Great Depression.  The Liberal 
government has responded with a $1.5 billion income assistance 
program designed and implemented in partnership with the 
provinces and stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many argue that $1.5 billion is not enough.  It would be more 
accurate to say that not enough of it has been paid out so far. 
Federal assistance to prairie farmers has recently been boosted 
by an additional $170 million, something announced by the 
agriculture minister just days ago, raising the total federal 
emergency aid to farmers to over a billion dollars.  This is over 
and above ongoing federal support payments of $600 million to 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having grown up on a farm in southern Manitoba around the 
community of Glenboro, I understand and greatly sympathize with 
the plight of prairie farmers.  I would like to see existing 
income assistance moneys paid out as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only part of the solution.  In the Speech from the 
Throne the government reaffirmed its long term commitment to 
Canada's farmers.  We will work to reduce foreign export 
subsidies at the upcoming WTO meetings in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also reaffirmed the importance of biotechnology 
research to the future of Canada's agriculture industry and 
pledged additional support.  In addition, the government is 
committed to helping prairie farmers by building on the work 
already done by Judge Estey and Mr. Kroeger in their reports on 
the grain transportation system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must ensure that there is greater competition 
within the system and that producers receive the benefits through 
lower transportation costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment briefly on the importance of ongoing 
communication between the government and the public.  I recently 
had the honour of heading up a caucus task force on the four 
western provinces.  That task force was mandated to complement 
the work of the existing western Liberal caucus by consulting 
with western Canadians about what the government's priorities 
should be as we approach the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without prejudicing the contents of the report, which I expect 
will be released very soon, western Canadians overwhelmingly 
welcomed the opportunity to be consulted on what the government's 
priorities should be as we enter the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech reflects many of the comments that my task 
force heard during our consultations.  The commitment to further 
tax cuts while reinvesting in the social safety net, the 
commitment to further investments in research and development and 
improvements to our infrastructure, and ensuring that Canada's 
children and families are a priority are all important issues for 
western Canadians.  The government is listening to western 
Canadians, indeed to all Canadians, and it is responding to what 
it is hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech provides an inspiring vision to take Canada 
into the new millennium.  As the Prime Minister so boldly stated, 
Canada will be the place to be in the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
pleased to hear the hon. member mention that our society needs a 
dynamic economy.  He spoke about more money being in one's hands 
after taxes, which is very important, but in order for people to 
have more money they must have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to direct the hon. member's attention to an issue that is 
very important to those of us who live in the maritimes, the 
issue of a national shipbuilding policy.  The throne speech made 
no mention of that issue whatsoever and yet it is an issue that 
has been brought forward on many occasions and presented to the 
federal government as a very pressing concern for those living in 
coastal areas.  Management, workers and many people are 
supporting the idea of a national shipbuilding policy, a policy 
that is aimed at bringing about some very productive employment 
for the people who have the skills and training necessary to 
perform that work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the hon. member see anything in the throne speech that gives 
any hope or any promise for a national shipbuilding policy for 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member from 
Halifax wants to gain insight into this issue, I invite him to 
read the report by the Liberal caucus representing Atlantic 
Canada.  He will find that reading very interesting.  The report 
contains a lot of information on the issue of a shipbuilding 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member from Halifax wants to be updated on what 
government members are doing and saying with respect to 
shipbuilding in Atlantic Canada, I want him to read that caucus 
report.  It is good reading.

delivering the Speech from the Throne with an eloquence that 
befits the inspiring vision of the Government of Canada for the 
21st century, that is building a higher quality of life for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the constituents of Winnipeg North—St. Paul, I

</I></B></P><P align=left>This House is a very special place, indeed, where openness of 
hearts and openness of minds are a way of life, where the true 
power of co-operation reveals the very best in our nation and the 
very best for our nation, a democratic society with responsible 
government and a citizenry committed to hard work, integrity and 
justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of life in Canada speaks for itself.  For six years 
in a row, Canada has been deemed by the United Nations as the 
best country in the world in which to live.  As we cherish this 
honour, let us reflect once more on our country's past, as did 
the Prime Minister in his response to the Speech from Throne when 
he said that Canada is a triumph of will over geography and 
economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the departing 20th century has been a challenge to 
Canada.  The Prime Minister noted that in a century of tyranny, 
of brutal dictatorships, of human rights oppression and of 
growing gaps between the haves and have nots, Canadians gave 
their lives so that others could live in freedom.  He said Canada 
embraced a charter of rights and freedoms and developed an 
advanced system of social security and a social safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that in a century of great economic progress, 
of entrepreneurship and innovation, and of education, Canada grew 
from a small agrarian society to become one of the leading 
industrialized countries in the world and the only major country 
in the world to have all its schools linked to the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadian successes define the conscience and the strength 
of our nation's will as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister went on to emphasize that in a century where 
artistic production has expanded as never before, Canadians 
occupy a place of honour.  I just saw the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage beaming with pride and joy, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sum of all these achievements equates to our Canadian 
genius.  It is this Canadian genius that the Government of Canada 
applied to succeed in eliminating the $42 billion national 
deficit, reducing the double digit unemployment rate, restoring 
our collapsing physical infrastructure and balancing the books of 
the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this Canadian genius that guided the Government of Canada 
in the creation of the national child benefit program, the 
establishment of the Canada millennium scholarship fund, the 
restoration of $11.5 billion transfer payments for medicare and 
the increase in the budget for research, innovation and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have watched the government lead the country from a 
nation of despair to a nation of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as Canada rightfully basks today in the quality of life of 
our people, we are the first as a people to acknowledge that we 
can do better for ourselves and for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne defines our national vision for 
Canada in the 21st century and our plan to turn our vision of 
today into the reality of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister spoke of the need for a comprehensive 
strategy for leadership in the knowledge economy and for 
promoting our interests and projecting our values in the world, a 
strategy that integrates the economy, social policy and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sees that the role of a national government today is to 
represent the future to the present, is sometimes to act 
directly, sometimes to work in partnership, sometimes to create a 
framework for the private sector and sometimes simply to lead by 
example.  He sees that to attain our national vision and meet our 
national objectives, we must work with Canadians to achieve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, we come to this special place to make 
a difference in the quality of life of our fellow citizens, not 
only for a few of them, not for some of them, not even for most 
of them, but for all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Government of Canada has in mind when it 
commits to develop our children and youth, build a dynamic 
economy, strengthen health care and quality care, ensure the 
quality of our environment, build stronger communities, 
strengthen the relationship with Canada's aboriginal peoples, and 
advance Canada's place in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada beholds the dawn of the new era, let us be reminded 
that our greatness as a nation rests as much in our past as in 
our future.  The greatness of a nation is tested when it creates 
opportunities out of challenges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one such challenge that touches the heart of the 
Canadian experience.  I speak of the challenge in rural Canada 
which at once becomes a challenge for all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm income crisis is real and painful, and we worry very 
much about the farmers affected and their families, their sons, 
daughters and grandchildren.  For most of them, this crisis is a 
matter of survival:  food on the table, security from bankruptcy 
and a sense of confidence in tomorrow.  That is why the 
Government of Canada has announced an additional $170 million 
over and above the over $1 billion that is already in our 
disaster aid program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the government caucus continue to preoccupy ourselves with 
this very vital issue.  We are determined to examine all options 
for a solution and we will search for new approaches, such as 
easing the cost of transportation and handling of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the northern and western federal Liberal caucus, I 
share with colleagues the sense of duty and dedication on the 
part of our members to contribute our share to the future of our 
nation.  Rural Canada and our farmers are a vital part of that 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a Canada with a higher quality of life for the whole of 
our citizenry where every Canadian from every region shares the 
blessings of this great nation.  Let not our experiences of pain 
detract from our sense of belonging to this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We challenge ourselves to lend our ears and hear with equal 
acuity the voices that come from all regions of our country. 
Although not everything can possibly be done, we must have the 
wisdom to reconcile them all, to reconcile the diversity of our 
needs and aspirations just as we reconcile the diversity of our 
talents and experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early at the turn of this now departing century, then prime 
minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, while beholding a model of Gothic 
architecture in England, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cathedral was made of granite, oak and marble.  It is the 
image of the nation I wish to become.  For here, I want the 
granite to remain granite, the oak to remain oak, the marble to 
remain marble.  Out of these elements, I will build a nation 
great among the nations of the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I behold a parliament whose governor general is from the 
Pacific and whose members of the Senate and the House of Commons 
come from varied roots, a parliament where we hear the sound of 
many tongues and accents, see the sight of many colours, feel the 
beatings of many caring hearts and distill the wisdom of many 
minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And thus, I am confident that working together this parliament 
can achieve our common vision:  building a higher quality of life 
for all Canadians.  We can say, with resolute confidence, the 
great future is indeed Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments made by the hon. member.  He talked about 
Canada's vast resources and the fact that Canada is a vast 
country.  He also bragged about the Liberal government's policies 
for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know our population is low.  We know that Canada needs a 
larger market for our goods and services.  With the fast changes 
that are taking place in our country and in the international 
arena and the fast changes that are taking place in the global 
village, which is globalization, one policy that is very 
important for a nation is the foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not even one word about foreign policy in the throne 
speech. This is a policy that is like a thread in a necklace 
which keeps all the beads together.  A foreign policy is the 
policy on which the other policies of a nation depend.  I am 
talking about trade, the economy, the fiscal health of a country, 
investment, defence, security, immigration, human and natural 
resources and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since  a good, sound, solid foreign policy is very important to 
a nation, I would like to ask the member why there is not even a 
single word about foreign policy in the throne speech.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really saddened 
that the member stood in his place and said there is nothing in 
the Speech from the Throne on foreign policy.  I wonder whether 
indeed he has read the Speech from the Throne. Perhaps I should 
call to his attention pages 21 and 22 where it says, “Canada's 
place in the world”.  In the interest of time, the member should 
accept that that phrase speaks of Canada's foreign policy in the 
world, and that is to care for everyone. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member's speech. I noticed he 
spoke about everybody sharing in the blessings of this great 
nation and the importance of that happening. In order for some 
communities to share in the blessings that this nation has, there 
is a need for basic infrastructure within a lot of small 
communities right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Halifax West many small communities could 
certainly benefit from the Canada infrastructure works program. 
Quite some time ago I wrote to the Prime Minister on that issue 
and got a response that indicated it would depend largely upon 
the provinces and the municipalities wanting to have such a 
program. My understanding is that the provinces have now come on 
board and want the program.  The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities has written to support such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence has shown from the past program that it is a useful 
way of getting very basic infrastructure such as roads, sewage 
and water systems into many communities that would not otherwise 
be able to have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member see anything in the throne speech that 
would give any hope for a program that would address the basic 
infrastructure needs of our communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased the 
member raised that question and shared with us his concerns for 
citizens of Canada.  Therefore I am obliged to remind the member, 
and all members of the House, that pages 12 to 16 give the exact 
plan of the government on the infrastructure for Canada for the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will encompass not only the physical infrastructure but the 
information, knowledge and cultural infrastructures as well.  In 
other words, the sum total of our resources will be used so that 
we will all be stronger.  It is in the throne speech and the 
member can expect a real hope of attainment on that issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague from Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to reply to the Speech from 
the Throne which is supposed to explain how parliament intends to 
proceed with public business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recessed this place for over four months. 
Canadians must be sorely disappointed with the lack of substance 
announced for the current session.  There must be particular 
disappointment in the whole area of justice. I will highlight 
some of the shortcomings in what was presented by the government 
in its speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have commented that a Speech from the Throne is intended to 
very generally indicate the direction of the government in the 
coming months.  It is often flowery with little substance, and 
that is understood.  Just what did it say to indicate where the 
government has its beliefs, its plans and its focus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often heard of the don't worry, be happy attitude of the 
Prime Minister.  His arrogance has become increasingly obvious. 
In spite of valid criticism, he always answers that only he knows 
what is best for Canadians.  His answer to citizens who do not 
like the way of things is that they can always move to another 
country.  What has he said through the Speech from the Throne? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His statement that “Canadians are justifiably proud of having 
built communities where citizens feel safe”, shows he knows very 
little about the average Canadian. Now that he has beefed up his 
own personal security through the RCMP, and now that he expends 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in maintaining that security, he 
jumps to the conclusion that all Canadians feel safe.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent Statistics Canada studies on public perception 
of crime show that Canadians do not feel safe.  Urban residents, 
females and seniors do not feel safe walking alone in their 
neighbourhoods at night.  More and more Canadians are cocooning 
themselves within their homes at night.  More and more Canadians 
are spending more and more on deadbolts, alarm systems, guard 
dogs and self defence courses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech claim to citizens feeling safe rings hollow to 
most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech goes on with more flowery words that on closer 
inspection contain little substance.  It talks of a 
reintroduction of legislation to reform the youth justice system. 
The government is acting only to quell the strong dissatisfaction 
of Canadians with the Young Offenders Act.  Even the Minister of 
Justice accepts its failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this government proposes little more than a name 
change of the current legislation.  It has only made minor 
improvements in limited areas. In most of the significant 
portions, it does not legislate the process.  It leaves it up to 
the discretion of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech promises reform of the youth justice system, 
but in reality Bill C-3 is little more than a puff piece.  There 
has been glitter, there has been spin doctoring and there has 
been promise, but there is little substance to the youth criminal 
justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech promises to combat drug trafficking.  The 
government likely made a similar promise 30 years ago.  It is no 
closer to solving the drug problem today than it was then.  In 
spite of billions of tax dollars spent on the war on drugs, we 
still have traffickers in our schools.  We still see that the 
vast majority of crimes are related in one way or another to 
drugs and all we get from the government is vague promises. What 
we do not see is concrete action to address the illegal use of 
drugs in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech mentions focusing attention on international 
crime, including money laundering, terrorism and the smuggling of 
people, drugs and guns.  We have seen how prepared this 
government is to the problem of people smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four boatloads of Chinese migrants were smuggled into my home 
province of British Columbia over the past few months.  Taxpayers 
face a potential bill of $52 million or $123,000 per person for 
the 420 individuals we have chosen to detain.  All indications 
are that more may also attempt to enter Canada in the same 
manner. We have all heard the minister's plan.  She is waiting 
for the north Pacific winter storms to deal with the rusty old 
ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has few, if any, ideas or programs to properly 
address crime within Canada and now it talks of addressing 
international crime.  It is all just talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech mentions strengthening the capacity of the 
RCMP.  However, it was this government that put the RCMP in such 
a fiscal straitjacket that the only training facility was forced 
to close.  Patrol cars are parked because the force cannot afford 
tires.  Planes were grounded, boats were docked, investigations 
were shelved due to lack of resources.  My home province of 
British Columbia is already short about 400 federal police 
officers.  My own community of Surrey has some 70 vacant 
positions in a complement of some 370. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government operates in a most peculiar manner.  First it 
rapes our national police force of its ability to function 
through budget freezes or inadequate resources.  Then at some 
future politically opportune time it will ride in on its white 
horse amid much fanfare to announce additional funding.  In the 
meantime our communities suffer from inadequate policing and lose 
valued police officers who leave for other opportunities because 
of frustrations and obstacles to doing their job.  All in all 
there is little promise for Canadians in the area of innovative 
justice programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to a couple of areas important to Canadians but which 
were not even mentioned in the throne speech.  There was no 
mention of the child pornography issue.  On January 15, 1999, 10 
months ago, Mr. Justice Duncan Shaw ruled that the present law on 
possession of child pornography was unconstitutional.  On January 
16 I wrote to the Attorney General of British Columbia urging him 
to appeal the decision, which he subsequently did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 21 I wrote to the justice minister to encourage her 
to immediately introduce amending legislation for the sake and 
the safety of our children. On January 26 approximately 70 
Liberal members and senators urged the minister to introduce new 
legislation, then promptly voted against a Reform Party motion to 
do just that.  The minister merely made public statements that in 
her legal determination the British Columbia Court of Appeal 
would uphold the constitutionality of the current law.  Well, we 
all know just how wrong she was.  The appeal court ruled that the 
law was unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote the minister once again urging her to introduce 
legislation to clearly define for the courts the intent of 
parliament on the possession of children pornography and still no 
action.  Instead, the minister now wants Canadians to wait for 
the Supreme Court of Canada to rule on the case which will not be 
heard until January.  The decision may take months. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile our justice system is left in chaos over this law. 
Some prosecutors are holding charges in abeyance until the 
supreme court decision. Some investigations are being shelved 
because scarce police resources cannot be wasted on legislation 
that may ultimately be unenforceable.  Convicted offenders are 
now proceeding with appeals.  And there is nothing from the 
government in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue of importance to Canadians is the raising of the 
age for consensual sex.  The Mulroney Tories lowered the age from 
16 to 14 years, meaning that a 14 year old can consent to having 
sexual relations with an adult.  Canadians everywhere feel that 
this law subjects young people to abuse by predatory adults. 
There is a clear cry for the return to the age of 16.  Canadians 
believe that those 14 and 15 are far too susceptible to coercion 
to be making informed decisions about sexual activity with older 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact in a recent case, two escaped sex offenders wound up 
with a 14 year old girl.  Eric Wanamaker, 51 years old, charged 
with sexually assaulting this young girl, was acquitted when the 
judge ruled her conflicting testimony led him to believe that she 
had consented.  It is difficult to believe that a 14 year old has 
the wherewithal to make a free and informed consent with a 51 
year old, especially when we consider emotional maturity and 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention of the issue of consent in the throne 
speech.  It does not seem to be a priority for the government. 
Once again the government will probably study the issue to death 
and if anything ever does get done, it will be watered down in an 
ineffective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, the throne speech contained a number of smooth and 
flowery words.  It contained little if any substance.  Much of it 
contained issues that have been around for throne speech after 
throne speech.  It did not address many of the issues of concern 
to Canadians.  It leaves us with poor expectations.  I am 
disappointed and Canadians are disappointed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on this side of the House we were looking for a useful throne 
speech that the Liberals took so long to write.  Instead of high 
hopes what we got was a hopeless, empty shell of a speech. There 
is a lack of vision for the 21st century by the Liberal 
government and the Prime Minister confessed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had written that speech, I would have given a vision to 
build a strong and wide bridge for all Canadians to cross to the 
next millennium to find peace, hope, prosperity and opportunities 
for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the fast changes that have been taking place in the global 
village in the past decade, the foreign policy of a nation 
becomes increasingly important.  Foreign affairs was not 
mentioned in the throne speech.  There was not a single word 
about it.  A nation's policies on trade, the economy, fiscal 
health, investment, defence, security, immigration, human 
resources, natural resources and other issues depend on good 
sound foreign policy, but there was not a single word about it in 
the throne speech. There was no mention at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally we have had a niche in the world arena. In the 
world, Canada has little military interest, no weapons sales 
interest.  We have no hidden agenda.  We have no threatening 
trade interests.  But the current Liberal government is eroding 
our reputation as a potential world leader having integrity and 
fairness. The Liberal government's lack of a plan and its track 
record since 1993 show Canadians a weak spirit and a weak 
political will to make any leaps and bounds at the international 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has missed many opportunities for our 
country.  His missing King Hussein's funeral is typical of what 
he has done to our international reputation.  He did not allow 
B.C.'s emergency response team to go to Taiwan after the 
devastating earthquake there.  The Prime Minister also 
disappointed the people of Turkey in terms of helping them with 
the first of the two earthquakes.  He responded very late to the 
crisis in East Timor.  His policies were on the wrong track when 
India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests.  The government was 
on the verge of declaring a trade war with our largest trading 
partner earlier this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples.  The decisions concerning Iraq and 
Kosovo were done deals before they came to the floor of 
parliament.  It was meaningless to have take note debates without 
a vote.  It did not provide an opportunity for the government to 
listen to anyone in the House or to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign policy of the government has many faults.  There is 
not a word about foreign policy in the throne speech.  Over a 
century ago Sir John A. Macdonald hoped that Canada would be a 
source of strength, not weakness.  Our bilateral and multilateral 
foreign policy requires the integration of diplomatic, military 
and economic dimensions of policy into a coherent framework 
grounded in sound principles and oriented toward promoting long 
term security and prosperity for Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the official opposition and the Reform Party, as the 
government in waiting, released its interim foreign policy paper 
this week, <I>Canada in the New Millennium: A New Look at Foreign 
Policy</I>.  It is a sincere effort by the official opposition to 
present a thoughtful, strategic new foreign policy approach 
consistent with Canada's national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a program of action that will permit coherence, encourage 
consistency and retain moral purpose.  It seeks to restore our 
country's international credibility, shamefully squandered over 
the past 30 years by Liberal and Tory governments.  It is 
designed to advance our security and prosperity, and it allows 
our country to adapt to the ever changing dynamics of world 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's influence in the world has steadily declined.  In the 
last several years a small elite group has formulated our foreign 
policy.  Many of its assumptions stem from a 30 year old foreign 
policy that needs to be rethought.  The Liberals, beginning with 
Mr. Trudeau, have ignored, for example, the importance of NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada belongs to some 100 international organizations, some of 
which do not even exist.  There may not be any analysis done on 
cost benefits or value for tax dollars.  Our friends and foes 
wonder what are our national goals.  Canada is becoming the 
laughing stock of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government uses catch phrases like soft power and 
human security but has never explained what they mean.  In fact 
it has endangered our long term economic and political interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's foreign policy is not enhancing our security 
and prosperity.  This government and the Tories before it eroded 
Canada's military capability to the point that they have caused 
our international influence to decline.  Except for its 
initiatives to ban land mines, the government has failed to 
address drug and small weapon smuggling, organized crime, illegal 
immigrants, gangs, money laundering and industrial espionage, to 
name only a few areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are infamous reports of corruption and wrongdoing in our 
foreign embassies.  The government does only three things: first, 
it punishes whistleblowers; second, it covers up the wrongdoing; 
and third, it does nothing.  The government has practically done 
nothing to address this serious issue.  Based on a constituent's 
concern I discovered some wrongdoing, took action and attempted 
to fix the problem.  Our image is being tarnished and our 
abilities at the international level have been curtailed as these 
situations go unaddressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have foreign missions where people are lining up and waiting 
for many hours.  They have no washrooms, drinking water or 
covered facilities. 
Next door to these places are the embassies and high commissions 
from other countries that provide those basic facilities, not to 
mention air conditioning.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our foreign policy has been hostile to certain nations and 
discriminatory toward others.  The immigration head tax is a good 
example of that, and so is the inconsistency of the government's 
handing out foreign aid in billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals continue to maintain and promise that they will 
provide 0.7% of the GNP to foreign aid, but actually they have 
been able to give only one-third of that.  The question is not 
one of more or less but one of fair commitment.  They deliver a 
message of false hope to the poor and starving people and the 
governments of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government delivers billions of dollars of our foreign aid 
unaudited, without transparency, without parliamentary review and 
without compatibility with our national interest.  It ensures 
that it is unaccountable by refusing to establish the aid 
effectiveness measurement asked for by the management of CIDA. 
Other than for humanitarian reasons, our foreign aid should be 
attached to good governance and an acceptable human rights 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not target our support to credible 
organizations, nations or even regions that are important to the 
Canadian interest.  There is no mention of these considerations 
in the throne speech.  Imagine, Mr. Speaker, there is no mention 
of foreign affairs or international trade in a speech which 
announces the work that the Liberals plan to do before the next 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is limited, but I want to talk about peacemaking 
versus peacekeeping.  I want to talk about Candu reactor trade 
barriers and I want to talk about plutonium, nuclear wastes and 
many other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I encourage all members of the House and all 
Canadians to read our interim foreign policy statement on Canada 
and the millennium and ask the Liberals across the way to open 
their eyes.  They should not sleep at the wheel.  They should 
either do the job properly or get out of the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will just ask the member a very short question.  Another item 
that was not mentioned, and if it were it was very limited, was 
the agricultural industry.  A person would get a bit excited if 
the government had said some things in that agricultural policy 
that would give us hope, but there was absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have even become excited if there had been a slight hint 
that the Liberals were to move the heritage minister out of her 
position and put her in charge of agriculture.  The way that 
woman throws money around, I do not think there would be a poor 
farm in the country, plus they would have flags flying from every 
weather vane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on what he feels are the real answers? 
Why does he feel that things like international affairs, 
agriculture and the grassroots native problems are not included 
in the throne speech in his view? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I highly appreciate the 
thoughtful comments of the hon. member and I thank him for the 
excellent question.  That is the question about the throne speech 
all of us are asking on the opposition benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to that question is simple.  How can the government 
ignore such important areas like agriculture, child pornography, 
defence, airline mergers and illegal immigrants coming to this 
country?   All these areas are missing from the throne speech, 
even the broad base tax cuts which Canadians have been demanding 
for a long time.  All these areas are missing just because of one 
reason.  The government's arrogance shows that it lacks vision. 
The Liberals have absolutely no vision about the 21st century and 
where Canadians should be heading so confidently to look for 
prosperity and opportunities for all.  Basically the government 
is lacking vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of his speeches the Prime Minister even admitted that. 
He said that Canada was doing very good without vision.  Imagine, 
Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister had vision?  The Prime 
Minister has absolutely no vision and he confessed that.  The 
Liberal government is giving evidence day after day that it 
really has no vision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to rise but I cannot let a sin of 
omission prosper.  He said there was nothing on agriculture in 
the throne speech.  Let me read one sentence at page 14: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it is an economy in which technology can lead to greater 
economic stability for the primarily rural regions in which 
cyclical resource industries—agriculture, fisheries, forestry, 
mining and tourism—are the dominant sources of wealth.  The 
government will encourage the development and adoption of new 
technologies in all sectors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on I think we have to adopt a policy that when 
something comes from Reform we take it with a grain of salt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is amusing to hear 
from the hon. member because that is the only thing mentioned in 
the throne speech about agriculture.  I challenge the member to 
show me anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any solution to the crisis or the problem?  The Liberal 
government, while it is figuring out if there is a crisis at all, 
does not know how farmers are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of foreign affairs, I ask the hon. member or any other 
member on the Liberal side to tell me the page in the throne 
speech where it talks about foreign affairs or international 
trade.  I look forward to an answer from the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member talked about vision.  We talk about vision on this side of 
the House.  We are looking at matters such as rebuilding the 
national infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a $40 billion deficit.  I remind the House that it was 
this government in 1993 that adopted the the proposal of the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities which was wandering in the 
wilderness when the Tories were in power.  For five years we have 
had a strong national infrastructure program that is being 
renewed in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one who comes from the greater Toronto area, and as chair of 
the greater Toronto area caucus on our side of the House, I want 
to say how important this is for an area of 4.5 million people. 
To reinvest in core infrastructure is extremely important for the 
residents of the GTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about vision. In the Speech from the Throne we are 
talking about investing in the economy and technology.  I realize 
that when we talk about investing in technology we are talking to 
some people here who still believe the earth is flat, but the 
fact is that in this case we are talking about a vision of going 
forward to the 21st century, not back to the 19th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a program that is investing in high 
technology.  I happen to come from an area of the greater Toronto 
area with probably the highest percentage in Canada of new 
technology in terms of computer industries.  Members opposite may 
be working with Ouija boards over there, but from our standpoint 
we are looking ahead at advancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to vision, we know what vision is about. 
Fortunately our vision is forward, not backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that my speech 
was effective enough to at least wake all of them up.  The member 
spoke about the deficit.  I ask the member, and all members on 
the other side of the House, why they did not balance the budget 
29 years ago.  Why is the deficit continuing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They balanced the budget on the backs of taxpayers.  The budget 
could have been balanced 29 years ago if the government increased 
taxes then.  The budget should be balanced by eliminating waste 
and duplication, by reducing spending in government and by giving 
a tax break to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the number one country in the G-7 for paying the 
highest amount of personal income taxes.  That is shameful.  That 
is a lack of vision.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 19, 
1999, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development a 
question concerning a Labour Congress study that confirmed what 
we have known for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are penalized by the employment insurance reform. 
Ultimately, children are also penalized. 
In her answer, the minister ignored the substance of my question 
and spouted statistics, which proves clearly that the Liberal 
government does not care at all about women's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance plan designed by the Liberal government 
completely ignores the real conditions on the labour market. It 
is designed for men who have been working full time throughout 
their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time the government woke up and realized that we are 
not in the 1950s anymore. Women are now on the labour market and 
they deserve protection under the EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current labour market also includes a substantial number of 
workers in seasonal industries. The Liberal government scorns 
these workers. It blames unemployment on the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the fault of the workers if they cannot fish under the 
ice or exceed lumber quotas. The government should assume its 
responsibilities and invest in an infrastructure program to try 
to diversify these local economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides women and seasonal workers, the employment insurance 
program is also ignoring self-employed and part-time workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of hiding behind statistics, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development should realize what is really going on in 
the labour market and set up an employment insurance program 
that really meets the needs of all workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program is at a critical point. With 
only one third of the jobless eligible for benefits, we are 
obviously dealing with a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the Liberals opposite not realize that their policies have 
real consequences and that poverty and the popularity of food 
banks are increasing because of the changes they made to the EI 
program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a $26 billion surplus in the EI fund. The Liberals are 
refusing to help workers, but not because they are out of money. 
They are refusing to meet the needs of the workers because they 
want to protect the interests of their bank buddies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough is enough. The government should stop making the jobless 
feel guilty or feel like they are criminals and change the EI 
system to ensure that it is in sync with the realities of 
today's labour market.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian workers contribute to the employment insurance fund and 
they should get benefits when they lose their jobs. After all, 
the reason we have an employment insurance program is to help 
workers when they are out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Minister of Human Resources Development and her 
officials will really take note of what I said, will follow up 
on the issue that I raised and will amend the employment 
insurance program, so as to meet the needs of workers and, above 
all, eliminate child poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw today on Parliament Hill, there is an increasing 
number of poor. This is why they came to Ottawa to protest. The 
changes made to employment insurance have even generated a 10% 
increase in the number of people going to food banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government claims to be a responsible government. 
But a responsible government should take concrete action to 
eliminate poverty. This is absolutely not what this government 
is doing. The government must act now. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada is recognized 
throughout the world for its quality of life.  We are committed 
to helping Canadian families, as the government said it would in 
the Speech from the Throne and in the Prime Minister's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made a commitment to introduce legislation in 
this parliament to redesign parental benefits.  We are extending 
employment insurance maternity and parental benefits from the 
current maximum of six months to one full year.  We are making 
these benefits more flexible to meet the different needs of 
families.  We are also making these benefits more accessible by 
increasing the number of parents eligible for support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently there are several features of the EI program that are 
important for women.  Through EI reform, every hour of work is 
covered and women working part time or holding multiple jobs can 
now be eligible for both EI regular and special benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is encouraging to see that maternity claims have remained 
virtually unchanged and that the duration of these benefits has 
remained the same.  This is despite the fact that between 1995-96 
and 1997-98 the birthrate has gone down by 4.6%.  Prior to EI 
reforms, no women working part time were eligible for EI, let 
alone maternity benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that two-thirds of those who receive the most 
generous family supplement are women.  Fifty-eight per cent of 
those participating in the small weeks adjustment projects, which 
provide workers in high unemployment regions with higher 
benefits, are women.  The reach back provision for the active 
employment measures expands eligibility for women, providing 
increased help for stay at home mothers to get back to the 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a number of initiatives outside EI aimed at helping 
women enter or re-enter the workforce.  These initiatives 
include:  projects to promote the self-sufficiency of lone 
parents, 80% of whom are women; grants to help women pursue 
higher education; and programs focused on helping young women at 
risk.  Two programs, the legislated employment equity program and 
the federal contractors program, were introduced to ensure that 
women have equal access to employment opportunities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian women have made major gains on the labour market. They 
now account for close to half of our manpower, compared to only 
30% in 1966. Over the past four decades, the employment rate has 
increased more rapidly for women than for men. In the last 20 
years, that rate has been the highest among G-7 countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, women of all ages had lower unemployment rates than 
men, and in October 1999, adult women had their lowest 
unemployment rate since 1975, 5.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are getting better access to knowledge based jobs. 
In fact, women are enrolling in university at a much higher rate 
than men.  Over 13% of women between 18 and 29 years of age were 
enrolled in university in 1997 compared to about 11% of young 
men.  The number of women with post-secondary education is rising 
rapidly.  In 1998, 28% of working women had a university degree, 
up from 22% in 1990.  Despite this—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am very sorry but 
the parliamentary secretary had two minutes to respond and her 
time has run out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for 
one more minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The parliamentary 
secretary has asked for one more minute.  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it will be worth it if 
they listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this positive news, we want to be sure that women in the 
workforce are provided with proper support systems.  That is why 
we are examining the issues of accessibility to the EI program 
for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of EI reform, we have put in place a monitoring and 
assessment system.  Every year we receive information about how 
the system is working.  We are looking forward to receiving this 
year's monitoring and assessment report to get a better 
understanding of how the EI program is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to making sure that EI is fair and accessible 
to all women.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  As 
you are aware, Mr. Speaker, public life, especially work as a 
member of parliament, has its exhilarating and rewarding moments 
occasionally, but most of the time there is a real sense of 
frustration, especially when we are unable to mobilize public 
resources in the interests of the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight is one of those occasions as I revisit the issue of 
youth smoking.  As we deal with this issue, I am certainly faced 
with one of those moments of very deep frustration and anger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my question on October 25 on tobacco taxation, the Liberal 
government has blown another opportunity to strike a significant 
blow against youth smoking and as a result the health and lives 
of more Canadians will be sacrificed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut taxes on tobacco in 1994 in response to the 
smuggling crisis.  At the same time, it promised to launch a 
major campaign against youth smoking.  More young people are 
smoking today, and on top of it all, tobacco profits continue to 
rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistically we know that the trend to non-smoking dropped off 
immediately in provinces where taxes were cut in 1994.  The 
differential over the last eight years is 24% where there were no 
cuts and 8% where there were cuts.  In young adults, smoking 
rates have rebounded to pre-1989 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bewildering as I try to conceive of what it will take or 
what we can do or say tonight to prompt the government and the 
health minister to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from the scientific community that youth smoking 
carries the severest of all tobacco's health consequences and 
that youth smoking sets up the most difficult problems to 
overcome.  We know internationally that there are health 
organizations and also, of course, the World Bank that endorses 
high tobacco taxes as a weapon against youth smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that stable high prices in neighbouring states mean a 
significant tax hike here will not trigger renewed smuggling. We 
also have Canada's leading health groups on tobacco unanimously 
calling for a significant $10 federal-provincial increase in 
tobacco taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all commend the work of those groups:  the Canadian 
Cancer Society, the Non-Smokers' Rights Association, the 
Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada and the Quebec Coalition for 
Tobacco control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government, which claims to be committed to ending 
youth smoking, do?  It raises taxes 60 cents.  There is no 
logical reason and no obstacle standing in the government's way 
from introducing significant enough tax increases to make a 
difference, significant enough to discourage young Canadians from 
needlessly endangering their health. 
Instead, what does the government do?  It chooses to talk the 
talk but do nothing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me remind members opposite and the government 
that it is not only tobacco taxes that we are talking about.  We 
are talking about the government's cave-in on tobacco sponsorship 
legislation.  We are talking about the government's obstacles to 
and blockage of Bill S-13.  It promised to bring it back in some 
form, but it is not here.  It is buried somewhere in some Liberal 
caucus committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the government's refusal to call the 
tobacco companies to task for the kind of health care costs that 
we are incurring as a society because of tobacco advertising and 
because they are pushing tobacco products on young people.  We 
are talking about the government's commitment to spend $100 
million on tobacco cessation and smoking prevention and barely a 
fraction of that has been spent today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I call on the minister once more to take some action.  I 
say to the government that it is not too late.  Act now for the 
sake of our young people and for the health of our nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is concerned 
about smoking by young people.  That is in fact the key reason 
why it has continued to increase tobacco taxes on a regular 
basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the implementation of the government's anti-smuggling 
initiative, in 1994, the federal government and the 
participating provinces—Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia and Prince Edward Island—have been working together to 
jointly increase taxes on tobacco. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tobacco tax increase announced in the House on November 5 
was the fourth such increase since 1994.  In total, taxes on 
cigarettes have been increased by $4.40 per carton in Ontario, 
$5.00 per carton in Quebec, $3.40 in New Brunswick, $3.80 in Nova 
Scotia, and $5.80 in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work with the provinces and enforcement 
agencies to implement increases in tobacco taxes in a manner that 
will minimize the risk of renewed contraband activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these tobacco tax increases, the Minister of 
Health has indicated that the government will intensify its 
efforts to reduce smoking, particularly by younger Canadians, 
through tough anti-tobacco advertising and upcoming labelling and 
information reporting regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives demonstrate the government's concern with 
smoking and its resolve to take steps to discourage smoking by 
young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
