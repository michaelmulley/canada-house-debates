<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-37, in Clause 12, be amended by replacing lines 13 to 18, on page 
10 with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(5.1) Where a young person elects or is deemed to have elected to be tried 
by a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction with a jury, the youth court 
shall conduct a preliminary inquiry and if, on its conclusion, the young person is

	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on 
Bill C-37 regarding the amendments that are before the House 
today.
<P>
	As members are aware undoubtedly, numerous motions were 
passed by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
following very lengthy testimony on Bill C-37. We had before 
the committee approximately 40 witnesses.
<P>
	The government today has tabled further motions, eight to be 
exact, to which I would like to speak. Seven of these motions 
involve technical improvements to the bill and one addresses a 
more substantive issue.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	These suggestions have arisen as a result of further review of 
the bill and from recent consultations with the provinces, the 
territories and youth justice professionals.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice recently met with his counterparts, 
provincial and territorial, in Victoria, B.C. The provinces, as 
members know, administer large aspects of the Young Offenders 
Act. They requested changes that would be in their interests 
primarily in the administration of this act. We were most willing 
to comply because we want the act to work as well as it possibly 
can.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 serves to clarify which provisions of the code 
will apply dealing with the preliminary inquiries where a youth 
is charged with murder and the matter is going to be dealt with in 
youth court.
<P>
	The existing language of Bill C-37 speaks to proceedings 
being regulated by the provisions of the Criminal Code relating 
to juries and trials of indictable offences. The revised language 
is specific as to the relevant provisions of preliminary inquiries 
as well as the initiation and conduct of jury trials.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9454"> 9454 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The first group is dealing with Motion 
No. 1. Ten minute speeches.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I start my comments on Motion No. 1, I would like to say 
once again that the Bloc Quebecois has always been opposed to 
Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	It has always been our position, both in this House and in 
committee, that Canada, and especially Quebec, where the focus 
of Bill C-37 has no specific application, do not need this kind of 
legislation.
<P>
	Since the Young Offenders Act was first implemented a little 
over ten years ago, the authorities in Quebec have done a good 
job of harmonizing provincial legislation with the Young 
Offenders Act. The Youth Protection Act is a case in point. The 
same people are responsible for enforcing the same laws. I feel 
that this particular measure is entirely unnecessary and 
constitutes an unexpected shift to the right.
<P>
	However, when we see 70 Liberal members rise to vote on Bill 
C-226, we realize why this kind of bill was introduced. Our 
young people need jobs far more than they need sentencing. If 
they had jobs, if their future was not a dead end, there would be 
no need for legislation to lock them up and refer them to adult 
court so they will get longer sentences. What we have here is a 
society that is running scared and a government that will not 
admit it.
<P>
	As for Motion No. 1, since that is our topic, it raises far more 
questions than it answers. Perhaps I may touch on a few points.
<P>
	The young person's right to elect is provided in the Act, 
except in the case of murder charges. However, there is no 
indication when the right to elect to be judged before a jury or 
before a judge or a magistrate may be exercised. Will a young 
person exercise his right when he first appears in court? Will he 
exercise it at the preliminary hearing? Will he exercise it when 
he applies for bail or release from custody? There is no 
indication at all. There is absolutely nothing to go by. Does this 
mean we go by the jurisprudence already established in adult 
court? There is no indication where the law stands.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	I think the government will have to redo its homework on this 
one. The steamroller approach may have to be moderated a bit.
<P>
	One wonders also, in the case of a young person charged with 
murder, to which court his request would have to be submitted 
for release on bail while proceedings are pending. Would it be a 
superior court, as is the case presently for adults, or would it be a 
youth court? The rules are different.
<P>
	If a young person must appear before a superior court judge to 
request release on bail for the duration of the proceedings, there 
are no safeguards against possible information leaks resulting 
from the presentation of such  a request. It might be covered by a 
journalist, names might be published, although the Young 
Offenders Act includes specific provisions to protect the young 
person's identity, in large measure at least.
<P>
	So the young person may very well appear before a youth 
court, but be required to appear before a superior court judge to 
request a release, just as adults must, and then the matter would 
be disclosed even though it is maintained that the preliminary 
inquiry would take place before a youth court. This poses a 
serious problem. I think this needs to be reworked. I also think it 
was done in a bit of a rush because it was only in a parliamentary 
committee that the official opposition pointed out that, with 
longer sentences, the young person would then acquire the 
choice of proceeding to trial by judge and jury. This aspect has 
evidently not been thoroughly investigated.
<P>
	An attempt was made, of course, to link the right to trial by 
jury, guaranteed by the Canadian constitution even for young 
persons liable to a prison term of more than five years and Bill 
C-37, which, originally, made no reference to it at all. 
Departmental lawyers will have to look at the question more to 
avoid having the courts establish jurisprudence on procedure 
over the years.
<P>
	I understand that, in substantive law, the courts have 
considerable power to establish rights, but the procedure should 
be established by the legislator in as safe and certain a context as 
possible. Vague provisions such as these cannot be ignored. 
Provision must be made at least for a ban on the publication of 
the name of the applicant in an application for release, if the 
application is to be heard by a justice of the superior court, 
because this is absolutely not clear.
<P>
	Currently, appearance is made before a youth court justice, 
and the preliminary inquiry takes place in a youth court. What 
happens, though, if a bail application is made in between the 
two; where is it heard? It could be claimed that, since, at least 
until this point, proceedings are held in a youth court, all 
proceedings could take place there, but the legislation does not 
speak on this. Provision must be made to permit everything to 
remain in youth court, even the application for release on bail, 
since it is made generally between the appearance and the 
preliminary inquiry, which takes place in youth court.
<P>
	Guidelines must be established and limits set on motions for a 
referral order by the Crown. When can the Crown make such 
motions? At any point before the trial? Immediately before 
appearance is made? Following the preliminary inquiry? 
Between the time of appearance and the preliminary inquiry? 
Here again it is vague. We will have to rely on the precedents 
that will be set to determine at what point the Crown will be able 
to do it under the new legislation. I think it should occur between 
the appearance and the preliminary inquiry or very shortly after 
the appearance. Certainly not any longer than the three days that 
the Crown already has to request that the release from custody 
hearing be delayed. The  legislation is not specific. This must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9455"> 9455 </A></B>
<P>
absolutely be clarified, and surely the department's jurists could 
help out in this area.
<P>
	Since Part XVIII of the Criminal Code is referred to 
specifically, in relation to Motion No. 1, as much for what it says 
as for what it fails to say, I ask myself the following question: 
Does the crown have the right to evoke preferred indictment in 
cases involving young adolescents or is preferred indictment out 
of the question?
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	If preferred indictment can be used, young people will be 
treated exactly like adults, at each stage. If the crown decides to 
proceed by preferred indictment, the young person will appear 
before a justice and then will be sent directly to trial by judge 
and jury, without any preliminary inquiry.
<P>
	At the very least, there must be a provision ensuring that 
preferred indictment cannot be invoked for a young person 
accused of a criminal act which is punishable by a prison term of 
over five years, or, if it is used, certain procedures must be put in 
place for the youth court, otherwise the Young Offenders Act 
will have lost all meaning. By proceeding by preferred 
indictment the crown will be able to sidestep the Young 
Offenders Act and to send the young person directly to criminal 
court.
<P>
	I was already of the opinion that bill C-37 was extremely 
regressive, considering all of the improvements made to 
criminal law between 1969 and 1980. I believe that Motion No. 
1 makes it worse and the opposition will vote against the motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak to Motion No. 1. We in this party recognize it is a step in 
the right direction, but it is a small step. It does not accomplish 
what the Canadian people want to see accomplished. It does not 
accomplish what we in this party recognize needs to be 
accomplished.
<P>
	I will draw what may be a poor analogy. If you wanted to head 
from Ottawa to Vancouver and you got on the 401 heading west, 
you would say that you were going in the right direction but you 
would not pat yourself on the back because you hit the outskirts 
of town here. People do not want us to drive on a highway in first 
gear. They want us to get to Vancouver in a hurry. They want us 
to get on a jet and get there overnight.
<P>
	That is what we find wrong with this legislation. It does not 
begin to accomplish what we know needs to be accomplished. 
For that reason my party and I have a great deal of difficulty with 
this amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on Motion No. 1. Is it

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 76.1(8), a

with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``to (<I>d</I>) may be kept indefinitely in the special''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the three motions which have been grouped 
together are consequential in nature.
<P>
	Motion No. 2 flows from the creation in Bill C-37 of two 
additional repositories. One is the special records repository 
which is referred to in clause 32, page 25, proposed section 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9456"> 9456 </A></B>
<P>
45(2), and the other is the fingerprint repository which is 
referred to in clause 32, page 27, proposed section 45(3).
<P>
	These two repositories will permit the RCMP to store records 
for additional periods of time. The provisions however require a 
more limited access than the general repository of the RCMP. 
The amendment will clarify the point in time at which the 
records may be transferred from the general repository to the 
special repositories. The existing scheme already requires a 
crime free period of behaviour before a youth's record may be 
subject to destruction.
<P>
	The scheme in Bill C-37 prolongs the period that records of 
certain offences will be detained as further precaution. In effect, 
the records from the general repository are moved to a more 
restricted repository once the young person has met specified 
conditions set out in section 45(1) as amended by clause 31 of 
Bill C-37. The time periods for retention in the general 
repository were amended in Bill C-37 to generally correspond 
with pardon periods applicable to adults.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 flows from the Bill C-37 changes to the record 
provisions which allow for shorter retention periods for less 
serious offences and require longer retention for more serious 
offences. These retention periods will apply to the records of 
young offenders dealt with prior to the coming into force of Bill 
C-37.
<P>
	The effect of the motion is to require young offenders who 
have received absolute or conditional discharges or have been 
found guilty of a summary conviction offence to apply for the 
destruction of their records if they wish the shorter time periods 
to be applied to them. The conditional discharges were not 
legislatively provided for in the Young Offenders Act but were 
introduced into Bill C-37. This motion includes conditional 
discharges as some judges ordered them.
<P>
	This measure will allow eligible youth the benefit of early 
destruction of their records. It is also resource efficient and will 
avoid the necessity of a mutual case by case search through the 
existing data bank which could cost well in excess of one million 
dollars.
<P>
	For a youth whose records will come into existence following 
implementation of Bill C-37, the process will be automated and 
no application by the young person will be required.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 4, like the other two it is 
consequential in nature. It flows from the motion passed by the 
committee at the committee stage which removes aggravated 
assault from the list of offences which trigger presumptive 
transfers. The option of seeking to have a case involving this 
charge transferred to the adult court remains open to the crown 
or course.
<P>
	The effect of section 45.02(2) is that records relating to 
murder and to any of the presumptive transfer offences may be 
kept indefinitely in a special repository of the RCMP.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are indeed rather technical. Their 
purpose is to improve an ill-conceived bill. By making technical 
improvements to an ill-conceived bill, we are in fact making it 
worse.
<P>
	We will, however, agree to Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 on 
division without a recorded vote.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 2 
merely provides further amplification and clarification but does 
not materially change the bill. Therefore, we are opposed to this 
motion on the basis that we oppose Bill C-37.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 provides clear direction for the RCMP to 
destroy records at set periods of time subsequent to conviction 
of the less serious offences for which an absolute discharge, a 
conditional discharge or a summary conviction punishment has 
been imposed.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 merely corrects a mistake or a typo in the bill 
which states ``in paragraphs 16(1.01) (b) to (e)''. The list only 
went up to (d) so there was no (e).
<P>
	Once again, on behalf of the Reform caucus I oppose these 
cosmetic changes. The only way I will lend support to anything 
dealing with the Young Offenders Act is if it has teeth, if it does 
something to reduce criminal activity among youth, if it 
provides for the increased protection of society which is at the 
heart of this debate and which is the objective of the traditional 
role of justice in this country. This is an objective the Liberal 
government and its predecessor seem to have forgotten in the 
quest to have the rights of criminals supersede the rights of 
victims, the victims' families and society at large.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just listened to the speech made by the member from 
the Reform Party who says he will only support measures with 
respect to young offenders or amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act if they have teeth and will do something to 
substantially reduce youth crime. If that is the case, I am 
wondering why the Reform Party does not support measures 
which will really be directed to the causes of crime and to the 
real reasons young people commit crime.
<P>
	Every time measures are put forward that will really do 
something to reduce the rate of crime in this country, including 
youth crime, Reform Party members are opposed to it. They are 
opposed to spending money on serious social programs. They 
are opposed to spending money which would really help youth 
reintegrate into society. They are really opposed to programs 
that would help youth re-adapt in society. All they want to do is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9457"> 9457 </A></B>
<P>
put  young people in prison and let them sit there by themselves 
doing nothing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Skeena will realize 
that one can only debate once at this time, therefore, the hon. 
House leader for the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to whether or not there is substantive 
material here that we are dealing with, I would concur with the 
hon. member for Skeena. What the amendments we are 
discussing today really include is so minor it does not 
substantially change the material beast of Bill C-37, which is 
not even a half-baked measure, perhaps not even a 
quarter-baked measure as far as solving the problems of young 
offenders and their criminal activity are concerned.
<P>
	I had the privilege in January before we came back to the 
House to visit many schools in my constituency. In a free 
question and answer period students were able to dialogue with 
their member of Parliament.
<P>
	They brought up the case of the Young Offenders Act. It was 
not something I mentioned in my brief presentation to them. 
They indicated it was insufficient. It has no support among 
young people. They felt it was casting them in a bad light. They 
were demanding change.
<P>

<P>
	When will this Liberal government realize that even young 
people want reform of the Young Offenders Act? Give us some 
meat. Give us something that is substantive and will change the 
Young Offenders Act to protect the reputations of our young 
people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, we met with the Council of Churches and they totally 
agreed with my Liberal colleague. We must address the root 
causes of the problem. It is not by putting people in jail that we 
will teach members of society how to live together, and that we 
will spend as little as possible.
<P>
	You know that prisoners cost a fortune, not to mention prisons 
and penitentiaries. When our colleagues from the Reform Party 
say that tough sentences are needed, almost suggesting that 
criminals must be punished, I, on the other hand, say that we 
must address the root causes. We must invest in prevention, in 
education. We as a society should consider the issue thoroughly 
and spend the money wisely.
<P>
	A suggestion was made yesterday. Let us assume that the 
judges are given the money they need for the year-let us say, 
for example, $187 million per district. This money could be 
managed jointly by the judges themselves and the citizens. If 
that were the case, protecting society would not cost $187 
million. It would only cost half as much and these people would 
also make a contribution to society.
<P>
	I think that we could make several suggestions like that one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest when the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce accused the Reform Party 
of not supporting legislation that was going to solve some of the 
problems of why young people commit crimes.
<P>
	I suggest to the member that he had ample opportunity when 
he was Solicitor General and in a position to bring in legislation, 
to prevent the problems we have today. He did not. All he did 
was bring in legislation that amplified the problems we now 
have as a result of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Like my colleague here, I went into a number of schools in my 
constituency over the holiday break. I heard the same things. 
The young people in our country do not feel protected by this 
legislation. They want some serious changes made to it, not just 
housekeeping and not just changes in the way we say things. 
They want to feel free when walking the streets, unhampered in 
their schools and in their communities.
<P>
	I do not hear that from the young people. What I hear from the 
young people and the seniors in my community is that they want 
protection. They do not see protection in what the government is 
offering.
<P>
	It concerns me when I see that the government, which has the 
potential and the opportunity to put in legislation that would 
keep pedophiles from wandering the streets, which would at 
least let the community know who these pedophiles are in order 
to protect the young people in our communities, fails to do that.
<P>
	My party is waiting for the government to come up with 
legislation that we can support. We are waiting for legislation 
that will make a difference, not this kind of legislation that is 
going to do nothing but take us further down the path of do 
nothing legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Smoke 
screens, Mr. Speaker. That is what is coming from the Liberal 
side all of the time. We see it from the justice minister on the 
firearms legislation that is proposed. Because it is something he 
cannot deal with, he comes out with this as a smoke screen to 
suggest that he is doing something. This motion is no different.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	People ask why we oppose something that is a step in the right 
direction. The problem is that if they take a step they say: 
``There, we have given you a solution'', but we never take the 
full trip.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9458"> 9458 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is going to have to come out with something 
substantive that will answer the needs of the public, answer the 
needs of the young people. If it does not, we will never get the 
final solutions which we require. Half measures have to stop. 
They do not work. They are only being used as an excuse to 
cover up the fact that the government does not know what really 
needs to be done or it does not have the will to do it.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from the Bloc said that we cannot make the 
Young Offenders Act tougher, we have to get to the bottom of the 
problem, find the solutions. Nothing says we cannot work on 
solving the problems before they come to the justice system. 
The bottom line is still to protect the rights of law-abiding 
citizens and their property. Young Offenders Act problems are 
created mostly against young people. It is the young people we 
are defending, not oppressing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
amendments before us today raise a larger issue and that is the 
need, which is ongoing, to study the Young Offenders Act as a 
whole and not to bring in piecemeal methods.
<P>
	I heartily disagree with my Reform colleagues who would 
simply lock up every young person in the hope that they would 
not commit a crime. At the same time they would cut the social 
programs and the kind of facilities available to young people.
<P>
	We have a disturbing trend in this country of a very anti-youth 
movement. The government has not addressed youth 
unemployment. Why is it not doing that? It has not addressed the 
need of young people to have better services for treatment and 
for work in the communities. Instead it is contemplating cutting 
some of those very services.
<P>
	Of course we have to deal with those young people who are 
committing crimes. We have to deal with the communities and 
the parents who are dealing with those young people. However 
we will not do it by the government's policy of an anti-youth 
campaign which this legislation is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is about time that we got back to reality.
<P>
	I have heard inflammatory comments from members of the 
Reform Party, and in her effort to correct the record I think the 
hon. member for Yukon only made things slightly worse, but in 
the other direction. She referred to things such as treatment, 
which fall under the authority of the provincial government, as 
she knows. I really wonder how hon. members can make 
statements such as that.
<P>
	I heard a Reform Party member ask why are we not addressing 
in this bill issues dealing with pedophiles. This is an amendment 
to the Young Offenders Act, made prior to the comprehensive 
10-year review. This amendment is designed to be an interim 
measure until we have more comprehensive review of the 
legislation. It is not a substitute for the review. As a matter of 
fact, the  review is going to start very shortly. All members of 
the House know that.
<P>
	Only a few days ago a member of the Reform Party was 
sending letters to Canadians, telling them that members did not 
care about such issues and that the only way to get things fixed 
was to buy a membership card for the Reform Party. That is the 
kind of nonsense and fearmongering that we have been hearing. 
It is victimizing Canadians, trying to take advantage of fears 
which they might have.
<P>
	It is about time we had a little bit of honesty surrounding this 
and other issues involving social policy and justice.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I notice my comments are 
generating a bit of heckling. I am glad. The purpose of this bill, 
first, is to make sure that 16 and 17-year olds who have 
committed a violent crime can be shifted to adult court in a more 
expeditious manner. It has to do with information sharing and it 
has to do with stiffer sentencing, when required. But let us not 
portray all young people or even most people as being members 
of that group.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	I am the father of two adolescents. I too hear from them the 
concerns that they have about people in their age groups who do 
things that are improper. However, at the same time let us not 
pretend that we live in the most crime ridden society on earth or 
that locking everybody up would necessarily make us safer. 
After all the United States would be nirvana for everyone if 
locking people up made society such a better place.
<P>
	We have just lived through a terrible economic recession. We 
know it. But we know that right now there are 424,000 more jobs 
than there was at this time last year. These are statistics this 
morning from Statistics Canada. We know that those are the 
kinds of measures that will help to reduce crime; helping 
Canadians to have jobs and hope.
<P>
	Simply locking people up the way the Reform Party members 
pretend is the solution, is not so. Deep in their hearts they know 
the truth. It is about time they said it instead of the nonsense we 
are hearing from them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to what our friends in the Reform Party have been 
saying in the House, and I get the impression they are asking us 
to live in a world where the rich get richer and the poor go to jail.
<P>
	What exactly does the Reform Party want? They say we need 
less government and fewer taxes. So what will that mean? It will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9459"> 9459 </A></B>
<P>
mean less government, fewer social programs to benefit the 
poor, the sick, the elderly and aboriginal people.
<P>
	That is the kind of world they would have us live in. They say: 
cut spending, cut taxes. Sure, Canada may be spending too much 
and sure, we have to pay taxes, but today I read in the paper that 
Canada ranked fourteenth among industrialized countries in 
terms of the tax burden on its citizens. So there is a fallacy 
somewhere. They say we can no longer afford to spend, so let us 
look into this. They say we are overtaxed. Well, I am not crazy 
about taxes, but I wish they would stop and think before saying 
we should let the neediest in our society go hungry so we can 
reduce the tax burden on people who just want more money than 
they already have.
<P>
	Today, we are talking about young offenders, and sadly, in 
most cases, people who go to jail are anything but wealthy. 
These are usually people from disadvantaged families who for 
all kinds of reasons became involved in crime, but the point is 
that we want to do something for these people and if we want to 
do something for our country in the process, we should try and 
prevent youth crime. We should try and give them some hope, 
and putting security people in our schools and having armed 
police officers controlling places where young people get 
together is not the answer.
<P>
	In any case, I hope our friends in the Reform Party, especially 
as far as this legislation is concerned, will stop and think what it 
would be like if their children were in prison at the age of 15, 16 
or 17, without much hope for the future and without much hope 
of being rehabilitated. I think they would change their tune. It is 
all very well to talk about these things and make certain 
suggestions and even go along with them here in the House, but 
out in the real world, in the schools and the prisons, when we see 
what young people are up against, I think the issues are far more 
fundamental than what we have heard today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have heard a lot of rhetoric this morning from the opposite side. 
Lots and lots of rhetoric. The Liberals need to remember that 
when they attack the Reform Party they are attacking the people 
of Canada because poll after poll shows that people are upset 
with the Young Offenders Act. They want changes made to put 
some teeth in it.
<P>
	Like my hon. colleagues I also visited a number of schools 
during the break. I got the same message from the students as my 
colleagues did. The students are fed up with the Young 
Offenders Act. They feel unsafe. They do not even feel safe 
going to the McDonald's in North Vancouver because of the 
gangs that cannot be arrested, that cannot be touched by the 
police.
<P>
	When the police approach a gang outside McDonald's on 
Lynn Valley Road the gang swears at the police. ``F-off'' they 
say to the police. What sort of control is that? People feel unsafe 
in their communities. They feel as if the government is letting 
them down. It is time the Liberal government dropped its 
rhetoric. Of course we  need to get to the source of crime and to 
help the people at the beginning to prevent crime, but we also 
have to address the problem of the criminals who are already 
there, the ones who are making society unsafe.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	We have to put those people away so that we can protect 
society. We have to put the rights of victims ahead of the rights 
of criminals.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-37, in Clause 35, be amended by replacing lines 23 and 24 on

<BLOCKQUOTE>``or waiver would otherwise be admissible.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 5 is the substantive amendment I 
mentioned at the beginning of my remarks.
<P>
	This issue revolves around the obligation of police to advise 
young persons before taking a statement of the possibility of the 
youth being dealt with as an adult.
<P>
	Bill C-37 proposed an amendment to require police to so warn 
a youth where applicable. The language in the bill has been 
criticized for being vague and for possibly resulting in the 
exclusion of statements that would otherwise be admissible.
<P>
	The effect of this motion is to rely on the common law 
principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the 
case of R v. ET, 1993. This option will allow the courts to 
examine the specific circumstances under which the statement 
was given to determine the relevance of the warning relating to 
the possibility of transfer.
<P>
	Proceeding in this way will also allow broader study of this 
and other evidentiary issues in the broader review of the youth 
justice system and the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Motion No. 6 is technical in nature. Its effect is to clarify that 
the requirement for a waiver to be signed by the young person 
applies only to a written waiver and not to a videotaped waiver.
<P>
	One of the reasons for amending Bill C-37 to allow for 
videotape waivers is that some youth are willing to waive their 
rights to consult counsel and/or an adult and to make a statement 
but are unwilling to sign the waiver. Currently the Young 
Offenders Act does not provide for oral waivers.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 is technical in nature and intended to clarify an 
ambiguity. Bill C-37 provides in subparagraph 56(5.1)(c) for 
the situation where a youth misrepresents his or her age and then 
subsequently seeks to rely on the evidentiary safeguards for 
youth provided in section 56.
<P>
	The bill would permit a judge to rule a statement admissible 
under specified circumstances even where the normal 
safeguards required for admissibility of statements have not 
been met. One of the circumstances is that the statement would 
be admissible in common law and under the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. The additional clause in subparagraph (c) which 
states ``and its admission would be appropriate'' is vague and is 
seen as unnecessary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
sometimes it is almost ironic to listen in this House to my good 
friend, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
criticize the Reform Party, and especially the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, as if Bill C-37 had been 
tabled by the Reform Party. This government whip who made his 
people rise to vote in favour of Bill C-37 is at the same time 
criticizing our Reform colleagues for not going far enough. He 
should find a logical niche to call his own.
<P>
	Bill C-37 shows us that the Liberals only have a right wing. 
For a government to remain in the centre, it must have a left 
wing to balance things out from time to time. The Liberal Party 
is now siding with Reform, and we see the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell criticizing the Reformers' 
current position, even though this bill was initiated by the 
government.
<P>
	I would like to know what the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce think about the standing committee's 
proposed amendment to Motion No. 5. The standing committee 
simply proposes that the admissibility of a statement given to a 
person in authority or a peace officer be subject to an additional 
requirement, namely that the person in authority or the peace 
officer inform the young person that he or she may be dealt with 
as an adult and could therefore face the same consequences as an 
adult.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9461"> 9461 </A></B>
<P>
	A 15-year-old who gets arrested under a new law does not 
always know what the consequences may be. However, the 
person who makes the arrest or who has authority over the 
young person as far as the statement's admissibility is 
concerned must know that the young person may be tried in 
adult court and face extremely harsh sentences. Why not 
maintain the standing committee's proposed requirement to 
inform the young person of the seriousness of the charge that 
may be laid against him or her? This would make the young 
person think for a moment instead of trying to recant later and 
having previous statements ruled inadmissible.
<P>
	The young person may want to consult first his parents and 
then perhaps a lawyer or another person as provided for in 
section 56 of the Act before making statements that would be 
very easy to obtain, as young people are much easier to 
manipulate and draw confessions from. These statements would 
not really be made freely and voluntarily, as they would be 
obtained under false representations or through promises or 
threats.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I think that the provision proposed by the standing committee 
should be maintained. Consequently, we will vote against 
Motion No. 5 aimed at removing this requirement.
<P>
	As for the other amendments, they are technical in nature, in 
our opinion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a great 
deal of difficulty with these amendments as with the other 
amendments because they do not go nearly far enough in 
addressing the real issue.
<P>
	I must say that I appreciate the remarks my colleague in the 
Bloc just made because he was right on the money. The 
problems that we are dealing with in the Young Offenders Act 
were created by that party and specifically by the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who stood a few minutes ago and said 
that the reason we have problems with young offenders in 
Canada is that we do not spend enough money. He is saying that 
we should spend money.
<P>
	If money were the criterion by which we could fix our 
problems, with the spending that has gone on here in the last 20 
years we would be living in a nation of saints. However we are 
not because that is not human nature. Human nature requires 
accountability and deterrents. We do not get them with the 
Young Offenders Act or with these proposed amendments.
<P>
	I suggest that the government should examine the real causes 
of crime in society and the Young Offenders Act and put teeth 
into the act so that young people understand there is a real price 
to pay for the transgressions they commit.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to put a question to the parliamentary 
secretary or to the minister with respect to Motion No. 5 that 
would strike out lines 17 to 20 on page 30. Those lines state that 
when applicable the young person may be dealt with as an adult 
and if dealt with as an adult could face the same consequences as 
an adult.
<P>
	In accordance with the portion I just read, the officer who 
would be advising a young offender would have to tell him that 
those were the possible consequences before he signed a waiver.
<P>
	The amendment that is now being presented by the 
government would strike out the requirement to advise the 
young offender there is a possibility that he could be dealt with 
as an adult and could face the consequences in adult court and go 
to an adult prison.
<P>
	I do not quite understand why the government is now making 
a motion to strike that advice to the young offender. Therefore, 
when the parliamentary secretary makes his concluding 
remarks, I would like him explain further why they are now 
striking out that section which would require the police officer 
or the official to advise the young offender of that possibility.
<P>
	I also want to take up again the remarks of the Reform Party. 
To begin with, let me say that the problems with youth crime 
cannot be attributed to the sections of the Young Offenders Act. 
Yes, I bear a lot of responsibility for the Young Offenders Act, 
but the reasons for youth crime are not with the Young Offenders 
Act. That is where members of the Reform Party err over and 
over again. They think that if we amend a few lines in the Young 
Offenders Act, if we make the penalties tougher and do a few 
things like that, everything will be fine. They are living in a 
dream world.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The member will have 
the floor after question period. We will now go to Statements by 
Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the secretary of state in a recent interview stated that we have no 
national culture. I would like to take this opportunity to respond 
to that statement.
<P>
	Most Canadians believe, as my party does, that we must 
uphold the right of citizens and private groups to preserve their 
cultural heritage using their own resources but are opposed to 
taxpayer funded multicultural programs.
<P>
	An ideological conception of culture is that as Canadians we 
believe we have something that others do not. Collectively we 
see ourselves as a tolerant, peaceful and independent people. 
Canadian culture is not insular but rather has an international 
consciousness that embraces the ethnic richness others have 
brought to our shores.
<P>
	The difficulty is that we continue to debate our 
self-conception. We need to stop struggling with our self-image 
and accept who were are.
<P>
	Visually our culture is a kaleidoscope of images, finely 
integrated and ever changing. Visual symbols such as our flag, 
the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the fleur de 
lis and the ice flows of the north all connect us to one another at 
the deepest level of our consciousness. This is our Canadian 
culture.

<P>
	On behalf of all Canadians of Norwegian descent I would like 
to congratulate the Sons of Norway which celebrated its 100th

<P>
	The organization has come a long way since its 18 founding

than 70,000 members and more than 400 lodges in Canada, the 
United States and Norway.
<P>
	Continuing what they began in 1895, the Sons of Norway 
provide its members with the opportunity to care for themselves

	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr.

and an integral component of Canada's transportation system. 
Therefore it is essential that prairie farmers continue to have 
access to this cost effective outlet for their grain and that the 
port is used to the best advantage of prairie farmers.
<P>
	A recent report released by the Churchill task force 
demonstrates the enormous potential of the port and the benefits 
of a rational, long term approach to the revitalization of the port 
and bayline.
<P>

facilities to deteriorate from neglect when they could continue 
to make an important contribution to the Canadian economy.

<P>
	I would point out to Mr. Paillé that equalization payments,

<P>
	To describe the contribution made by the Canadian 
government to redistributing the collective wealth of this

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while

Canada is the best country in the world, according to the United 
Nations, the quality of life of Franco-Ontarians is comparable 
to that of citizens in the Third World. This was the finding of a 
study made public yesterday by a group promoting the 
development of French in Ontario.
<P>
	It also revealed that if the UN were to take the rate of 
functional illiteracy among Franco-Ontarians into 
consideration in calculating the human development index, 
Canada would be a long way from first place.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister crow about a superficial rating 
and close his eyes to the despicable treatment of the French 
speaking minority by English Canada? If Statistics Canada were 
to supply the UN with the real figures on illiteracy among

<P>
	Our response to the committee's recommendations was 
hastily written only because we were given two days to craft a

had to write the report for the committee in the first place.
<P>
	If the minister would think through his own recommendations 
and come to grips with reforming Canada's social programs 
without spending more money, especially borrowed money, 
Canadians would not be so worried about their personal security. 
If there were ever a time for leadership it is now.

	As usual, the federal government is not playing by the rules. 
As it did in 1980, it is quietly pouring considerable financial and 
human resources into the Prime Minister's political machinery,

	Last November the Minister of Justice put out a consultation

Canadians from coast to coast had a chance to view two

of members of the Airborne Regiment in Petawawa.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence ordered an internal 
investigation. He obtained a report from the chief of defence 
staff which referred to the existence of a third videotape, and he 
subsequently ordered that the Airborne Regiment was to be 
disbanded.
<P>
	Considering the particularly vivid scenes contained in the two 
first tapes, what explanation does the Minister of National 
Defence have for the fact that he decided to disband en entire 
regiment against the recommendations of his chief of defence 
staff, a decision with far reaching consequences, without taking 
the elementary precaution of personally screening the third 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9466"> 9466 </A></B>

videotape that was mentioned in the report from General de 
Chastelain?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
mentioned yesterday, in the report that was given to me a couple 
of weeks ago mention was made of a video taken last August of 
what was described as a beer welcome party where officers were 
present. Compared to the earlier video it certainly was 
innocuous.
<P>
	Obviously had I had the information I received just before 
question period yesterday, the existence of that video and some 
of the untoward things on it, I would have made that public two 
weeks ago. Obviously things in the video were unacceptable. 
They were an infringement of the National Defence Act.
<P>
	The report which I received two weeks ago was incomplete. I 
want to know why it was incomplete. I want to know why the 
chief of defence staff was not informed of the electric shock 
experiments and why the head shaving was not in the report. 
These all infringe the National Defence Act.
<P>
	An investigation is under way to find out why we were not 
informed. As soon as I have that information I will make it 
available to my colleagues in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead 
of dumping the responsibility for keeping this information from 
him on all levels of command in the military, would the minister 
not agree that he only has himself to blame, since he did not even 
take the trouble to screen the evidence that was available, 
evidence of which he had been aware since January 23 and to 
which he had access? Is he not the author of his own misfortune?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think 
the Canadian public expects the minister of defence to take the 
role of a military police officer, to go to military bases and 
interview people, to view all kinds of evidence and to be a one 
man show.
<P>
	We have a large organization. We have a chain of command. 
The chief of defence staff was tasked with the report. That report 
came. Obviously it is not complete because some of the military 
police investigations are ongoing. I do not think anybody 
expects the minister to be out there doing all of those things.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the actual viewing of the tape, we never really 
got to the bottom of it until I ordered the tape to be dispatched 
from Petawawa following the question from the hon. member 
for Charlesbourg on Wednesday.
<P>
	The tape was viewed yesterday by one of our senior officers. 
The chief of defence staff viewed it early this morning. He 
concurs with the interpretation I gave in this House yesterday 
that the behaviour was not innocuous, that it was offensive and 
there was infringement. Action will be taken.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
notice the minister admits that the opposition is better informed 
about what goes on in the military than the minister himself. 
This is disturbing.
<P>
	What are we supposed to infer from the minister's 
explanations for his lack of information on the events in 
Petawawa? Does this mean that General de Chastelain failed to 
put all the information he had received in his report or does it 
mean General de Chastelain himself was not aware of all the 
facts about the situation in Petawawa?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said 
subsequently to yesterday's question period that the chief and I 
were not informed completely about that videotape. We are 
quite open about that. We want to know why the chief was not 
informed. I want to know why I was not informed.
<P>
	I know this is a Chamber of thrust and parry where the 
government is to be criticized. What really concerns me here is 
that these events, however horrendous and however 
unacceptable, are casting aspersions upon the thousands of men 
and women who serve in the Canadian Armed Forces and are 
performing their duties in some of the toughest parts of the 
world. These people serve with distinction. I am worried that the

	My question is to the minister of defence. Clearly, Canadians' 
trust has been shaken by the backlash of the events at Petawawa. 
Not only did the minister make hasty decisions without being 
fully informed, but it appears, moreover, that not even the chief 
of defence staff had all the information.
<P>
	Now that it has been established that a lot of information had 
been concealed from the chief of defence staff and from the

that he retains full control over the armed forces?

somewhat amused by the question. Obviously if I had had the 
full description of that tape when I gave the press conference 
announcing the decision of the airborne, I would have made that 
public. The existence of the tape with the unacceptable acts as it 
has been embellished by the viewing by officials yesterday 
actually confirms the government's decision to disband the 
regiment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly 
the minister is not aware of all that happens in his department.
<P>
	Since we now know, based on the events at Petawawa, that all 
levels of the Canadian military can keep information from this 
House, does the minister not realize that it is absolutely vital in 
order to rebuild Canadians' trust for him to order a public 
inquiry, not only on the events at Petawawa, but on the entire 
system that allows the army to elude parliamentary control?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

an investigation. We have military police investigations. Now 
the military police are investigating the tape on which we have 
been speaking this morning.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
January 23 the Minister of National Defence disbanded the 
airborne regiment even though he had not seen the videotape of 
the hazing incident. Apparently his department had not even 
been in possession of a copy.
<P>
	Several weeks ago DND obtained what is now reported as a 
third hazing video. The minister says he was not informed. On 
Wednesday he claimed he had no knowledge. Yesterday he 
misinformed the House by calling the video innocuous.
<P>
	After a year and a half, my question for the Minister of 
National Defence is, why is it that the minister and the House are 
continually informed of these incidents through the media? Why 
does the minister not know what is going on in his own 
department?

will ask the question again because it demands an answer.
<P>

is going on in his department? Why do we have to learn about 
this through the media? Why does the minister have to learn of 
these activities through the media?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

people know that yesterday I was somewhat agitated having 
been informed of the extra charges in this video just before

events in Somalia, irregularities in the investigation of those

other publications about alleged cover-ups.

inform himself about the allegations of Major Armstrong or 
others or to better inform himself about what happened in these 
particular events?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	According to the report on income security in Quebec, the 
number of households that had to apply for social assistance for 
the first time increased by three per cent last October, among 
which a surprising number of young people under 25 years of 
age.
<P>
	In all regions, workers who had not yet heard about the 
unemployment insurance cuts are learning about them the hard 
way. All the while, surpluses, which will be used to reduce the 
national debt, are continuing to accumulate in the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9468"> 9468 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not realize that his last series 
of budget cuts have had very dire consequences for the young 
people who now have to rely on social assistance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the situation in 
which unemployed young people find themselves is certainly of 
great concern to us, on this side of the House, like it is for the 
hon. member.
<P>
	Having said this, I believe that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development's new initiative to help these young 
people move away from passive assistance to a more active one 
is something that even the hon. member will support. To 
conclude, I must say that the unemployment insurance fund is 
still in a deficit position and that we will have to find a way to 
eliminate that deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, young 
people who participate in job training programs should not be 
refused unemployment insurance benefits. That is the position 
taken in Bill C-17 and in the reform proposal; it is the position 
that was taken in the Liberal majority report.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not realize that by cutting 
unemployment insurance benefits he has increased the fund's 
surplus at the expense of young people, making them pay an 
exaggerated amount of the deficit? In such conditions, will the 
minister commit to sparing young people, at least in the 
upcoming budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development- Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we will do 
everything possible in the next budget to really create an 
economic framework within which all Canadians, especially 
young people, will be able to find work.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. Well said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, 0I should also 
mention that the figures for this year show that the government 
is making progress on this front. For example, this year, in the 
month of January alone, just in Quebec, we created 16,000 new 
jobs, and that will help young people.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the underpinnings of morale in the Canadian forces 
have been under attack for a long period now. I was therefore 
dismayed to read in yesterday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> that when the 
second battalion of the Royal 22nd Regiment goes to Croatia in 
April it will be without a Canadian surgical team, instead having 
to depend on a Czech facility an hour's drive away.
<P>
	The most fundamental support Canada has always given its 
soldiers is Canadian medical treatment. Our soldiers are willing 
to risk their lives. They will make do with equipment shortages, 
but their morale depends heavily on the availability of adequate 
medical support.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National Defence take action to ensure 
that a surgical team is maintained with our troops in Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the army 
command in the former Yugoslavia recommended to the chief of 
defence staff that it was unnecessary for the Canadian team to 
continue in that particular theatre of conflict because they had 
full confidence in the facilities supplied by the Czech armed 
forces.
<P>
	It is not unnatural in multi-operational theatres of war that 
one shares expertise and functions. Certainly the best advice is 
that the facilities available to Canadian forces in Bosnia and 
Croatia are comparable to those that would be offered by 
Canadian forces personnel.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they are comparable but they are not Canadian. When 
we have golf trips, inadequate housing, expenditures on 
furniture and all sorts of mismanagement like that, let us not add 
to it.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that mismanagement of medical 
support for our soldiers in the field must not take place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the hon. member's question. There is no mismanagement of 
medical facilities with respect to our soldiers in Bosnia and

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario have 
plans to advise citizens when a high risk sex offender is being 
released into their communities. These plans are necessary 
because the federal government has been unwilling to introduce 
any legislation that deals with high risk offenders.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. Why is it that the 
minister is not showing leadership but rather is abdicating his 
responsibility to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, the steps 
announced yesterday by the province of Manitoba and by the 
province of Ontario do not represent, as the hon. member has 
suggested, an abdication of federal responsibility. Rather they 
represent on the part of those two provinces an exercise of 
jurisdiction that is specifically provided by federal legislation, 
section 25 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, 
which enables provinces to take those very steps. I decline the 
suggestion of the hon. member that this in some way represents 
federal inaction. It is quite the opposite.
<P>
	Second, the single highest priority for the government in the 
area of criminal justice is the safety of Canadians. That priority 
is reflected in the action taken by the government on a variety of 
fronts.
<P>
	Two weeks ago I presided at a meeting of ministers of justice 
from across Canada in Victoria. We decided on specific action to 
improve the Criminal Code, to introduce new sections and to 
work with ministers of health to ensure public safety.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the minister mentioned the 
conference in Victoria. At that conference last month the 
Minister of Justice stated that he was opposed to post-sentence 
detention orders because they may infringe upon the rights of 
convicted sex offenders. I fail to see where this shows that the 
federal government is more concerned about the protection of 
society, as he has just stated.
<P>
	Could the minister explain to the House why he believes the 
rights of convicted sex offenders like Fernand Auger are more 
important than the lives and the rights of victims like Melanie 
Carpenter and Pamela Cameron?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, both the purported 
quotation offered by the hon. member and the substance of her 
question represent a marked departure from her usual standard 
of fairness. I must say that is not what I said at all.
<P>
	In Victoria when we discussed this issue first we identified 
changes that could be made to the Criminal Code, upon which 
we had agreement in principle, changes we will introduce to 
enhance the existing provisions in relation to dangerous 
offenders; second, adding new provisions to the code for long 
term offenders so that we have long term supervision for people 
who are at high risk to reoffend; and third, we had ministers of 
health from across Canada present to work with us on those who 
are mentally ill and who present a risk to reoffend.
<P>
	We are taking action, very specific action. We understand that 
going beyond that and into the criminal sphere represents 
constitutional challenges, but we are committed to looking at 
those strategies to determine whether there are other steps we 
could take to enhance the safety of Canadians.

treat people who will be departing because of downsizing in a

themselves in the private sector.

	I met with the mayor of Ottawa this morning to discuss ways

by some 16,000 in number, despite the decline in the federal

or in the tragic case of Melanie Carpenter to claim the life of an

<P>

beyond their original sentence if they are deemed to pose a risk 
to society just before their release?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

Criminal Code already provides that a person who represents a 
high risk and can be called a dangerous offender within the

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the latest 
budget rumour among many is that Canadians will be forced to 
invest all of their RRSP savings in Canada.
<P>
	If the government wants Canadians to invest money in this 
country, it has two choices. It can force them through 
regulations and legislation or it can encourage them by getting 
its fiscal house in order, which this government should do. That 
would create some confidence.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Is the minister 
prepared to force Canadians to invest in Canada or is he going to 
give them the opportunity to invest freely, as a Canadian should?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have said many times that I 
am not in a position to reveal details of the budget. But I would 
like to remind the member opposite that we have made it very 
clear that we are going to get this nation's finances in order.
<P>
	I would also remind the member opposite that this nation's 
great resources are not only deep in the ground but they lie in the 
skills and the talent of those who walk on it. The government 
will always encourage Canadians to invest in their own country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
certainly appreciate what the minister has said, but what we 
want in this country is the opportunity to have the freedom to 
invest without the intervention of government. Less government 
is what we want.
<P>
	The minister wants to take all of the credit for the growth of 
the economy and the improvements in this country, but I think 
the provinces have something to do with it. For example, 
Alberta has the lowest taxes at the current time in the country. 
We have unemployment at 7.2 per cent. We have a surplus 
budget and we have investor confidence which is something that 
is necessary for all of Canada.
<P>
	In his considerations and responsibilities as the Minister of 
Finance in creating an investment climate, is he considering the 
Alberta model as one that should be followed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have some difficulty 
understanding where the member is coming from. His initial 
question appeared to be a representation on behalf of foreign 
bankers. His second question appears to be a representation on 
behalf of the Conservative government of Alberta. I am 
delighted to see, however, that the twain have now come 
together.
<P>
	Certainly I congratulate any province that has succeeded in 
getting its fiscal house in order. I would extend to the 
governments of the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick, in fact mostly the Liberal 
provinces, our congratulations.
<P>
	However, I would point out one thing. There is criticism of the 
way in which the Government of Alberta has gone at that in 
terms of its health system and its education system. One must 
wonder whether it makes sense to get short term financial results 
at the expense of the long term human capacity of the country.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	The government is proposing massive cuts to public services, 
to social services and to health services. These cuts seem to have 
gone through the Liberal caucus relatively quickly. However, 
when it comes to something such as MPs' pensions the 
government seems to be unable to get its act together as indeed 
the previous government could not get its act together.
<P>
	I want to ask the Minister of the Treasury Board why inaction 
on this issue has been allowed to take on a symbolism which I 
think is both unrealistic and far beyond the reality. To put an end 
to this will the minister bring in legislation on MPs' pensions 
before the budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I understand it, the hon. member has also had lively 
discussions on pension reform matters in the past. Certainly we 
are going through a discussion of the matter. As the Prime 
Minister indicated yesterday, there will be an announcement 
either during the budget or before the budget.
<P>
	We will live up to our red book commitments with respect to 
pension reforms.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Two new hyperdestructive handgun bullets were recently 
developed in the United States. One is designed to do maximum 
damage to human tissue while the second can penetrate body 
armour. This rhino ammunition is designed to break into 
thousands of razor-like fragments when it hits flesh and death is 
almost instantaneous.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether the import and sale of these 
bullets will be prohibited in Canada and whether the sale of all 
ammunition will be subject to control under his new legislation 
to be tabled next week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians were 
horrified to read of the production and potential sale of these 
bullets in the United States.
<P>
	That news story has seemed to solidify the vast majority 
opinion in this country that steps must be taken to ensure that in 
relation to firearms we do not go the way of the United States.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9474"> 9474 </A></B>
<P>
	Ammunition of that description has already been prohibited. 
Order No. 10 of 1992 makes the import or sale of that 
ammunition unlawful.
<P>
	The new registration system which the government proposes 
will permit the tracking of any such prohibited items and ensure 
that they do not come into Canada.

<P>
	The right of management to employ replacement workers 
balances the right of employees to withdraw their labour. The 
effect of tipping this balance through legislation in favour of 
employees will destroy the balance between management and 
labour.
<P>
	Is it the intention of this government to drive business and 
investment out of Canada to jurisdictions without such 
legislation?

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal. 
A week ago during a public debate, the minister admitted that 
between 10,000 and 12,000 federal public servants would lose 
their jobs in the Ottawa-Hull region, including 4,000 in the 
Outaouais, which represents more than one-third of the total 
cuts.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why, as he was reported to have 
said in <I>Le Droit</I>, more than 33 per cent of these cuts will affect 
the Outaouais, which provides only 25 per cent of the federal 
public servants in the Ottawa-Hull region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, all the issues concerning the budget's impact on the 
public service have been dealt with from the outset by the 
President of the Treasury Board. I believe we have said many 
times that we will treat our public servants fairly.
<P>
	That is exactly what transpires from the proposals released 
last week by the President of the Treasury Board. Both sides of 
the river will be treated fairly, there is no question about that.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the honour to present the seventh report of the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	This report deals with tax revenue and the resource companies 
allowance, following a dispute between the Department of 
National Revenue and Gulf with respect to the interpretation of 
certain tax deductions for the 1974 and 1975 taxation years. The 
Department of National Revenue issued a reassessment, which 
Gulf appealed. The court ruled in favour of Gulf. The 
government appealed the decision and lost in 1992. The 
government then sought leave to appeal, which the Supreme 
Court of Canada refused, and has continued to refuse since 1992.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Following the court decisions, 40 other companies in the 
resource sector sought a refund based on their tax returns since 
1974. Negotiations are continuing between the government and 
these companies. The final amount of the refund, including 
accumulated interest, could reach two billion dollars. In order to 
offset this substantial risk of erosion of the tax base, the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts is recommending a 
series of measures designed to avoid a repetition of the Gulf 
affair and to make possible a judicious assessment and 
management of the risks to the federal government.

of discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual Canadians 
are an every day reality in all regions of Canada. This kind of 
discrimination is unacceptable in a country known for its 
commitment to human rights, equality and dignity for all 
citizens. Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to act 
quickly to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured 
to rise in the House pursuant to Standing Order 36 to present a 
petition with several hundred names on it.
<P>
	The undersigned citizens of Canada draw the attention of the 
House to the following: that because the inclusion of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act will provide 
certain groups with special status, rights and privileges; that 
because these special rights and privileges would be granted 
solely on the basis of sexual behaviour; that because inclusion 
will infringe on the historic rights  of Canadians such as freedom 
of religion, conscience, expression and association; therefore 
the petitioners call upon Parliament to oppose any amendments 
to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms which provide for the inclusion of the 
phrase sexual orientation.

three petitions to present.

	The first one is signed by Charles Kingston and 30 others from 
North Vancouver praying and requesting that Parliament reduce 
government spending instead of increasing taxes and implement 
a taxpayer protection act to limit federal spending.

<P>
sexual orientation as a basis for protection against 
discrimination and to include recognition of relationships based 
on financial and emotional interdependence.
<P>
	The third petition signed by 40 people in North Vancouver 
humbly prays and requests Parliament to enact legislation to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination against persons based on their sexual 
orientation. It further calls upon the Liberal government to pass 
Bill C-41 which gives tougher sentences to those who commit 
crimes of hate against others on the basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to table a petition containing approximately 100 
signatures forwarded to me by constituents in my riding of 
Cambridge.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that the government not 
amend the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act 
or the charter of rights and freedoms in any way which would 
tend to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-37, an act to 
amend the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, as 
reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of Motions 
Nos. 5, 6 and 7.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before question period I was replying to members of 
the Reform Party who continue to propose simplistic and 
unworkable solutions to the problem of crime, especially youth 
crime. When they say they want something meaningful and 
effective what they really mean and what they really want are 
longer, harder sentences to prison without additional resources 
for correction and rehabilitation.
<P>
	That model does not work. It is now being tried in several of 
the United States and violent crime in those states is among the 
highest in the western world. Those states with ``three strikes 
and you are out'' laws, those states with capital punishment have 
among the highest murder and violent crime rates in the western 
world. Look at Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Mississippi. Those 
states are executing people in the morning while in the afternoon 
murders take place during the theft of an automobile.
<P>
	The approach being proposed by the Reform Party does not 
work. To begin with there has not been a general increase in 
youth violent crime in recent years. To give an example let us 
look at homicide rates among young offenders. The highest 
number of homicides for youths between the ages of 12 and 17 
was 68 homicides in 1975 before the Young Offenders Act, 
whereas the low rate was 35 homicides for youth in 1987 after 
the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Second, the Young Offenders Act is not, as alleged by the 
Reform Party, the cause of youth crime. While the Young 
Offenders Act might be a federal law it is fully and totally 
administered by the provinces. Some provinces do much better 
than others.
<P>
	For example, my province of Quebec dedicates a lot of 
resources to the Young Offenders Act and has a much better 
record and much greater satisfaction with the act than other 
provinces. In some provinces youth crime and youth recidivism 
is much lower than in others, with the same act right across the 
country.
<P>
	If there is violent youth crime in Canada the cause is not the 
Young Offenders Act. If we want to do something meaningful 
about youth crime, then we must make a greater effort in 
prevention and rehabilitation. Yes, certain amendments are 
required to the Young Offenders Act and we are doing that in 
Bill C-37, but they alone will not solve the problem of youth 
crime.
<P>
	Certain Reform members just said that they met with youth 
during the Christmas recess and that those youths want 
significant amendments to the Young Offenders Act. Well, 
during the recess I also had a meeting with youth in my 
constituency at Concordia University in Montreal.
<P>
	Those youth understood that the real problem is principally 
one of prevention and correction. They also knew that this year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9479"> 9479 </A></B>
<P>
the Parliament of Canada was going to make a thorough review 
of the Young Offenders Act,  a thorough review of youth 
correction programs, and a thorough review of the situation of 
youth crime in Canada.
<P>
	Let us have some honesty and seriousness with respect to this 
debate. To suggest to Canadians that changing a few lines in the 
Young Offenders Act is going to solve the problem of youth 
crime in this country is not correct. I would like my friends in 
the Reform Party to acknowledge that and be honest with the 
situation as it really is.
<P>
	I also would like answers from the parliamentary secretary on 
the question I asked at the beginning of my remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member perhaps does not 
know that the parliamentary secretary has already spoken on this 
series of motions and he is therefore not able to speak again.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it amusing that a person who had the 
ability to bring in crime prevention programs over 20 years ago 
is now talking about the need for crime prevention programs to 
prevent this kind of youth crime.
<P>
	If that is the solution and the answer, why did this individual 
not work that kind of a concept into the Young Offenders Act 
years and years ago? Why did that person who was in the 
position of instituting crime prevention programs not do it 20 or 
25 years ago? Is it not just a little bit late now?
<P>
	I would suggest that the Reform Party does not disagree that 
we do need to look at crime prevention and try to keep young 
people from committing crimes. That does not mean when they 
do commit crimes that we absolve them of all responsibility and 
let them return to the street without any kind of recourse for 
what they did.
<P>
	Not only did I visit schools back in my constituency, but I also 
visited the young offender detention centres that are run by the 
provinces. I cannot say I was pleased with what I saw. What I 
heard from people working with young offenders is not only the 
need for accountability and all other things, but the need for 
government legislation that allows them to work with a federal 
system in identifying and sharing information on these young 
people so they know who will be serious problems as adults. The 
system does not allow for that kind of interchange of 
information.
<P>
	The federal government has the responsibility to implement 
programs and legislation that will allow communities to look 
after the problem of young people who are falling into criminal 
patterns.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when the Young Offenders Act came into force in 
April 1984 it replaced the Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1908. The 
old Juvenile Delinquents Act was informal and attempted to 
respond like a wise parent wherein dependent children had few 
rights.
<P>
	In April 1985 the maximum age of 18 became uniform across 
Canada because of the new Young Offenders Act. In fact, many 
provinces formerly had 16 years as the upper age limit for young 
offenders.
<P>
	The main issues that are significant for the average citizen are 
age limit, transfers to adult court for serious crimes and the 
privacy provisions.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs will be 
conducting a 10-year review of the entire act. The situation we 
are left with is ``get it right next time''.
<P>
	The government is proceeding with Bill C-37, an act to 
amend the Young Offenders Act. Its main thrust is to lengthen 
some penalties but not to touch on areas about which the Reform 
Party and the majority of Canadians have been asking.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the justice system should 
place the denunciation of crime and the protection of 
law-abiding citizens and their property ahead of other justice 
system objectives. The principle should apply to the Young 
Offenders Act and the general operation of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	We believe that the criminal justice policy toward young 
offenders should be guided by the principles of individual 
responsibility and system accountability. Young offenders 
should be held individually responsible for the harm caused by 
their acts. The justice system should be held accountable for 
how it handles young offenders. The results that the system 
delivers should be measured against clearly stated objectives.
<P>
	I want to provide some alternatives to the criticisms of the 
previous member of the Reform Party's suggestions. Here are 
some meaningful proposals that are not simplistic but are 
reasonable and considered and, most of all, are what mainstream 
Canada wants.
<P>
	Lower the Young Offenders Act age definition of young 
persons to 10 to 15 years inclusive from 12 to 17 years inclusive. 
Any young offender who commits an indictable offence could 
possibly be transferred to adult court. Remove extra privacy and 
secrecy provisions of the Young Offenders Act and treat all 
YOA records, access to information and ability to publish in the 
same manner as for adults.
<P>
	Sentencing must emphasize victim compensation, 
community service, skills training, education and deterrence to 
others. In custodial facilities, opportunities for rehabilitation 
must be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9480"> 9480 </A></B>
<P>
emphasized in a disciplined environment and medical and 
psychological treatment orders should not require the consent of 
the offender.
<P>
	Above all, parents of young offenders should be held 
responsible for compensating victims of property crime if it can 
be demonstrated in court that they have not made a reasonable 
effort to exercise parental control.
<P>
	The consensus among average Canadians is that the Young 
Offenders Act is too soft and that stronger, more predictable 
consequences are needed. Serious and repeat young offenders 
should be transferred to adult court. Young offenders have to be 
held accountable for their actions.
<P>
	A recognition that crime prevention occurs best within 
nurturing families and early intrusive social services outside the 
justice system are much better than sentencing.
<P>
	The public's right to know must take precedence over the 
rights of an offender for privacy and for general deterrence to 
work.
<P>
	It is not a Reform plan to incarcerate all those who commit a 
crime, only those who commit serious crimes. We encourage 
community involvement with volunteers supporting alternative 
measures under the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	In summary, the legislative changes previously done and 
currently planned arise because the original Young Offenders 
Act was misguided concerning its age of operation. We are 
therefore not supporting the government's inadequate 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make two or three comments.
<P>
	I have listened to the remarks of members opposite. All of it is 
well-meaning. Some of it borders on the rhetorical but I 
understand where they are coming from. I do not find any of this 
a new issue. I think we can make some headway in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	As we know, the amendments being proposed to the Young 
Offenders Act and the amendments we are debating today do 
principally three things in response to the election commitments 
of the government in the last election. The government has 
moved to expedite the transfer of 16 and 17-year-olds to adult 
court when they are accused of committing the more serious 
crimes. We have again proposed lengthening the sentence for 
homicides committed by young offenders. This is the third time 
Parliament has done this. Last, we have taken steps to deal with 
the sharing of information between agencies, police, educators 
and so on involving young offenders.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Underlying all of this is the recognition that the way to reduce 
crime among young offenders, and I suppose throughout the rest 
of society, is through crime prevention techniques. Once the 
crime is committed the issue is done. The crime has been 
committed. We all recognize that. We have commenced a 
national crime prevention council in the hope that we can 
engender the  kinds of crime prevention techniques, ideas and 
concepts and put them into place.
<P>
	Having failed hypothetically with crime prevention 
techniques to prevent a hypothetical young offender from 
committing a crime, and having arrested the young fellow, we 
are then faced with a societal intervention. We have decided as a 
Parliament, as government policy, that we will not simply take a 
young offender and drop him into the slammer for a couple of 
years.
<P>
	We want an intervention that is appropriate to the 
circumstances so that the young offender does not commit a 
crime again. There are several ways to go about it. We have 
heard different suggestions across the floor of the House and 
there is plenty to read about it in the media. We want to intervene 
so it does not happen again. The intervention must be prompt.
<P>
	I have noted even in the amendments that we propose now and 
in the existing structures of the Young Offenders Act there is too 
much potential for delay of that intervention. The secret in 
applying the justice system to the needs of that young offender 
so that the young offender will stay straight is that society 
intervenes promptly in an appropriate way.
<P>
	Even the youth transfer provisions to the adult court involve 
procedures. The intervention of the state following the offence 
of a young offender that takes a year or six months is absolutely 
useless. Could we please stop and take note that if a 16 or 16 and 
a half year old commits a crime and we wait a year before we are 
able to convict and intervene we have wasted a whole year. That 
young offender is 17 and a half years old. He or she is almost an 
adult. We have blown the entire window of opportunity to 
intervene.
<P>
	We also have to remember that the interventions are not done 
by the federal government. Interventions following the 
commission of crimes by young offenders are by provincial 
jurisdictions. Young offenders are dealt with by provincial 
procedures following conviction.
<P>
	This House edicts that there will be an appropriate and a 
timely intervention by a provincial government. We cannot do 
it. We have to negotiate it. We have to have the provinces on 
side. This is a fairly complex undertaking in a country like this. 
These jurisdictions have been successfully dealt with in the past 
and we can continue to make progress.
<P>
	It is important to remember as we consider these amendments 
to this act that the government is committed to reviewing the 
entire operation of the Young Offenders Act, even the 
amendments that we are dealing with today, in a review which 
will probably take a number of months but which will be 
intensive. I know that review has the commitment of all 
members. We intend to do a very good job of producing a report 
that will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9481"> 9481 </A></B>
<P>
indicate the directions for reform if any. I am sure there will be 
reform proposals. I am certain of it.
<P>
	This House and the justice minister may be able to make 
further proposals with provincial counterparts in the weeks to 
follow.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
noticed there are really two main themes in this debate on the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The first theme seems to be that we should deal with the root 
problem, the cause of youth crime. The other theme is that 
filling the jails is not going to be the deterrent that we should use 
to prevent crime, that filling the jails is not the only answer, is 
not the whole solution to the problem.
<P>
	I would like to talk a little about these two issues. First I agree 
absolutely with those who have said that we must deal with the 
root cause of youth crime. I do not think members would find 
anyone who would argue with that position.
<P>
	If we look at the legislation that this government and past 
governments over the past 20 to 30 years have passed, we find 
that the role of the family has been weakened by laws, including 
changes to the criminal justice system and the tax system. These 
changes have certainly done nothing to get at the root causes of 
crime, in fact just the opposite. The weakening of the role of the 
family and the increasing of the role of the state have weakened 
and added to developing the root cause of crime. It has allowed 
crime.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to talk about is the issue of filling 
our jails as really not being a good deterrent to crime. Jail is part 
of the answer and jail does provide a deterrent but I too am 
concerned if we only look at filling the jails as deterrence to 
crime, including of course crime committed by young offenders.
<P>
	We have to look at all possible options as deterrents. For 
example, we have to seriously look at boot camps and other 
types of set-ups where there is strong discipline. This could be 
used with young offenders.
<P>
	Let us also look at something that was removed as an option 
for deterrence from the Criminal Code in 1971. I am talking 
about the use of corporal punishment not just with adults but 
with young offenders. We have to examine the possibility of 
bringing back corporal punishment as a very effective deterrent.
<P>
	Before I was involved in politics the first time in 1975 I heard 
from a constituent who told me about his personal experience in 
the use of corporal punishment.
<P>
	This gentleman was at a coffee table in a local restaurant when 
we were talking about how the criminal justice system had to be 
improved and how criminals were not being dealt with very 
well, not firmly enough. One person got on to the suggestion that 
we reinstate and use corporal punishment in our system again.
<P>
	One gentleman who had been saying nothing until this point 
said: ``I am going to tell you something that I have never told 
anyone before. When I was a young man I committed a violent 
crime''. We never asked what the crime was. It was not 
important in the discussion.
<P>
	He said: ``As a result I received a prison sentence of about two 
years and I received the lash''. This gentleman said that because 
he received the lash going in and going out of prison that he 
believed a deterrent had been provided that kept him from a life 
of crime. He believed that if it had not been for that corporal 
punishment, he would have been a lifetime criminal.
<P>
	When members opposite talk about the harshness of corporal 
punishment in our criminal system, I would like to ask them this 
question. Which is more harsh? Which is more kind and gentle, 
using corporal punishment to prevent a life of crime or not 
having sufficient deterrents and having an individual become a 
lifelong criminal?
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	This gentleman who had received the lash said that he 
believed it kept him from a life of crime and he also believed 
that was far less harsh than the alternative of being a lifetime 
criminal and living every day, every year of his life knowing that 
he would go back to crime again and again.
<P>
	Therefore when we are talking in this House about being kind 
and gentle, let us look at it from a factual and real point of view. I 
ask again, which is more kind and gentle?
<P>
	I heard a very similar story from another gentlemen in my 
riding at an Elks meeting a few years later. This gentlemen had 
personally received the lash. He received the lash going into jail. 
He had a longer sentence. He said if he had his choice he would 
have stayed in jail for life rather than receiving that corporal 
punishment. This came directly from the person involved. He 
would have stayed in jail rather than receive the lash on his way 
out.
<P>
	I think that says a lot about using corporal punishment as a 
deterrent. There are many different degrees of corporal 
punishment that could be used. Certainly with young offenders I 
think the degree of corporal punishment should be far less.
<P>
	I know from personal experience throughout my life as a 
young person growing up that pain was a terrific deterrent. I 
believe that pain through corporal punishment should be 
seriously considered in this House as a deterrent to prevent 
young offenders from reoffending.
<P>
	When I asked the parliamentary secretary a question in the 
House last year whether his government had even considered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9482"> 9482 </A></B>
<P>
corporal punishment as a deterrent, the parliamentary secretary 
stood up, looked at me in a scoffing manner-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> That is the Liberal look.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Maybe that was the Liberal look. He said no and 
sat down. I believe that it is important that we discuss all options 
and I believe that we should look at the option of corporal 
punishment in our criminal justice system generally as a 
deterrent and in our penal system, including for young 
offenders.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to make one more point and comment 
on how corporal punishment was removed from the criminal 
justice system. An ominbus bill I believe in 1971, a part of this 
omnibus bill was not debated, only spoken on by two speakers 
and that removed corporal punishment as a deterrent in our 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	As a result of this bill under a Liberal government back then 
corporal punishment was removed without debate, without the 
consideration it deserved. I believe that now we should have the 
debate in this House and among Canadians to see if other 
Canadians feel the same as people of my constituency. This 
issue has been brought up again and again. Then maybe we will 
see that there will be or is a place in our penal system, including 
under the Young Offenders Act, for corporal punishment. Let us 
find out. Let us have an open debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a short comment.
<P>
	I listened with interest as the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River talked about crime prevention. I 
think this relates quite specifically to Bill C-37 which we are 
discussing today.
<P>
	I will make my point very brief. He talked about crime 
prevention and the need to focus on crime prevention more than 
the punishment of crime. He considered that important.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I would ask this House to consider whether the Young 
Offenders Act as it currently stands, even in light of the 
amendments in Bill C-37, encourages crime simply because the 
criminal element over 18 years of age is able to coerce young 
people to carry out criminal acts because of the lack of harsh 
offences and consequences that are not enforced under the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	What Canadians and even young people are telling us, those 
who represent them, is tighten up the Young Offenders Act so 
that these older criminals, the criminal element, are not 
harassing, coercing and bribing young people to do the dirty 
work for them because there will not be serious consequences as 
a result. That is crime prevention, that is what we should be 
dealing with and that is not in this bill. It is not in the red book 
and it is not in anything I have seen from the Liberal government 
to this point.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-61, an act to to establish a 
system of administrative monetary penalties for the 
enforcement of the Canada Agricultural Products Act, the Feeds 
Act, the Fertilizers Act, the Health of Animals Act, the Meat 
Inspection Act, the Pest Control Products Act, the Plant 
Protection Act and the Seeds Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has tabled Bill C-61 introducing the Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act, a major 
component of our program to reform enforcement of the 
regulatory system for agriculture and agri-food products.
<P>
	This bill introduces an option to enforce agriculture 
regulations outside the courts when domestic or imported 
products do not measure up to Canada's excellenct standards for 
health, safety and quality. A system that allows for equal 
treatment of domestic and imported products has been requested 
by the industry.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The administrative monetary penalty system, AMPS, would 
allow government officials to issue monetary penalties for most 
breaches of eight federal statutes and regulations under those 
acts in cases involving both domestic and imported products 
instead of proceeding through the criminal justice system as has 
been the case in the past.
<P>
	The use of the criminal justice system would be reserved for 
serious breaches warranting high fines, a criminal record and 
the possibility of imprisonment. The move is in keeping with the 
government's overall plan. This overall plan will include that 
we ensure our high standards, apply those standards consistently 
to both domestic and imported products, increase the rate of 
compliance and perform our important regulatory function in a 
more efficient and cost effective manner.
<P>
	The administrative monetary penalty system means precisely 
what it says. Monetary penalties will be imposed for violations 
under eight acts and their regulations, including the Canada 
Agricultural Products Act, the Feeds Act, the Fertilizer Act, the 
Health of Animals Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the Pest 
Control Products Act, the Plant Protection Act and the Seeds 
Act.
<P>
	The system we are proposing today was developed in 
conjunction with the Department of Justice through the 
regulatory compliance project, a cross government initiative 
looking at alternatives to criminal prosecution of regulatory 
violations. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food and I are 
acutely aware that food safety and quality have been and must 
continue to be our top priority.
<P>
	Our reputation for safety, quality and the competitiveness of 
Canadian products is vital to our domestic consumers. It gives 
producers and processors a critical advantage in the 
international marketplace. Doing a better job as regulators 
means protecting that reputation both at home and abroad. That 
is tied to our overall government commitment to jobs and 
growth by making the most out of liberalized world trade.
<P>
	A year ago this government made a number of commitments 
to the people of Canada. I am pleased to say that within our first 
year of office we have made a great amount of headway on a 
number of fronts. Improving the regulatory system is one of 
those areas.
<P>
	In reforming the way we enforce regulations we have asked 
some basic questions. Does what we do now make sense 
practically and economically? How could we do a better job of 
regulating? What does the industry want? What about 
consumers and what about our international obligations?
<P>
	Under the present conditions penalties for regulatory offences 
are dealt with under criminal law. That means they are 
prosecuted in the courts. This is costly. It can cause delays and 
means that strict requirements of criminal procedure must be 
followed. This places a considerable pressure on our limited 
resources.
<P>
	As a regulatory department we are not dealing with crimes in 
the order of murder, theft and assault. We are dealing with 
regulatory contraventions that fall outside true criminal law 
such as misleading labelling of food products, improper 
sanitation procedures in food processing and failure to follow 
market requirements for federal inspection or for packaging.
<P>
	This legislation, AMPS, will allow us to treat most of these 
regulatory violations outside criminal courts in a manner that 
requires less formal procedures and lower costs for proceedings. 
It will allow us to allocate our scarce resources to uses with the 
highest value.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9484"> 9484 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation is far more efficient than prosecution, as it 
allows for the settlement of penalties without going through a 
hearing process. It is also a much fairer process for violators, 
as it removes the criminal stigma with these violations.
<P>
	The use of the administrative monetary penalty system would 
widen the array of options available to the department in 
responding to non-compliance. We now prosecute essentially in 
situations of serious non-compliance such as actions that 
introduce a foreign disease or a pest into the country. Those are 
the main areas in which we follow the present process because of 
the cost and time involved.
<P>
	A suitable alternative to prosecution that provides suitable 
deterrents to non-compliance is needed for effective regulatory 
enforcement. AMPS is such a system.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	AMPS would provide the government with a much needed 
method of enforcing compliance with our regulations. The 
United States uses a monetary penalty system for exporters, yet 
we have not had this option to ensure that imports meet our 
standards in Canada. The United States department of 
agriculture and most other regulatory agencies in the United 
States use a system of monetary penalty.
<P>
	Currently we have federal inspectors in plants and 
establishments in Canada and we generally have effective 
enforcement options in these situations to deal with 
non-compliant products. We can seize and detain the product in 
establishments or stop the processing line until the product is 
brought into compliance. For imported products these options 
are not possible. However, the monetary penalty system would 
give us an effective response to non-compliance in the market 
of these products.
<P>
	The system would allow for the use of consistent enforcement 
practices against importers and domestic companies marketing 
products that do not meet Canadian health, Canadian safety or 
Canadian quality standards. Consistency of consequences for 
non-compliance combined with a greater rate of compliance 
increases the competitiveness of Canada's agri-food sector.
<P>
	The recommendation to move to an administrative system 
came out of the department's regulatory review, where industry 
associations pointed out the need for active enforcement of 
domestic standards to imported products. They want a level 
playing field. This system would lead to equitable enforcement 
of regulations for domestic and imported products. Further 
consultation with the agri-food industry would take place in the 
development of regulations for the system.
<P>
	The system emphasizes compliance, not punishment. In 
general, warnings would be issued before an administrative 
monetary penalty is proposed. In those situations where a 
penalty has been imposed, the system would allow officials with 
the Department of Agriculture  and Agri-Food to negotiate 
solutions with companies when the product violates an act or a 
regulation. Penalties may be reduced or indeed waived if 
corrective actions such as processing modifications, staff 
training, the purchase of new equipment or whatever it takes to 
ensure future compliance, are made by the industry.
<P>
	This kind of immediate corrective action results in a better 
product. It also results in improved health and safety and, in the 
end, more effective enforcement. Negotiated solutions to 
non-compliance are not now available.
<P>
	With the monetary policy system being administrative in 
nature, it would replace most prosecutions and decriminalize 
violations of the various acts, as there is not a possibility of 
obtaining a criminal record or of being imprisoned. The system 
represents a further step toward decriminalizing our regulatory 
violations. We would retain the right to prosecute offences 
committed with intent that have the potential to cause 
significant harm. As well, we would ensure the effective 
regulation of health, safety and quality of both domestic and 
imported products.
<P>
	The system would also allow us to issue tickets at ports of 
entry to Canada and allow us to issue those tickets for minor 
violations committed by the travelling public that try to illegally 
bring meat or meat products or plants or plant products into 
Canada.
<P>
	The problem of that type of thing happening has the potential 
to be serious because of the possibility of introducing plant or 
animal diseases into the country. For example, the introduction 
of foot and mouth disease a number of years ago resulted in 
millions of dollars in damages and costs for its control and 
eradication. The current system based on prosecution before the 
courts is generally inappropriate for these violations unless 
significant harm is done.
<P>
	Along with an education component developed by the 
department to increase awareness of important requirements 
called ``Beware and Declare'', we expect the monetary penalty 
system to solve the problem efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	Through these initiatives major airlines will be showing 
travellers coming into the country a video on the restrictions 
surrounding the importation of agriculture and agri-food 
products and the possibility of receiving a penalty if they 
attempt to bring meat or plant products into the country without 
declaring them.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The use of the monetary penalty is not a new concept in the 
federal regulatory system. The AMPS being proposed in the bill 
borrows on the system used by Transport Canada to regulate 
activities under the Aeronautics Act as does Human Resources 
Development Canada for enforcement under the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. Other departments are as well considering a 
system for use in their regulatory areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9485"> 9485 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the administrative monetary penalty system we expect 
a higher rate of compliance simply because the system is 
flexible, faster, fairer, and sends a clear message on what the 
response to non-compliance will be. We believe the system 
makes sense as we move toward a partnership with industry and 
as we shift many of our inspection activities away from hands 
on inspection and move more toward a monitoring role.
<P>
	New enforcement options are needed to address this shift in 
responsibility as industry will take on a greater ownership of 
ensuring that agri-food products are in compliance with 
regulations.
<P>
	The administrative monetary penalty system provides 
alternatives to both overly strict and weak enforcement. As I 
said earlier, our main enforcement options at the present time 
are to seize and detain a product and to prosecute. In addition, 
we can suspend and cancel licences, deregister plants and 
withdraw services. Because these last three options stop 
business operations either temporarily or permanently, we have 
used these sanctions sparingly and only as a last resort. As well 
these sanctions are not available for imported products.
<P>
	A monetary penalty would generally be considered 
appropriate when the violation posed actual or potential risk of 
harm to health or safety and would cause economic harm or is a 
threat to the environment.
<P>
	Administrative monetary penalties would be imposed on the 
basis of absolute liability, that is the penalty could be imposed 
without proving intent or negligence. The concept of absolute 
liability is appropriate to the administrative enforcement of 
regulations with modest levels for penalties and no threat of 
imprisonment.
<P>
	We expect to begin implementation with penalties that will be 
broken into three basic levels ranging from $50 to $6,000 
depending on the severity of the offence. The proposed 
legislation, however, would allow us to set maximum penalties 
at $15,000. This built-in flexibility would help to accommodate 
future increase that might be due to inflation and other causes.
<P>
	The amount of the penalties could be adjusted higher or lower 
based on several mitigating or aggravating criteria, including 
seriousness of the violation, the compliance record, the degree 
of intent to commit a violation, the amount of harm done 
including harm to health and safety and economic and 
environmental harm.
<P>
	As part of the system a review process would be set up to give 
an opportunity to be heard to those who believe they did not 
commit a violation. That review would be carried out by an 
appropriate government official, or a violator could request a 
hearing before an independent tribunal with recourse to the 
Federal Court of Canada as the final level of review.
<P>
	Again in keeping with the emphasis on compliance, not 
punishment, the proposed act would authorize officials to enter 
into negotiations, if requested by the offenders, for the amount 
of penalties and for concluding compliance agreements. Under 
the compliance  agreements, fines can be reduced or waived if 
the industry takes the necessary steps to ensure future 
compliance.
<P>
	As well, under this system fines will be reduced by 50 per cent 
for offenders who pay the fine within the time prescribed by 
regulations without asking for a review. Doing a better job of 
regulating makes sense for the consumer, for the industry and 
for government.
<P>
	The administrative monetary penalty system would provide 
for a quick response to most non-compliance situations. 
Combined with other enforcement measures, this should have 
the effect of improving compliance with the regulations. In turn 
this is expected to reduce the government's exposure to liability 
resulting from the underenforcement of statutes and regulations.
<P>
	To conclude I would like to say that to introduce this system 
initially requires the passage of this omnibus legislation that 
would amend the eight acts I listed earlier. Implementation of 
the administrative monetary penalty system is an important step 
in our overall plan. It is important in order to improve the 
agriculture and agri-food inspection system. It is important to 
apply our standards of high quality, high health and high safety 
equally to products coming into the country and to products 
produced in Canada. It is important to stop the travelling public 
from bringing in illegal plants, animals or products made of 
plants and animals, and to bring an overall greater sense of 
fairness and expediency to the enforcement of regulations.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	We are working in close co-operation with the industry. We 
are adapting to the changing business environment. We are 
finding different ways of doing business that do not compromise 
on the world renowned standards of excellence in Canada.
<P>
	I recommend members of the House approve Bill C-61 as 
expeditiously as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-61, immediately 
after the presentation by the hon. member for Prince 
Edward-Hastings, especially since the hon. member, until 
quite recently, operated a big farm in his own riding and is an 
expert on the subject.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill before the House today is to provide 
enforcement options to deal with persons who violate certain 
laws that regulate health standards and the quality of 
agricultural products sold in Canada and, of course, Quebec.
<P>
	This legislation, as we just pointed out, will affect eight acts 
and their regulations, including the Canada Agricultural Prod-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9486"> 9486 </A></B>
<P>
ucts Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the Fertilizer Act and the 
Health of Animals Act. With Bill C-61, the government 
establishes what are referred to as AMPS. AMPS stands for 
administrative monetary penalties system. Throughout this 
debate, when we refer  to AMPS, that is what we mean. The 
purpose of Bill C-61 is to extend the range of enforcement 
options available in legislation administered by the Food 
Production and Inspection Branch.
<P>
	Under this system, an inspector from the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food will be able to impose penalties 
when regulations are violated. This procedure would obviate the 
need for going to court, so this is also a matter of alleviating the 
burden on the judiciary system.
<P>
	After reading the Auditor General's comments on inspection 
procedures, it is clear changes were necessary. I realize that 
these changes are not directly related to the changes 
recommended in the Auditor General's report, but this may be a 
first step.
<P>
	I may remind the House that in his latest report, the Auditor 
General of Canada pointed out that resources were being wasted 
as a result of the incredible confusion with respect to inspection 
standards. A document from the Food Production and Inspection 
Branch tells us that the government expects to cut $44 million in 
this sector over five years, including $22 million in the next 
budget, which the minister will be bringing down a few weeks 
from now. After the by-election in Brome-Missisquoi, of 
course.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	It would be worthwhile knowing the savings, which my 
colleague from Prince Edward-Hastings did not mention, the 
amount of the savings generated by this new approach and 
whether these savings are included in the cuts mentioned earlier.
<P>
	We must be very careful to avoid imposing drastic cuts that 
could affect the quality of inspection services. At the risk of 
digressing briefly from the context of the bill we are currently 
considering, that is Bill C-61, I will take the liberty of adding 
that I have received a lot of mail from small meat-packing firms 
concerned about possibly having to pay inspection costs 
themselves.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc quebecois will be keeping a close 
watch, at the appropriate time, to ensure the government does 
not dump the costs onto small businesses. That is the end of my 
brief digression, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The fact remains that the AMP system provides for the 
imposition of fines, but through an administrative process. An 
AMP cannot lead to either a criminal record or imprisonment. 
The main objective of the system is to ensure compliance with 
the law, it appears. It is not intended to impose heavy fines as the 
result of an offence.
<P>
	The system invites negotiation much more than severe 
penalties. In fact, to my understanding, it provides an 
alternative to public officials who must ensure compliance with 
legislation. The principle is clear: the intention is to reduce the 
number of legal proceedings and to provide more satisfactory 
solutions to carrying out the law.
<P>
	Representatives from the agricultural sector have already 
pointed out that overly excessive fines were sometimes imposed 
for offences and that officials sometimes had to simply overlook 
certain mistakes. The flexibility of the AMPs could lessen the 
problem.
<P>
	What Bill C-61 provides that is new is an alternative solution 
for the offender. Once an individual is found guilty, he has a 
number of options open to him. He can contest his guilt with the 
minister within a prescribed time frame and under certain terms 
of the regulations. If, on the other hand, he accepts the guilty 
verdict and pays the fine, the amount of the fine is automatically 
cut in half.
<P>
	In our system of justice, the presumption of innocence is a 
fundamental right. By giving the offender this option, the 
accused is in effect threatened with having to go to trial and 
having to hire a lawyer to defend himself, with all that entails. 
He is simply told to pay up and be quiet. We oppose this 
principle which would require the less affluent to admit their 
guilt even though they would like to proclaim their innocence. 
The implementation of this measure could create a dangerous 
precedent.
<P>
	I would like to compare this possibility to a personal 
experience of mine. I was stopped by an officer of the Sureté du 
Québec; I was certainly at fault, driving at 141 km per hour. The 
officer said, very kindly, ``Sir, you were doing 141 but we will 
say 135, that will save you this much, you will save that much''.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Once he gave me the ticket, I of course wrote out the cheque as 
soon as I got home and sent it off right away and, in so doing, 
admitted my guilt. As another example, one of my friends was 
once ticketed in a different but similar situation, for failing to 
come to a stop, although he was sure he had stopped properly.
<P>
	He decided to plead not guilty but he too, poor fellow, should 
have written out a cheque as I did to get some peace of mind. He 
had to appear three times in court in Thetford Mines. The first 
time, the case was postponed because the judge was not in a 
good mood. The second time, the officer failed to appear. He had 
informed the court, but there had not been enough time to inform 
my friend; the third time, he won.
<P>
	Yes, he won, but the money he saved did not make up for the 
costs incurred since he missed nearly three full days of work, not 
to mention his travel expenses and what he paid for his defence. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9487"> 9487 </A></B>
<P>
So, you see, I am more or less convinced that many of our fellow 
citizens will simply pay, even if they are not at fault, they will 
pay  immediately to receive the 50 per cent reduction. What a 
deal!
<P>
	You know that for a $2,000 fine, the fine is reduced by 50 per 
cent if paid in cash. So, for that reason, I strongly suspect that 
many people will pay forthwith to avoid costs which, in my 
opinion, would be much greater. It is a basic right and it must 
still be respected. As the hon. members opposite have said so 
well, we live in the world's most democratic country, so we must 
not let this wonderful democracy run wild, even though it 
sometimes seems, in my opinion anyway, to only hobble along 
in some cases.
<P>
	Therefore, we are against the principle which obliges the less 
well-off to admit their guilt, even though they would rather 
claim their innocence. Applying this measure could set a 
dangerous precedent because the other available option, if the 
fine is $2,000 or more, is to reach an agreement with the 
minister. Applying this alternative solution is simple. If the 
minister accepts-the decision is discretionary-offenders can 
considerably reduce or even cancel their fines if corrective 
measures are taken to comply with the regulations in the future, 
that is individuals or businesses will see their fines reduced by 
$1 for each $2 they invest to improve their methods, businesses, 
ways of doing things or working, whether they buy new 
equipment or give new training to their employees.
<P>
	Therefore, for each $2 invested in their businesses, $1 is taken 
off of their fines. This means that for each investment made to 
comply with the department's regulations, their fines are 
regularly reduced by 50 per cent. Thus offenders are able to 
negotiate their sentences. Our judicial system does not lend 
itself, in my opinion, to this kind of negotiation. When people 
make mistakes, they must bear the consequences.
<P>
	This method constitutes a form of economic discrimination in 
the sense that individuals and businesses with bursting wallets 
will barely feel the impact of the sanctions, while people who 
are innocent, but have less financial means at their disposal, 
could pay bigger fines than their rich neighbours, sometimes for 
lesser violations.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	We also have no idea of how the offenders' compliance costs 
will be estimated, or of what will happen if suppliers inflate 
prices. If we want to give businesses incentives to invest, let us 
do it through tax programs or through other means, not by 
negotiating sentences.
<P>
	Another thing that bothers me is the power given to the 
minister and, by extension, to his employees. The minister will 
use his own employees to ensure compliance instead of the 
courts. They will be the masters of the destiny of those who have 
committed violations. They decide if there has been a violation, 
label it as minor, serious, or very serious, set the amount of the 
penalty, decide on the cases in which the tribunal may intervene  
and approve or reject compliance agreements. It seems to me 
that this is being done and that it could be detrimental and could 
lead to the obvious risk of political interference, not to say 
barefaced patronage.
<P>
	These officials will have full authority to determine whether 
or not there has been a violation, and if so, the degree of fault. 
Who will decide if the fine is $2,000 for a minor infraction, 
$10,000 for a serious infraction or $15,000 for a very serious 
infraction? The decision-making process is therefore 
decentralized and the minister claims that the regulations 
remove any risk of arbitrary decisions. Because they are seen by 
the department as essential to an equitable application of 
penalties, it goes without saying that a draft of the regulations 
must be made available to the members of the committee 
studying this bill.
<P>
	I am also somewhat bothered by the independence of the 
tribunal responsible for hearing the complaints of those named 
in notices of violation and for reviewing the decisions made by 
the minister or his officials. This reminds me, if I may digress 
again, of the meeting last week of the 19 Quebec Liberal 
members with the president of the CBC to discuss coverage of 
the referendum campaign in Quebec. It is terrible, Mr. Speaker, 
the political interference of this government in information. 
When we speak of democracy in a country such as ours, the first 
thing this should call to mind is the right to accurate, truthful 
and unbiased information. When a Liberal party caucus meets 
with the president, it is not to tell him: Cover the referendum, 
but do not slant it in favour of the Yes side, slant it in our favour 
because we are the ones who pay you, who set your budget and 
who will reappoint you to your position. And, for that matter, we 
are the ones who appointed you to it in the first place.
<P>
	I also heard in the fall in this House that the minister of 
heritage had written to a quasi-judicial body, the CRTC, which 
reports through his department. The minister had written so that 
one of his constituents could obtain a licence. And the Prime 
Minister excused him by saying that he was not alone, that eight 
other ministers had written-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am very sorry, but the time set aside 
for government orders has expired. The hon. member can 
continue next time.
<P>
	It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-244, an act to require charitable and non-profit 
organizations that receive public funds to declare the 
remuneration of their directors and senior officers, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and pleasure to rise today 
to speak on behalf of Bill C-224, an act that would require 
charitable and non-profit organizations to declare once a year 
the salaries and benefits of their directors and senior officers.
<P>
	This is a votable bill. If passed into law it will have a profound 
effect on all Canadians. It is a first step in bringing public 
accountability to a huge sector of the Canadian economy that 
has never been under meaningful public supervision.
<P>
	I am speaking of the not for profit sector, the charities and 
non-profit organizations that pay no taxes and yet account for at 
least $120 billion in revenues and expenditures each year, about 
one-sixth of Canada's gross domestic product. Let me repeat, 
$120 billion, a sixth of GDP.
<P>
	Incredible though it may seem, Canada has had few rules of 
public accountability governing this huge sector of the 
economy. The financial affairs of charities are but thinly 
disclosed to the public while those of non-profit organizations 
are entirely beyond public scrutiny. Even though charities and 
non-profit organizations are funded directly or indirectly by the 
taxpayer, they have been allowed to operate at whatever level of 
secrecy they choose.
<P>
	Oh, yes, they will argue, they have to keep books. They have 
to be prepared for an audit by Revenue Canada. However there 
are 70,000 charities and 60,000 plus non-profit organizations. 
What are the chances of a spot audit? Even if an organization is 
audited, the Income Tax Act forbids public disclosure of the 
financial details or the results of the examination. The public 
has no right to know even when a charity or non-profit 
organization is discovered to have failed to keep the public trust, 
neither right nor opportunity.
<P>
	This is a situation that has gone on forever. The potential for 
abuse is huge. The scope of the likely waste is difficult to 
comprehend. If only one-quarter of this $120 billion is being 
frittered away, soaked up in excessive salaries, improper 
contracts or bureaucratic inefficiencies, then Canadians are 
losing $30 billion annually, which becomes $30 billion out of 
the economy.
<P>
	No wonder Canada has a debt and deficit crisis. I must say it 
never made sense to me that Canada, with all its resources and 
given its fine entrepreneurial spirit, should be in the cellar with 
Italy in terms of debt among the G-7 nations. Now it does.
<P>
	No nation can possibly let an economic sector worth 
one-sixth of its GDP run along without scrutiny, without public 
accountability and not run up serious bills. And not have the 
financial crisis that Canada now faces.
<P>
	There is irony here. As the finance minister casts around for 
spending cuts and savings crucial to the budget soon to be 
tabled, he looks in every corner of the rest of the economy; 
consumers, corporations, social programs, the public service 
and so on. He does not look at charities and non-profit 
organizations. Is there no waste here, no savings? Of course 
there are. I can only guess at the reason why charities and 
non-profit organizations have not yet come under the deficit 
reduction microscope.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	It may well be because there has been no decent financial 
overview of the not for profit sector. It has literally been a case 
of out of sight, out of mind, for a generation of finance 
ministers.
<P>
	No doubt this is true of non-profit organizations. There were 
60,000 of them in 1986 and up until two years ago they did not 
have to file an annual financial information return equivalent to 
that required of charities. They only had to file as incorporated 
companies or trusts. If they were neither, they did not have to 
file at all.
<P>
	Consequently, as the Auditor General stated in 1990, Revenue 
Canada ``has no effective check on the right to enjoy tax exempt 
status''. He could have stated further that the public, private 
citizens, journalists and even members of Parliament have no 
opportunity whatsoever to see how they manage their affairs.
<P>
	However, thanks to the information returns required of 
charities, though very inadequate in terms of public disclosure, 
we can at least glimpse the huge dimensions of Canada's charity 
industry. I would like to refer my colleagues to an excellent 
paper, ``A Portrait of Canada's Charities'' which was produced 
by the Centre of Philanthropy, based on a study of 1993 charity 
returns.
<P>
	Briefly, here are some of its findings. Canada has 70,000 
charities through which $86 billion passed in 1993 for 12 per 
cent to 13 per cent of GDP. This amount is equal to the GDP of 
the entire province of British Columbia and considerably more 
than the entire agricultural sector. Forty billion dollars was paid 
out by charities in salaries and benefits-a huge sum.
<P>
	Government funding of charities amounted to $49 billion in 
1993, slightly more than half of all the charities' revenues. 
Hospitals and teaching institutions received 58 per cent of all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9489"> 9489 </A></B>
<P>
revenues, or about $50 billion. By contrast  churches received 
only 6 per cent of revenues or about $5 billion.
<P>
	Here is the problem. Anyone can find out how much a 
minister of a church is making for 6 per cent of the charity take. 
But it is usually impossible, right across this country, to find out 
the salary of a hospital or university president for 58 per cent of 
the charity take.
<P>
	Why not? Hospitals and universities are all fully funded 
directly or indirectly by the taxpayer. Why does the taxpayer not 
have the right to know how much of his hard earned tax dollar is 
being spent on the salaries of their chief administrators? Why 
not?
<P>
	The answer is, and I am sure that 90 per cent of Canadians will 
agree, that the taxpayer should know. We do have the right. If 
you are paying the bill you have a fundamental right to know 
how your money is being spent. That is a given. That is what Bill 
C-224 addresses.
<P>
	It would require every not for profit organization to file a 
statutory declaration showing the total remuneration and 
benefits received by all directors and senior officers of charities 
and non-profit organizations. The minister of revenue would 
then make this information available to anyone who wanted it.
<P>
	This I should add is no less than what is required now by 
publicly traded companies in Canada. If for profit companies are 
required to provide this kind of disclosure to shareholders, why 
should not charities and non-profit organizations do the same 
thing for their shareholders, the taxpayers of Canada?
<P>
	It seems so reasonable, so obvious, so morally right. The fact 
is, however, that hospitals for instance have often ferociously 
defended the secrecy of their books and denied absolutely, even 
to members of their own governing boards, details on the 
salaries paid their top administrators. Indeed, trying to find out 
how most hospitals run themselves is akin to trying to assess the 
administrative practices of the government in Beijing from city 
hall in Thunder Bay. Most hospital board meetings are held in 
camera. The public and press are excluded.
<P>
	This is all the more mystifying in that governments at all 
levels are told that hospitals are hurting, that beds must be cut 
back unless funding is sustained or even increased. Yet not even 
the politicians deliberating the problem of health care spending 
are entitled to know how much a hospital president is making. 
Why not?
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Some might argue that the current charity information return 
already provides enough information about remuneration. It 
does not. It only requires totals and sadly, some charities filling 
out the form step around the spirit of openness.
<P>
	For example, the charity return asks for the ``total 
remuneration paid to employees who are executive officers, 
directors or trustees of the charity''. Then it asks for the total 
number of people involved, which invites division of that 
number to get the average per individual.
<P>
	Alas, often the trustees of charities are unpaid. Therefore the 
number you are dividing by is inflated and the average 
remuneration appears far lower than it actually is for key 
administrators.
<P>
	Sadder still is the fact that many charities simply skip the 
remuneration lines altogether. The Canadian Cancer Society of 
Ontario reports paying over $8 million in salaries and then 
leaves the following lines on executive remuneration blank. 
Therefore we do not even get totals.
<P>
	This practice is common. Any random sampling of annual 
charity returns will come up with many where the remuneration 
lines are not filled out. There is obviously an unwillingness by 
many charities to provide this elementary information. They get 
away with it because there is no penalty for their omissions short 
of revoking their charity status. There is no adequate screening 
of the filled out forms either. Errors abound and some must be 
deliberate.
<P>
	Bill C-224 partially plugs this loophole. The legislation 
provides a penalty for the failure to disclose. A fine of up to 50 
per cent of the funds received from government is a law that has 
teeth. Perhaps that sounds tough but in fact legislators in the 
United States have been tearing their hair and trying to bring to 
task not for profit organizations that have been giving 
executives excessive compensation.
<P>
	The lifting of charitable status is too slow, the ways of 
concealing excessive compensation too intricate. I have to add 
that the United States is years ahead of Canada in trying to tackle 
this problem.
<P>
	How bad is it? In the United States the information returns of 
both non-profit and charities are available to the public. There 
too, they have this phenomenon of organizations skipping the 
lines pertaining to executive remuneration. Prodding by the 
Internal Revenue Service has disclosed salaries exceeding one 
million dollars annually, $300,000 or $400,000 is not unusual.
<P>
	This is undoubtedly happening in Canada as well. Our charity 
information returns are primitive in the detail they require in 
comparison to those of the Americans. The Canadian public, 
citizens, journalists or politicians cannot even see the returns of 
non-profit organizations. While these are available to every 
American on demand at the office of the non-profit 
organization, the equivalent information in Canada is denied to 
Canadians.
<P>
	While my remarks have tended to focus on charities it is only 
because there is at least some public information on them. There 
is nothing on non-profit organizations. Nothing at all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9490"> 9490 </A></B>
<P>
	Revenue Canada is not even sure how many there are. The 
only figure I could obtain, 60,000, is nine years old and 
nobody-I mean nobody-knows how much money flows 
through them yearly. If it is even half that of charities, that is 
$40 billion. I suggest that that figure is conservative. I suggest 
that it could be considerably more. I suggest the combined 
figure that I have been using, $120 billion, is also conservative.
<P>
	Last week I received a visitor at my constituency office in 
Hamilton-Wentworth riding. He was from Manitoba and while 
on business in Toronto he drove over to meet me because he had 
read in his local paper that I was investigating the not for profit 
industries.
<P>
	He told me that he headed a for profit company in the business 
of recycling building materials. He said that he was being killed 
by a non-profit organization in the same business which enjoyed 
a competitive advantage because it did not pay taxes.
<P>
	That same week, I received a call from the president of a 
Toronto union local representing jail workers. His problem was 
with a non-profit organization hired by the provincial 
government to manage group homes for youths convicted under 
the Young Offenders Act. The union wanted access to the 
company's financial statements for the purposes of negotiating a 
collective agreement. Denied. A non-profit organization does 
not have to disclose financial details to anyone. Secrecy is 
absolute, no matter how the taxpayer's dollar is being spent, and 
so it goes.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The real problem is that we do not know the net negative 
effect non-profit organizations are having on the economy. That 
many exist purely to pay inflated salaries to their principal 
officers there is no doubt. In doing so, with the advantage of not 
having to pay taxes, are they forcing out of business legitimate 
for-profit enterprises which would pay taxes? How damaging to 
a free market economy is a plethora of businesses which only 
have to compete sufficiently to line the pockets of their 
executives rather than sufficiently to show a profit to pay 
shareholders? How much of Canada's deficit is rooted in 
non-profit companies doing barely enough and no more?
<P>
	There is only one quick way to get at this issue: require 
non-profit organizations to declare the remuneration of their 
principal officers, as Bill C-224 proposes, and the benefits as 
well.
<P>
	MPs are often accused of having a too rich pension plan. I 
agree that is so and that it should be brought into line with 
industry. Tax exempt charities and non-profit organizations are 
dependent upon the taxpayer too, no less so than MPs. What 
kind of pensions do their executive officers get? Chances are 
given that this information has never been available, many of 
their pension plans would make current MP pensions look 
starved and stingy.
<P>
	Just as the public demands accountability of its politicians, so 
it should demand accountability of those organizations 
dependent upon public and governmental generosity. There is no 
excuse for secrecy when tax dollars are being spent, directly or 
indirectly.
<P>
	Finally, it is clear that the entire $120 billion not for profit 
sector is urgently in need of review and oversight. However, a 
problem of such magnitude cannot be solved overnight.
<P>
	Nevertheless, something must be done immediately because 
the loss to the economy is undoubtedly enormous. The 
floodlight of public scrutiny must be brought to bear as quickly 
as possible. That is the intention of Bill C-224. It cannot cure in 
a stroke an industry that has been allowed to function 
unsupervised for decades but it can bring into sharp relief the 
fundamental nature of the problem. By forcing into daylight 
those executive salaries and benefits which are obviously 
excessive, it can show the greed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank my hon. 
colleague for his speech, which I thought was rather well 
researched and skilfully crafted.
<P>
	I wish to tell him that members of the Bloc Quebecois are not 
against this bill but would like to discuss it more thoroughly. I 
want to take this opportunity to add my two cents' worth to the 
discussion.
<P>
	Today's debate is on Bill C-224, an act to require charitable 
and non-profit organizations that receive public funds to report 
the remuneration of their directors and senior officers, which 
was introduced by my hon. colleague, the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	This bill would require charitable and non-profit 
organizations that receive, directly or indirectly, any payment 
from the public funds of Canada to report the remuneration and 
benefits received by their directors and senior officers. My Bloc 
colleagues and I think that the objective of this bill deserves our 
support.
<P>
	It would be appropriate, in the name of openness, to require 
organizations receiving funds from the federal government or 
the public to disclose the remuneration and benefits provided to 
their directors and senior officers. Canadians would thus be able 
to ensure that public funds used to support charitable 
organizations do not end up in the pockets of those who 
administer these organizations, as we have seen recently at all 
levels.
<P>
	As a donor, the federal government would be entitled to 
require that the remuneration and benefits received by the 
directors and senior officers of non-profit organizations, at least 
those supported by the government, be made public.
<P>
	We support the principle of this bill for another reason: it will 
always be difficult to assess with accuracy the voluntary sec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9491"> 9491 </A></B>
<P>
tor's contribution to Canadian society until we find out the 
number of paid employees and their  salaries, as well as the size 
of the infrastructure in place to facilitate the work done by 
volunteers.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In these difficult times, understandably, volunteer work and 
donations are more needed than ever. This is due to the fact that 
voluntary organizations face an ever-growing demand for 
programs and services, on the one hand, and a reduction in 
government assistance and stiffer competition for private funds, 
on the other hand.
<P>
	We must recognize that volunteer work is an essential element 
of society as well as a way of life and social duty. It is a 
democratic gesture which plays a very important role in the life 
of the community and compensates, as I just explained, for the 
government's gradual withdrawal from a number of sectors.
<P>
	However, the situation is more complex as regards non-profit 
volunteer organizations, since they include various national, 
provincial and municipal organizations which are active in 
sectors as diverse as health, social services, the environment, 
justice, education, international assistance to name but a few.
<P>
	I have some concerns regarding this bill. First, as my hon. 
colleague mentioned, line 16 in clause 3 reads as follows: 
``-receives, directly or indirectly''. That wording is very 
general and could include a vast number of non-profit 
organizations which think they have nothing to do with the 
federal government, or with direct funding from Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	For example, a university research fund receiving money 
from a provincial government would or could be affected by this 
bill, since money received could indirectly come from 
federal-provincial transfers. Consequently, that research fund 
would have to disclose the salaries of its managers or directors.
<P>
	As well, would an organization like the Knights of Columbus 
in a small town be subject to this bill, since the vast majority of 
such small charitable and non-profit organizations rely on 
public donations and therefore on public money?
<P>
	I am concerned that the objective of this bill might be altered 
by the means used to achieve it. I fear that this bill might be 
stalled because it is too ambitious and could generate a lot of red 
tape.
<P>
	This bill put forward by my colleague is commendable, its 
purpose being to eliminate as much as possible frauds 
committed by administrators and directors of non-profit 
organizations who take money from the Canadian public and use 
it more for themselves than for the great causes they claim to 
defend.
<P>
	In order to respect the spirit of this bill, I think that we need to 
look more closely at its scope. We cannot treat in the same 
fashion organizations that are responsible and those that some 
people use to their own financial advantage, as can be seen 
occasionally.
<P>
	We must also make a distinction between most small 
non-profit or charitable organizations and those that have large 
budgets. What constitutes a large budget, $50,000, $100,000? 
We do not know exactly. We need to have statistics on this and 
discuss the issue.
<P>
	We must also make a distinction between a person who works 
hard all year long for a cause he or she believes in and who 
receives, for example, $40,000 a year as executive director and 
another person who would receive the same amount of money to 
organize, for example, a fund-raising campaign lasting two 
months. A mere report to the minister cannot make the 
difference between these two cases.
<P>
	There is also a problem of confidentiality, of course, when a 
person's employment revenues are disclosed without the job 
description or the length of employment being known. For all 
these reasons, I think that the scope of this bill has to be limited.
<P>
	First of all, only the organizations receiving directly any 
payment from the federal government and major non-profit or 
charitable organizations would have, for example, to file along 
with their annual reports a statement of income and salaries 
specifying the major positions and the remuneration of their 
incumbents.
<P>
	With this proposal, there will be no need to create more 
bureaucracy, since companies already have to produce an annual 
report to which the income and salaries annex could be added, as 
would be the case for some charitable or non-profit 
organizations that meet criteria which, I think, still have to be 
defined.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Hence, the remuneration and benefits of the directors and 
managers of all major non-profit organizations would be 
disclosed, which is the purpose of this bill, and the financial 
institutions minister would be able to answer any legitimate 
inquiry.
<P>
	Knowing full well that the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth is acting in the interest of the Canadian 
population, for which he must be commended, we would be 
prepared to support the principle of the bill if we could amend it 
to abolish some of the pointless conditions it prescribes for the 
vast majority of non-profit organizations whose staff receive 
little or no remuneration and to avoid creating another useless 
level of bureaucracy.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the 
volunteers in Canada as well as in Quebec, who work day in and 
day out to promote a cause they believe in.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9492"> 9492 </A></B>
<P>
support of Bill C-224, a private member's bill presented by the 
hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	I hope the journalists who cover the proceedings of the House 
of Commons note that we as members are not always at each 
other's throats. If the public only watches Question Period and if 
Question Period is the only parliamentary proceeding that hits 
the nightly news, a wrong impression of how this House 
operates can and I submit has developed in the minds of 
Canadians.
<P>
	There have been numerous occasions in this Parliament 
setting it apart from the previous Parliament when members 
have agreed on the disposition of various subjects. When a good 
idea is presented it deserves support. This is the view of how the 
House of Commons should work which my party has tried to get 
across since all members convened here a little more than a year 
ago.
<P>
	While we have not always been successful, politics by its very 
nature being partisan, I believe we have on many occasions 
raised the level of debate in the Chamber through mutual 
co-operation on a number of issues.
<P>
	The private member's bill presented by my friend from 
Hamilton-Wentworth deals with an important issue in a way 
which deserves our support.
<P>
	This bill proposes that charitable and non-profit 
organizations that receive public funds be required to declare 
the remuneration received by their directors and senior officers.
<P>
	In supporting this bill I want to make it crystal clear that the 
Reform Party for the most part supports the work of charitable 
and non-profit organizations in Canada. The Reform Party 
supports the work of the voluntary sector in Canada. I would like 
to point out along with the previous speaker of the Bloc that I too 
thank all of the volunteers across Canada, many of whom give 
many hours and are not always thanked as they should be.
<P>
	We recognize the need for volunteers in many organizations 
and we respect the right of these organizations to exist and to 
carry out their functions.
<P>
	However, what we are against, and this is the reason we 
support this bill, is these organizations not being accountable. If 
these organizations receive taxpayers' dollars then every penny 
of every dollar received should be accounted for.
<P>
	I do not think it will come as a great surprise to many that 
Reform policy goes further than this bill. It is the policy of my 
party that no funds should be given by the government to any 
charitable or non-profit organization. It should be the 
responsibility of the organization to fund itself. If there is a need 
or a perceived reason for the existence of an organization then it 
should be able to sustain itself without the need for government 
handouts.
<P>
	I also want to point out here that in my riding over the last year 
I have been donating 10 per cent of my salary, not because I 
think MPs are not paid enough or are paid too much, but because 
I think it was an opportunity for me to show people within my 
riding that if we are interested in a particular community project 
or a service group or a food bank then we can show others that it 
is up to us in the community to support those things.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	Reflecting back on the last 15 years it seems to me that with 
the advent of the charter of rights and freedoms Canada 
gradually has become a society dominated by special interest 
groups, each group advocating what it deems to be a worthwhile 
cause. We all know to each of us the things we are involved in 
seem more worthwhile than what someone else is doing and it is 
an understandable feeling.
<P>
	More often than not these groups receive seed money from 
some level of government. Because the federal government 
historically has the most money to give out, most of these 
organizations end up receiving some handout from the federal 
treasury.
<P>
	The problem with this procedure is that the dependence on 
government grants begins and carries on. It becomes difficult 
for the organization to function without federal money. For 
political reasons it becomes difficult for a government, any 
government, to eliminate that funding.
<P>
	It is the opinion of my party and it is my personal opinion as 
well that we can no longer afford to fund these organizations 
either totally or partially. If there is a good reason for the 
existence of the organization there should be a good reason for 
people to support it financially. However as long as these grants 
continue it is the least we as legislators can do to ensure that 
there is accountability.
<P>
	It is shocking to think that not for profit organizations are not 
required to disclose individual salaries. While I am not 
condemning any of these organizations, surely the public should 
know if the reason there is no profit is because a great deal of the 
money received was spent on salaries or spent on programs. 
There should be no ambiguity.
<P>
	The only way to eliminate this ambiguity is for these 
organizations to report fully on their disposition of funds 
received. It should, as my friend opposite suggests, be broken 
down so that there can be no misinterpretation as to which of the 
organization's programs were funded and how much each 
particular individual in the organization received as a salary or a 
bonus.
<P>
	Full and complete disclosure should also have a chilling 
effect on any organization that uses the bulk of the contributions 
it receives on salaries. Perhaps the mere fact that salaries have to 
be publicly declared may result in more money being put into 
the programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9493"> 9493 </A></B>
<P>
	The amounts of money we are dealing with here are not 
insubstantial. This whole sector of the economy comprises 
about 70,000 charities, as was mentioned earlier, which spent 
$82 billion in 1993. There are also 40,000 plus non-profit 
organizations which probably spent an amount proportional to 
the amount spent by the charities.
<P>
	The annual returns required by Revenue Canada are not made 
public with respect to not for profit organizations. It is 
important that salaries be disclosed in these organizations 
because the amount shown will indicate if excessive profits are 
spent or simply eliminated through the payment of high salaries.
<P>
	While the public and financial information returns of 
charities have been available since 1977 they are not policed by 
Revenue Canada for accuracy or completeness and contain little 
financial detail. Public accountability requires us to do better 
than this. The public should be able to know who gets how much.
<P>
	I believe this bill accomplishes this goal. I am pleased to note 
that by the wording of this bill all not for profit organizations are 
affected. Even those administered by the provinces are affected. 
Therefore, hospitals, universities, research organizations, 
training schools and other institutions which receive federal 
funds will be subject to disclosure.
<P>
	This bill is a good first step in dealing with the issue, however 
it is only a first step. It is important for us, perhaps in a 
committee of this House, to review the conditions precedent for 
having an organization declared to be a charity or not for profit 
organization. In other words, we should review the conditions an 
organization has to meet to receive the tax exempt status and to 
give tax receipts for donations.
<P>
	Perhaps we may conclude that only organizations which pay 
their own way should have this status. If they receive a 
government grant then they pay tax. Such a review could focus 
on the role and value of purely volunteer organizations in our 
society, organizations that use all of the money donated to them 
for programs rather than for salaries.
<P>
	On the question of grants and contributions by the federal 
government to these groups, I stated the firm policy of my party 
earlier. These grants and contributions are to cease.
<P>
	In my position as the Reform Party's critic for literacy, I have 
suggested this to my party and will be suggesting it to the 
minister responsible for literacy, the government leader in the 
Senate. Most if not all of the literacy budget is distributed in the 
form of grants or contributions to charitable or not for profit 
organizations which are involved in the literacy business. These 
are organizations which encourage literacy through adult 
training, raise awareness of the problems of illiteracy, or 
perhaps are involved in family counselling where illiteracy is an 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	Those are all worthwhile goals. However, it is my contention 
that they can be achieved without dipping into the public purse. 
Let us face it ladies and gentlemen, today we have no more 
money in the public purse.
<P>
	Private enterprise, the business community, which stands to 
benefit the most from a high level of literacy should assume the 
task of training. It should assume this burden because business 
will reap the benefits.
<P>
	I have also suggested that in order to treat these literacy 
organizations in a humane fashion, funding will be phased out 
over three years. Yes, no government funding to any of these 
organizations is my ultimate goal, but I appreciate the work 
done by my colleague for Hamilton-Wentworth. His ideas on 
this matter of salary disclosure deserve our support and Bill 
C-224 deserves the support of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the pleasure today to second and to speak in 
support of Bill C-224, an act to require charitable and 
non-profit groups receiving public funds to declare the 
remuneration of their directors and senior officers.
<P>
	This bill is the first important step toward reforming Canada's 
not for profit sector. With the implementation of C-224 all 
organizations with charitable or non-profit status receiving 
public funding by direct grants, government transfers or by tax 
exemption will be required to publicly disclose the amount of 
the salaries and benefits paid to their principal officers.
<P>
	This bill is about accountability. It is about allowing these 
collectively funded organizations and agencies to be scrutinized 
not only by government but also by the public. It sets the same 
standard of accountability for not for profit organizations as 
those set for individuals, businesses and government.
<P>
	When government funds individuals and businesses, rules and 
regulations are in place to ensure accountability. Why should 
the rules be different for not for profit organizations? In difficult 
economic times all precautions must be taken to ensure sparse 
public funds are allocated according to real need.
<P>
	The issue is of utmost importance given the absolute 
necessity to control government spending today. We are forced 
to re-evaluate the role of government in society generally. Now 
more than ever we must closely scrutinize recipients of all 
public funds.
<P>
	There are two distinct advantages to achieving charitable 
status in Canada. Once an organization is registered it is exempt 
from paying income tax. Registration also allows the 
organization to issue official donation receipts which donors 
then claim as income tax credits. This results in a reduction of 
tax revenues to the government.
<P>

<P>
	Currently, registered charities, including private and public 
foundations and charitable organizations are required to file a 
registered charity information return with the department of 
revenue. These returns are also available for public release as 
per section 149(1) of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Section D of the return asks how much remuneration is paid to 
employees, executive officers, directors and trustees. The 
question of how many people are paid from the total regular 
employees remuneration is not asked. As long as the 
organization files a return, even though it be incomplete, it 
retains its charitable status. There is no penalty if required 
information is missing.
<P>
	The member for Hamilton-Wentworth's November 1994 
report concerning special interest group funding contains 
returns from selected charitable organizations. Of these, only 50 
per cent specified the number of executives or their salaries. The 
other half implied they had no executive officers, directors or 
trustees and therefore did not have to specify how much money 
was allocated for their salaries.
<P>
	One wonders how an organization such as the Canadian 
Council on Smoking and Health claiming receipts of almost $1 
million and employee salaries of close to $400,000 can function 
without directors or executives.
<P>
	By simply including all salaries in the figures paid out to 
regular employees, organizations avoid having to identify or 
reveal executive salaries. The current charity information return 
does not require detailed information about remuneration. 
Canadians who are hard pressed to donate a simple $25 to a 
charity may be appalled to find its executive director receives 
half a million dollars in salary.
<P>
	While the Income Tax Act requires charities to use at least 80 
per cent of individual donations on charitable activities, it does 
not mention what proportion of a government grant should be 
used in this way. Moreover, when a charity is 80 to 90 per cent 
government funded the current rules leave an enormous gap.
<P>
	The situation is even worse for non-profit organizations. 
They are generally not taxable. While non-profit organizations 
cannot issue official tax receipts, they receive direct funding 
from the government by way of grants and transfers and indirect 
funding in the form of tax exemptions.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Currently, non-profit organizations are required to file a 
non-profit organization information return with Revenue 
Canada detailing their financial information. Not every 
non-profit organization is required to file a return. Only those 
having revenue exceeding $10,000 per year or having assets of 
more than $200,000. Only 4,960 of an estimated $40,000 
non-profit organizations filed a return in 1993. Under the 
Privacy Act and section 241 of the Income Tax Act all of this 
information remains confidential.
<P>
	A non-profit organization has absolutely no public 
accountability. There is no way for any member of the public or 
the government to adequately assess the financial operations of 
these organizations. MPs are asked to approve grants for 
organizations in their own constituencies having little idea 
where that money is actually going. I have personally withheld 
cheques from organizations in my constituency that have failed 
to provide me with adequate financial information.
<P>
	Bill C-224 requires a detailed public breakdown of all 
salaries for all charitable and non-profit organizations. This 
would eliminate a prime area of potential abuse in a largely 
unaccountable sector.
<P>
	The Consumers' Association of Canada lists three sources of 
income on its information return with government grants 
totalling almost $900,000, more than 70 per cent of its total 
revenues. This organization pays one executive officer $96,000 
a year. At least it reports this information. Most do not.
<P>
	We can no longer allow any publicly funded organization to 
remain outside financial scrutiny. Given the state of the 
government's finances, the present situation is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	There are more than 66,000 registered charities in Canada, a 
number which increases by 4,000 annually. We do not know 
exactly how many non-profit organizations truly exist.
<P>
	The Canadian Centre for Philanthropy reports approximately 
$86 billion passed through registered charities in 1993, 13 per 
cent of Canada's gross domestic product and equal to the entire 
GDP of British Columbia. We can safely say that together 
charities and non-profit organizations account for more than 
$100 billion in cash flow. They pay out approximately $40 
billion in salaries to 3.2 million people or 9 per cent of the 
Canadian labour force.
<P>
	Registered charities alone receive approximately 56 per cent 
of their revenue directly from various levels of government, $49 
billion annually; $5.5 billion comes from the federal 
government in direct grants and transfers and $600 million in 
forgone tax revenue, over $6 billion in total per year.
<P>
	In our quest to control government spending, not for profit 
organizations cannot be ignored. Accountability in terms of 
salaries paid out by government funded agencies is the essential 
first step proposed in this bill.
<P>
	Other important recommendations in the bill also need to be 
considered. The Income Tax Act must be amended to allow 
public access to the financial statements of non-profit 
organizations. Revenue Canada must scrutinize more closely 
the activities of registered charities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9495"> 9495 </A></B>
<P>
	Applicants for government funding should be required to 
waive certain protections offered by the Access to Information 
and Privacy Acts. Organizations should not receive significant 
government funding without having had their annual statements 
reviewed and approved by the granting authorities.
<P>
	All of these recommendations establish accountability. 
Current financial conditions demand close scrutiny of all groups 
receiving government funding. This bill is only the tip of the 
iceberg, a small but necessary step in reforming the way we 
handle Canada's non-profit sector.
<P>
	In the U.S., charitable and non-profit organizations must file 
returns with the IRS which are available for public inspection. 
Information must be filed by both charitable and non-profit 
organizations, unlike the Canadian policy which keeps the 
returns of non-profit organizations confidential.
<P>
	The U.S. form is much more comprehensive and detailed. One 
section asks for the names, addresses, compensation, benefits 
and expense allowances of officers, directors and key 
employees. If any receive annual compensation of more than an 
aggregate $100,000 an additional schedule must be attached. 
The organizations are thus held directly accountable to the 
public.
<P>
	We publicly fund charitable and non-profit organizations in 
Canada which engage in activities unrelated to their charitable 
status. Some participate in blatantly political activities by 
donating funds to political parties.
<P>
	The Canadian Labour Congress was given a grant of over $3.6 
million in 1993 for its labour education program. The CLC 
contributes none of its own revenues to this program yet was 
able to give over $1 million to the New Democratic Party in that 
same year.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	The definitions of charitable activities are vague and open to 
abuse. Activities in the public interest and those of special 
interest are not clearly defined. As for non-profit organizations 
there are very few guidelines. Some of these organizations such 
as the Canadian Ethnocultural Council receive up to 80 per cent 
of their revenue from sustained government funding. Many 
could not survive without direct annual funding from the 
government. We are talking about $49 billion in government 
funding each year. We must get our act together.
<P>
	I ask all hon. members to vote for the bill as a first step in 
addressing a situation that both the public and the legitimate not 
for profit sector should welcome. The taxpayer has a right to 
evaluate the spending priorities of recipients of government 
grants. Legitimate not for profit organizations have an interest 
in knowing that both government and private funding is 
allocated to those who need and deserve it most.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to begin by congratulating my hon. colleague from 
Hamilton-Wentworth on the effort he has put into studying the 
subject of the accountability of non-profit organizations. This 
debate is about accountability. It should in no way be perceived 
as an attack on the numerous organizations that are making a 
real contribution to public policy.
<P>
	At the same time it is appropriate to reconsider the necessity 
of government support for many not for profit organizations. I 
do not buy the argument that government funding is required to 
give a voice to people who would otherwise not be heard. 
Instead I believe the process has usurped the role of members of 
Parliament who are elected to speak for their constituents.
<P>
	A look at the appointment diaries of MPs will demonstrate 
very quickly that it is not the rich and powerful who come to see 
us with their problems and concerns. Rather it is those who have 
come up against the giant bureaucracy that is modern 
government and have been stymied or frustrated by the 
experience. It is people who want a solution to their individual 
problems and would be unlikely to turn to another bureaucracy 
in the form of a not for profit organization to take up their case. 
That is a primary role of a member of Parliament: to act as an 
advocate for those who feel they do not have a voice.
<P>
	On the broader question of consultation it is difficult to argue 
that governments do not consult. More often than not we are 
accused of consulting ad nauseam, to the detriment of action. 
Politicians are extremely conscious of the need to involve all 
stakeholders in any discussion of public policy. A look at the 
makeup of any advisory body on questions of wide interest will 
confirm this point. Membership is carefully structured to reflect 
linguistic, cultural, gender and consumer interests.
<P>
	From time to time an issue will generate considerable public 
interest. Citizens will want to be involved in the policy process 
and will join with like-minded Canadians to galvanize public 
opinion and encourage governments to act. That kind of activity 
is perfectly legitimate and helpful.
<P>
	The history of such grassroots activism suggests that 
politicians do respond. Sometimes whole new government 
departments are created, examples being environment and 
consumer affairs. However too often those departments begin to 
see their constituencies not as the people of Canada but as the 
interest groups that establish permanent organizations. Long 
after the public has decided that the original reasons their 
activism have been responded to, the not for profit organizations 
continue to exist as a mirror bureaucracy often supported by 
taxpayers. An 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9496"> 9496 </A></B>
<P>
almost symbiotic relationship develops between the 
organization and the governmental body, and the natural inertia 
that exists in government organizations discourages change in 
that type of relationship.
<P>
	It is only when fiscal pressures force a review of program 
spending that a reassessment takes place. We have reached or 
surpassed that point today. Government can no longer justify 
funding special interest groups that cannot demonstrate their 
legitimacy through self-sustaining financing. This is not only 
my view but also the view of many of my constituents who have 
spoken to me about what they expect to see in the budget.
<P>
	For the first time in many years governments are being forced 
to make politically tough decisions about expenditures that have 
a real impact on people's lives. In the last budget we announced 
the closure of military bases that had contributed substantially 
to the welfare of whole communities. That was a tough decision 
but one that should have been made years ago. We are now about 
to ask Canadians to sacrifice even more, as we recognize that the 
deficit is the single overwhelming problem we face. As part of 
that exercise a number of government programs will be cut, 
resulting in significant job loss in the federal public service.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that many causes promoted by special 
interest groups have their own champions within government. I 
do not believe we should be cutting public service jobs if we are 
not prepared to reduce or eliminate funding to those extra 
governmental groups that mirror government programs and 
initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Another problem associated with special interest funding 
relates to the lack of control elected officials have over the 
process. Although politicians bear the brunt of public criticism 
and are justifiably held accountable for the expenditure of 
public funds, the real control of patronage rests within the 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	Ministers cannot possibly pay close attention to every grant 
and contribution dispensed by their departments. Once budgets 
and guidelines are set, it is also seen as inappropriate for 
politicians to become involved in the disbursement of public 
money.
<P>
	Public servants are sensitive to political considerations and 
this can lead to funding only for those organizations that are 
deemed politically correct. It becomes impossible to criticize 
such expenditures without being labelled as inappropriately 
biased.
<P>
	The problem for members of Parliament is that it is usually 
not worth risking the disapprobation of powerful voices among 
the media and special interest groups. Taxpayers' dollars 
continue to be directed to organizations that may enjoy the 
support of only a small minority of the public.
<P>
	The amount of money involved is staggering. Approximately 
$4 billion is directed to not for profit organizations in the form 
of unconditional grants. Another $3 billion takes the form of 
contributions for which accountability is demanded.
<P>
	It should offend taxpayers that organizations which depend in 
any measure on public financing, no matter how noble the cause, 
can escape the normal accountability expected of any other 
private or public enterprise. This situation only invites abuse.
<P>
	It should also concern Canadians that their members of 
Parliament have no right or ability to review how that public 
money is spent. Canadians are very tolerant. We are proud that 
so many of our fellow citizens involve themselves freely in 
organizations that exist to better the lives of others.
<P>
	However we also believe any organization that claims to have 
the support of a large percentage of the population should be 
able to demonstrate the support with corresponding levels of 
membership and financial support. That is how one 
demonstrates legitimacy.
<P>
	Unfortunately the availability of public funding for special 
interest groups has spawned many institutions that cannot meet 
that test and could not continue to exist if they were forced to 
depend on their membership and public appeals for support.
<P>
	Again the motivation and objectives behind these groups may 
sound compelling, but we are living in an era of hard choices 
that will continue for many years to come.
<P>
	My colleague from Hamilton-Wentworth has brought to our 
attention a number of examples of how federal grants are 
allocated which would, I am sure, surprise and upset many of my 
constituents. I would like to single out one in particular because 
it raises a number of questions. My colleague from Mississauga 
has already referred to it. Over the past 10 years the Canadian 
Labour Congress has received $41,370,247 from the federal 
government. This funding results from a 1977 labour education 
agreement with the government.
<P>
	The CLC educational services program includes three courses 
on occupational safety. The subjects taught in the other 32 
courses include techniques of organized labour activism, 
collective bargaining, grievance procedure, shop steward 
responsibilities, something called facing management and 
labour law.
<P>
	I am not arguing that those are inappropriate subjects for 
union education. I do contend the Canadian taxpayer should not 
be funding the program with an average of $83,672 per person in 
pay and benefits for the office and teaching staff involved when 
we are facing cuts in other programs that will mean real hardship 
for many individuals.
<P>
	A more troubling aspect of public funding for the CLC relates 
to its involvement in federal election financing. In the 1993 
federal election the CLC donated $1,509,810  to the New 
Democratic Party. That was by far the largest contribution from 
any single source to a political party.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9497"> 9497 </A></B>
<P>
	The taxpayer paid again when Elections Canada matched that 
contribution as provided by law dollar for dollar. Whether or not 
the CLC can argue it administers separate funds for education 
and political action, it is inappropriate for any organization that 
receives direct government funding to make political 
contributions. I would apply that rule to private industry as well.
<P>
	This debate is important for a number of reasons. First, it is 
unlikely that many Canadians are aware of how much public 
money is channelled to special interest groups. Second, they 
should be made aware of the need for accountability by those 
organizations. Finally at a time of real fiscal restraint, it is 
important that all non-essential spending be put under the 
spotlight and justified.
<P>
	I am pleased to support Bill C-224 and I am confident that it 
will have the support of a great majority of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to enter into debate on the very worthwhile bill being 
presented by my colleague from Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	People throughout the country are telling us that they do not 
want any more taxes. Taxes take various forms. They take the 
form of writing cheques on April 30 but they take other forms as 
well. Every time somebody receives a tax deduction for a 
charitable donation it is a form of taxation. It means that person 
did not have to pay tax on that transaction. He received an 
exemption for it. In a sense, between taxpayers there is a transfer 
of resources from one taxpayer to another.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	People are asking us for greater visibility and accountability 
in government programs. One of my own initiatives, to be 
presented in a private member's bill later this year, is to 
basically try to focus on how much government programs cost 
and taking them one step further to how much they are costing 
each individual taxpayer in this country.
<P>
	Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I stand in support of 
Bill C-224.
<P>
	The financial community has long regarded accountability as 
being very important. Public corporations in this country 
publicly trading shares are required to report the remuneration 
of their top executives. The hon. member is asking for nothing 
unusual. It is only something that should have been put in 
legislation years ago.
<P>
	One of my hon. colleagues from the Bloc mentioned that it is 
possibly too wide in scope and possibly applies to organizations 
that do not receive federal government funding. I do not really 
think that is the purpose. If there is a non-profit organization or 
a registered charity people want visibility whether governments 
have funded it one  way or the other. Therefore, I do not think the 
scope is too broad. I think this could be something useful for all 
government agencies and for the public in general to have access 
to information.
<P>
	Non-profit and charitable organizations do not have a profit 
motive or the necessary overburden for efficiency. In a free 
market economy, a capitalist system, obviously companies have 
to make a profit or they die, they go into bankruptcy and become 
insolvent. The whole concept of those organizations is how they 
are going to meet the payroll.
<P>
	When I was in private practice running my own businesses 
every day I wondered how I was going to make the payroll. That 
was a big feature of my daily life. If I did not meet the payroll I 
would suddenly be out of business.
<P>
	These organizations obviously have to meet the payroll but 
they also do not have the incentive to have to make a profit. This 
by itself creates inefficiency if there is not a constant focus on 
the results of the organization. Most non-profit and charitable 
organizations have a different focus. They are not trying to make 
a buck. They have a specific and worthwhile function they are 
trying to achieve. However, without having the restraints 
required of turning a profit or being efficient they will have a 
tendency over their history to build in inefficiencies. The 
greatest inefficiency is in the area of wages.
<P>
	If we allow these organizations to simply set their own wage 
structure there will always be non-profit organizations 
demanding more money just by the nature of the way they are 
established. There is no requirement to be efficient.
<P>
	I think the member has brought forward a very worthwhile bill 
that will give these organizations an advantage to make them 
more efficient because people will have the visibility of how 
much people were remunerated. The question is whether it is 
reasonable remuneration.
<P>
	In conclusion, I certainly congratulate the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth for his very valuable contribution today 
and I certainly support it. I would respectfully request that all 
the parties of the House support this very worthwhile 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> May we call it 2.30 p.m.?
