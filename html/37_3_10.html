	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to address Bill C-2, an act to amend the Radiocommunication Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an opportunity to review some of the debate in which I took part earlier in the week and I want to make a few points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to focus on and at least highlight the bill in terms of what it does for consumers and the telecommunications industry. The government rationale behind the bill is to protect investments made by the broadcasting industry and the integrity of the broadcasting system as a whole by fighting satellite piracy. To do so, the bill will target unauthorized dealers and the pirating of signals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the government wants current changes it deems necessary to stop the sale and distribution of devices used to decode encrypted direct to home satellite signals without authorization. It is an excellent example of the government not taking the proper steps on an issue that is going to lead to confrontation in Canadian society and is the reason I do not support the bill being moved to committee at this time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be specific, the problem is that the bill is coming forward without dealing with the issue of satellite access to  many cultural and other programs that are currently available abroad to  different communities out there, providing those opportunities for people to purchase into the systems.  They will now be further criminalized by the bill if they are accessing products and services that are not available legally in this country. I think the government should have been honest and should have actually worked on producing those access points for Canadians, be it for cultural or other types of programming for which people have been clamouring and which keeps them in connection with the community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report that came out of the Canadian heritage committee identified this issue. It was a report about the black and grey satellite market: “Maintaining a Single System”.  In chapter 16 the committee recommended:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--that the CRTC permit Canadian broadcasting distribution undertakings to offer a wider range of international programming, while being respectful of Canadian content regulations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the government has come forward with this bill, which will further criminalize people for keeping in touch with their cultural communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed in <i>Hansard</i> that previous supporters of the bill seem to be falling back on the whole issue of protecting artists and broadcasting integrity in Canada to ensure that those individuals receive funds and the proper recognition they deserve for their products, and to encourage our Canadian culture to flourish. That is very suspect, with the government's past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very clear about this. If a person is in the black market system  and is stealing a signal that is legally available in Canada, we should stop that. We should have punishment for those individuals. Whether it is Bell ExpressVu, Shaw or whatever is currently available in Canada, it should not be an option for people to steal the signal and they should be punished accordingly for that.  The problem is in that grey market where the services are not available. This also provides a good connection for individuals and communities to reach back to their former homelands, to have education and entertainment  and that connection. Those individuals will now be further criminalized into that black market. I cannot support the bill for that reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is falling back on the whole notion that the bill will improve the access for artists to be able to receive funds and to make sure Canadian content prospers, but it is not really an improvement on its past practices. We recently had a motion put forward by the member for Dartmouth from our party which called for a tax deduction for artists. That would have been far better for those artists. The government voted against that and  stopped the motion from going forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main issues that we have to identify is how to provide people with the actual access to those cultural programs. In my community of Windsor, we have many people accessing programs which they would access  in a legal way if they were provided the opportunity to do so. They could do so and pay into a system that supports Canadian culture. They would all be happy to do that  and would support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to wonder where this issue is going. We look at the fact that Bell ExpressVu Canada and Shaw Communications have contributed over $320,000 to the  Liberal Party and Paul Martin's leadership campaign--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria:</b> That is out of order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse:</b> The Speaker has not ruled on that. You are no longer the House leader, thank you.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Hon. members cannot refer to other hon. members this way. In particular, they cannot use their names on the floor of the House of Commons.  I will leave the rest of the insults aside for a moment, but  members are to refer to each other by name of riding.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know perfectly well that I am not the House leader. That has nothing to do with it.  It has to do with the unparliamentary language used by the hon. member across.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-809349"></A><a HREF="#Int-809350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-809348"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>

	Let me see if I can be of assistance here. Certainly  with  regard to the practice of the House in terms of referring to one another, it is either by the portfolio one might carry or at the very least by naming each other's ridings respectfully.  In terms of the contents, I will not engage in a debate, but certainly the practice as stated by the hon. member for Glengarry--Prescott--Russell is correct.  I failed in paying close enough attention and I do regret that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the little time the hon. member for Windsor West has left, I know he will want to make sure that we complete this intervention without any further mishaps. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-809350"></A><a HREF="#Int-809352"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-809349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I apologize for that.  I was reading off my notes and made an honest mistake.  I took offence because I was being shouted down by another member of the House.  I apologize for naming an individual.  I should have said the former minister of finance, the member for LaSalle--Émard.  I apologize for that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap up, I do want to impress upon members that before Bill C-2  moves forward we need to clear up the issue of access to grey market products.  That is very important.  That should be the  very first step because it is important to build Canada through our cultural diversity.  That is what connects many people to information abroad, whether it is English language programming, whether it is Christian programming, or whether it is Middle Eastern programming like Al Jazeera.  All these things have been asked for at the CRTC but there has been no response.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to solve that first as opposed to further criminalizing people for making sure that they have those elements that are so important to their lifestyles.  Quite frankly, it could be accessed through other mediums we already have, such as the Internet or as in other communities by putting up regular airwaves. This needs to be resolved right away before the government moves forward. Nothing else will do.</p>

John McKay (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to rise on Bill C-18, an act respecting equalization and to authorize the Minister of Finance to make certain payments with respect to health, and to support the motion that the legislation be referred to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  is designed to achieve two goals.  First,    the bill would enable  the continuation of the equalization payments while the renewal legislation is being finalized. Second, the bill would provide the federal government with the authority to pay $2 billion to the provinces and territories for health, as confirmed by the Prime Minister following the first minister's meeting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleagues are aware that the federal government is in a partnership with the provinces and territories and it plays a key role in supporting the Canadian health system and social programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large majority of federal transfers are delivered through four major programs: the CHST, the Canada health and social transfer; the equalization payments; the territorial formula financing; and the new health transfer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill today only deals with equalization and CHST.  However, collectively, those four programs actually represent 2.4% of the nation's GDP, a significant sum of money by anyone's standard and constitute  18% of the government's revenues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization program is a constitutional obligation that ensures that less prosperous provinces have the capacity to provide reasonably comparable public services according to their levels of ability.  It is not a program that transfers wealth among citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments are unconditional.  Receiving provinces are free to spend the funds on public services according to their own priorities.  Payments are calculated according to a formula set out in federal legislation.  The formula responds to the changing economic fortunes and circumstances of each province.  It is designed to measure a province's fiscal capacity relative to the average fiscal capacity of the five middle income provinces, which forms the threshold standard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula puts 33 revenue sources in a basket to measure fiscal capacity.  Each province's fiscal capacity is measured relative to the middle wealthy five provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula is dynamic and, as revenues go up or go down over the year, the average moves as does the fiscal capacity of each province.  If any province has a good year, that affects equalization and, conversely, if any province has a bad year, so also is equalization affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a large province has a bad year, naturally there is a ripple effect.  Population movement, as reflected in the 2001 census, also affects the flow of payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that over the past 20 years, with all the ups and downs of the nation's provinces, there has been a slow but steady narrowing in the fiscal disparities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, equalization payments are subject to a floor provision, which provides protection to provincial governments against unexpected large and sudden decreases in equalization payments.  The floor limits the amount by which a province's entitlements can decline from one year to the next.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal and provincial officials review the equalization program on an ongoing basis to make sure that differences in the capacity of provinces to raise revenues are measured as accurately as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, and central to today's debate, is the fact that equalization legislation is renewed every five years to ensure that this review is undertaken and that the integrity and fundamental objectives of the program are preserved. The last renewal was in 1999.  The current legislation is set to expire on March 31, 2004.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions on the full five year renewal of the equalization program are underway  but may not be set by April 1, 2004, which would leave a gap in the government's authority to make equalization payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the bill before us today would provide  the Minister of Finance with the authority to continue to make the equalization payments according to the current formula for up to a year in the event that the new legislation is not ready before April 1.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would  ensure an uninterrupted stream of equalization payments following March 31.  It is basically an insurance policy to ensure the continuation of payments while renewal legislation is finalized.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passage of the bill would  ensure that public services provinces fund through the equalization program will continue to be protected for the benefit of their citizens.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when passed,  the renewal legislation would supercede this extension.  When   the full renewal legislation is  passed it will be retroactive to April 1, 2004. The renewal legislation would  ensure that the program remains up to date and that the best possible calculations and data are used to determine equalization payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated, until the renewal legislation is introduced and passed,  hon. members should regard the measures in Bill C-18 as insurance to continue payments and minimize the impacts upon the receiving provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to turn now to the other  provision  in Bill C-18, which is the Prime Minister's commitment to provide a further $2 billion to the provinces and territories for health.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest federal transfer, the CHST provides provinces and territories with cash payments and tax transfers in support of health care, post-secondary education, social assistance and social services, including early childhood development and early learning and child care.  It constitutes 1.7% of the nation's GDP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the CHST was created in 1996, the federal government has strengthened the transfer numerous times and it will continue to be a key priority for the government.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a moment to review the major funding increases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September  2000, Canada's first ministers reached a five year health renewal agreement under which the federal government made its largest ever increase to the CHST.  The September 2000 agreement provided $21.1 billion to the provinces and territories for health care and early childhood development, bringing CHST payments to their highest levels ever. To support the agreement, the federal government also provided an additional $2.3 billion in targeted advancements for medical equipment, primary care reform and new information technologies  such as electronic patient records. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that money came to the hospitals in my riding the CEO of that hospital identified information technologies as his critical need and, in some direct measure, the federal government responded to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on the commitments supporting reform and renewal outlined in 2000, the 2003 budget confirmed $34.8 billion in increased funding over five years to meet the goals outlined in the 2003 health accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the investments I have just outlined, in 2003-04  the federal will provide a total of $37.9 billion in support to the provinces and territories through the CHST.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the second measure in the bill, which is the $2 billion from the consolidated revenue fund in 2003-04 for health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional funding for health care was committed under the 2003 health accord where the government indicated that in an addition to  $34.8 billion over five years, it would provide an additional $2 billion for health at the end of the fiscal year 2003-04 if the Minister of Finance determined during the month of January 2004 that there would be sufficient surplus above  the normal contingency reserve to permit such an investment.   The commitment was reiterated in the February 2003 budget and again in the November 2003 economic update.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government intends to live up to that commitment. This money is in addition to the increased federal investment of $17.3 billion over three years and the  $34.8 billion over five years already confirmed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of the bill before the end of the fiscal year will provide provinces and territories with the flexibility to begin drawing down these funds as they require, which will help them better plan for the future.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would  ensure that Canada's health care system continues to be, in the words of the Prime Minister,  “A proud example of our national values at work”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the equalization measures of the bill, I urge hon. members to also keep in mind that the bill underscores the priority the government places on equalization and ensures uninterrupted funding until renewal legislation is in place.  This would ensure that the receiving provinces continue to receive the resources they need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage hon. members to support the motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, anybody who did  not know the difference and who listened to what we just heard from the government member would think we have a wonderful government.  It is giving all this money to the provinces and now, because it thought there might be some disruption in the program, it will  extend the current program for another year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has   this not been a very familiar ring in the Chamber over the last few months? The government is going to extend,  going to put off,  going to refer to the courts.  When is the government going to make a decision on something?  What more important decision can it make than on the equalization payments to the provinces?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces have known for years that the present equalization payment agreement  would end at the end of this fiscal year.  They have been working extremely hard and  have been placated by little bits and pieces.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member says that the government is giving more in equalization payments  than it ever did before.   If people   worked for me in 1970 and I paid them  $5 an hour and I now give them  $5.25 would I ask them why they were complaining   since I was  paying them  more? We must look at the effect in real dollars.  The provinces have been shafted entirely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read into the record what the Constitution says. Section 36(2) states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not say comparable levels of service.  It says reasonable, meaning close. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should look at  some of the provinces we refer to as have not provinces. Why are they have not provinces?  It is because we have not.  The federal government takes it away.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons we have to fight for equalization is to make sure we can provide these reasonably comparable levels of services.  Can it be done?  Let me be parochial and talk about Newfoundland and Labrador.  Can we provide reasonably comparable levels of services?  The answer is a blatant no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that?  One just has to look at the geography of our province and the infrastructure necessary to deliver reasonably comparable levels of service to our people.  Let us look at  the   health care funding, which the government has scuttled.  The  CHST payments have been reduced to almost non-existence despite the promises of an extra $2 billion that  we have heard about for three years.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the premiers come up and take the money begrudgingly and  go home.  However the bottom line is that they are  worse off than they were before they took the money.  We are not even close to keeping up with regular payments.  In fact, at one time  the provinces and the federal government shared the cost 50:50.  Now some of the provinces are down to a 14% federal contribution.  The burden is on the provinces and then, of course, it is on the municipalities and on the taxpayers and the services cannot be provided.  Is this reasonably comparable?  That is poppycock. Services are not reasonably comparable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we again look at the geography of Newfoundland and Labrador, or anywhere in rural Canada, can we provide reasonably comparable services under the present system? The answer is no.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the premiers looking for?  The premiers and the ministers of finance are looking to the government to give them what  the Constitution requires, nothing more and nothing less.  They only want    adequate funding to provide reasonably comparable levels of service. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What difference does it make to Newfoundland, under the present arrangement, where we see the average based upon not  only five provinces, but which also excludes a number of different factors that affect what we would call equalization?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When look at the 10 provinces and we base it on equality, the difference to  Newfoundland and Labrador is about $200 million annually. Where can we find that money?  It is about the same amount as we have now seen wasted on the sponsorship program.  Right now we are talking over $100 million, and every day we see other bits and pieces come out. With the sponsorship program alone, the money that has been squandered and covered up could have equalized the payments to Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That $200 million is only 20%, or one-fifth, of the money spent on the gun registry. If we had taken the gun registry money alone, five provinces, like Newfoundland and Labrador, would have received proper and adequate equalization payments. It is incredible to think that the government  blatantly can throw away such money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals can go behind closed doors and in five minutes make a decision to bring in the foolish long gun registry that has wasted $1 billion. They can go behind closed doors and pass out $100 million to their friends. It is unbelievable.  Yet they cannot, within two years, sit down with the provinces and come up with a reasonable agreement on equalization. This is completely and utterly unheard of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can they do to correct this inadequacy?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if they moved to the 10 province formula instead of the five province formula, it would be a major factor and it would help all the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and more important, let us take this designation of have not away from the provinces by letting them develop their own resources. The development of natural resources and the economy generated by that should be taken out of the equalization formula if they are non-renewable resources. Let the provinces benefit from their own resources. If that happened, provinces like Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador and the developing north would do very well on their own. Not only would we be equal in the economic standards of the country, we would be contributing partners. We would not have other provinces complaining about paying more than their share, and perhaps rightly so.  They would not have them dumping into the public purse to equalize provinces like ours. We would be able to pay our own way and  help maybe a few provinces who could not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals look at us, the new Conservative Party, and ask where our policies are. They will see them when we hit the campaign trail.  However, I will tell them one right now. In relation to equalization, we would move to the 10 province formula for which  all the provinces have asked.  We would remove non-renewable natural resources from the equalization agreement which would give provinces that have these resources a chance to get on their feet and become contributing partners. Then the services across the country would be comparable.  We would be contributors and would not be held subservient to a central government that just does not care.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this bill. I find it very symbolic and very representative of the kind of stunts this government, the Liberals and this Prime Minister seem to enjoy playing. Of course, this is to be expected just before an election. Bill C-18 is basically a partisan piece of legislation that goes against the interest of Quebec and the rest of the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in Bill C-18, two  distinct components have been combined. The first one deals with extending the current equalization program that the provinces, and Quebec in particular, do not like and have been criticizing. The second one is to approve the $2 billion that was first promised to the provinces by Jean Chrétien and then by the former finance minister and that will probably be paid by the current Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we are against the extension of the current equalization program, because it penalizes Quebec and Atlantic Canada, in particular. On the other hand, we agree with the $2 billion for health promised by Jean Chrétien. The government thinks it can fool of us by  coercing us to vote in favour of a bill that would penalize Quebec and Atlantic Canada over the next fiscal year. It is not fooling anyone, not the people of Quebec and not the Bloc Quebecois.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We demand that this bill be split. While we are in favour of Bill C-18 being referred to a committee, we will be bringing forward in committee an amendment to split the bill into two very distinct parts, as I mentioned earlier. So much for the first stunt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, by introducing a bill that would extend the equalization program and provide an additional $2 billion for health, as promised over and over again, the federal government would have us believe that it is being very generous and that the provinces will be the big winners here. That is not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fiscal year alone, federal transfer payments to Quebec have been cut by about 5%. That means $423 million less in Quebec's coffers, even with the $2 billion, of which Quebec will receive $472 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not stupid. The federal government is financially starving the provinces, especially Quebec. Next year, if the equalization formula is maintained and if there is no agreement to increase health care funding, transfer payments to Quebec will drop by $1.55 billion. This is unacceptable. We will not allow Ottawa to financially starve the Quebec government at the expense of Quebeckers. We will not endorse this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the federal government is making a big deal about the $2 billion it is transferring for health care but has failed to mention that this year it will save $2 billion in equalization payments. That is the federal government's strategy: to take with one hand and give with the other. The problem is that the rules are not the same when it comes to equalization or the CHST.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHST is based on population percentage. Equalization, however, is based on the relative wealth of the provinces. Consequently, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces lose under Bill C-18. The proof is that, this year, under the equalization program, our share of the 2002-03 amount will drop 38%. These figures bear repeating because they are evidence of this third stunt pulled by the Liberals and the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures I am providing are from the study by Quebec's finance minister, Mr. Séguin, who is far from being a separatist, as the Liberals say, and who should have a certain credibility in their eyes. In 2002-03, under the equalization program, Quebec received $5.315 billion. In 2003-04, the current fiscal year, it received $3.29 billion. That is a 38.1% decrease. Projections for next year are approximately $3.5 billion. Compared to 2002-03, this is a 34.1% decrease.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they are trying to sell us on the idea of extending the current equalization formula at the expense of Quebec's finances.   This is unthinkable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Canada health and social transfer, we see that in 2002-03 we received $2.648 billion.  In 2003-04 we received $2.58 billion, a drop of 2.6%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year there  is of course the increase provided for in the February 2002 agreement plus the $2 billion, which means for Quebec a total of $1.647 billion.  And there is $1.367 billion in other transfers. So this year Quebec will receive in federal transfer payments $8.884 billion compared to the $9.3 received in 2002-03.   That is a net loss of 4.5%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want the Bloc Quebecois, the sole defender of the interests of Quebec in this House, to accept such a unilateral reduction in transfer payments by the government.  Next year, again compared to 2002-03, according to our very conservative estimate, the losses will be in the order of 16.7%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore cannot accept the sort of stunt they are trying to pull with Bill C-18, which will, when all is said and done, penalize Quebec and the Atlantic provinces in particular, as I have said, by strangling them financially. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see, since the numbers are there, that the basic intent of Bill C-18 is to allow the federal government to save money.  The $2 billion—which, I will remind hon. members, is $2 billion with no guarantee of repetition next year, far from it—is merely an attempt to conceal what they are doing. This is why they have put the two elements into Bill C-18.  But, once again, we are not taken in,  nor are the people of Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, since there has been a new prime minister, since there has been a new finance minister, they have copied the tactics of the former finance minister, now Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They claim the financial situation is very difficult, pointing  to examples of current issues that are indeed of great concern: the mad cow crisis, which the federal government should come up with more money for, the SARS crisis, and a number of other things such as the power outage in Ontario. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says finances will be very tight now. It expects to have a lot of difficulty raising $2.3 billion in surpluses. What did we learn this week? From April to December, the federal government already   raised $5.2 billion. The surplus will be closer to  $6 billion   or $7 billion, as the Bloc Quebecois predicted earlier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the federal government put up a show to try to relieve the pressure on the negotiations concerning equalization and health. When he met with provincial premiers, the Prime Minister said, “I will not solve the problem now. I will wait until July”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will he wait until July? Because he hopes to hold his election before then. Of course, I am not convinced that, with the current events, it will be easy. However, at the time, his idea was to call an election as soon as possible and postpone the problems. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same with Bill C-18. The government does not want a debate, it does not want to negotiate the equalization formula with the provinces. It is downloading, hoping that the election will be held before then.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to cover all  this, it is pretending that it is having financial problems, which is false. Not only there are surpluses, but there is $6 billion sitting in the foundations that were created by the current Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Jacques Léonard, the former president of the Treasury Board in Quebec, did a wonderful job for the Bloc Quebecois. He showed that the federal government had increased its spending at a pace that was double that of Quebec and Ontario, and that there was a lot of waste. It is not just the sponsorship scandal; there is also a culture of waste within the federal government. If things were tightened up, we would have ample means to settle the issue and negotiate quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, all this is done with one goal in mind, which is to put all the problems off until after the election. Afterwards, the government will give the bad news to Quebec and to the other provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be fooled. We will not play this game. We will not condone what the Liberals want to do to the provinces and to Quebec in particular, which is to  put a financial stranglehold on them and not deal with the fiscal imbalance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor will we condone the laxness of this government, which could easily have negotiated the new equalization rules before March 31. We will not play this game and we will not support Bill C-18.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that this bill will be split and that the issue of the $2 billion for health will be addressed separately.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we will ask that the $2 billion be a recurrent amount and that the equalization program be extended before March 31 if possible, but in any case before the election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we will support the referral of this bill to the Standing Committee on Finance.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to address Bill C-18, an act respecting equalization and authorizing the Minister of Finance to make certain payments related to health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened very carefully to the parliamentary secretary's comments on introducing Bill  C-18. What we heard essentially was a bit of a historical account and a somewhat clinical recitation about equalization payments and the Canada health and social transfer  which  is a critically important part of the Canadian fiscal regime. In a way the parliamentary secretary's comments are significant not for what was included  but for what was omitted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expressed  concern and sounded ever so committed to the federal government keeping its fiscal and moral commitment to Canadians to ensure that regardless of which province people  happen to live in they will   be entitled to a roughly comparable level of service in the vital areas of health, education, child care and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the parliamentary secretary failed to say despite this show of concern is that the government has been so unwilling to see it as a priority to ensure not just that equalization payments continue but that there be a fair formula for equalization payments.  The government  has been dragging its feet and the current regime expires at the end of March.  It has had five years to negotiate a renewal agreement that would be more fair and more effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are dealing with   here is a stop-gap measure.  We are dealing with a bill that is necessitated because the government has not seen it as enough of a priority to work in good faith with the provinces to put in place the new formula for equalization which  is desperately needed and long overdue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the provinces have been working hard and in good faith to put forward a new formula.  We heard from the parliamentary secretary about how the old formula works. What he did not say is that  a very specific proposal  has been brokered and worked on over a period of years that is based on a 10 provinces agreement and a 10 provinces formula.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has not been willing to come to an agreement about that new improved formula.  Why?  Despite the expression of concern about the inadequacy and deterioration of services across this country as a result of federal policies over the last 10 years, it seems content to continue using the same formula because it saves the government money.  It needs to find ways to save money no matter whether it comes out of the hides of Canadians who are the most vulnerable in this country or wherever the government can find it because we know what the government's priorities are.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government decides that a corporate tax cut of $4.4 billion comes first, then no wonder it is   avoiding entering into a good faith agreement with the provinces that would allow the equalization funds to be more adequate and more fair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the notion that the Prime Minister can claim that it is  a new, different and better government.  What we see by the introduction of this bill today is simply an admission of failure. It is a revelation of  how vacuous the   Prime Minister's claim  is that he  is a Prime Minister that has a much improved working relationship with our premiers.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more to having an improved working relationship with our premiers than going to a football game with the boys. There is no question  it is a good photo op  and it is smart to come  out of the starting gate saying that he is  getting together with the premiers so they can just get along better. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not presume to speak for any premier. However,    I think one could say without fear of contradiction  that the vast majority of the premiers  would be a lot more impressed with the supposed commitment of the new Prime Minister to work in better harmony and good faith with them if the government had moved to endorse the 10 province formula. That formula was   worked on over a very long period of time. If it could be in place so that it took effect April 1 we would not need this stop-gap legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make no mistake about it. It  is not going to be missed on Canadians why this stop-gap legislation is needed. It is needed because when it comes to the fiscal regime and equalization, the new Prime Minister and the new finance minister have behaved no differently, no more responsibly, no more in response to the need for change by  the provinces than the old regime, the previous finance minister and  the old prime minister.  And I do not mean old in years, I mean old in terms of chronology.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to the second part of the bill which is to deal with the $2 billion that we hear trumpeted as a great achievement of the new Prime Minister. Let us not be that easily taken in by the notion that the $2 billion desperately needed for health care was an option and  the Prime Minister might have said,  “We are not going to do that after all because we do not have enough money”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard all the posturing  from the new Prime Minister, the new finance minister and the other cheerleaders for the new regime. They are  saying that they      have to be fiscally responsible, that they  may not have that $2 billion that was absolutely recommended as the rock bottom measure. That was the first measure needed to begin  to make up for the  money that was lost, that was clawed back by the federal government, that was held back from the health and social transfer over the last several years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not an option, not unless the new government, the new Prime Minister and  the new finance minister wanted to engage in a massive kamikaze effort here. It is clear that health care is the number one priority of Canadians. It is clear that the  loss of those dollars  at the insistence of the former finance minister, who now happens to be the Prime Minister, has very severely eroded the quality of health care, particularly in have not provinces like my own,  Nova Scotia,  and in the other six have not provinces. It  has made it very clear that the provinces  have to carry the load. They  have to  bear the burden of  the elimination of much of the federal funding for health care over the last several years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  not surprising that the premier of Nova Scotia has said  that the $2 billion clearly is not sufficient to deal with the horrendous waiting lists for specialist services and diagnostic services. It is  not sufficient to deal with the log-jam at emergency hospital rooms. It is  not sufficient to deal with the damage done over the last nine years because of the former finance minister's budgets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is absolutely clear is that even with the $2 billion granted, it does not begin to close the Romanow gap. When the Romanow report on the future of Canada's health care was presented, it was absolutely clear that there was a need for changes to  the equalization formulas. There was a need to address many of the other aspects of the health care system which  had been badly damaged by the government's misplaced priorities.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, there is no indication whatsoever with Bill C-18  that the government is seriously committed to creating a fairer, more effective equalization regime.  There is no indication that the government will begin to do what is needed to put in place the kind of health care system that Romanow recommended,   that was put before the Canadian people. Health care remains the number one priority for Canadians.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, last  fall, one of his first actions as Prime Minister was to cancel the sponsorship program. He has accepted all the Auditor General's recommendations concerning the sponsorship program. Moreover, he has pledged to take the necessary steps to uncover what happened to ensure those who are responsible are held to account.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I ran for federal politics seven years ago was because I recognized that there was something seriously wrong in our democracy. Many have called it the democratic deficit, and I am not at all confident that this government has the moral fortitude to fully address this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in this House, I have witnessed far too many scandals. The billion dollar boondoggle in HRDC, the Shawinigate affair, another billion dollars or more wasted on the ill-fated gun registry, the hep C tainted blood scandal and I could go on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Auditor General has exposed perhaps the greatest scandal that this House has seen in many years. It appears that this Liberal government turned a blind eye to taxpayer money being funnelled through Liberal-friendly advertising agencies to outside groups and events. After taking their cut, they passed it on to Liberal-friendly businesses and one can only speculate where the rest of the money went from there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, who was then the minister of finance, wants us to believe that he did not know anything was going on. Canadians are not stupid. Now the Liberals have gone too far. Maybe this is the scandal that will send them packing at the next election. I can only hope so, because Canadians deserve an honest government for a change.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dartmouth and Halifax almost 31,000, or 8% of the population, are on the brink of homelessness. A Halifax study has found many of these people are under 24 and many have disabilities.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High housing costs often mean choosing between paying the rent, buying food or getting prescriptions. Why are any of our citizens being forced to make such choices?

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of our most vulnerable citizens, yet the callous attitude of the Prime Minister has been to cut the national housing program as finance minister and not appoint a secretary of state for housing. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the 24th edition of the Cégeps en spectacle local finals at the Collège de Shawinigan has been a great success. More than 40 young people trod the boards of the auditorium, dancing, playing music, singing and juggling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges, including actor Robert Brouillette, winner of the 1984 finals, were won over by three creative numbers in singing, music and dancing. Singer-songwriter-performer Lillianne Pellerin took first prize. Many volunteers contributed to the success of this cultural event, onstage and backstage, even operating the lights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many new talents have been discovered through this competition, including Sylvain Cossette, Denis Trudel, Jean-François Bastien. Cégeps en spectacle will continue to be a life changing and unforgettable experience for many generations of students.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations for 25 talented years of Cégeps en spectacle.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, February 15, is the 39th anniversary of the Canadian flag. This distinctive emblem is recognized the world over. It is a symbol of Canadian identity and a source of pride for every one of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 15, 1965, at the stroke of noon, the national flag of Canada was raised for the first time, right here on Parliament Hill. The Speaker of the Senate at that time said this: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The flag is the symbol of the nation's unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief or opinion. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are just as meaningful today as they were then.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all Canadians will get together to celebrate Canada's flag on Sunday and will start planning even bigger and better celebrations for the 40th anniversary next year, on February 15, 2005.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister claims to be a fresh face, but as fast as he blames his predecessor for scandals he signed off on, he sets a speed record for invoking closure to get the same old bills back on the Order Paper.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also reminded of how true to form it is for Liberals to say one thing:  encourage more women to run for Parliament and then do the other; encourage their attack dogs to eliminate the women they do not like.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning it was my great pleasure to sponsor a meeting concerning the Stratford Festival of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stratford Festival employs some 700 people and is responsible for contributing $125 million to the economy.  The festival is world famous for its excellence in presenting Shakespearian classics and has taken a leadership role in offering new works illustrating the cultural mosaic of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The festival is truly a national performing arts organization.  The stages at Stratford also serve to train young emerging Canadian actors and playwrights and prepare them for careers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government's matching endowment program is a very important and appreciated source of funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the MPs representing multiple parties who took time out of their busy schedules to discuss this great Canadian institution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to have the Stratford Festival of Canada located in the heart of my riding of Perth--Middlesex.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister, despite his denials, was made aware of the mismanagement of the sponsorship program two years ago in a letter that came from the Liberal Party policy chair.  True to form, he did nothing.  He blamed an uneasy relationship with the former prime minister.  In other words, he was competing for his boss's job and it made things a little uncomfortable, causing tension.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the Prime Minister's personal ambition and rush to get to 24 Sussex put ahead of taxpayers' trust?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said yesterday that the gravity of the situation began to emerge in the early part of 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Maharaj's letter was written in February 2002.  The Groupaction matter was referred to the Auditor General in March.  She reported in May and then proceeded to her more detailed examination.  Obviously that is completely consistent with what the Prime Minister described yesterday.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the more the Prime Minister claims he knew nothing, the more incompetent he looks.  Was he on top of his department?  Was he looking out for taxpayers' money? Or was he shamelessly working to get the prime minister's job? It appears that this political ambition, this naked ambition, took precedence over anything else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal friendly firms that received millions of dollars in taxpayers' money were working for the Liberal Party.  If the Prime Minister is serious about getting the money back, will the Liberal Party coffers pay that money back to the taxpayers and then will they go after those crooked firms?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in the announcements the Prime Minister made on Tuesday he indicated that we have already appointed a special legal counsel for the recovery of money.

	Mr. Speaker, those promises are about as thin and flexible as Flat Mark.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown corporation heads may roll, according to the Prime Minister.  Among those on the chopping block should be BDC President Michel Vennat, who was part of a well orchestrated smear campaign against the former president, François Beaudoin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Superior Court judge said Beaudoin suffered “unspeakable injustice”, and Vennat's evidence at trial was rejected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Prime Minister ensure that a public inquiry will include in the terms of reference a review of the Auberge Grand-Mère file and, in the meantime, will they fire BDC President Michel Vennat?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso Gagliano is not the only high profile Liberal to come under the scrutiny of the Auditor General. The Auditor General also rips Canada Post for its role in the Liberal Party's dash for taxpayers' cash.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not going to determine that in the House.  The appropriate place to determine responsibility, guilt, innocence and the ability to recover money is in the disciplined processes that have been established.</p>

They can also go to the public accounts committee, which is already sitting and looking into these matters.  That is where it should rest.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the government was very quick to pull the trigger on Gagliano, which we applaud, but why has it not done the same with André Ouellet?  All the government has to do is look in the Auditor General's report.  It is very clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;André Ouellet ran the Liberal Party in Quebec for many years.  He was even public works minister for a while. Now he is up to his ears in this scandal at Canada Post.

	Mr. Speaker, they say that breaking up is hard to do.  It has been an emotional week for everyone: Paul and Jean, Ken and Barbie.   And I think that Ken and Barbie managed to break up with more dignity than the Prime Minister and the former prime minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more concerned, as we all should be, with the future to some degree.  I want to ask the Minister of Finance about the possibility of future scandals as a result of the increasingly incestuous relationship between corporate lobbyists and the Prime Minister's Office.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister of Finance could tell us what the government is going to do about all the corporate lobbyists in the Prime Minister's Office.  Is it not time that they hit the road, so to speak, so we do not have to worry about them being paid off in the future?</p>

	Mr. Speaker,   I want to commend you for having operated such a streamlined question period that we got two additional questions today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Commons this week my colleague from St. John's West rose at the end of question period to bring to the House's attention a concern that he had about the reintroduction of bills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week in the House a number of bills were reintroduced.  I will not speak to the fashion in which those bills came back.  Specifically, at page 439 of <i>Hansard</i>  the member for St. John's West rose to bring the Chair's attention to the fact that he wanted the government to be vigilant in the reintroduction of those bills.  He was looking for assurances from the government House leader that the bills would be brought back in the proper form. The member was asking that they not be tampered with and that they be presented in the original form. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to page 440 where  the House leader  responded that  yes and  in fact on Bill C-4, he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the special order made previously, I would like to inform the House that this bill is in the same form as Bill C-34 was in the previous session at the time of prorogation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker then responded:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Chair is satisfied that this bill is in the same form as Bill C-34 was at the time of prorogation of the 2nd session, 37th Parliament.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has come to our attention, upon examination of the original Bill C-34 and the current bill that was reintroduced, that at page 14 of the original bill, there is a line  in  section 19(2) and I am reading that entire passage for the Chair, “In addition to any method of service permitted by the law of a province, service of documents on the Senate, House of Commons, Library of Parliament, office of the Senate Ethics Officer”. That is  page 14, line 25, section 19(2), and  I draw your attention specifically to that line which reads “office of the Senate Ethics Officer”. I now draw the Chair's attention to Bill C-34, the new bill introduced by the government, the same passage, the same section 19(2), line 25, “the office of the Ethics Commissioner”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text has been altered.  The text is not the same.  The bill is therefore not in the same form that it was introduced in the last Parliament, after receiving the assurances of the government House leader who I know passed that information on to the Chair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that the Chair examine this inconsistency and review the original ruling that was given by the Speaker on that day.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member is accurate, we will correct the mistake.  We have to take a look at that because both the House leader and the Speaker at the time concurred that indeed it was the same.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate amendments that the member refers to were never received by the House. Therefore, as far as the House is concerned, they do not exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion for reinstatement says clearly “as approved by this House”.  We will double check.  It is our belief that the procedure was followed absolutely as it should be.  I believe the Speaker will probably be confirming that as well, but we will  check again.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-809771"></A><a HREF="#Int-809794"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-809766"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rodger Cuzner (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise and speak on Bill C-18 here today and to join in this debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know and as  has been stated in the House, Bill C-18 really has two aspects that will be dealt with, one aspect being the continuation of the transfer payments from the federal government to the provinces. The second aspect of this bill will allow the federal government to move the $2 billion that has been identified through the meetings with the federal officials and the Prime Minister, through the premiers to the provinces as well, specifically for health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look first at the aspect of the legislation that deals with the transfer payments. As we are aware, money flows from the federal government through the provinces in any number of ways. Four main vehicles that the federal government uses to share money with the provinces are: the Canada health and social transfer,  equalization, the territorial formula financing, and the health reform transfer. The legislation being put forth today deals with equalization and the CHST.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization program basically ensures that those provinces less able to provide the necessities and the essential services to its constituents are able to draw from the fund. It takes into account the revenues from the prosperous provinces. Everybody pays into equalization and then through the sharing formula it is determined which revenues are able to be taken out of this pot. It is a very complex and complicated five province formula that is applied. Through this formula, the lesser provinces, the provinces less apt to have revenues to provide basic services, are able to draw from that fund. I hold my seat in Bras d'Or--Cape Breton and the Province of Nova Scotia is one of those provinces that is a beneficiary of the equalization payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the major inputs obviously come from the bigger provinces. When we look at a province like Ontario, we see that its revenue input is a significant amount of what we base our sharing outcomes on. Looking back and reflecting on the year that Ontario has just gone through, there is going to be somewhat of a change from past years because of the tough year Ontario experienced this year with SARS, the downturn in its tourism industry, and those struggles. This is all going to factor into the formula as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original legislation was signed in 1999. As we know, the reason for the discussion, the debate and this legislation coming forward today is that it is set to lapse at the end of March. Hence,  we find ourselves in a situation where the federal government wants to guarantee that the flow of cash to the provinces is not interrupted. We want to reaffirm that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, this legislation is almost like an insurance policy. Officials for the provinces and the federal government continue to negotiate and get into the nitty-gritty of the new legislation that will be put forward. What we will see, hopefully in the next short while, is that a new formula will be developed or a new agreement will be struck. At that time, legislation will be put forward which  will supersede today's legislation. This is almost like interim legislation until the new deal is agreed upon between the federal government and the provinces.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect or component of this legislation is the transfer to the provinces of the very much needed health care dollars.  In January, when the Prime Minister met with the premiers, and even before that, it was identified that if there were a surplus then an additional $2 billion would come from the federal coffers to be shared among the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the great excitement among the premiers and some of the trepidation  when we were not quite certain just what the surplus was going to be this year.  We had hoped that we were going to be able to provide that $2 billion and now this legislation will make sure that the $2 billion is there and can be moved to the provinces so that they can apply it to their provincial health care systems. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what we have seen in recent years.  In September 2000 a reinvestment was made, with $21.5 billion reinvested in health care to the provinces.    That agreement was struck between the federal government and the provinces.  The federal government, because it finally got its financial house in order, was in a position where it could reinvest in those essentials that Canadians see as imperative.  Obviously health care is something that Canadians take a great deal of interest in and recognize the importance of, and fortunately the federal government was able to reinvest in it in 2000.  Subsequently, we have made additional investments in health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own province of Nova Scotia, when we did make the reinvestment in 2000, there was a particular envelope of money that was peeled out and identified specifically for the acquisition of hospital equipment.   We can see that on the ground now back in my own constituency.  I look at the Cape Breton regional health care facility, the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, and the recent acquisition of an MRI machine.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we made this investment in health care back in 2000, I think there were around 50 MRIs in the country.  Right now we have almost 125 MRIs across Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was further investment in equipment.  We have digital x-ray machines in Inverness County, in Richmond County at the Strait Richmond Hospital, and a bone densitometer in Sydney.  Health care facilities were able to make these investments because the federal government put money in a specific envelope for the acquisition of health care equipment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who used to have to leave home and travel to Halifax for these particular treatments are now able to stay in their own communities and receive the treatments. We were very fortunate that we were able to apply the money there. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And really, what we are able to do through this legislation is provide an additional $2 billion that we will be able to transfer to the provinces for health care.  It is entirely up to the provinces how they deal with the moneys through the CHST and   through equalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the House will see the wisdom of supporting this legislation.  We hope members recognize that when we look at equalization, this legislation offers itself as an insurance policy as we wait for the final agreement between the feds and the provinces. As well, we hope they see the merit in supporting this legislation because it will enable the federal government to get that $2 billion into the hands of the provinces so that we can make that reinvestment in our provincial health care programs.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-18 on equalization. Even though people have a good grasp of the principle of equalization, I would still like to explain it briefly. It is the transfer of money from the federal government, which got that money from the have provinces  that make a somewhat larger contribution to the coffers of the state, to the have not provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of the current fiscal imbalance, this equalization program has suffered many distortions. Programs and places are invented—I will name a few later on—where the money sent to Ottawa  can be transferred. This means that the provinces are greatly penalized under the equalization program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the principle of Bill C-18, which should be referred to a committee, where a new format for presenting legislation in the House could be discussed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we also agree with the proposed health transfer of $2 billion to the provinces. We would go even further and ask that this $2 billion be paid to the provinces on a recurring annual basis. We do not want this $2 billion to necessarily be the set amount, but rather the guaranteed minimum payment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes ago, we put the question to the Minister of Finance. Despite larger than anticipated surpluses, the minister refused to promise to pay or to make this $2 billion a recurring payment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify the equalization principle, I remember that the current Quebec finance minister, Mr. Séguin, used to say that it is like what  Robin Hood did: take money from the rich and give it to the poor. Indeed, the equalization program can easily be explained by making a comparison with Robin Hood, who took money from the rich to give it to the poor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time comes to negotiate a new transfer or a new equalization formula, it will be difficult to negotiate because the idea of taking money from the rich and giving it to the less well-off has been perverted by the Liberals, as they adapt and change it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their system of equalization is to take the taxpayers' money  and give it to their friends. That is what the Auditor General has told us. For 18 months, for 2 years, they—from Jean Chrétien to the current Prime Minister—have been telling us, “We do not know if we will be giving you this $2 billion for health, because we do not know if we are going to have it”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not know if they would have that $2 billion, but they knew they had wasted $1 billion on the firearms registry. They knew they had spent and wasted $250 million fraudulently on the sponsorship program. They knew that they had bought two jets in nine days—that is fast—for $100 million. So far, I am up to $1.35 billion that was not  audited by the President of the Treasury Board, not audited by the Minister of Finance, not known to the Prime Minister. No one knew about it, but they held a sword of Damocles over the provinces and said, “We do not know if we will be giving it to you your $2 billion, because things are tight financially this year. You might not be getting anything at all”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things certainly are tight when the purse strings are loosened and all the money is wasted. That is where the equalization system breaks down in this government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to demonstrate that the equalization system works better—and this is what the Auditor General says—for those who have their Liberal Party membership cards and contribute to that party's fundraising campaign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an example of equalization where money is taken from taxpayers, sent to the federal government and given to party friends, who are told, “Give back 5% to 7% of it”. A public inquiry will allow us to shed light on this amount.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is one example. A representation of L'Information Essentielle,  the noble Robert-Guy Scully, was involved in this little scam. One of the representatives of his company told us, “We solicited the executive director of Public Works for the Government of Canada to sponsor three different television series”, including one on Maurice Richard. </p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive director, Mr. Guité, agreed and verbally committed the government to funding, which included $7.5 million for a series on Maurice Richard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask Fabienne Larouche, Pierre Falardeau, Quebec and even Canadian producers and artists if they ever called Mr. Guité to ask for $7 million for the film, television series or documentary they want to make and if Mr. Guité, or Alfonso Gagliano, called to tell them that there was no problem and the cheque was in the mail. No, it was a bit more complicated than that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything was fine since, after all, it was  Robert-Guy Scully. He calls Mr. Guité, who verbally promises him $7.5 million—so far, so good—plus $1.2 million for  <i>Le Canada du millénaire</i> and additional funds for a series called <i>Innovation</i>. No less than $8.7 million was granted in one phone call, as part of a verbal agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the money change hands? The Auditor General told us she would give us a demonstration in a briefing session in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, because what is in the report is just the tip of the iceberg. It is so bad, she would have had to write an encyclopedia, instead of a report, on the scandals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking the money of Public Works and Government Services Canada.  This is pretty serious business. In March 2000,. a cheque is cut for $862,000, not to L'Information Essentielle—that would be too simple—but to Lafleur Communications.  Lafleur pockets $112,000 of that cheque amount, and cuts another cheque for $750,000 to VIA Rail, which forwards it to L'Information Essentielle. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this way?  Because when someone wants to do some money laundering, to do some crooked deal or other, cheques must not go from point A to point B.  They have to go from A to B, from B to C, and then from C to D.  That way they think they will not get found out.  But they did, because of their little cut of $112,000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2000, a cheque for $400,000 was sent via Lafleur, which pocketed a $42,000 cut, <i>x </i>% of which went back to the Liberal Party.  This yielded $4 million,  not for the entire sponsorship program, but just for one item, the Maurice Richard series. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General tells us that, in December 1999, Public Works and Government Services Canada signed a contract with Lafleur Communications for production services worth $862,000, but this contract was intended as reimbursement to VIA Rail.  The contract stipulated that $862,000 was for work to be done between December 1999 and March 2000, but the contract was in very general terms and did not specify what work was to be done by Lafleur.  Lafleur invoiced PWGSC for $750,000 plus $112,000 commission.  Commission for what?  For handing on a cheque.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you would like to be able to deliver cheques, at the rate of 2 or 3 a day, if someone paid you $112,000 to pick up a cheque at one point and deliver it to someone at another.   I am sure you could do a lot of it, but you would not, because you are an honest man.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An internal investigation by PWGSC indicates that, when that contract was drafted , departmental staff was well aware of the true purpose, i.e. to reimburse a third party, VIA Rail, for part of the funds advanced.  The auditor says that this was, in her opinion, a dummy contract awarded by the Liberal Party.  Not a matter of taking from the rich to give to the poor, but of taking from the taxpayers to give to one's friends.  That is what is happening in this government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other examples in the Auditor General's report. The Old Port of Montreal needs a giant screen. To Public Works and Government Services Canada this is normal, legal and proper. A property procurement program is in place and they need $1.5 million. In theory, we would think the money would go from Public Works and Government Services Canada to the Old Port of Montréal Corporation Inc. Instead, it goes to Lafleur, which pockets the money and writes a cheque to Old Port of Montréal Corporation Inc. That is how it works everywhere.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Liberal Party proposing to resolve the situation now? It is simply saying it will make sure this never happens again. That would be like our justice system deciding, in response to organized crime laundering $250 million, not to punishing the offender, but simply tighten the rules to create more of a deterrent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want is for the guilty parties to be identified. The Prime Minister said that Quebec ministers were involved. We want to hear from them too. Then there would be a better sense of trust and the equalization system, since that is what we are talking about, would be fairer for everyone.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be here to speak on the equalization agreements and what the federal government is putting in, and that is the $2 billion for health care to the provinces, which have been delayed for some time. Now that these are finally reaching the provinces, they are very happy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 36.2 of the Canadian Constitution commits this Parliament and the Government of Canada to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonable comparative levels of public services at reasonable comparative levels of taxation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current structure of the equalization program does not fulfil the constitutional commitment. Premiers and provincial finance ministers have called on the federal government over the past number of years to strengthen this program to ensure it adequately fulfills the commitment. Provinces have asked the federal government to move from the current five province standard to a ten province standard to ensure the program comprehensively includes all revenue sources, particularly user fees and to remove the ceiling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the only thing that the federal government has done is to remove the ceiling,  but provinces have seen no financial benefit. Presently provinces are in discussion with the federal Department of Finance regarding the renewal of the equalization program for a five year period commencing April 1. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has had high expectations regarding the outcome of the renewed discussions, it appears now that the renewal will not result in strengthening the program, and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador firmly believes that we could have a process that would weaken the program. We, as the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, cannot have that, and I know many others provinces in the Confederation of Canada have this concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equalization payments comprise a very significant portion of the revenue for Newfoundland and Labrador. We rely on this funding so  we can provide such services as health care, education and infrastructure such as roads and highways. Erosions of revenue because of arbitrary federal decisions put my province at a disadvantage compared to other provinces. Not only is it unable to provide comparable service, there can be absolutely no doubt that it does not have comparable taxes, particularly in the most visible and important tax, personal income tax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal decision to maintain the inadequate five province standard results in $132 million less revenue for my province of Newfoundland and Labrador for the year 2003-04 than if a ten province standard was adopted. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador will endure a shortfall every year as a result of this decision. We need to have the 10 province standard adopted by this government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal decision to exclude 50% of the user fees from the equalization formula costs my province of Newfoundland and Labrador approximately $45 million annually. The small province of Newfoundland and Labrador, which is struggling beyond its means, cannot afford to have this revenue taken from it. The federal government will have to do something for our province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the others provinces within Confederation which have the same problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, the negative impact on Newfoundland and Labrador of federal decisions which limit the payout under the constitutionally enshrined equalization program could be in excess of $200 million annually. There are concerns that the federal government decision related to the 2004 renewal will further erode the program. This will have a significant impact on our ability to fund programs and offer residents of my province a fair and competitive tax regime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all hope that when the federal government sits down and negotiates with the provinces, it will keep in mind the concerns that Newfoundland and Labrador have so we can make the program stronger, not weaker. The $2 billion in health care is a great start, but we have a long distance to go, and I hope  the finance minister and health minister are listening to the concerns of all provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada health and social transfer is the federal transfer program which is intended by the Government of Canada to contribute to health, post-secondary education and social services. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador has seen its share of funding under this program substantially reduced over the past number of years, primarily because of the federal government's restraints imposed on the program starting in 1996-97 and because of the province's declining population.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to this pressure, the federal government has recently started to put more money back into this program. However this has not been sufficient to offset the rising costs of programs it was intended to support, particularly health care.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we turn on the news we hear the premiers saying that they do not have enough money for health care or  for education and not enough money overall to do the required infrastructure.  I hope the government will listen to the concerns of the provinces.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994-95, Newfoundland and Labrador received $425 million from the Canada health and social transfer.  In 2003-04, the province's cash entitlement is expected to be $367 million. Over the same period, the province's spending on health, education and social services has increased from about $2 billion in 1994-95 to almost $2.7 in 2003-04.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people have to realize is that our population is getting older and more services are needed.   The provinces have to deliver those services.  We need the federal government to be more open with its books  to ensure that the provinces get the money they require to provide services for the citizens  they represent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the federal contribution has not kept pace with provincial spending requirements.  It is imperative that the overall level of federal funding for social programs be increased from the current levels.  Provinces have called on the federal government to increase the level of funding over time until the share of federal funding is 25% of provincial-territorial health and social expenditures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate all the premiers who attended the 2003 first minister's health accord.  It was good that they decided to come out united because it  opened the doors to  co-operation.  They can now  sit down and talk about the problems and, as a good start, they will receive $2 billion.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However if all the federal government is going to do is sit down and talk and not give the provinces what they rightly deserve, then we will  have  confrontation.  I think we get more by sitting down and talking rather than having confrontations.  It is important that the premiers are starting in the right direction. It is now time for the Prime Minister to make sure that he delivers to the provinces what they are rightly due under our Constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland and Labrador's share of the $2 billion for health care this year is estimated to be approximately $33 million.  That sounds like a lot of money  but when we look at the big picture of  trying to provide services, it is  not very much.  We need more and  I hope the federal government is listening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 census:   the population  is a big determinant of   equalization and CHST.   In 2003,  revised population data was released which reflected the 2001 census.  Those results indicated that previous federal estimates of provincial population had been overstated for the years 2001-02  and  2003-04.  This revised population data has resulted in an overpayment to provinces over that period of about $700 million.  The impact for Newfoundland and Labrador of this overpayment was approximately $168 million. We need that money.  We cannot afford to have  the federal government  take it back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has indicated that  it intends to recover this overpayment from provinces.  The amount related to 2003-04,   $52 million for Newfoundland and Labrador, will be recovered this fiscal year, while amounts related to the previous years, $116 million for Newfoundland and Labrador, will be recovered over the next five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that the federal government listen. It should forgive the money for the provinces because they need it.  It is important that they ask where the money is being spent.  I think the provinces will return and tell the federal government that the money was spent in the right direction.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous administrations over the years in Newfoundland and Labrador have not spent the money properly and as a result the hon. premier, Danny Williams, is in a difficult situation.  We need the federal government to come on board, to assist Newfoundland and Labrador, like it has never assisted it before, not for political reasons  but to do the right thing.</p>

Larry Bagnell (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, to ensure that the people who  are just tuning in  understand this finance related bill,  the equalization payments are running out at the end of the federal government's fiscal year,  March 31, and we need to put a provision in place.  Negotiations are underway to renew them  but if the negotiations are not finished in time   we need to have a stop-gap measure in place to make sure  the provinces continue to get their funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part allows for the provision of   the $2 billion transfer to the provinces that the Prime Minister just announced.  I am sure no one would be against that.  It is a very high priority among Canadians to transfer this money for health care.  Health care is a high priority and I am sure everyone would be in favour of this administrative measure  in the bill  to transfer that money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister is meeting with the provinces and territories later this month to continue the negotiations.  People should be  secure  in the fact that if and when  new arrangements are made  they will  supersede anything in the bill and will be retroactive to April 1 so that any new arrangements will  be taken into account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member from Newfoundland  just  outlined very eloquently, the provinces   need the money and we must ensure that the money  keeps flowing to the provinces so they can provide the essential services, such as health care and education, to their citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-18 is  an act respecting equalization and it authorizes the Minister of Finance to make certain payments related to health.  We also have a motion for     the legislation to be referred to committee.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  is designed to achieve two goals which relate to Canada's system of federal transfer payments.   First, the bill would enable  the continuation of equalization payments while the renewal legislation is finalized.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the bill would provide  the federal government with the authority to pay $2 billion to the provinces and territories for health, as confirmed by the Prime Minister following the recent first ministers meeting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleagues are aware, the federal government, in partnership with the provinces and territories, plays a key role in supporting the Canadian health system and other social programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large majority of federal transfers are delivered through four major programs:  the Canada health and social transfer, equalization, territorial formula financing and the health reform transfer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's bill deals only with equalization and the CHST. Collectively, these programs represent 2.4% of the nation's GDP.  Another way of looking at it, and probably more relevant, is that it constitutes approximately 18% of the Government of Canada's budget.  Either way, it is a significant sum of money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be talking about the territorial formula financing right now.  I will be talking about the transfer to the provinces through equalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equalization is a constitutional obligation that ensures that less prosperous provinces have the capacity to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. It is not a program that transfers wealth among citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments are unconditional.  Receiving provinces are free to spend the funds on public services according to their own priorities.  Payments are calculated according to the formula set out in the federal legislation.  The formula responds to changing economic fortunes and circumstances of provinces and is designed to measure provinces' fiscal capacity relative to the average fiscal capacity of the five middle income provinces, which forms a threshold or a standard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula puts 33 revenue sources in a basket to measure final capacity. Each province's fiscal capacity is measured relative to the middle wealthy five provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula is dynamic and as revenues go up or down over the year,  the average moves as does the fiscal capacity of each province. If any province has a good year, that affects equalization and, conversely, if any province has a bad year, that also affects equalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a large province has a bad year, naturally there is a ripple effect. Population movement, as reflected in the 2001 census, also affects the flow of payments.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that over the past 20 years, with all the ups and downs of all the nation's provinces, there has been a slow but steady decline in fiscal disparities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, as a nation, we would all hope for that.  I am sure none of us would want to  move ahead in prosperity, in our  ability to take care of our families, in health care and in education if the rest of our brethren in Canada were not able to progress with us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time,  equalization payments are subject to a floor provision which provides protection to the provincial governments against unexpected and large sudden decreases in equalization payments. The floor limits the amount by which a province's entitlements can decline from one year to the next.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal and provincial officials review the equalization program on an ongoing basis to ensure that differences in the capacity of  provinces to raise revenues are measured as accurately as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, and central to today's debate,  is the fact that equalization legislation is renewed every five years to ensure that the review is undertaken and that the integrity of  fundamental objectives to the program are preserved. As I said earlier, that is exactly what is occurring right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last renewal was in 1999, and the  current legislation is set to expire on March 31, 2004.   Discussions on the five year renewal are underway but may not take place exactly on April 1, 2004, and, of course, we would not want to have a gap in the government's administrative authority just to make these payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the bill would give  the Minister of Finance the authority to make these equalization payments according to the current formula for up to a year in the event that the new legislation is not in place by April 1. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would ensure an uninterrupted stream of equalization payments following March 31. It is basically an insurance policy to ensure the continuation of payments while renewal legislation is finalized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passage of the bill will ensure the public services provinces fund equalization program will continue to be protected for the benefit of their citizens. Of course, when passed, the renewal legislation will supercede this legislation. When the full renewal legislation is passed it will be made retroactive to April 1, 2004. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The renewal legislation would  ensure that the program remains up to date and that the best possible calculations and data are used to determine equalization payments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated, until the renewal legislation is introduced and passed, hon. members should regard the measures in Bill C-18 as insurance to continue payments, given that the impacts on receiving provinces could  be very significant without legislation. It really appears just administrative so  I cannot imagine anyone here voting against allowing us to continue payments to the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part, as I said earlier, is related to health. It would allow    the Prime Minister's commitment to the provinces and territories of  $2 billion for  health care. This constitutes 1.7% of the nation's GDP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go through all this technical information on the health transfer but I do not think I will  because   the technicality of this has been well outlined.   We just want to continue the equalization payments until a new deal is in place  and to transfer the $2 billion in health care to which  I am sure no one objects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I will do now is  reinforce  the whole concept of equalization. I think equalization is one of the things Canadians point to as being the greatness of our nation. All Canadians want to see each and every one of us succeed and we help each other. In my community, any time there is a tragedy or an emergency  the whole community falls in behind the person or the family with the problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nation works like that when one province has a difficult time. We have a  nation that is  probably bigger than all of Europe. It covers a huge geographic and demographic area with different cultures and economies. Anything can happen to affect any of those areas. It can be seen even more rapidly in the new global environment. Under those circumstances we want to stick together. We want to progress as a people. We want to ensure  that everyone progresses together and that the rising tide raises all boats together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are a very compassionate people  and that is what equalization allows. We are all proud of that and we will make sure it   continues through the bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to speak on Bill C-18, whose purpose is double.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is somewhat surprising that, in the same bill, we find one part that finally transfers the $2 billion promised by Jean Chrétien and promised again by the current Prime Minister. This amount really should be transferred one way or another. It is a good idea in itself, but the amount is clearly inadequate. It is rather paradoxical and, I believe, unacceptable that this same bill is being used to extend the equalization agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization period is usually five years, and the current period ends on March 31, 2003. They want to extend it from 2004 to 2009, but without having real agreements with the provinces. It is rather like having an old collective agreement with a few holes and things that need fixing. We would like it to be improved. They assure us that the old agreement will apply for the entire period, unless something new is negotiated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have preferred that the current government had done its homework on time and that we had a new equalization act that included the results of negotiations and agreements with the provinces. But the past predicts the future. We know that the Liberal government has not always kept its word on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, this is very frustrating. We can see that the surplus for the current year, ending March 31, 2004, will probably be in excess of $7 billion. The former finance minister, who is now the Prime Minister, deliberately underestimated the surplus year after year, and the new Minister of Finance is doing the same thing. On March 31, 2004, at a time when a number of provinces will be in situations  where they cannot avoid a deficit, where they will be looking for money to spend on health care, the federal government will have $7 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a government that acts as if it were a corporation. It is trying to have the largest profits possible, but it is the only stockholder. I think that the results are not what our society wants. It is true that the government must be well managed, but the bottom line is that, if the surpluses piling up do not make it possible to provide adequate services, there is no sense to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Quebec's finance minister was unable to refrain from saying so in the consultations he is holding on his own budget. It is frustrating to hear from farmers and people in social housing or other sectors in committee and see that the Quebec government does not have the money it needs to meet their needs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec and the provinces shoulder the responsibilities, and they do not have the means to obtain the money. The federal government is not responsible for front-line services in health, education, social housing nor a number of other things such as the current mad cow crisis. The federal government has not listened carefully, or it would have provided adequate funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of this bill, we agree with the clause to invest $2 billion, as long as it is understood that this is insufficient. Additional funds are needed, and the federal government has the money. However, equalization, as it exists currently, is not sufficient for Quebec's needs and should be reviewed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment would have been a good idea. It would be appropriate. The $2 billion for health referred to in the bill should be made a recurring item. In the Bloc's opinion, such an amendment would improve the bill, make it more acceptable and ensure our support for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this were a recurring item, funding would be more secure and dependable. As a result, the provinces would have a guarantee that they will not have to rely on the government's good will from one year to the next. It would be recognition that this threshold must be integrated into the health transfer payments. It would be good to have this in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ask that the bill be split so that these two distinct issues can be considered separately. This will be done in committee. We will likely move an amendment to make the $2 billion a recurring item.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That way, there would be two bills coming back to the House, one which would ensure that the $2 billion is paid to the provinces on a recurring basis  and  the other, which we will not support as it stands, to renew the equalization payment agreements. </p>


	<A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this part, an additional effort needs to be made over the weeks and months to come.   It does not look very professional, in a country like this one, which claims to be a leader in public administration, to be living from hand to mouth.  Next month, the provinces will be having to define what sort of budgets they will have for the coming year, and to make five year plans as well.  Yet they do not know what they will be receiving from the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have memories of episodes in the past when the Government of Quebec, no matter what party was in power, learned in February that it would be $200 million or $300 million under, or $500 million over.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to terrible frustrations.  When one learns that there was $500 million more that could have been spent in the previous year, on health for example, one sees a number of needs that could have been met.  It would have been put to use if one had known it would be there to use, and people would have been pleased.  Worse yet is the situation when amounts are taken away. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the part about equalization, it is estimated that a one year extension of the current formula would represent a net loss for Quebec. Consequently, we cannot support this legislative measure that would cause Quebec to suffer. Let us hope our suggestion to split the bill does not fall on deaf ears.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect more specifically to the equalization issue, the current formula is extremely flawed. It must be changed as soon as possible. We have been defending this point of view for some time now and we hope the government will listen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula penalizes Quebec, gives the advantage to the federal government and accentuates the fiscal imbalance that has been established and recognized by a  commission in Quebec. This commission is considered to be very reputable. It was chaired by Quebec's current finance minister, Mr. Séguin, who, in his current role, has noticed that what he saw in his task force he now sees on a daily basis in his responsibilities as finance minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the government has not budged in this area. This would have been a good opportunity for the current government to stand out, but, as in other sectors, it is hard to see the difference between the practices of Mr. Chrétien and the new Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has changed on the equalization issue. The new finance minister flat out rejected the formula proposed by the provinces, and now we are faced with a no man's land. We do not know what exactly will happen. No solid proposals have been made. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois is calling on the federal government to come back to the table with the provinces as quickly as possible in order to enter into a satisfactory agreement on equalization that would meet the provinces' needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the new Prime Minister is serious about wanting to be more open toward Quebec and the provinces, he has a good opportunity to prove it by quickly negotiating in good faith so that the provinces will have the information they need to prepare their next budgets and plan for the next five years. That is what we would expect from a responsible federal government  looking to implement a practice that is different from the one that existed under the former government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new administration is currently using the exact same practices the former administration used, and the provinces still have to beg for the money they need, money that taxpayers have paid in taxes, in a very complicated process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government collects taxes, much more than it needs, and gives a certain amount back to the provinces through the equalization program, but it controls everything. It can decide whether or not it will open the tap, depending on all sorts of conditions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We witnessed that in the past. When provincial governments are not of the same political stripe as the federal government, the latter turns off the tap just in time. This means that the provincial government does not have the money to table a responsible budget and voters make that government pay the price, when in fact the one that is responsible for this situation is the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Minister of Finance said that the next real  formula would be retroactive to April 1, 2004, so that, in the end, no one would lose.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this point, this is still only a promise. There is no guarantee in the bill that the government will live up to that commitment. We do not know when the negotiation will conclude. In the meantime, the provinces have a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads, and this is why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the bill in its current form. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $2 billion health transfer must be paid as quickly as possible and this must become a recurring payment.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still a lot of work to do as regards equalization. Before we give our support to an equalization formula, we want to make sure that it will benefit Quebec. </p>

Mauril Bélanger (Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be brief, but I wanted to make some comments about what we just heard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During question period, the finance minister indicated that he will be meeting his counterparts as early as next weekend to try to reach an agreement on equalization. He did not promise that an agreement would be reached, but he did not say either that it would not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to give the provincial and territorial finance ministers as well as our own finance minister time to try to reach a new agreement to set up a new equalization scheme and hopefully meet everyone's expectations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a new agreement cannot be reached before the end of March, that is at the end of the current fiscal year, we would find ourselves in a situation where the current program would expire. The bill before the House would extend the equalization program for an additional fiscal year, under the same terms and conditions, so that we can continue operating without any problem. However, should an agreement be reached, it could be retroactive to the beginning of the 2004-05 fiscal year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see why some people are against this bill, since we have said that we are willing to talk with the provincial governments, with our finance minister's counterparts, to determine if an agreement is possible. There is no other way about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not want the equalization payments to stop, then we need some kind of interim measure. This is what we are proposing, all the while hoping that a new five-year equalization agreement can be reached so that provinces can more adequately plan their operations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why there is so much opposition to a bill that is so badly needed and would not hurt anyone.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-809882"></A><a HREF="#Int-809898"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-809878"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will start by responding to what I have just heard. This is a very strange way to view things, in asking the provinces to sign an agreement before they can even negotiate it. It is like asking workers not to strike and to sign a collective agreement, in hopes they will agree with the employer. If an agreement with the provinces is to be reached, it must be done before the expiry date and there must be negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References have been made, for example, to the $2 billion for health. How long have we heard about this? Mr. Chrétien promised this amount, for part of last year, and this promise is being repeated. They say that to invest $2 billion in health, the equalization agreement  has to be renewed for another year. This is false.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois is asking that the federal government fulfill its obligations and give the $2 billion for health care. The bill can be split with regard to this issue. We are asking that this $2 billion be made a recurring item. It makes no sense to try to administer a province without ever knowing what will happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Quebec, like the other provinces, is responsible for health, education and municipal affairs. It needs to know what funds it will receive. A new equalization agreement must be signed before the old one expires, so that we know what will happen under the next agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if one law says it can be renewed for one or five years, this puts the provinces in a tight spot. They agree to what the government wants, or else the current system is renewed. This is not a logical way to work. Our system is one in which the federal government must give money to the provinces; therefore, both parties must agree.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the House hardly sat. Nothing was accomplished. Now, the bills we should have considered last fall are being reinstated one by one. Due to internal problems in the ruling party, the House did not sit. Now, the government wants to reinstate everything at the last minute, no matter what may happen to those suffering from its incompetency, as the provinces are suffering with regard to equalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request of the Bloc Quebecois is quite logical. This $2 billion for health was promised a long time ago. Please, give us the money. We can split the bill. We all agree, everyone agrees with that part of the bill, and we would even want it to be a recurring item. It is quite a significant amount.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, during the whole summer and autumn, we were told that the government was not sure it would have enough money to hand out this $2 billion. The government wanted us to believe that it was almost in a tough financial situation, but we now realize that there will be a $7 billion surplus. All this goes to show how hypocritical they can be. Why can they not tell the  truth for once?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking for the truth not only about the sponsorship scandal, but also about what is happening with equalization. I agree with what our critic said on this issue. We do not sign blank cheques. We want the bill to be split and we want to get the money for health that is owed to us under the equalization program, and we want it to become a recurrent item. We would support that part. However, let us go to the negotiation table as soon as possible. Let us not put a knife to the throats of the provinces and coerce them into signing a deal that would be similar to the current one. If we go about it this way, the provinces would not be pleased and would feel once again that they have been had.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat for nine years at the National Assembly of Quebec and I know the administration problems the provinces have when they do not know what transfers they can expect. The amounts owed to the provinces do not belong to the federal government, but rather to the provinces and are needed to help them discharge their obligations.</p>


	<A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not logical to feel that one is at the mercy of the federal government and that they always arrange things so one is at a disadvantage in negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore totally in agreement with the Bloc Quebecois position on this and am convinced this position is shared by all the provinces, Quebec in particular of course, because we have heard that Mr. Séguin is calling for the same thing we have been saying here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find deplorable about this government is the lack of justice in its legislation or in the way that legislation is applied.  Someone this afternoon referred to equalization payments as they are seen by the Liberal Party over there.  Among other things, it is the money involved in the sponsorship scandals which finds its way to the party's campaign funds without anyone being responsible.  They saw nothing, yet half a billion dollars changed hands, and one hundred million of that half billion changed hands in an indirect manner.  A strange kind of transfer payment, that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite people to look into the contributions to the Parti Quebecois  and the Bloc Quebecois.  These are public and bear no resemblance whatsoever to the contributions to the Liberal Party.  I know that because I have worked in Quebec, as I said, and have had to work within the stringent rules of Quebec's legislation and we had moral standards, unlike the federal public service and the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, for instance, scandalous  to see that seniors are being deprived of money, as are the unemployed.  Only 39% of those currently out of work can collect employment insurance.  Their fund has been taken over.  That is another transfer payment in favour of the federal government.  They helped themselves to $45 billion from the EI fund, money that belonged to workers.  Not one red cent of it belongs to the government.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to hear anyone try to tell me that it is the same thing in Quebec.  That is not true.  The Government of Quebec has had some things to answer for, but never a scandal such as the one we have here.  There are even some people on that side who are so scandalized that they dare not speak.  Someone has said  it is totally beyond him.  What is really beyond me is that it is difficult, if not downright impossible, to get at the truth. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a word I would like to use, but it would be unparliamentary. Therefore I will not use it. Another word that should be considered unparliamentary is the word truth. We have very little opportunity to hear that word. What is happening defies logic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we are constantly before a government that takes every  opportunity to help its friends and then shirks responsibility if a problem arises, make no sense. They are the only ones who had not heard about what was going on, while in our ridings, everyone had. Agency representatives in my riding were shocked at what they had to do in order to get a sponsorship. It is quite unbelievable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, we are talking about equalization. I know  I have somewhat belaboured the point, but we can all agree that this equalization formula is unacceptable. With respect to the current agreement, I think it would be logical to meet with the provinces to negotiate as soon as possible in order to resolve this problem. Legislation could be passed after the negotiations, not before. The provinces should not have to renew the former agreement for another year or another five years because the government says so.</p>

Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to comment on the remarks by the Bloc member who has just spoken. He made the point that certain things were scandalous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an interesting statement from a member who sat in the National Assembly for nine years as a member of the  Parti Quebecois; he is a member of a party that wants to divide a great county like Canada. We are talking about equalization between the federal and provincial governments. We know he was a member of a party that never wanted to share its money with the big cities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Oh, Oh.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague:</b> Even though I am a member from Ontario, I understand very well that the Bloc Quebecois and its friends have always had problems in years past. They have always had problems. Yes, I touched a raw nerve there. They do not like to hear about certain things. Yet, hypocrisy is not something that happens on only one side of the House. How easily the PQ and the BQ forget that the provincial government's record shows that Quebec's cities were ignored.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I think it is a bit sad, perhaps, but quite unreasonable for them to take this position here—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Even to amalgamate them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dan McTeague:</b> Even for the question of amalgamation. We know very well why the people, our friends in Quebec, got rid of their government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the position being taken, we must be reasonable. The position taken by the government is to find ways to ensure that the money goes to benefit everyone in the country, whether they are in Ontario, Quebec, or the Maritimes. This money has to come back in order to sort out the troubling things we are finding at present, that is ensuring that there is enough money to meet commitments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not do as the Bloc Quebecois wishes and create divisions. That is their philosophy: to create rifts between the other provinces and cities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I find what the hon. member about seniors and the least well-off interesting. I was the vice-chair of one of the committees examining this question. Their party was opposed to changes in the pharmaceutical patent regulations that could have lightened the financial burden on veterans and retired people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the people who must use these medications, the Bloc protects the industry rather than the interests of seniors, people who have fought for our country and who  built a country that the Bloc should be ashamed of trying to destroy.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to speak in this debate on Bill C-18 and the side issues. It is an act respecting equalization and authorizing the Minister of Finance to make certain payments related to health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My good friend opposite was letting off steam and having fun. However, I think the true hypocrisy is on that side of the House across from us.  A bill like this one smells of an election. Every time an election is on the horizon, the government always manages to put forward a bill that opposition parties are often forced to vote against. There is always something in the bill that does not make sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the government could very well have paid out  the $2 billion for health. If a bill were needed for that, to say that this sum should be put into a trust, as clause 6 suggests, a simple bill with very little in it would have sufficed for paying out the $2 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals will be able to travel across the country, and particularly in Quebec, during the election campaign and say, “The Bloc Quebecois voted against the bill that provided $2 billion for health”. Nonsense. We are opposed  to the fact that, over a period of five years, this government did not manage to negotiate equalization. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the government chief whip and deputy House leader told us that the Minister of Finance had made a promise. When we see that ministers opposite have no memory, we cannot really trust their promises. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see in the bill, under clause 3, that payments are extended to March 31, 2005, without any mention of this retroactivity to April 1, 2004, we do not believe the Minister of Finance; we no longer believe this government. It has fooled us too often in recent days. We can no longer trust it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, a proper amendment must be included in a clause to point out that the new equalization formula will be retroactive to April 1, 2004. We cannot take any risk. If there is no retroactivity, Quebec, among others, will lose $1.5 billion. We cannot run that risk. If this formula is going to be retroactive, then let us put it in writing in the legislation. It does not cost much to include these things. Why not do it? We cannot put our trust in a promise. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important, as the hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques pointed out, is to split the bill in two. Let us vote on the amount of $2 billion. Everyone here agrees with it. Then, the government should propose the equalization formula with an important   amendment, namely the guarantee that the formula will be retroactive to April 1, 2004. If we do not have that guarantee, logic tells us to vote against this legislation. It is simple. The Liberals think they are doing fine with their majority, but they only have the  support of 38% of the voters. Incidentally, I am curious to see the next poll.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that many Canadians are proud to be Liberals today. I am not sure at all. They will have trouble finding candidates to run against us in Quebec. More and more people are hiding the fact that they are Liberals. It is a shame to have a government that would not stand for taxpayers, but would rather look out for itself, its own party, its friends and its growing bank accounts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this bill is only a parody of democracy that would have us believe that the government is generous. However, in the last five years, the former finance minister who is now Prime Minister could not reach an agreement with his provincial counterparts about an equalization program criticized by all of the provinces. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only Quebec but all of the provinces that are criticizing the equalization program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief whip told us that we would come to an agreement before March 31, 2004. Who does he think we are? Take a good look at me, I am no dummy. What they are doing does not make any sense. They could not come to an agreement in the last five years, but they are now sure they can make a deal within a month. It does not make any sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government to seriously reconsider the issue. And if the Prime Minister is really serious about a new approach to governance, a new way of doing things, he should stop acting like the previous government did and he should be more transparent and tell us exactly how things stand.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I am going to be as eloquent as my colleague was, but I will try to express my point of view, which is very similar to that of all my colleagues here in this House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we have been in politics long enough and we have seen enough bills before this House to realize that this bill deals with two totally unrelated issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague mentioned, if we have to pass a specific bill to put these $2 billion for health in a trust, then let us do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, the government is tricking us by rolling two bills into one.  It is trying to get us to swallow this when it knows perfectly well that we will not go for it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree about the $2 billion. All the members would vote in favour of a bill dealing exclusively with this issue. There would be no problem; it would pass  in a flash.  The members opposite know that, and this is why they are trying to get us to swallow another equalization bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague already said, we cannot accept that. We cannot accept this bill as is. We want it split and sent back to committee. Once it is split, we will be able to consider the first part and deal with the issue of the $2 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about these $2 billion for a year. Right now, people in hospitals are waiting, emergency rooms are clogged, it is just crazy.  In my community, Saint-Jérôme, ER patients have to be sent to other hospitals because  of the overload.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send us the $2 billion and stop toying with us. It is just ridiculous. The time is now. We need that money and we know what to do with it. Do not worry, when it gets into the provinces' pockets, whatever government they have in place, the money will go directly to health care, directly to the people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government waiting for to give them the money? It is toying with us again. How long will it take to pass this bill? It is just making things more complicated.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my colleague talked about retroactivity, she was entirely correct. This is not in the bill. Will it be agreed to in committee? If not, obviously we will vote against this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is not true that negotiations will take one month because the parties have been trying to reach an agreement for five years. Not one province considers the equalization formula, in its current state, to be fair and equitable. Consequently, we are told, “We are going to propose this just in case”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an election bill because we are headed for an election. So, they are taking advantage of the situation to delay things for one year, without any retroactivity. This is dishonest for the public and the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> It is misrepresentation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Monique Guay:</b> It is misrepresentation and such behaviour is unacceptable. We are told that it will be our fault if this bill is not passed. The $2 billion is being held over our heads like the sword of Damocles. It is totally illogical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For once, the government could have acted quickly and clearly. There are people who need the money the government collects from provincial taxpayers.  We need only look around today to see that people are getting poorer. Only 39% of workers have access to employment insurance. What about the rest? Where do they go? They get social assistance. We know just how poor people on social assistance are. It is hell.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the problem is offloaded on the provinces. If we do not have equalization to help us, to help those people get back on their feet and go back to work, to create jobs and pay taxes that benefit the government, then this problem will continue. That is why we need equalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should start to manage its affairs properly, to work harder, put an end to the scandals and clean house. It must clean house. It is unbelievable; I have never seen anything like this before. It is shocking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding office, the telephone never stops ringing. People simply cannot believe what is going on here.</p>


	<A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not very good for politicians, whatever party they belong to, to see how money was handed out right and left to someone's buddies. It is not right and it must stop. And let no one tell me that the Prime Minister did not know. I absolutely do not believe that and I can say that the voters of Laurentides do not believe it either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them put their house in order. When they have the chance to do something good, let them do it and do it right away. They should stop telling us that they are going to put things together and mix things up so that, later, they can say that we voted against the $2 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voters of Quebec are very pragmatic and they will realize why, if this bill is not divided, we will oppose it. They will understand that equalization negotiations must be retroactive for Quebec. We cannot afford to lose this money; we need it. We administer most of the programs, not the federal government. We need that money. This must be in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, I hope that amendments will be made in committee. I hope that, for once, the government will accept amendments that are logical and reasonable, and that we will finally be able to vote in favour of a sensible bill. But as it stands now, it is clear we cannot support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that I also wish the bill could be  divided, so that the $2 billion can quickly be put to a vote and sent to the provinces to help us fix our problems in health care. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to indicate that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from Skeena. As I understand it, it will be the standard procedure, where we have 10 minutes of remarks followed by five minutes for questions and comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is appreciated, certainly by the official opposition, the Conservative Party of Canada, that we have this opportunity to bring the House up to speed on the situation in our own ridings, and to present the case for some immediate action above and beyond what little the government has done on this file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members that the situation in all of Canada, certainly in western Canada with which I am most familiar, is grave. That goes for Prince George--Peace River, a prominent cattle country part of Canada. In the Peace River region, on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, we have a large grain and livestock producing region.   Likewise, in and around the Prince George area, and down in the McBride area that will be added to my riding under boundary redistribution, there are a lot of cattle farmers and cattle producers of both cow and calf, and feedlot operators. The situation has reached or passed crisis proportions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have family businesses that in some cases have been in business for two or three generations.  They are virtually on the verge of losing all their equity and going out of business. It is that serious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members that the average Canadian out there needs to understand the seriousness of this issue. This is not a case of the member of Parliament for Prince George--Peace River standing here and crying wolf. This is serious business and I want to make that abundantly clear today. When we have a situation where individuals have struggled not for one lifetime but in some cases for two or three lifetimes to build up a business, and they are on the verge of losing it through no fault of their own, it should send a chill up our spines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a case where somebody made a bad business decision. This is not a case where they overextended themselves or they wanted to take  a holiday and go to Hawaii rather than reinvesting their money. These people have their backs to the wall, and I would argue that the government, while recognizing it in rhetoric, has done precious little to alleviate their pain in order that they may be in a position to pay their bills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are proud people. When we look at the history of the nation, cattle producers have very seldom come looking for assistance from government. They are independent people.  But my God, their backs are up against the wall this time. They have had to come and say that they need some help to get over this hump, and if we want a cattle industry in Canada, they need some help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members of the outrage in Prince George--Peace River over the last number of days, when it became clear that  $250 million had been blown out the window with this sponsorship program at the same time that people were losing their farms, their ranches and their feedlots.  There is a growing anger across this land, and I hope the government is listening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed since last Wednesday? What have we heard from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food? What have we heard from the new Prime Minister? What have we heard from the government that would indicate a ray of hope for the cattle industry in Canada since our take note debate held last Wednesday night, participated in by members of Parliament from all parties including government members who spoke very eloquently and passionately about the plight of farmers in their ridings, as well as they should?</p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what party we represent in the House, first and foremost I would argue that we represent real people in real situations, whether we are from the back country of Ontario or northern British Columbia where I come from.  These are real people with real problems and they are suffering right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed since our take note debate? Has there been any ray of hope? I would argue, no. I have not seen anything. No one  follows the news closer than members of Parliament. Every day we get news clippings and we scan them to see what is happening, not only here in Ottawa but across the land so that we are kept up to speed about what is happening in our regions, our provinces and in the country as a whole. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not seen anything coming from the government from last Wednesday that would indicate to the people in my riding or elsewhere that there is a ray of hope or that we are going to turn a corner with this crisis. That has to be extremely depressing and troubling for these farmers and ranchers as they struggle with this crisis day-to-day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just one or two individuals.  It is families and in many cases, young families. I cannot imagine what it is like for those young children to come home to the farm or ranch right now and see the look of anguish on the faces of their parents as they struggle with what they must believe is hopelessness. They are looking for a little bit of hope from the government and they are not getting it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite their best efforts, farmers are now facing an added catastrophe. They are running out of feed for their animals because their business was not built upon having these animals feed all winter long. Anybody who understands the first thing about animals and about agriculture and farming knows that in cold weather an animal eats a lot of feed to maintain its body heat to keep it sustained when it is outside in minus 20° to minus 30° weather. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these farmers have had a real struggle to get good quality feed for the winter and now they find that the animals that would have gone to market are still on the farm because they are virtually worthless.   Farmers have to scrounge up the feed. It must seem to them that they are pouring this money down a bottomless pit with no hope on the horizon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all understand what is necessary. It is necessary for the government to make the admission here and now that the program it has put in place is a great disappointment. It is a failure. The government must recognize that. The money is not getting through to the people who need it. Farmers have not seen any increase in their income so that they can sustain their operations for the short term to hopefully get over this hump. We need an immediate cash infusion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that last Wednesday night from all parties, including the governing party and I certainly hear it all across the land. I implore the government to revisit this issue and find the money to support our cattle producers instead of putting it into sponsorship programs.</p>

Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to ask a question of the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River. He speaks for all of us in the House in terms of the seriousness that he attaches to this issue.  He has properly and appropriately described the conditions that many people who are proud, strong and supportive Canadians find themselves in through no fault of their own with eloquence and forcefulness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has delved into other areas, but I will not deal with those.   However, I want to ask the hon. member if in his opinion there might be a way of addressing a formula that might help these farmers? And I say so with all candour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have a riding with a lot of beef producers, but I would like to ask the hon. member,  is it possible for us to do something more as far as it relates to the price that farmers are now forced to get for their cattle and of course the prices that are charged in the stores? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many consumers in my riding are still amazed that the money they are spending on beef is not getting back into the hands of the people who so desperately need it as we speak. Could the hon. member provide the House some insights in terms of his understanding of this issue in order to help a very difficult situation notwithstanding?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made my colleague across the way.  As he says, he does not represent a riding that has cattle producers, cattle farmers and ranchers in it, but he recognizes that he represents a lot of people who I am sure eat beef.  That is why it is as important to him as it is to his constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start out my response by paying tribute to Canadian consumers.  By God, they really dug deep and tried to do what was right in this crisis. Canadian consumers from coast to coast looked at this situation and at least partially recognized the seriousness of it, even though they might not have lived on farms themselves or might not have understood it.  They understood that it was serious enough that they wanted to do something, as the hon. member stated.  What we saw was a fairly dramatic increase in the consumption of beef in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as he has stated, which is accurate, it has not related to either a drop in the consumer cost to encourage even greater consumption to use up more beef or a return to the farmer.  Whatever beef consumption went up, all that happened was the middle people, the packers and the supermarkets, said that there was no need to put the price down to encourage more consumption because it was supply and demand and as long as people were buying lots of beef, they would keep the price up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it filter through to the farmer?  No.  Quite the opposite has happened.  The price has continued to slide to the point where, as I said earlier in my remarks, cows are practically worthless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our very serious concern is that any program or money put in place has to go directly to the farmers, whether it is in the form of paying them to cull their cattle or whatever.  It cannot go to the middle people.  Also it has to offset to a large extent the fact that the cow is now worthless.  If it does go to the middle people, the price that the packing plants or the feedlots will to pay the farmer will be correspondingly lower because they know the farmer is getting some assistance from the taxpayers and the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the dilemma and irony of the situation.  Consumers tried their best to help out farmers by increasing consumption, but it is not filtered through to the farmers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what my honourable colleague had to say, and I would like to ask him a question about the impact of this crisis on the next generation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I visited the Institut de technologie agricole, in La Pocatière, along with the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. We met with about 15 students, interested in various areas of the farm industry. We listened to their needs and asked them what the future holds for them in agriculture. They kept asking us what exactly the federal government intends to do to reduce their incredibly high debt load to a more reasonable level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dairy farmers, whose extra income from cull cows often represents 20 to 25% of their total farm income, told us, “What we are losing now is what used to pay my own wages, or what used to be my father's wages”. What can we expect?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With another $7 billion surplus this year, should the federal government not put into place a more humane approach to prevent people from moving away from the farm? People who have lived all their lives on the farm are now losing their savings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the federal government not take more drastic measures? Should it not set up a new program to provide assistance to beef producers and milk producers for whom this is an important source of income?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we not expect some kind of financial assistance from the federal government first to deal with this problem and then to promote economic renewal?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yes, as I noted in my remarks, I think there is general agreement on both sides of the House.  I do not know why there has been continued inaction on this file on the part of the government when many of its own members have expressed the same empathy for the producers and the same concern for their constituents as we have on this side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to me, in listening to the  take note debate last Wednesday evening, that there was virtual unanimity in the chamber on the need for an immediate cash infusion  to sustain the backbone of our beef industry in Canada.  Therefore, yes, there is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what effect this has.  I think all of us recognize that there is a growing average age of farmers in Canada.  Farmers are getting older and older because less and less young people are farming, and it is because of situations like this.  They do not see any hope.  Why would young people stay on a farm trying to eke an existence basically on the equity that their fathers and grandfathers have been able to build up when there does not appear to be a very bright future for farmers in Canada.  Part of that I would blame on the government across the way.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the hon. member. I know that we only have a few minutes here, but I have had a chance to speak to the member from the Bloc.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that there was a concern raised by some of us here, and that was in part the question of the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. Is it possible, short of the cash issue which the producers are facing right now, that we also encourage in the House a sixth person complaint to the Competition Bureau?  I am not sure of the mechanism with which to do it.   I understand from the member from the Bloc that the Competition Bureau refused this, but it seems to me this is the second time it  has happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is earth shattering.  I think there is a certain amount of concern about concentration at the retail level, particularly as it relates to groceries.  Part of the problem that is  exacerbating the situation for our good farmers is what is happening beyond the farm gate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if it might be possible for the member to discuss with his members on the industry committee about giving strong consideration to perhaps a section 9  complaint under the Competition Act to ensure that at least something is being done while a decision to help and to compensate is being considered.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that the mandate of the Competition Bureau would have to be redrawn, because as it has said that there is nothing in its present mandate that prevents any company from making an exorbitant profit. Just because these companies do not see fit to lower the price because consumption has actually gone up, there is nothing  the Competition Bureau can do. I think that will  have to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would make quickly on this is that anything like that will not help in the short term. It might solve the problem if we were to, God forbid, end up in a situation like this in the future to redraw some of that type of legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to re-emphasize this as my last statement today.  The fact is  farmers need the help now. They needed it yesterday, not tomorrow and not today. It is crisis time.</p>

	I would like to make a correction concerning the mistake that was made twice earlier today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to resume the take note debate that we had last week on mad cow disease, the proper procedure would be to have a 10 minute speech, followed by a 10 minute period for questions and comments. This is what I just did with the last hon. member who spoke.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-809962"></A><a HREF="#Int-809965"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-809961"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise during this take note debate. I received a number of calls from producers in my region who are understandably very concerned about the situation, and who find the way things are going to be somewhat unfair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment that one case of mad cow disease was discovered, the American border was closed. The border was going to reopen, but a second case was discovered. Immediately, and without any evidence, the Americans claimed that the cow was from Canada. Unfortunately, once the evidence was in, it was confirmed that the second cow also came from Canada. Consequently, the border, which was to reopen in January, has remained closed.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time we took a serious look at the impact of this mad cow situation on us. It is unacceptable that in Canada, whose area is so vast that it could  include 10, 12 or 13 sovereign countries, people in the east are affected by what is going on in the west or, conversely, that people in the west are affected by what is going on in the east. We should have greater autonomy.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is surprising is that when chickens are slaughtered in the southeastern United States, the border is not completely closed to American chickens. Chickens from the west continue to be shipped. But if the situation were reversed, I wonder if we would have permission to export our chickens. For example, if chickens were slaughtered due to bird flu, for example, in Ontario. Probably, the entire border would be closed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What producers want, at least those in my region who talked to me, is for us to find a way to restore public confidence, confidence in exports and of importing countries. How can we do this?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe has decided to test all animals slaughtered. It would be an extremely costly measure if we decided, tomorrow morning, to test all animals slaughtered in Canada. We have decided to randomly test 30,000. This measure seems insufficient to restore the confidence of importing countries in our production.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible, using DNA testing,  to identify pork sold on supermarket shelves and verify if that animal could have a problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec has a tracking system too but the Canadian government is not really interested in what Quebec is doing. I used to be my party's agriculture critic. I sat on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and each time I talked to producers, they said, “If only Canada would adopt some of the same agricultural practices as Quebec”.   Obviously not all its practices, but some; Quebec does things differently than Canada, and this is quite an advantage in light of what is happening in the rest of the country.</p>


	<A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is a Quebec solution, people will say that it is not good for Canada.  What they are trying to do instead is to bring Quebec in line with Canada, but rather they ought to be allowing us our specificity, and making the policies in use in Quebec, which are avant-garde, efficient and productive, a model for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That way we could continue to cross-pollinate our ideas, so as to improve the situation in agriculture, rather than spend all of our time and energy battling a government that wants to prevent us from doing things our way and to impose its made-in-Canada approach to agriculture on us, without realizing that it may not necessarily suit us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is unfortunate is that, in my opinion, over the 10 years I have been here, we have never managed to find an agriculture minister who appeared to have an understanding of what was going on in Canadian agriculture.  Odd, that.  Yet one of them was even a farmer himself.  The one in the portfolio now comes from a farming region.  Strangely, one might think that they lose any ability to understand agriculture as soon as they become minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person does not have to be a genius to realize that agriculture is different in Saskatchewan, in Alberta, Manitoba, B.C., Quebec and Ontario.  Our climates differ.  Our snowfalls differ.  Our rainfalls differ.  Our dry spells differ.  Our exposure to the sun differs, because the earth is round, so we do not all get our sunlight at the same angle.  They appear to doubt that.  We are not all at the same angle to the sun all the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there cannot be one wall-to-wall agricultural policy.  It has to be adapted to each province.  If one province works well in one area, the others should be ask to adopt that approach. They will be encouraged to use the same method. The government needs to decentralize agriculture more, instead of trying to have a one-size-fits-all approach,  and to think that agriculture is the route to Canadian unity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not how Canadian unity works.  “This little piggy went to market” has to be the way to productivity, not unity.   So if there are problems, we need to sit down and seek solutions together.   All the steps being taken now are nothing but stop-gap measures.  Here, we will give you $450 million, or $500 million or $200 million, and think the problem is solved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the way it works. We need the creativity to find solutions. We need to properly identify the problems, see where they are, and find solutions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the border with the United States is still closed. They have promised us better relations between Canada and the United States. It does not look as if things are working better between the Prime Minister and Mr. Bush, because nothing has changed on the mad cow issue. Nothing has changed on softwood lumber. Nothing has changed about any of the problems we have with the Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I hope that Ottawa will soon be in discussions with the provinces to decentralize things and to find sustainable solutions to economic issues, rather than thinking that this year they will hand over $200 million to solve the problem, and next year find another $200 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems are not solved by throwing millions of dollars at them. Producers must be able to live. Producers must be in a position to know that their efforts will be rewarded in the end, and that they will continue to be able to export their products abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a producer's domestic market collapses because there is a monopoly, for example, such as one slaughterhouse for all of Quebec, then let a second one be opened to encourage competition, if that is what it takes to increase the prices received by producers. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon. member a question about the current situation. Some of my constituents have told me, for instance, that at 58 or 59 years of age, they are now at the end of their working life and thinking about retiring. Their farm, assessed at $1 million at one point in time, is now almost worthless. This is a financial emergency. In Quebec, as my hon. colleague knows, desperate people have killed themselves because of their financial problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While medium--and long-term solutions are being considered, would my hon. colleague not agree with me that the government should act now to try to help those who, at least for now, and let us hope for not too long, have lost hope, because this crisis has cost them too much and they cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel? Does the hon. member not think that we could quickly find some money to assist these people at such a terrible time in their lives?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems clear that there was an announcement that at the end of the fiscal year, the government would have a $7 billion surplus. We are talking about a lot of money--$7 billion is not peanuts. Some $2 billion was promised for health, which leaves $5 billion. The government still wants to keep a $3 billion cushion for unexpected problems such as SARS, floods and the mad cow crisis. The mad cow crisis was unexpected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we have to be able to find solutions for the short term, but we must also consider the medium and long terms. Always focusing on the short term means we will always be up against it. This is where the difficulties begin because people are not left with much hope. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was agriculture critic during the scrapie problem. This too was a catastrophe. Yet, we were under the impression that things were under control, perhaps because fewer people raise sheep than cattle and we have dairy  stock in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time farmers are facing huge difficulties. What they want is for the government to do whatever is necessary so that consumers regain confidence in their products and they can start exporting again as soon as possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that herds in Canada have not been fed  animal-based feed since 1997. It has been six years. So why could it not be agreed that cattle 30 months old or less could easily be exported? There is no risk whatsoever that these animals could have been contaminated. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the necessary effort is not being made to help restore confidence. The borders are closed, so we do nothing. If others closed their borders to us, we should do the same to them. I do not see why we should continue to be so generous with others if they cannot be generous with us.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, we must obviously find money to help people, to prevent bankruptcies, to  avoid a situation where young people would be unable to take over from those who have reached the age of retirement. Indeed, as my colleague pointed out, I know people who do not have much in front of them right now because they receive about 6¢ a pound for their cull cows. My colleague from the  Conservative Party of Canada mentioned that prices have not gone down at the supermarket, but that has not given anything more to producers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something wrong that should be fixed to the satisfaction of producers. I think that everyone of us here is aware of the fact that, when the day comes that we have to import everything because farmers here are  longer be able to produce, it will be too late to wake up.</p>

Even though we have a very complex legislative schedule with a lot of debate and reports that have to be communicated in Parliament, we can take time out when there is a national issue such as this one and work on it with all parties. I think all parties are providing helpful solutions and part of my comments will show that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member made a very good point.  She mentioned that it is very important to have a qualified minister of agriculture.  It is serendipity that just before this crisis came up the Prime Minister appointed one of the most--if not the most--knowledgeable people in the House, with experience in working with other people.  He was the chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.  He had just finished consulting across the country on the Prime Minister's task force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member opposite made the point that nothing has changed nor is there success in the relationship between the President of the U.S. and the Prime Minister. However, that is not accurate.  We know that when the Prime Minister took over, right away there was a change in the contracts available to Canadians in Iraq.  I was surprised myself that we were that successful.  I do not think I would have been bold enough to push for that.  This was a great victory for Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third comment I wanted to make was on the initiative that the minister, along with the members for Tobique—Mactaquac and Medicine Hat, took by going to Asia to meet, first of all, with Japan and Korea, because their acceptance of our beef is part of our problem with the United States, our biggest consumer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members went there and worked together.  They talked about how the international review panel had reported on Canada.  The Japanese gave us some ideas on what we could do to help get our beef back into Japan, which was very helpful. Then they went on to the United States, our biggest customer, of course, and met with American and Mexican officials to help improve the situation.  All these efforts have certainly helped the situation.  This is all work in progress on a very difficult issue.</p>

The new riding boundaries that  presumably will be in place fairly shortly will take my riding inland another 150 miles which gets  into some fairly major cattle country in the Vanderhoof area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BSE issue is a big concern to me and it is  a big concern to people in my area. There is no question that action is needed but it has not been forthcoming from the government.  The people in my riding are urging the government to deal with this serious issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Monday I was in Houston, B.C. for the opening of Canford's new sawmill addition. It  will be the biggest sawmill in the world.  I realize I am a little off the topic but I will get to the point.  This sawmill will produce some 600 million board feet of lumber a year, enough to build some 30,000 homes.  As members can see, the forest industry is very important in northwestern B.C.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that session I spoke with the mayor of Smithers, Mr. Jim Davidson, who is a cattle rancher.   I had met with him previously and also with the Bulkley Valley cattle ranchers association. He impressed on me once again how serious this problem is.  As my colleague said earlier, family businesses that have been built up over several generations are on the verge of bankruptcy.  There does not appear to be any hope for them unless something changes very quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of cattle is basically at zero.  The equity that the banks were lending money on was basically on the value of cattle which were saleable at one point in time.  However  there is no value there anymore. The banks are walking away from these people. It is  creating huge problems in terms of people meeting their loan payments and so on.  There are huge costs  in terms of feeding the cattle over the winter. The cattle should have gone to the feedlots last fall.  People are facing an accumulation of problems and it is almost impossible for them to deal with them.   Without some hope, some help and some direction from the government, they will give up.  We cannot allow that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cattle  industry is important to my riding. It is important to British Columbia.  It is important to Canada. The cattle industry is worth some $35 billion.  It does not make any sense to let it collapse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government to date has done very little. People out there are  angry and  desperate.  There is no doubt  this will be reflected at some point in the near future.  There has been no change since the debate last Wednesday. All parties have agreed that this is a serious problem.  The minister needs to take action, not today, not tomorrow, but yesterday.  Action is not happening and we have to ask why on behalf of the cattle producers of Canada.   Why is there no positive action and  positive results? What do we do about this?  Obviously there are solutions  and we have to start addressing the problem sooner rather than later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to rebuild our relationships with the U.S. There are some problems in dealing with trade issues right now.  The softwood lumber issue  has been going on for a number of years and no end appears to be in sight.  Now there is  the BSE situation. There was one animal in Alberta and one in the U.S. which unfortunately came from Alberta. It is    a huge problem.</p>


	<A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two governments need to arrive at a  method that will  deal with these trade issues expeditiously.  They cannot continue dragging them out week after week, month after month, year after year.  The softwood lumber industry paid the  price and now our beef cattle producers are paying the price and they will not be able to pay it for too much longer.  We need  action on this right away.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  should be seen as a scientific issue.  We should be putting money into research and resources in the longer term to come up with a solution so this does not happen again, but we also need a short term solution so the industry can continue and survive.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian consumers have supported this industry.  I think we are consuming as much beef as we possibly can as a nation.  However  given the number of cattle in Canada we obviously cannot consume them all. We need to have access to the U.S. market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting point was raised just a little while ago.  Our Canadian army in Afghanistan is destroying thousands of kilograms of U.S. beef.  The Canadian army actually eats U.S. beef.  With our beef industry in the situation it is, regardless of how the army contracts or how it does its supply to the  troops, it seems very strange to me   that our troops overseas would  actually be eating U.S. beef. I just wanted to point out how ridiculous the government's position is and how it has not been useful  in resolving this problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian people are proud of the beef industry and they support it to the best of their ability.    Our government must  recognize that   support and pride and it must recognize    that our beef farmers need direct support. The support  does not need to go to some middle man where  the farmers do not  see it on their bottom line.  The bottom line is that  this industry must survive in Canada  and it is up to this government today to find  a solution.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  the people in my Ontario riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke  are also  in a desperate situation.  The president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture called me the other day saying that the auction barn was a very dismal place and that people were having to reach into their pockets to pay the commission fees because  after selling their animals there was no money left over. He said that people were at the point of having  to shoot their  cattle but that they had no place to bury them.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that my colleague's producers are in the same situation, I wonder if he could tell me what his producers are doing to get rid of the animals  they have had to shoot because they have no food left to feed  them. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-809988"></A><a HREF="#Int-809989"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-809986"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Burton: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, frankly, it is a huge problem.  There is a certain amount of local market for cull cows, and so on, that they have to get rid of.  One can  buy a whole beef pretty darn cheap right now anywhere in northern British Columbia, if not all across Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that is not the solution.  There are no slaughterhouses in my area so they cannot ship to a slaughterhouse to get rid of at least some of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that  there is no easy solution for our producers. Again, it just points out the need for the government to deal with this issue immediately.</p>
