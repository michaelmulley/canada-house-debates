	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
received numerous letters from constituents concerned about 
the upcoming budget and whether they can expect to be taxed on 
their RRSPs.
<P>
	These constituents believe that an understanding between 
government and Canadians has existed since the 1950s when 
RRSPs were first introduced. At that time the government 
rewarded Canadians who took responsibility for their own 
retirement by offering both an initial tax deduction as well as tax 
free accumulation.
<P>
	Since then thousands of Canadians have assumed 
responsibility for their own retirement by taking advantage of 
RRSPs. They have done so in part because of strains on the 
Canada pension plan and old age security and their need for 
greater income security during retirement.
<P>
	My constituents and I feel that any move on the part of the 
minister to change the ground rules by taxing RRSPs would be 
unfair and unwelcome. It is our sincere hope that the minister 
will listen to these concerns and not tax RRSPs.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
several months now, the written press has reported numerous 
delays in the processing of immigrant files. Ever since the 
previous government decided to concentrate its operations in 
Vegreville, Alberta, there has been one problem after another.
<P>
	All members of this House have been receiving legitimate 
complaints from their constituents with respect to Vegreville, 
but the minister does not seem particularly concerned about this 
administrative catastrophe. Furthermore, services are offered 
almost exclusively in English. Immigrants and visitors who 
have all the  documents required by the act thus find themselves 
in an illegal situation.
<P>
	When will the minister stop insisting that he wants to see his 
immigration policy rigorously applied, when his department is 
clearly no longer able to keep up with the routine requests of the 
immigrants it is there to serve?

Alberta.
<P>
	I would like to associate myself with the prayer in the petition 
which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas there is no proven connection between gun control legislation and a 
decrease in the occurrence of criminal activity;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas all handguns in Canada are required by law to be registered;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas crimes involving the use of firearms already carry severe 
penalties under the Criminal Code;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas criminals by definition feel no compulsion to abide by the law;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We the undersigned feel that implementing more restrictive firearms controls 
which will affect only law abiding citizens is an unjustifiable action and the 
proper course of action for responsible governments to follow is more effective 
prosecution and tougher sentencing of criminals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will be forwarding the petition to the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I have no problem with this

	Travelling across this vast country is always challenging, but 
to do so in renal failure and on peritoneal dialysis is truly 
unbelievable and a miracle in itself.
<P>
	Suzanne set out to promote organ donation awareness and to 
raise money for transplant research. However, she has also 
instilled in us a strong sense of hope and confidence in being 
able to overcome traditional physical obstacles and in meeting 
our expectations and aspirations. She has generated tremendous 
public support for organ donations. The impact has already been 
felt; Canadians have signed their organ cards and are discussing 
the idea of donating.

Suzanne and to this worthy endeavour. Please join me in

The week is sponsored by the Federal Business Development 
Bank in partnership with many local private and public sector 
organizations that promote entrepreneurship.
<P>
	It is no surprise to anyone in this House that small business is 
critical to the Canadian economy. Eight of ten new jobs in 
Canada come from the small business sector. It employs 4.2 
million Canadians and accounts for 37 per cent of the country's 
employment.
<P>
	This week throughout Ontario the FBDB will be giving a 
series of seminars and luncheons which will promote small 
business, educate participants and pay tribute to the men and 
women who make this province successful.

country who daily risk everything they have and in doing so 
create jobs and economic growth for Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the government is challenging the opposition to indicate where 
public spending could be cut. I would like to add a suggestion to 
the long list the Bloc Quebecois has already submitted over the 
past year. Yesterday, speaking before a committee, the president 
of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada 
denounced the federal government's negligence in the 
management of contracting out. He presented some pretty 
ludicrous examples to us, including the one about public 
servants who retire on a Friday with generous severance 
benefits, and are hired as consultants the following Monday.
<P>
	In order to remedy this situation, the Bloc Quebecois suggests 
that the government have a code governing contracting out, 
which would ensure transparency in the awarding of contracts 
and would introduce the right for public servants to denounce 
abuses. This is another suggestion to add to the list.
<P>
	Will the federal government finally decide to straighten up its 
expenditures?

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the people and governments of Israel and Jordan 
for today's signing of the comprehensive peace deal.
<P>
	For 47 years Israel and Jordan were divided by war but, to 
quote King Hussein, ``today the two countries will close a dark 
chapter and open a new book of light''. Since the Middle East 
process began several years ago, there have been many tough 
moments on all sides. I often wondered whether the obstacles to 
peace could ever be removed. Thanks to the commitment, 
dedication and courage of King Hussein, Prime Minister Rabin 
and many others, today's peace has been achieved.
<P>
	Now is the time for new friends to come together to learn 
about each other and forge new bonds. For the children of Israel 
and Jordan a new and bright future is emerging, a future where 
they will not fight each other but will work to build prosperity 
for the Middle East.

wishes, hearty congratulations and the promise of future 
friendship for all the people of that region.

men who own and operate small and medium sized enterprises 
are celebrating Small Business Week from October 23 to 29.

	This year's theme is Partnerships for Growth. The federal

businesses and truly become partners in breaking down the 
barriers.
<P>
	In Burlington small businesses like Roxanne Moffat's 
Hillcrest Florists are the backbone of our community and 
ultimately of our nation. They encourage healthy competition, 
provide great products and service and combine innovation with 
expertise.

	Ms. Moffat, head of our Business Women's Network and an 
active member of the Burlington Chamber of Commerce, is one 
of many Canadian women whose skill, imagination and 
determination have made them a success.

<P>
	Today with the future of rural Canada uncertain, the 
recognition of an organization dedicated to providing a quality 
life experience for rural youth has never been more necessary. 
However federal funding of 4-H remains uncertain.

beyond the end of the current fiscal year is troubling 4-H 
participants across Canada.
<P>

its support for rural youth. In recognition of the value of these 
young people to the future of Canada I encourage the Minister of

they have conjugal visits to relieve them of any deprivation they 
may have? So what if they receive free condoms acknowledging 
their habits?

paying taxes. They can vote if they are incarcerated for less than 
two years. If they have a bad day on the prison golf course at

are not true.
<P>
	Let me state what has taken place. We have offered to cost 
share a number of strategic initiatives with the province of 
Quebec. In August of this year we arrived at an agreement in 
principle and one that would be particularly appropriate for 
helping young people to get employed. An election ensued.
<P>
	I wrote to my counterpart after the election to suggest that we 
were prepared to move ahead. My deputy has written to his 
counterpart to say that all we want from the province of Quebec 
is for it to establish among six or seven projects what priority 
projects it has.
<P>
	As soon as Quebec is prepared to confirm with us what its 
priority projects are we will go ahead in a co-operative way and 
work with it. Because the strategic initiatives are part and parcel 
of an important element of the overall review of social policy, I 
am glad to hear that the Leader of the Opposition and the Quebec 
government now want to become part of that process.

has not yet accepted. Why does the minister refuse Quebec what 
he has allowed under other pilot projects which are being funded 
in New Brunswick and especially in Newfoundland?

	I want them to understand that we have written back to the 
Quebec government saying that as soon as it establishes clearly 
what its priorities are then we will sign an agreement and 
proceed with social review and with  strategic initiatives 
because they are part and parcel of the same thing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister reduces the question to a lack of 
understanding by the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, if anyone 
does not understand something in this House, it is the minister 
who does not understand Quebec's historic demands in the 
manpower field.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Speaking of this, how can the minister expect 
the present government of Quebec to accept his offers of 
administrative transfers in the manpower field, of sharing 
quarters for the same confusing mess in the same building, when 
this offer was rejected by the previous federalist government?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps one reason why 
there may be some confusion is because we have one party in the 
House on the opposite side which makes it its business to try and 
create confusion between Quebec and the rest of the country. 
That is part of the problem we face.
<P>
	When it comes to strategic initiatives we have said that as 
soon as the Quebec government replies to our request and 
specifically says what its priority projects are we will discuss 
them. We cannot fund all the projects because it would take all 
the money. We have to share with the rest of the country.
<P>
	As soon as the Quebec government indicates it is prepared to 
go ahead with the priorities that were presented by the previous 
government then we will sit down and negotiate with it.
<P>
	We understand and fully support the process. By developing 
these kinds of new, progressive and innovative approaches to the 
development of social programs, we can bring a much better 
system to all Canadians, including those in Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development. We learned 
from the SQDM, the Quebec labour development corporation, 
that the minister was aware of the duplication between his youth 
service project and Quebec's young volunteers program as early 
as the beginning of February, two months before he launched his 
program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7228"> 7228 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that federal and Quebec 
government officials tried without success to harmonize the 
two programs before the federal government decided to go 
ahead despite the resulting increase in duplication?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at noon hour I attended a 
very interesting event where a youth service project that serves 
both sides of the Outaouais area and a group of young people 
who were street kids had come together to start their own 
business in a recycling plant.
<P>
	As part of the testimony one young man said that he had been 
on the streets since he was 11 years old. Because of the youth 
services project he was now able to get a pay cheque. He was 
now able to plan to go to school. Much more important, he now 
believed in himself.
<P>
	I do not think that young man was concerned about 
jurisdictional turf wars. He was concerned about the 
Government of Canada which, in co-operation with the private 
sector and the local community, was giving him a new chance at 
life. That is what the program is all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
again for the Minister of Human Resources Development. Does 
the minister not admit that his attitude in the youth service 
matter clearly shows that he is trying to muzzle the Quebec 
government, when we know that federal officials offered 
Quebec a seat on the federal pilot project selection board 
provided that Quebec made a commitment not to criticize the 
Canadian youth service program publicly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the facts of the matter are 
this. We presented to the province of Quebec, as we did to all 
provinces, a proposal on a labour and manpower agreement that 
would offer wide responsibility to all provinces to help set 
planning priorities for federal human resource expenditures in 
each of the provinces.
<P>
	In the case of Quebec the count was close to 60 or 70 per cent 
of the human resource expenditures in terms of helping engage 
in that planning.
<P>
	At this time I have not received a response from the province 
of Quebec on that proposal. If that response is received, we are 
prepared to sit down and talk about all the programs. Once the 
province of Quebec responds we will co-operate with it.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1978 Allan Kinsella murdered 24-year old Kenny 
Kaplinski by shooting him twice in the head. He was sentenced 
to life in prison.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	In July he was transferred to the Bath penitentiary, in spite of 
the fact that the Solicitor General received two letters from the 
Assistant Attorney General of Ontario warning that Kinsella 
was unsuitable for transfer and likely to attempt escape.
<P>
	The Solicitor General did not respond to these warnings and 
on October 19 Kinsella escaped from Bath along with Serge 
Damien who was serving life for murdering a credit union 
cashier with a sledge hammer.
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General explain his negligence in this case, 
and what does he have to say to the people whose lives have been 
put at risk by this negligence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Kinsella had been in a medium security institution 
since 1986. He was transferred to another medium security 
institution, Bath.
<P>
	The letters of warning from Mr. Code, the Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General, were to the effect that Mr. Kinsella should not 
be transferred to a minimum security institution, specifically 
Beaver Creek. The advice on Mr. Kinsella was followed by the 
Correctional Service officials because Mr. Kinsella was not 
transferred to Beaver Creek or any other minimum security 
institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Attorney General of Ontario knew more about Bath 
than the Solicitor General. Not only did his office warn the 
Solicitor General about Mr. Kinsella, but the Bath medium 
security prison was medium security in name only. Bath was 
supposedly upgraded to medium security last May but many of 
the security features of a medium security facility were not in 
place, such as adequate lighting, surveillance cameras and 
double fencing.
<P>
	Why did the Solicitor General allow murderers like Alex 
Kinsella and Serge Damien to be transferred to an institution 
that was incomplete and substandard from a security 
standpoint?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before the transfer was carried out, the professional 
staff of the Correctional Service had formally upgraded Bath to 
medium security status, after adding additional protection 
measures. That is the fact, Mr. Speaker.

horse is out of the barn. Every time there is a problem in his 
jurisdiction the minister says it is a serious matter, there has 
been an investigation and steps are being taken, but in fact no 
action really occurs.
<P>
	Since the Solicitor General is so fond of investigations, will 
he submit to an independent public inquiry to examine not only 
the problems within Corrections Canada but the negligence of 
the Solicitor General's department itself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, an independent investigation has been convened, 
headed by the retired former deputy police chief of the city of 
Toronto. Under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
that investigation has the status of an investigation under part II 
of the Inquiries Act.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday a youth charged with criminal negligence causing 
death with a stolen car was sentenced to one year in a youth 
detention facility. In frustration the judge presiding over the 
case remarked that politicians, not judges, were the lawmakers. 
The judge's hands were tied and because of a weak Young 
Offenders Act the offender walked away with a year.
<P>
	In view of this case, how many more insupportable decisions 
does the Minister of Justice need to hear before he will make 
substantive and not cosmetic changes to the Young Offenders 
Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to 
comment on the facts of the case. I will speak to the point 
generally.
<P>
	Let me say that the member is himself participating in the 
work of the justice committee of the House of Commons, which 
has been engaged for many weeks in hearings with respect to 
Bill C-37, proposals to amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	In that capacity the member has heard witnesses who have 
been before the committee saying that in their view the Young 
Offenders Act as it exists at present is more than sufficient, if 
properly administered, to deal with juvenile justice in the 
country.
<P>
	The changes in Bill C-37 represent the amendments that the 
government thinks are appropriate at this time. The member 
knows we have asked the standing committee to commence, as 
soon as it finishes with Bill C-37, a comprehensive review of 
the statute as a whole, crossing the country, listening to experts, 
speaking to police, principals, parents, and hearing views about 
other changes that may be appropriate to the act.
<P>
	The member knows that process is going to be undertaken. 
Indeed he is going to be part of it. I trust he will come back to the 
House with responsible recommendations at the end of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it was quoted this morning that the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police as well as the Canadian Police 
Association recommended that judges must have access to

olds charged with serious crimes should automatically be tried 
in adult court.
<P>

associations, or is he going to sit back and listen to the broken 
record of the professional criminal justice community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are going to 
do and what we have done is be responsible and balanced and 
take into account the views at all ends of the spectrum.
<P>
	The fact is the hon. member seizes upon the headlines of this 
morning from the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. I 
have two comments. The first is that recently the paper has been 
full of reports of the testimony of other witnesses before the 
committee who said precisely the opposite. Obviously views 
differ. What we have done in Bill C-37 is produced a balanced 
bill that adjusts and amends the act in the public interest.
<P>
	The second observation I would make is that I am interested to 
observe the hon. member's interest in the views of the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police. I remind him it is the same 
organization that very much supports our intentions with respect

<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. The

their institutions. The political system is meant to serve the 
interest of Canadians and not of members of Parliament. When 
the public trust is gone the system does not work any more.

Mr. Speaker, first, there is clearly no conflict of interest because 
I have no pecuniary interest in the museum. Second, the decision 
to locate in Aylmer was taken by the Treasury Board in 1990.
<P>
	The recent decision to permit the Museum of Nature to 
acquire more land and build up its own facilities was made. I am 
a member of Treasury Board and all members of Treasury Board 
know that my riding is Hull-Aylmer. If it had been placed on 
this side of the river, since all 12 ridings are occupied by Liberal

question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	In its first budget last February, the government announced it 
was closing the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean. Reacting to the 
ensuing controversy and to protests organized by the Official 
Opposition, the federal government started negotiations with 
the Government of Quebec and concluded an agreement in 
principle on July  19. This agreement was never ratified, and 
negotiations with Quebec are at a standstill.
<P>
	Considering the uncertainty in which the people of Saint-Jean 
have been living for far too long, is the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs prepared to resume negotiations with 
the new government in Quebec, on the basis of the agreement in 
principle reached on July 19, and to confirm the military role of 
the college?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

</B>Mr. Speaker, we have an agreement on the Collège militaire 
royal de Saint-Jean which was concluded between the previous 
government and our government. The agreement clearly sets out 
the civilian status of the Collège de Saint-Jean and is in the best 
interest of both governments and of the people of Saint-Jean.
<P>
	The federal government has no intention of backtracking on 
the basic terms of the agreement as signed. What has not been 
determined is the implementation procedures. I will be sitting 
down very shortly with my Quebec counterpart to settle these 
final details which will implement the principles on which we 
have already agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand from the minister's attitude that his government is 
trying to withdraw from any plans to reopen the college, 
although it was responsible for closing it in the first place?
<P>

</B>Mr. Speaker, we certainly intend to stand by our commitments, 
and I hope the Government of Quebec intends to do the same.
<P>
	The uncertainty is not caused by our attitude, because we 
continue to abide by the terms of the agreement we concluded. 
However, if those terms are not implemented, the one to blame 
for the uncertainty in the Saint-Jean region and for preventing 
the Collège de Saint-Jean from continuing operations in its new

Mr. Speaker, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was

past its deadline and there is strong evidence of abuse in the $8

<P>
	In light of the government's promise to cut government 
spending and in light of the government's promise of

costs of the commission simply because the minister claims it 
was started by the previous government?
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I will deal with the 
research. The chairman of the commission has been in contact 
with our department. Out of approximately 140 reports that were 
supposed to come in I believe 15 were looked at. Nine were 
judged as inadequate and five were non-existent.
<P>
	Mr. Crombie is looking into that. I am waiting for his report, 
but 90 per cent of the reports that were paid for came in, were 
adequate and sufficient and were utilized. As far as the costs, I 
made my point last week.
<P>
	The commission is made up of eminent people. I am sure their 
report is going to be a good report. On balance we have to make 
judgments and decisions. The former government decided to 
have a royal commission. If we  had to decide it today, in today's 
environment with $58 million we would build 1,000 houses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this report will come in a year late at best. It will 
have a cost overrun of some $48 million. As the minister 
indicated a couple of days ago, they probably will not be able to 
implement some of the recommendations by the time they get it 
anyway.
<P>
	In spite of all of this, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development apparently thought this was something 
to joke about when he said the other day that maybe he would 
like to have a job on the commission but that he would have to 
stand in line.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development is how does he ever expect the Canadian people to 
regain some trust in the government when he treats such a 
serious matter like this with such irresponsible statements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two parts to that. 
The first is that we will not implement. I find this odd coming 
from the Reform Party which has not yet voted for one piece of 
aboriginal legislation in 11 months either in this House or at the 
committee.
<P>
	Talking about seriousness, we are treating this seriously. I

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. For months the Gaspé 
Cured company has been asking the minister to officially 
recognize a label of origin, <I>une appellation contrôlée</I>, for the 
area and the process and product of Gaspé Cured. Yet, the 
federal minister allows companies in the Atlantic region to 
export their salt cod under the name Gaspé Cure, which creates 
some confusion on international markets and leads to losses of 
as much as $10 million for the Gaspé Peninsula company.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7233"> 7233 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans tell us if he 
intends to accede to Gaspé Cured's request, and if so, how 
soon?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister is very conscious of the importance of the issue 
raised by the hon. member. Officials in the department are 
studying the request of Gaspé Cured. At the present time the 
expression is used not only for a grade of fish from a certain 
area, but also for a grade and a process used elsewhere. I can 
assure the hon. member that the minister is studying the matter 
carefully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the request 
submitted by Gaspé Cured covers the process and the product.
<P>
	My second question is for the Secretary of State. If the 
research done by the department-because I understand that 
they are doing research on the matter-is positive, and 
demonstrates that the product from the Gaspé is different from 
similar products in other areas, will the department give the 
people of the Gaspé Peninsula the right to a label of origin for 
their process and product?
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I was saying, the Department is devoting a lot of attention to this 
issue, and when the study is over the decision will certainly be to 
the advantage of fishermen in the Gaspé Peninsula, and of the 
industry in general.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

into the funding of that society.
<P>
	Some auditors looked at the books. They have been retained 
as counsel to the society. The two levels of government, the 
federal government and the provincial government, have agreed 
in light of the fact that Deloitte &amp; Touche is advising the 
financing of the society to resume some degree of funding.

this House why she has committed new funding to the Metis 
National Council at a cost of millions of dollars?
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to

<P>
	The fee for a firearm acquisition certificate is $50. However,

What measures will the minister be taking to reduce the 
administrative costs of FACs in metro Toronto?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

pointed out, the current fee is $50.
<P>
	The actual cost to the police force for carrying out necessary 
investigations varies. It depends in part upon the exercise of the 
discretion of the investigating officers, the degree of risk.
<P>
	It also depends sometimes on whether the investigations are 
being done in an urban or rural area because finding the referees 
in the urban area may be more difficult.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, the entire subject of firearms 
regulation is under review by the government at present. We are 
including in that review the process by which acquisition 
certificates are obtained. We will bear in mind the cost disparity

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
underground dealers buy guns through street dealers in Detroit, 
bringing them back by the dozens every time they cross the 
border and then they sell them at immense profits at after hours 
clubs in Toronto.
<P>
	On Monday this week the revenue minister assured this House 
that everything was under control; except the Hamilton 
<I>Spectator</I> says that 98 per cent of the guns that are seized are 
seized from unsuspecting U.S. citizens coming into Canada.
<P>
	Why is the justice minister considering useless, ill conceived, 
unnecessary gun registration programs when guns continue to 
flow over the border?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the 
minister of revenue said earlier this week, we are preparing 
proposals to deal more effectively with firearms entering 
Canada illegally. In the package of proposals that the 
government will table before the end of the session in December 
dealing with firearms generally, we will deal specifically with 
the issue of firearms entering Canada illegally.
<P>
	Before I leave the subject I must point out that border controls 
in terms of being careful with those taking firearms across the 
border in their cars are very important. A man named Johnathon 
Yeo was found by a coroner's jury to have done just that with 
very tragic consequences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to registration the minister will know about project gun 
runner. Of the 17 guns purchased on the black market, only one 
came from a break-in. The rest were smuggled into Canada.
<P>
	I have even heard it said that the minister said that 70 per cent 
of all criminal acts involving guns are committed with 
smuggled, illegal firearms.
<P>
	I ask the minister again, why is he prepared to commit 
millions of dollars to a bogus registration program that would 
just harass law-abiding gun owners?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for many years the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has been calling for 
the registration of all rifles and shotguns. It has been joined in 
that by the Canadian Police Association, health care workers, 
physicians. Hundreds of other associations across this country 
have been asking for registration of long arms. That is one the 
prospects we are considering as we assemble our proposals for 
gun regulation. If we do decide as a government to introduce it 
we will make clear the practical advantages we intend to 
achieve, including those identified by the police of this country.

<P>
	Recently the minister decided to consider the case of Patrick 
Kelly under article 690 of the Criminal Code, which allows the 
minister to order a new trial when a conviction is based on false 
evidence.
<P>
	However, as the minister knows, there has been a lot of 
criticism of the 690 process, that the criteria are vague, it is 
secret, too long and not independent.
<P>
	When will the minister act to meet these criticisms and reform 
the 690 process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that the 
690 process as described by the hon. member can be improved. 
Equally, I am certain that the procedure now in place is capable 
of dealing fairly and fully with all of the applications that are 
pending.
<P>
	Let me point out to the hon. member that we have already 
made improvements in the process during the last several 
months. I refer, for example, to the fact that in the case involving 
Colin Thatcher, which was dealt with by reasons given some 
months ago, I took the trouble to spell out the principles that 
governed the disposition of applications under 690 to remove 
some of the mystery the hon. member has referred to.

where I felt it consistent with fairness. Finally, I am completing

words-says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we were prepared to do so because the main objective is to avoid the burden 
of higher interest rates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is, of course, accurate. However, the transcript of the 
simultaneous interpretation overheard by all members of the

again I quote the words: ``Elsewhere we would do so because our 
main target is to avoid a true increase in taxes, including 
RRSPs''.

<P>
	The petitioners wish to draw to the attention of the House that 
decriminalizing assisted suicide or legalizing euthanasia could 
lead to a reduction of patient-physician trust and respect, the 
degrading of the value of human life and the erosion of moral 
and ethical values and that palliative care is active and 
compassionate care which can relieve the pain and suffering of 
terminally ill persons and families without the danger of 
suicide.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners pray that Parliament continue to 
reject euthanasia and physician assisted suicide in Canada and 
that the present provisions of section 241 of the Criminal Code 
of Canada which forbid the counsel and procuring, aiding or

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFINDUSTRYACT">DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 18 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of 
Industry and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly my pleasure to rise today to speak on Bill C-46, an act 
to establish the Department of Industry.
<P>
	This all started with the election one year ago when Canadians 
felt it was important to set in place a team of people with certain 
ideas as presented in the red book, that would reorganize and 
transform the government and the way business is done in 
Canada.
<P>
	It is not a coincidence that we have the team of players which 
is heading the departments today. We are the original reformers. 
Our friends on the opposite side call themselves the Reform 
Party, but the Liberal Party is the party of reform. It is our party 
that looks at all the resources; people, mineral, and other 
resources and asks: How can we do the best for our people? How 
can we reorganize things in a way that Canadians will enjoy the 
lifestyles they have had in the past and will continue to have in 
the future?
<P>
	We started with general projects. We brought in the 
infrastructure program. Why did we bring in the infrastructure 
program? Because all the G-7 countries, those countries that are 
doing well put infrastructure in. I know because I was a mayor 
and I travelled the world. I travelled to Germany and the United 
States to beef up my riding of Bruce-Grey, having been the 
mayor of the city of Owen Sound for four terms.
<P>
	My friends opposite can check my record. They can go to the 
library and see that I had a strategic plan and I executed it. I 
called it building blocks, putting in a hospital, a regional mall, a 
sewer treatment plant, an arena, or what have you. These are 
building blocks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7241"> 7241 </A></B>
<P>
	This government has reorganized itself in a way to give better 
government by streamlining the departments. Starting on this 
exercise is so important for us as a government because we are 
into an era not unlike what happened during the industrial 
revolution.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	During that time there was a lot of confrontation. I remember 
quite vividly watching a movie in which a gentleman brought in 
a steam jenny to replace jobs. His place was stoned. They called 
him a sorcerer. People started breaking his windows and all that 
because he had brought in a piece of steam equipment that would 
replace their jobs.
<P>
	We have now moved into the technology era. The Secretary of 
State for Science, Research and Development and the Minister 
of Industry in integration programs with the Minister of Finance 
are reorganizing the debt. We are even working with the 
Department of Health. We realize that health and the economy 
are interchangeable.
<P>
	We cannot do much without involving young people. We 
know the birth rate is high if mothers have good nutrition. Young 
people born into the world need the correct tools, the proper 
nutrition and fostering. People are the main resource. It starts 
with a person being able to dream or a person being able to think. 
It spins off to small businesses. I taught some young people in 
school who have done quite well. One young man just went to 
Japan. I have a lot of faith in them, but as adults we have to give 
them opportunity.
<P>
	Within the next couple of days we will be giving opportunities 
to youth. Young people will be allowed to get out there and 
experiment with various jobs so they can be focused. We are not 
crowding them out as happened in the past. I have been with 
these young people and I understand what happens.
<P>
	As adults we have learned a lot of things over the last number 
of years. One thing we have not found out is that we have to 
transfer some authority to young people. We have to give them 
hope. We have to let them know that they can replace us and that 
given the correct climate they will.
<P>
	In my riding of Bruce-Grey tourism is extremely important. 
It is a sector that brings in foreign revenues. It allows 
communities to achieve a higher standard of living than they 
would have without tourism. The roads and infrastructure we 
have put in place will allow people to come to my riding. It will 
allow them to stay in a hotel serviced by good sewers and water. 
A lot of these things have to be sustainable.
<P>
	In addition a lot of members in our community such as the 
sportsman's association who work at restocking the lakes for the 
fishery. Everybody is trying to help. In that climate the fishery is 
enhanced. There is the natural beauty that the Lord has given 
Canada. We have a great fishery, clean air, pure water, and a 
sustainable environment. People can enjoy our beautiful sunsets 
and  the cottage climate. Then on Labour Day they can go home, 
after they have deposited their dollars in our community. There 
is a spinoff effect of probably $4, $5, or $6 for every dollar spent 
in the community. It provides the communities with an elevated 
level of life; they have a theatre and other facilities that 
normally would not be available.
<P>
	They are also helping our country because in some cases 
people bring in foreign exchanges. Foreigners know that in 
Canada there are many things available that they do not have at 
home. They can come here and enjoy them, be it bird watching, 
sunsets, skiing or snowmobiling in the Collingwood or 
Bruce-Grey area. All these activities are rather unique to our 
area. They will all foster opportunities. The industry department 
will provide small businesses with a climate in which to grow 
and prosper.
<P>
	Quite recently we struck a committee. I say to the House and 
to small businesses that we are serious. The banks must respect 
them. The banks must afford to small business persons the same 
kinds of opportunities they have been giving to larger 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I know in my heart and my soul, because I have studied the 
problem, that those small business people and the one to four 
people they employ are the people who will get us out of this 
recession. They will get people dreaming again. They will get 
people using their ideas and their ideals. Most of us have God 
given talents in certain areas that could help the country. As a 
government we have to prepare the climate for them to do those 
things.
<P>
	We are now moving to a knowledge based new economy. It is 
going to radically change the way we compete in the open 
market. We have announced in our educational policies that as 
we reorganize the way we use UI or funding to universities we 
will make sure all our young people have a chance to go to 
school.
<P>
	I have been told, because of the position we find ourselves in, 
that if young people want to enter the teaching profession their 
marks have to be in excess of 90 per cent. Lots of people who 
would be good teachers or would be good in whatever endeavour 
they wish to pursue are not getting those marks. If we empower 
them by putting money in their hands they are able to go to any 
university and have an opportunity like anybody else. Kids who 
are very resourceful, clever kids, come from an environment 
where there is a lot of money. There would not be a problem 
there, but I personally think it would be a much more 
imaginative way to approach funding for universities. Our 
young people are very important. We have to foster a climate 
where they have a chance, notwithstanding that they mature at 
different levels. In some cases their scores do not reflect their 
abilities. Some of us are late bloomers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7242"> 7242 </A></B>
<P>
	We are working on all these fronts in an integrated approach 
to make sure that we are coming up from the boot straps. We 
are going to give people hope again. We are going to make sure 
that they have the dignity of work. We are going to look at the 
climate of child care from the time a person is born. That is 
actually a second front in comparison to what has to happen 
now.
<P>
	We have to kickstart the economy now with the infrastructure 
program. We have to get small businesses working, creating a 
climate of competitiveness, cutting our trade deficits between 
countries we are trading with and trying to export more. That is 
important for us. We have to bring our agriculture into a 
competitive position. By nature Canadians are very good at 
agriculture. That is our niche. That is what we do best. By 
putting money into research and development we can improve 
our wheat and the amount of milk our cattle produce. We can 
produce better strains of beef and products that are resistant to 
pests and various climatic conditions.
<P>
	As we work in those areas that is the way we will get ourselves 
out of this recession, get Canadians working again and get our 
country working again.
<P>
	The government is doing the right thing by reorganizing the 
department. The government is taking an integrated approach to 
the way we work with the economy. That includes looking after 
the debt because the debt is very important. We are not taking 
anybody else's policies. We are taking a balanced approach. We 
are not going to take $44 billion out of the economy because it 
will cause a recession; there is no question about that. We will 
work on a balanced approach of 3 per cent of GDP. In this 
integrated approach we will start to move one step at a time. 
That slow walk will pick up to a jog and then we will be up to 
speed.
<P>
	I am pleased to be on this side of the House and I am glad we 
are reorganizing this department.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I draw 
your attention to identical provisions which appear in three bills 
recently tabled, namely clause 18 in Bill C-46, clause 17 in Bill 
C-52 and clause 8 in Bill C-53.
<P>
	In Bill C-46, the provision reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>18. (1) The Minister may, subject to any regulations that the Treasury Board 
may make for the purposes of this section, fix fees that the Minister considers 
appropriate in respect of products, services, rights, privileges, regulatory 
processes or approvals and the use of facilities provided by the Minister, the 
Department or any board or agency of the Government of Canada for which the 
Minister has responsibility.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Once in effect, this clause will reduce Parliament's control 
over increases in government revenues. Although the process is 
not new, the enactment of such measures will result in greater 
powers of taxation.
<P>
	It is important to note that, in 1991, some very controversial 
amendments to the Financial Administration Act considerably 
increased the power of  the executive branch of government to 
impose fees and costs through legislation.
<P>
	These amendments are found in Chapter 24 of the Statutes of 
Canada, 1991. Although they are questionable in some respects, 
the clause contained in Bill C-46 is even worse. Indeed, that 
provision allows the minister, or an official authorized by the 
minister, to fix discretionary fees within the department.
<P>
	Sections 19 and 19.1 of the Financial Administration Act 
already provide sufficient authority to the Executive without 
making it necessary for Parliament to once again increase its 
power to collect more money.
<P>
	At the time, members opposite fought tooth and nail against 
those amendments. I guess times change.
<P>
	Clause 18 in Bill C-46 allows the minister to impose fees or 
increase those already applicable, without having to resort to 
any legislative instrument that would have to be registered and 
published under the Statutory Instruments Act and that could be 
reviewed by a competent parliamentary authority such as the 
Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. This 
is due to the fact that the clause allows the minister to set the 
costs but not to do so by order. The words ``by order'' were 
omitted from the bills now before the House. Those words are 
very important in the British parliamentary tradition, as they 
have always transferred to the executive power, that is, the 
Governor General in Council, the enforcement of all legislation.
<P>
	I find this process unacceptable. If ministers can increase 
public revenue as they see fit, it would be logical for the relevant 
documents to appear at least in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, which is 
accessible to all Canadians.
<P>
	One of the main functions of this Parliament is to ensure fair 
and equitable taxation. Let us try to imagine what the Auditor 
General of Canada must do, in preparing his annual report, to 
find out if taxpayers really paid what they owe the government. 
The question would be: how much do they owe? The rule of law, 
a principle treasured by our constitutional monarchy, is being 
superseded today by the rule of the minister. An important point 
is the extent of the discretionary power that the minister gives 
himself in this clause.
<P>
	This government's usual approach is to entrust its ministers 
with highly discretionary powers totally inconsistent with the 
most basic principles of sound fiscal management. Clause 10 of 
Bill C-22 concerning Pearson Airport, so strongly denounced 
by the Official Opposition, is a good current example.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7243"> 7243 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister's authority is not limited to setting costs or 
charges appropriate in respect of goods or services.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Under Section 19(2) of the Financial Administration Act, the 
minister does not have to prescribe an amount up to the real 
costs in respect of a service provided. The use of these very 
subjective terms means that, from now on, the minister has the 
discretionary power to set costs above the real value and, 
secondly, that these discretionary decisions will not be subject 
to any kind of legal review.
<P>
	I find it extraordinary that Parliament can delegate to a 
minister the power to decide by how much he will increase 
public revenue other than through taxes submitted and debated 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Canadian courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada, 
have recognized the principle of domanial duality in 
administration. For those not familiar with this notion, it can be 
explained as follows: a truck used to move government 
household effects is government property, while a bridge is 
public property but useful to the general public. That is the 
distinction. That is what the courts call domanial duality.
<P>
	The government could, for example, charge $20 an hour by 
ministerial order for the use of its truck without advertising or 
enacting regulations, but it could not charge a passport applicant 
for the full administrative cost of issuing the passport. The cost 
could vary depending on whether the application was sent to 
officials working in a run-down building in Montreal or in 
luxurious quarters in Toronto.
<P>
	Finally, I am troubled by the description of the items for 
which the minister will be authorized to impose service charges 
and user fees.
<P>
	This concept was picked up in the Financial Administration 
Act and was one of the main points of the Liberal opposition 
when it proposed amendments in 1991 concerning the power to 
charge fees for rights. You will see how the Liberals argued then.
<P>
	I find it wrong for Parliament to say on one hand that a citizen 
has a legal right, or is entitled, to receive certain benefits and on 
the other that it authorizes the executive to charge a fee to have 
this right or benefit recognized. A right is a right; it is not 
something that an individual has to buy from the government.
<P>
	I am trying to understand this new power to ask people to pay 
for regulatory processes. That is the term used in the clause in 
question: regulatory processes. This expression is so vague as to 
be meaningless.
<P>
	What is a regulatory process? The clause itself rules out any 
recourse to the regulations. Or is ``règlement'' used in the 
French sense of reaching an agreement? By giving the word 
``règlement'' this common meaning, agreement, the English 
version of the same clause would be meaningless, since it also 
uses the term ``regulatory process''. But what is it?
<P>
	Also note the extended opportunity to collect funds through 
permits and licences and by other means.
<P>
	In this context, it is clear that regulatory consent is similar to a 
licence or a permit. However, that is not the case with clause 18. 
The Financial Administration Act and this clause can lead to 
abuse.
<P>
	It is plausible that a minister facing a deficit may increase his 
revenues by charging fees for every consent he gives; this will 
just lead to a new regulatory scheme to impose a basis for 
collecting new charges.
<P>
	It is true that the power granted by clause 18 would be subject 
to the regulations that Treasury Board could make for this 
purpose.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Since it is not certain that Treasury Board will exercise this 
authority or, even if it did, that it would impose restrictions on 
the minister's discretionary authority, it is quite logical to think 
that the public's concerns are justified.
<P>
	The citizen cares little whether what he is paying is called a 
tax, a charge or a fee: it is disguised taxation. Mr. Speaker, you 
will agree that this new Liberal tactic of collecting public funds 
by all sorts of devious means is much more like highway robbery 
in the last century than the forthright collection of fair charges 
related to a particular expense. They are changing the maxim 
from ``ignorance of the law is no excuse'' to ``guess right''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to enter into this debate. This is an 
important bill even though it appears, as my colleague opposite 
indicated, to be a purely regulatory type of bill that tends to 
condense a lot of the difficulties, bureaucracies and regulations 
that are appended to the Department of Industry.
<P>
	This is an important function nonetheless. It is important 
because the country desperately needs a Department of Industry 
that is fine tuned, well honed and whose processes for decision 
making are adapted to the conditions of the day, conditions that 
require immediate action that addresses the problems as they 
have emerged over the course of the last 10 years.
<P>
	I say the last 10 years because some of my colleagues here are 
more familiar with the tradition of the last administration that 
stretched from 1984 to only 1993. However, in the latter part of 
that administration we saw the devastation of the economic 
dynamics of this country. It is the economic dynamics of this 
country that a bill such as C-46 addresses today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7244"> 7244 </A></B>
<P>
	It addresses these because the directions of the previous 
administration allowed forces of an economic nature to pull this 
country apart and to weaken the dynamics that allowed even 
on a regional basis for some growth, for some wealth and, I dare 
say for my colleagues on the Reform side of the House, for 
some fiscal generation so that we could either maintain 
programs on a national basis or at least support and continue 
programs that we felt were of a need from a regional point of 
view.
<P>
	Let me give some examples. I come from that part of Canada 
which people love to hate but which is also very important to the 
economic vibrancy of the entire country and whose citizens have 
very dedicatedly and very willingly contributed to the 
consolidated general revenues of this country and have also 
done their utmost to engender that spirit of thrift, sacrifice and 
risk that comes with the responsibilities of those who would live 
in a country dominated by an entrepreneurial spirit.
<P>
	The greater metropolitan area of Toronto, an area which I 
know, Mr. Speaker, you are quite familiar with, used to provide 
close to 40 per cent of all the revenues gathered from the 
consolidated general revenue fund. Some of my colleagues from 
the Reform side, not having had the glasses to adapt them to a 
larger vision of the country, might not appreciate that, but it is 
true.
<P>
	Even in such a place the devastation and inadequacies of a 
government imposed on the economy saw, for example, the 
labour force go from 2,022,000 in 1989 at the end of the boom to 
1,984,000 last year. In the process we saw employment drop 
from 1,934,000 to a mere 1,755,000. These are statistics dated at 
the end of December 1993.
<P>
	What is interesting about that is not only the drop in the labour 
force but the increase in the unemployment. Unemployment 
went from 81,000 in Canada's richest city in 1989 to 222,000 
this last December-222,000 unemployed.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	For some of my colleagues who have a rose coloured glass 
view of the world, that is a population that exceeds almost all 
cities except the top six in population in this country. It exceeds 
the number of unemployed in most of the regions in this country. 
To make matters worse, the kind of dynamics that were 
unleashed by the last administration, the welfare cases rose to 
672,000 in that same area and welfare payments ballooned, as 
one can imagine.
<P>
	What we need-the Canadian public told us this in 1993-is a 
government that is structured such as to be able to address the 
needs of Canadians wherever they might choose to live in this 
country, and make that an absolute certainty, that it is where they 
choose to live.
<P>
	If we are Canadians one of the hallmarks of our identity is that 
we have mobility and our country must be governed by a 
government that is willing to address not only our aspirations 
and our objectives and our needs,  but also the development as 
we move along. We are not a country that pits one region against 
another. We need government instruments that allow us to 
address the needs as expressed on an ongoing basis, capable of 
meeting the changes that we see the world economy and our 
domestic economy impose on families, groupings, 
communities, cities, provinces and regions.
<P>
	As my colleague from Bruce-Grey said a moment ago in a 
most eloquent fashion and a most precise fashion when he gave 
some specific examples of the potential that has yet to be 
exploited, one of the objectives of new Department of Industry, 
after it is structured, will be to highlight tourism.
<P>
	Our Department of Industry has recognized that the current 
account deficit that we hold with the world cannot continue at 
the rate that we currently see. It is especially onerous on the 
tourism side because this country has enormous potential for 
tourism development, and yet we have very few programs that 
target the tourists emerging in various places around the world. 
For example, we do not have adequate programs to address the 
emerging tourism potential of western Europe or even the vastly 
and quickly growing tourism potential of Asia.
<P>
	We see that if we are going to allow Canadians to look for a 
more aggressive future, one that promises fiscal security, 
monetary security and aspirations for our young people and for 
families, what we would have to do is take a look at where the 
jobs are being created. In some of the statistics I gave we could 
see that while there has been a decline in manufacturing not only 
in my own region of Ontario and the city of Toronto but virtually 
everywhere in this country unfortunately, what we have 
experienced at the same time is a growth in the service sector. 
There is no better sector than the tourism sector.
<P>
	In the area of tourism we find that about 50 per cent more jobs 
are created in non-tourism related industries and businesses. 
These are not Canadian statistics, these are studies that come out 
of the OECD. This is an area where other countries have found 
similar experiences.
<P>
	If we are going to build on something that is tangible, 
something that is there, we ought to take advantage of the 
natural beauty of this country, the natural resources that it offers 
from a tourism point of view and we ought to be able to marshall 
an industry that allows us to provide jobs today and tomorrow 
for a country that yearns for those days when it was realizing its 
potential. Those days can come again. We must take the 
appropriate measures to put the right structures and procedures 
into place, and this bill is one. I urge all members to support it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to address the 
House on the subject of Bill C-46, the Department of Industry 
Act.
<P>
	I would not be doing justice to my own feelings on this bill if I 
did not state at the outset my firm belief that this is good 
legislation, a measure of which the government can be proud.
<P>
	Bill C-46 and other organizational legislation introduced in 
this session are clear evidence that the government intends to 
live up to its commitment first stated in the campaign that saw it 
elected to power to restore and renew our administrative 
machinery. I am convinced that Canadians will view it as a 
positive step that will help restore public faith in the way our 
country is governed.
<P>
	I have been listening to the discussion on the bill with 
considerable interest and have noticed that a constant focus of 
debate by the opposition has been the topic of regional 
development.
<P>
	Here we have a bill, as the members opposite have themselves 
acknowledged, that deals with a tremendously broad range of 
responsibilities. The department has responsibility for industry 
and technology, trade and commerce, science, consumer affairs, 
corporations and corporate securities, competition and restraint 
of trade, bankruptcy, patents and copyrights, packaging, 
telecommunication, investments, small business, tourism. I 
have to pause and I have not yet exhausted the list.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All these responsibilities are vital to Canada's industry, trade 
and economic development. They affect all Canadians in every 
province and region, including Quebec. I, for one, think it would 
be unfair to my constituents to focus on a single aspect of the bill 
and ignore all other very important elements.
<P>
	The arguments raised by opposition members are seriously 
flawed. First of all, according to them, since the Constitution 
does not define regional development as a federal responsibility, 
it therefore comes under Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction. The 
federal government has a special responsibility to the regions of 
the country whose economy is growing more slowly, as provided 
for in Section 36(1)(<I>b</I>) of the Constitution Act, 1982. This 
section requires the federal and provincial governments to 
further economic development to reduce disparities in 
opportunities throughout the country.
<P>
	The way these responsibilities are discharged has changed 
over the years, just as the various regional requirements have 
evolved. The federal government used to try to reduce regional 
disparities, but it now emphasizes small and medium-sized 
business competitiveness and regional development.
<P>
	Contrary to what some critics claim, the government remains 
very active in Quebec regional development. The  Economic and 
Regional Development Agreement, or ERDA, with Quebec has 
not been renewed yet but it only expires in December, despite 
the opposition's allegations. The ERDA agreements will remain 
in force long after they expire, in some cases in 1996 and 1998.
<P>
	If we stick to the facts, no one can say that funding for Quebec 
regional development is drying up. Between 1989-90 and 
1993-94, federal contributions to Quebec regional development 
rose by 15 per cent, compared to the previous five-year period, 
to $1.4 billion over five years. I would like to see northern 
Ontario get part of that; it is not even in the same ballpark.
<P>
	I admit that by making a commitment to reduce spending and 
to lower the deficit, the federal government was forced to cut the 
amount allocated to regional development. We made a special 
effort, however, to ensure that these cuts are spread fairly among 
all regions of the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That being said, the current approach to regional development 
in Quebec does not require the same level of funding as in the 
past. Business clients of FORD-Q were quite clear during recent 
consultations: they do not want any more grants. They want 
assistance in a form that helps them realize their potential and 
they want the government to reduce the size of our deficit.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a contradictory aspect to the opposition argument on 
regional development in Quebec. On the one hand, the federal 
government is faulted for not establishing a separate department 
or agency for Quebec as is done with WED and ACOA. On the 
other hand, the federal government is criticized for wanting to 
ensure that all regions of Canada benefit from economic 
development.
<P>
	I repeat, the constitutional provision to promote economic 
development exists so as to create a more level playing field. 
The field we are talking about is not only Quebec but all of 
Canada.
<P>
	I am confident the people of Quebec will demonstrate their 
confidence in the federal government's plans for encouraging 
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	There are practical reasons FORD-Q does not have separate 
legislation. The main preoccupation, the main priority of the 
government is job creation, not creating new administrative 
structures. Bill C-46 is intended to consolidate, not separate. 
Therefore it retains existing provisions regarding regional 
development. As is currently the case, control of regional 
development in Quebec will again be transferred to the Minister 
of Finance by order in council.

	I am sure that the opposition wishes, as do all members of

organization that will assist Quebec and all of Canada move 
toward that goal.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-52.
<P>
	Since the House resumed sitting, we have been looking at a 
new structure for several federal departments. This 
restructuring exercise results from a wise decision made by the 
Prime Minister to streamline the federal administration in order 
to make it healthier, more efficient and, in particular, to save 
precious dollars for Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Under the Conservative government, Cabinet had no less than 
40 ministers, not to mention the political and bureaucratic 
support required, as well as the costs involved. We now have 20 
departments which are more efficient and which will provide 
better and quicker service to taxpayers. The government is 
convinced that it can meet its objectives by pursuing four goals: 
streamlining the delivery of a number of services and programs; 
eliminating duplication and overlapping; defining the 
responsibility of each sector; and transferring some activities to 
other levels of government.
<P>
	The bill which we are looking at today meets these objectives. 
Indeed, its goal is to make policies and programs more efficient, 
more affordable and also more accessible to our clientele, the 
citizens of our country. To determine, in consultation with 
provincial governments, who is in the best position to deliver a 
program or a service, and to make provision for adjustments to 
cope with changing priorities and situations from province to 
province are specific and realistic objectives designed to 
provide a better service to Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7247"> 7247 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no doubt that, with the co-operation of the 
provinces, we can quickly make significant progress in this 
area. There is no doubt either that the review of all our 
programs and services in order to reduce duplication and 
overlapping is very important to Canadians. Every level of 
public administration is experiencing budgetary problems. 
Every government must find solutions to the growing deficit. 
We must spend wisely the money entrusted to us.
<P>
	We must do more with less. In the past, everyone wanted their 
own structure, their own showcase, their own projects and their 
own service centres. However, we can no longer afford to 
support all that. Generally speaking, Bill C-52 will streamline 
the administrative procedures which allow us to reach 
agreements with the provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I think that the infrastructure program is a perfect example of 
co-operation between the various levels of government. It 
confirms that, by pooling our resources and projects, we serve 
Canadians better while also creating many jobs in the process. 
The infrastructure program, which was clearly presented in our 
red book, is ideally suited to our current needs. We all agree that 
there is nothing to be gained by letting a country's infrastructure 
deteriorate, since this reduces its efficiency and, consequently, 
its competitiveness.
<P>
	In Quebec, about one hundred very valuable projects were 
supported and approved by municipal, provincial and federal 
authorities. In several cases, work has already begun. 
Consequently, it is not surprising that people were shocked 
when the new Quebec minister of municipal affairs announced 
his intention to review dozens of these projects.
<P>
	A new government has the right to do things differently from 
its predecessor. It can certainly do so when its plans and 
intentions were clearly stated to voters during the election 
campaign. For example, during the last federal campaign, we 
clearly indicated which programs we were going to eliminate.
<P>
	We also said that we would look at the Pearson Airport deal 
and would cancel that project if we felt that it was not in the best 
interests of Canadians. And we did just that. So, it is normal for 
the new Quebec government to review projects, provided it 
indicated its intention to do so during the election campaign.
<P>
	There can be no misunderstanding on this issue, and voters 
clearly got the message. However, in the case of the 
infrastructure program, we are talking about projects which 
have been proposed by municipalities, reviewed at the 
provincial level and, once approved and recommended by the 
Quebec government, reviewed and accepted or rejected by the 
federal government. All these projects were approved according 
to specific rules clearly stated from the beginning. We are 
therefore concerned to see the new Quebec government start 
from scratch.
<P>
	I do hope that once the new Quebec minister of municipal 
affairs looks at these projects-hopefully in the very near 
future-he will confirm them, so that the communities and 
municipal organizations concerned can pursue the work which 
had already begun regarding these very important projects.
<P>
	For example, in my own riding of Saint-Léonard, residents 
have been asking for years that a community centre be built to 
provide various services. The construction of that centre has 
now been put on hold and I hope that the minister will give his 
approval as soon as possible, so that work can begin on this very 
important project.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on Bill C-52; I am 
especially pleased to speak on it because the riding which I 
represent in this House, Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, clearly 
lacks government services. I want to talk about this before 
getting into the main subject.
<P>
	The only government buildings in my riding are marine 
navigation lights, a post office, an employment centre and an 
empty office building. That is not much. First we have the 
navigation lights. I think that the federal government cannot 
avoid this responsibility since the Rivière des Prairies flows 
through my riding and it must be marked with navigation lights. 
This is an absolute necessity. Then there is a post office in the 
heart of Ville d'Anjou, but having a post office in my riding is 
certainly not unusual since the riding of 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies is one of the most populous in the 
Montreal area. In that regard, not having a post office would be 
inexcusable.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	As regards the need for a Canada employment centre in my 
riding, I think that for a better understanding of what is at stake 
here, I should point out to the House that the riding of 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, located in the eastern part of 
Montreal Island, is considered by many experts to be an 
economically depressed area: the unemployment rate is much 
higher than in the greater Montreal area; the number of welfare 
recipients is at record levels; it has the lowest average household 
income; and the school drop-out rate is one of the highest in 
Quebec. That being said, I do not think having a manpower 
centre in my riding is a luxury. It meets a real need among my 
constituents.
<P>
	However, according to rumours in my riding, the centre may 
be moved to the Saint-Léonard riding, next door. It seems this 
would allow for better allocation of available resources. In fact, 
the real reasons are pretty obvious. First they expand the area 
covered by the manpower centre responsible for East Montreal. 
They consolidate various services in the same building, so that 
offices already being used are now too small or redundant. 
Finally, the new Department of Public Works and Government 
Services decides to move the offices to  a new building, where it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7248"> 7248 </A></B>
<P>
can offer government services first and foremost to a riding that, 
incidentally, voted for the winning side. Quite a coincidence.
<P>
	In fact, if the rumours I mentioned earlier are true, the new 
government offices will be located in one of the least 
disadvantaged areas of Montreal.
<P>
	Of course for the time being, these are just rumours. 
Nevertheless, there is a precedent. I realized this when I looked 
at the history of politics in this riding. The first Canada 
Employment Centre to open its doors in this riding was 
inaugurated in 1984. At the time, it was an extension of the 
employment centre located in the present riding of 
Saint-Léonard. Of course, at the time, in 1984, the riding of 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies did not exist and Ville d'Anjou 
was part of the riding of Anjou-Saint-Léonard. After the 
election in 1984, this riding was represented in the House of 
Commons by the present member for Saint-Léonard.
<P>
	In the fall of 1988, we had an election, and Ville d'Anjou was 
then part of a new riding, Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies. The 
riding was represented by the future minister responsible for the 
development of greater Montreal, and interestingly, the 
employment centre in my riding became a full-fledged centre 
from that very moment. Since it was then too small, the 
employment centre's offices were moved, this time to the riding 
of Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies.
<P>
	In 1993, another election. Voters in 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies elected a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois to represent them, as did many Quebecers during this 
last election, and hence current rumours that the employment 
centre is going to be relocated.
<P>
	To end these rumours, the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services need only have answered my question to 
him about the activities of his whole department in my riding, as 
several Bloc members asked him about theirs. The letters we 
received suggested that it was impossible for financial and 
accounting reasons to explain what is going on in the ridings.
<P>
	Given that, you will understand my disappointment with the 
vote on the amendment moved by a fellow Bloc member for a 
committee to monitor this department. You will agree with me 
that setting up a public monitoring commission with the 
mandate of scrutinizing the contracts let by the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services would be the best way 
to ensure the openness that the Liberal Party promised us so 
much in its famous red book that everyone quotes abundantly.
<P>
	We find such openness nowhere in any of the departments we 
address. I shall take a few current examples since they are very 
recent.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We have been trying to find out how many family trusts there 
are, how many billions are involved and for how long this money 
will not be taxed. We are not getting any answers. No one can 
give us exact figures.
<P>
	There is also the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. 
Some very serious allegations are being made that it has 
infiltrated a political party, specifically the Reform Party. This 
service's activities are subject to review by an independent 
committee, but when that committee's members appear before a 
House committee, the only reply they will make to our questions 
is that they have become accustomed to not giving a definite yes 
or no as an answer. This is not transparency.
<P>
	Let us look at the events surrounding the Pearson airport 
affair. A bill to deprivatize Pearson was introduced, and of 
course the people who invested money in the airport will be 
making claims. The bill provides that these claims will be heard 
in camera by the minister responsible, rather than here in this 
House, or before the Canadian people. This is not what I would 
call transparency.
<P>
	An ethics committee was struck to keep an eye on lobbyists. 
Rumour has it that this whole business is unsavoury. And to 
whom does the committee report? Instead of reporting to this 
House, it reports to the minister.
<P>
	The Communications Security Establishment, which is 
allegedly involved in spying activities on a large scale 
throughout Canada and perhaps internationally, has been 
mentioned today, and indeed with increasing frequency for a 
few days now. Eighteen hundred people are involved in its 
operations, and although difficult to estimate, its budget seems 
to be in the range of two hundred and fifty or three hundred 
million dollars.
<P>
	This brings us to another subject, the inquiry conducted by the 
Keable Commission which published some extremely important 
information. I may recall that the commission-I will read the 
first paragraph of the inquiry-started its proceedings on March 
8, 1976. The commission reported as follows: Former RCMP 
officer Robert Samson was summoned to testify behind closed 
doors at his trial on charges of placing a bomb at the home of 
Samuel Dobrin. He revealed that in 1972, members of the three 
main police corps operating in Quebec searched the premises of 
the Agence de presse libre du Québec without a warrant. This 
unlawful search was part of a police operation under the code 
name ``Bricole''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7249"> 7249 </A></B>
<P>
	Subsequently, the Keable Commission was to question all the 
witnesses who appeared in this case, and the commission's 
initial terms of reference were gradually expanded as it 
discovered more and more facts.
<P>
	At one point, the people conducting the inquiry tried to obtain 
specific figures and information from the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, and when the RCMP refused, they went to 
court. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, and I would like to read to you what the 
members of the Keable Commission thought of this ruling. The 
following appears in Chapter 3, paragraph 3: ``The Supreme 
Court's judgment recognizes the right of the Solicitor General of 
Canada to evoke, without further explanation, the interests of 
national security as grounds for refusing to produce documents 
relevant to a commission's inquiry. In so doing, the Supreme 
Court reinforces what Chief Justice Jules Deschênes of the 
Superior Court referred to, in a detailed study of section 41(2) of 
the Federal Court Act, as the absolute privilege which shields 
the executive from the judiciary. Of all the countries whose 
jurisprudence in this area was examined by Justice Deschênes, 
including England, Australia, New Zealand and the United 
States, Canada is the only country that repeatedly favours the 
doctrine of absolute privilege''.
<P>
	In other words, there are citizens in this country who are 
above the law, against whom no legal recourse is possible.
<P>
	This is what transparency means, and unfortunately, Bill 
C-52 does not provide the controls we proposed. They are not in 
this bill, and we will therefore vote against this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to talk about the legislation presently before the House 
and to look at the amalgamation of different government 
agencies into consolidated departments, particularly this one of 
public works and government services. The amalgamation of 
most of the federal government's common services into one 
portfolio is a sound step toward improved efficiency and better 
service delivery of government programs and services.
<P>
	The first and most obvious opportunity is the capacity of a 
centralized body to reduce wasteful duplication with consequent 
savings to the taxpayers. This is already apparent within the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services. It will 
become even more so over the next four years as the overall staff 
requirements are reduced by close to 30 per cent.
<P>
	This consolidation of operations will bring annual savings of 
hundreds of millions of dollars and make a real contribution to 
streamlining government operations and contributing to deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	Cost effectiveness can only be one of the reasons why 
amalgamation of the government's common services makes 
good sense. It also provides a single focal point to the scores of 
government departments and agencies that depend on public 
works and government service for services. It creates an 
environment in which Public Works and Government Services 
Canada is better able to understand the whole range of its 
clients' needs and deal with them on a comprehensive basis. 
Similarly it provides a single operational point of contact for the 
tens of thousands of companies and individuals that do business 
with government every year.
<P>
	By standardizing policies and procedures and by developing 
more streamline procurement systems, Public Works and 
Government Services Canada can make it more fair, more 
simple and less costly for these people to do business with the 
government. Finally, the consolidation of our common services 
creates a really impressive body of specialized expertise on a 
wide variety of matters relating to government services and 
government administration.
<P>
	One of these centres of expertise that has come into the 
department through the amalgamation is the government's 
translation bureau. Few people are fully aware of the wide range 
of services and enormous volume of output that this 
organization provides to Parliament and to government on a 
continuing basis. With a staff of some 1,200 employees the 
translation bureau looks after translation and interpretation 
services for Parliament and government departments, agencies 
and commissions, as well as acts as the prime authority for the 
standardized terminology throughout government.
<P>
	Besides its basic responsibilities relating to Canada's two 
official languages, the bureau provides translation services in 
more that 150 languages as well as interpretation services for 
some 40 languages and dialects including sign language. The 
translation bureau is also an important user of services provided 
by the private sector in this field, issuing in a typical year more 
than 8,000 contracts for outside work. On average the bureau 
translates over 300 million words annually. To give some idea of 
the scope of this accomplishment, it represents the contents of 
about 4,000 books each of 250 pages in length. If you have heard 
my French, Mr. Speaker, you would realize how important good 
translation is.
<P>
	The bureau also translates more than 100,000 weather 
bulletins a year through its Météo system, a computer assisted 
translation system. It provides about 20,000 person days of 
interpretive services. On top of all this the bureau responds to an 
estimated 150,000 telephone inquiries each year from client 
departments, suppliers and the general public seeking 
information regarding correct terminology.
<P>
	The move of the translation bureau under the umbrella of 
Public Works and Government Services Canada was and is a 
logical and sensible move. The  bureau provides an important 
common service to departments and agencies and to the public. 
It does extensive procurement for services with the private 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7250"> 7250 </A></B>
<P>
sector. In other words, it shares the same characteristics as the 
other common service elements of the department and will 
benefit from being integrated with them.
<P>
	Another of the important but sometimes overlooked common 
services that Public Works and Government Services provides 
for the government is that of the receiver general. This 
responsibility which was transferred to the minister from the 
former Department of Supply and Services Act covers a 
multitude of central financial and banking functions vital to 
government operations.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The duty of the receiver general includes the issuance of 
payments in response to inquiries, settlement and redemption of 
payments, performance of other treasury operations such as 
receipt processing, payment of banking fees relating to inflows 
and outflows from the consolidated revenue fund, maintaining 
the general ledger and preparing the financial statements of the 
government.
<P>
	The receiver general is basically responsible for all public 
moneys received and disbursed by the government and for all 
balances held on deposit in the Bank of Canada and with other 
financial institutions. The receiver general must also maintain 
the official accounting records of the government and provide 
extensive analysis and reporting on the government's 
transactions and positions as may be required by Treasury 
Board, the finance department or others.
<P>
	The volume of transactions generated by these 
responsibilities is enormous. Each year the receiver general 
must process some 30 million deposits and over 200 million 
payments. With this volume of work the function of the receiver 
general is one that can benefit from the application of new 
technologies now available to speed service, deliver and reduce 
the cost of delivery.
<P>
	There has been considerable progress on this front. For 
example, of the 200 million payments made annually 30 per cent 
are now made by direct deposit and this percentage is growing 
each year. Over the last three years the department reports that 
some 133 million paper cheques have been converted to direct 
deposits. This conversion has resulted in initial savings of some 
$41 million in postage and banking fees, and annual savings are 
now in the order of $18 million. I am sure members of the 
Reform Party will be more than delighted at this progress and 
will be supportive of what we are doing here.
<P>
	The cost cutting measures already taken by Public Works and 
Government Services Canada over the past year demonstrate the 
wisdom of consolidating the department's common services 
into a single department. The bill will give the department the 
legislative base it  needs to continue to accelerate its efforts to 
provide better and less costly common services.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the bill today.
<P>
	The basic mandate of the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services is ``to provide cost effective and efficient 
delivery of common services to government departments and 
agencies''. This seemingly simple statement of responsibilities 
in fact represents an enormous challenge, given that the 
department must deliver a vast range of diverse products and 
services to more than 150 federal departments and agencies with 
physical locations scattered all across Canada.
<P>
	The department bears much of the responsibility for fulfilling 
our government's directive that the administration of its 
operations must be made more efficient and that waste and 
duplication must be rooted out throughout the service.
<P>
	As the primary provider of common services for the 
government it must take a lead role in meeting the government's 
goals in that respect. I think this is a good argument for the 
amalgamation and centralization of common services for which 
the department was formed, and for the bill which will give 
legislative force to its operations.
<P>
	In pursuit of its mandate Public Works and Government 
Services must try to achieve greater levels of both 
standardization and flexibility in its operations. Standardization 
in such areas as communications systems, procurement 
processes and so forth can make a real and positive contribution 
to reducing administrative costs throughout government. In its 
service to client departments, Public Works and Government 
Services must also strive to be as flexible as possible so as to 
address the real needs and to respond quickly and effectively to 
them.
<P>
	One of the techniques used by the department to give it 
flexibility of action, which has been carried forward from 
previous legislation, is the use of revolving funds. A revolving 
fund is essentially a revenue spending authority. It is a standing 
authority like a line of credit which given to the organization 
enables it to use its revenues to pay all or a portion of its 
expenditures.
<P>
	The objective is that all revenues will equal all expenditures 
over time. It is the continuous authority to draw on the 
consolidated revenue fund up to a specified limit, as opposed to 
an annual appropriation of cash. Revolving funds are 
particularly useful in facilitating large scale, multi-year 
projects, the type of projects Public Works and Government 
Services Canada frequently undertakes in the service of its 
clients.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7251"> 7251 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-52 provides for the transfer of six such revolving funds 
from their existing legislation with no change in their terms and 
conditions. These include architectural, engineering and reality 
services; consulting and audit Canada; the Canada 
Communication Group; government telecommunications and 
informatic services; optional services; and the defence 
production revolving fund.
<P>
	In addition the bill establishes one new revolving fund for the 
disposition of real property. The new real property disposition 
revolving fund is being established to permit the repayment of 
expenditures made in the disposal of real property from the 
proceeds. At present parliamentary appropriations are used to 
fund these expenditures.
<P>
	As members are aware, the new department and one of its 
predecessors, Public Works Canada, have been quite active over 
the past few years in disposing of unwanted and unneeded 
federal property which represented an unnecessary cost to the 
Canadian taxpayer. The establishment of the revolving fund will 
streamline and simplify the administration of this process in the 
future.
<P>
	The Minister of Public Works and Government Services was 
recently made aware of certain practices within the Canada 
Communication Group in which the revolving fund was used to 
carry over funding from one fiscal year to another.
<P>
	The minister responded quickly to deal with this problem. 
Working in conjunction with Treasury Board the minister took a 
number of steps to rectify the situation, including identifying 
and confirming the exact amount of funds that had been deferred 
for each department, invoicing departments for expenditures 
already made against these funds in the current year, 
immediately taking steps to return these funds to the 
consolidated revenue fund as a refund of expenditures for prior 
years, conducting a refund of all the revolving funds in the 
department, and instituting a series of processes and systems to 
improve management control over them.
<P>
	The speed and decisiveness with which the minister 
responded to this problem attests to the government's absolute 
determination to govern with integrity and to take every 
possible measure to restore public confidence in the way in 
which government conducts its business. It also provides a good 
example of the value of amalgamating the government's 
common services within one portfolio.
<P>
	In dealing with the situation the minister was not only able to 
correct the particular problem that had occurred in one area but 
also to take steps to ensure that similar problems could not arise 
in other similar operations within his department.
<P>
	The new Department of Public Works and Government 
Services has demonstrated in its first year of operation that it is 
as valid and viable operation. It has already saved taxpayers' 
money by the elimination of  duplication. It provides one-stop 
shopping for its client departments and a central focal point for 
suppliers and contractors to government. It has controlled a 
valuable body of specialized expertise in government 
administration and improved the government's ability to serve 
Canadians efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as stated in the red book our challenge is and always 
will be to do more with what we have. Governments everywhere 
are striving to maintain and to improve service levels to growing 
populations and to public demands that we do more and be 
efficient, more open and responsive in the delivery of services in 
communication with our citizens.
<P>
	At the same time governments face equally challenging tasks 
of making their operations more cost effective, reducing 
expenditures and easing the financial burden that must be 
shouldered by the people. This is a universal challenge and one 
that must be met by this government and by all levels of 
government in Canada, the United States, Japan, Europe, and 
indeed the world.
<P>
	The experience of the past decade indicates that one of the 
most effective ways of meeting the seemingly conflicting goals 
of better service at lower cost is through the development and 
application of advanced technology to the operation of 
government. The Department of Public Works and Government 
Services has made considerable progress in applying automated 
systems in delivery programs and services.
<P>
	A new and advanced communications technology has helped 
to become more efficient in all aspects of communication within 
government, within communications and with the Canadian 
public. The technologies in this field are evolving rapidly. It is 
vitally important that the federal government keep pace with 
change, make maximum use of emerging technologies and make 
our operations more efficient and more cost effective. For this 
reason I believe the changes embodied in the creation of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services 
represent that positive step.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I refer specifically to the decision to merge the government 
telecommunications agency, formerly the department of 
communications, with those portions of former public works 
and supply and services that dealt with informatics to a new a 
stronger unit known as government telecommunications and 
informatics service, or GTIS for short.
<P>
	An amalgamation of the units will eliminate some duplication 
of function and will result in cost savings. More important, it 
creates a comprehensive centre of knowledge and expertise on 
all aspects of advanced telecommunications and informatics 
technology. Further, it recognizes the trend in the industrial 
sector toward convergence of computing and communications 
technologies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7252"> 7252 </A></B>
<P>
	By locating the agency within the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services at the very heart of 
government, it will be in a stronger and more central position. 
This will benefit the government chief informatics officer, the 
scores of federal departments and agencies for which PWGSC 
provides common administrative services, and its home 
department.
<P>
	The new GTIS provides information management and 
information technology to assist in the automation of 
government administration and provides the common 
infrastructure for program delivery. GTIS is committed to 
constructing an information management and information 
technology infrastructure to support both central 
responsibilities such as the Receiver General and common 
services such as procurement and realty management.
<P>
	It also is the functional and technical authority within the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services for 
information management and information technology 
architecture, standards, policies, practices and guidelines. 
Generally GTIS is working to develop open and standards based 
government-wide information management and information 
technology architecture and infrastucture.
<P>
	The importance of applying these new technologies to 
government operations cannot be underestimated. To take just 
one example, the electronic procurement and settlement system 
which is being designed by PWGSC will when it has 
government-wide application offer annual cost saving methods 
of several hundred million dollars to government and suppliers.
<P>
	This system, known as EPS, unites the traditionally separate 
functions of procurement and finance into a single process. EPS 
will link client departments, suppliers and central common 
settlement systems allowing them to do business electronically. 
It will achieve improved service and reduction in related 
overhead costs. It will put control of procurement in the hands of 
users without burdening them with the details of process. By 
next year it is expected that widespread use of EPS by suppliers 
and departments throughout government will begin.
<P>
	EPS is a flexible system and one that is workable. The 
electronic procurement settlement system is but one example of 
the many applications designed to streamline the operations of 
government that are being designed with PWGSC and within the 
government telecommunications and informatics service. 
Others include the new public service compensation system, the 
standard payment system, the common departmental financial 
system, and the government message handling service.
<P>
	The amalgamation of government expertise and capabilities 
in this important field through the creation of the government 
telecommunications and informatics service, GTIS, makes 
eminent good sense. It will continue to pay off down the road in 
the form of more effective service delivery and lower 
administrative costs  throughout government. It is one more 
reason to support this measure to give legislative force to the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of the adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Manpower 
training.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise in the debate on Bill C-52, the public works and 
government services act.
<P>
	Less government, less cost, a more responsive attitude: This 
is the message Canadians are giving us with respect to our 
government operations.
<P>
	I conducted a social policy forum in my riding just last 
Sunday. It was held at Durham College in Oshawa. Many 
speakers gave me their views on how to change our social 
programs. This is an important part of our democracy in 
ensuring that the people who are affected by policies are 
involved in them. While this forum did not deal specifically 
with the structure of government, speaker after speaker 
expressed their views of the need for a smaller and more 
efficient government that would interact with the public in a 
manner that would restore meaning to the phrase civil servant.
<P>
	Many of our civil servants are in fact caring and responsible 
hard working people who work diligently in the best interests of 
Canadians. Sustained salary freezes and a moratorium on hiring 
has created despondency in the ranks of the civil service. The 
concept of upward mobility seems to have been roadblocked.
<P>
	Now is the time for new and innovative changes which not 
only reduce the cost of government operations but most 
important deliver services more efficiently and more 
responsibly to the public. Often people are treated to telephone 
answering machines with messages never returned, or 
overworked line people who after their 90th unemployment 
insurance case seem uncaring and unsympathetic.
<P>
	We must do better. We must rethink our whole attitude toward 
public sector employment. We must involve employees and the 
public in the evolution of a new system which will still meet the 
demands of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7253"> 7253 </A></B>
<P>
	We must be prepared to experiment in the public sector in 
order to achieve a more efficient system. When we say 
experiment, we mean just that, being prepared to start on a test 
basis certain pilot projects which will then in turn be monitored 
to see how they can be extended to the public at large.
<P>
	I know members would like me to give an example of such a 
system. We have all been dealing with trying to struggle with a 
harmonized consumption tax system. The duplication between 
the provinces and the federal government along with the burden 
to small and medium sized business has been mentioned many 
times in this House. In addition, two collection authorities 
duplicate the work of the government side on this transaction. 
Indeed in the case of the federal government, it results in over 7 
per cent of the funds collected. Currently the harmonization of 
these taxes has eluded both jurisdictions.
<P>
	Here is the start of a solution: Why not form an agency for 
consumption tax collection? This agency would have 
transferred to it the necessary staff and equipment to collect 
existing federal tax. The agency would then be set free from the 
government. The federal government would then become its 
client.
<P>
	We could work out a formula for the receipt of tax based on 
the quantum of moneys collected as well as a bonus for the 
satisfaction of the general public. The agency would then sell its 
collection services to the provincial governments, offering to 
collect their taxes as well. Members will note that there will be 
no change in tax authorities or who gets what money. It seems to 
me this would eliminate some of the distress which now exists 
between jurisdictions. At the same time it would afford for a 
more efficient collection system.
<P>
	From this initiative it would not take long for such an agency 
to suggest to the provinces and the federal government an 
effective way to only collect the tax once rather than requiring 
the duplication which now exists.
<P>
	This is just one illustration of how government could change 
in order to meet the objectives of Canadians which is for an 
efficient and effective government, working better and smarter.
<P>
	Bill C-54 follows this vein by consolidating certain 
departments of public works and creating a new procurement 
policy. What is in it for the taxpayers? A reduction of $180 
million after five years in operation. A reduction in jobs from 
18,000 to 14,000. In addition, due to the last budget, a further 
reduction of $30 million. These are no small accomplishments, 
even though members in the opposition would have us believe 
otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I would now like to turn my attention to an important new 
aspect of the procurement policy as outlined in the bill. It relates 
to contingency fees.
<P>
	Before coming to the House today I looked up the definition 
of contingency fees: A future event or circumstance regarded as 
likely or as influence on present action. This means someone 
profiting by the success of securing government business. This 
is a concept of reward not consistent with the public's demand to 
move toward more integrity in our system. This is the sort of 
thing that should be abolished and should also be abolished in 
general lobbying with the federal government.
<P>
	Since last May all the department's contracts contain a clause 
requiring bidders to certify they have not hired a lobbyist to 
solicit award of the contract, where any part of the lobbyist's 
payment depends directly or indirectly on a client obtaining the 
contract, or a contingency fee. This is a very good thing.
<P>
	The minister has also moved quickly to make major 
improvements in the way contracting for advertising and public 
opinion research had been handled by the previous government. 
Previously, there were no effective guidelines for the purchase 
of these important and sensitive services which left the door 
open for widespread abuse and political patronage.
<P>
	For the first time ever, new guidelines have been developed 
and promulgated with the approval and backing of cabinet. They 
have brought the procurement of advertising and public opinion 
research into line with the thrust and policies governing all 
procurements, namely fairness, openness and transparency.
<P>
	These guidelines ensure that all contracts awarded for these 
services advance the policy interests of the government. They 
ensure that they reflect the government's determination to 
restore public confidence in the system and the way it conducts 
the public's business.
<P>
	By increasing the use of the open bidding system, by 
introducing the lobbyist clause and by developing new strict 
guidelines dealing with advertising and public opinion research, 
the minister has demonstrated his commitment to building a fair 
and open approach to government procurement.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has made it clear that restoring public 
confidence in the integrity of government is a matter of high 
priority. Dealing fairly and honestly with the thousands of 
Canadian individuals and companies who do business with the 
government can go a long way toward achieving that goal.
<P>
	Passage of the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services Act will ensure there is a central point of responsibility 
within government to ensure that the principles and policies 
governing government procurement are enforced, monitored 
and adhered to.

	The House resumed from Tuesday, October 18, consideration 
of the motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department 
of Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When we stopped the last time, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
had the floor, but since he is not in his seat, I recognize the hon. 
member for Drummond.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is introducing for second reading Bill C-53, an Act 
to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage and to amend 
and repeal certain other Acts.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to give legal form to proposals of 
the previous Conservative government to merge several 
departments. This exercise is presented as a political and 
economic measure, that of reducing the size of the Cabinet.
<P>
	At first glance, one might agree with the economic arguments 
for this operation. By merging a number of governmental 
responsibilities and activities, with a view to streamlining 
operations, we could achieve some savings. However, to do that, 
the government would have had to limit itself to the mere 
merging, in one single department, of services scattered in 
different departments. The government would have had to take 
this opportunity to do the necessary house cleaning and to 
streamline its operations while looking for duplication of 
responsibilities with the provinces.
<P>
	It did not do that. In this bill, much praised for its economic 
virtues, streamlining takes a back seat compared to the 
reaffirmed will to occupy fields of jurisdiction which 
constitutionally belong to the provinces.
<P>
	In the area of culture, in particular, the government had a good 
opportunity to satisfy its stated economic interest while giving 
Quebec something it had been claiming for years under the 
Constitution. Unfortunately, it does nothing of the kind, and 
instead, maintains duplication and overlapping with programs 
the objectives of which are short-circuiting those of similar 
provincial programs.
<P>
	All this at a time when neither Quebec society nor Canadian 
society can afford such counterproductive and expensive 
interventions. This operation, which could have been 
economically rational, is anything but. It perpetuates one of the 
economic flaws of federalism through continued spending in a 
field of jurisdiction which is not federal.
<P>
	With respect to this bill, had the government not wanted to 
listen to economic reason, it could at least have listened to its 
own Constitution. In 1867, the Canadian Constitution gave 
authority to the provinces in the areas of communications and 
cultural matters. The Constitutional Act of 1867 gave the 
provinces jurisdiction over all private and local matters and 
recognized Quebec civil law. Education, which is closely 
connected with culture, was recognized as a provincial field of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Section 40 of the Constitution, which was unilaterally 
patriated in 1982, states that when an amendment is made 
regarding education or other cultural matters, Canada shall 
provide reasonable compensation to any province to which the 
amendment does not apply.
<P>
	In fact, the constitutional acts are clear and give the provinces 
exclusive legislative powers over cultural matters. Had it not 
been for the spending power of the federal government, we 
would not be witnessing today this futile fight, the main victim 
of which is the specific cultural identity of Quebec.
<P>
	With this bill, once again, the federal government fails to 
recognize the cultural reality of Quebec as a distinct society 
having, as its main characteristic, its language, which it 
inherited from one of the two founding nations of Canada.
<P>
	Instead of recognizing Quebec's cultural reality and taking 
appropriate action, this bill reflects a pan-Canadian cultural 
identity based on the theory of a bilingual and multicultural 
society. The federal government is feeding utopian views which 
pose a real threat to Quebec from a cultural and linguistic point 
of view. Bilingualism, in particular, is utopian.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Every report, every study has come to the same conclusion: 
the use of French in Canada has not improved, quite the 
opposite. As a journalist, Michel Vastel, so rightly put it, the use 
of French in everyday life never spread even here in Ottawa, the 
capital of an officially bilingual country. Twenty-five years 
after the Official Languages Act was passed, we are still waiting 
for French to take its place in the sun, beyond mere use in 
legislation, whether it be in day care centres, at school board 
meetings, in movie theatres, in hospitals, or in banks.
<P>
	Sixteen years after moving here, in an article published in the 
magazine <I>L'Actualité</I>, Michel Vastel sums up his experience of 
bilingualism in the nation's capital, by stating: ``In Ottawa, only 
in public buildings will you find the illusion that the two 
languages are equal. Beyond this facade, Ottawa is like any 
small, unilingual city in Ontario. Here, people leave French at 
home''.
<P>
	This is just one testimony among many that will certainly 
leave many of my colleagues sceptical. Unfortunately, all the 
reports tabled by the Commissioner of Official Languages are 
packed full of such examples which tend to indicate, if one were 
to read between the lines, that outside our main institutions, 
bilingualism is still sheer utopianism.
<P>
	The province of Quebec has realized that bilingualism does 
not help to preserve and promote its cultural identity. However, 
Quebec still provides, in many areas, exemplary services to its 
English-speaking minority. As a French society completely 
surrounded by the English culture, Quebec has the duty and the 
historical responsibility to preserve its cultural identity, its 
distinct identity.
<P>
	Why not stop beating around the bush and provide the 
province of Quebec with what the Fathers of Confederation set 
aside for this province in 1867? Why does the federal 
government show such sterile and costly stubbornness when it 
comes to historical demands unanimously approved by every 
successive Quebec government for decades now, regardless of 
their political allegiance? For what economic or social reason 
has the government refused, during constitutional negotiations 
and again today in this bill, to give Quebec complete jurisdiction 
over cultural matters?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, will you let me finish my speech? It will take me 
perhaps five more minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House to continue for five 
more minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> These are the questions that Quebekers ask 
themselves and which they will soon be able to answer, among 
others, during a referendum on Quebec's political future.
<P>
	In the meantime, the government could have made the best of 
it and done something significant to prove its good faith 
concerning what it calls national reconciliation. For all 
provinces and especially Quebec, jurisdiction over cultural 
matters is of the utmost importance. Their numerous demands in 
that sense have always been rejected. For sure, the goal here is 
not only to put an end to the waste generated by overlap, but also 
to ensure cultural survival and development. And judging by 
this bill, the government apparently failed to understand this.
<P>
	Last week, the finance minister said that we were in hock and 
that we could not go on like this. According to him, the 
economic situation of this country is unbearable. One reason for 
this unbearable situation remains that the Canadian government 
uses its spending power indiscriminately in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. It insists on controlling everything 
whatever the cost. Well, the cost is unbearable. This is what we 
have been saying in this House, but to no avail.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	With the government threatening to cut social programs by 
several billion dollars, what is even more unbearable is that the 
Canadian government has clearly indicated in Bill C-53 that it 
wishes to impinge on yet another provincial jurisdiction and to 
ignore every primary rule of productivity and overspend. This is 
why this bill also appears unbearable to me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege for me to speak on this bill on the reorganization of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	This department has many extraordinary, important 
responsibilities but the one I would like to speak about to the 
House today relates to its responsibility for multiculturalism.
<P>
	As the House knows, the Department of Canadian Heritage 
will be responsible for the promotion of greater understanding 
of human rights, fundamental freedoms and related values as 
well as multiculturalism.
<P>
	It seems to me that when we are speaking about this topic we 
owe it to ourselves to look at it from the point of view of our 
ridings, which includes our neighbours and our friends, and also 
our country and the importance which this subject has for the 
development of Canada. I would like to look at it from both 
those perspectives.
<P>
	I have the privilege to represent the riding of Rosedale which 
includes some of the most complex areas of downtown Toronto. 
In St. Jamestown, which is part of my riding consisting of about 
10,000 people, we estimate there are some 57 language groups 
represented. Some wonderful communities are there, including 
the Filipino community. I belong to a group called the <I>Circulo 
Ilongo</I> which is a group of Filipinos who come from a certain 
part of the Philippines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7256"> 7256 </A></B>
<P>
	I have learned a great deal about Filipino values and about 
Filipino food and about Filipino love for one another and their 
values and the strength they are bringing to my community of 
Rosedale and to my neighbourhood that I never would have 
known anything about had I not had the privilege of associating 
myself with them as their elected representative. I am proud 
to say to the member for Winnipeg North who is here with us 
today as a representative of the Filipino community 
``Mabuhai'', welcome and love from the members of the 
Filipino community. He represents a great contribution that the 
Filipino community is making to our society.
<P>
	We have a Tamil community in my riding and there we have 
located the Tamil resources centre. This centre, located in 
Toronto, contains the largest collection of Tamil language 
literature outside of India in the world. In Toronto today we are 
publishing three books in Tamil. I could go on.
<P>
	The question is does one see this as a threat, or does one see 
this evolution in our society as a challenge and an opportunity?
<P>
	There are two very diverse opinions. I have listened to the 
speeches in this House on this subject. I listened to the member 
for Wild Rose who, it seemed to me, considered this as really a 
threat to Canadian development. I had an exchange the other day 
with the member for Calgary South who seemed to have the 
same attitude and who attacked the heritage languages program 
of the department of heritage.
<P>
	I listened to the member for Saint-Denis who lives in a 
complex urban riding in Montreal and who cited the president of 
the Royal Bank who said that it is precisely this complex, rich 
cultural linguistic grouping that represents the strength of 
Canada as we go into the 21st century, that represents the pool of 
human capital that will enable us to participate in an ever 
enclosed and more integrated global village in which we live.
<P>
	I much prefer the perception of the president of the Royal 
Bank and my colleague from Saint-Denis because it represents 
the reality of Canadian cultural experience. It represents 
Canadian values, those of tolerance and acceptance. It 
represents Canadian interests in terms of how we are going to 
deal with the future of the world and it represents the way the 
world is evolving.
<P>
	One of the members across the way called out that it 
represents the Liberals. It does represent the Liberals. It 
represents Liberal values. I am proud to speak for these values 
and proud to speak for a party that represents those values and 
insists on them. I am proud to be a member of a party that 
recognizes the way the world is evolving.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Members opposite can laugh. Are they not watching the way 
the world is evolving? Do they not know what is happening 
around them? I have talked to their representatives on the trade 
committee. I have spoken to  other members of the Reform 
Party. They know what is happening in globalization. Their 
members came with us when we travelled across the country 
with our international trade committee. We heard in Vancouver, 
Calgary and the Northwest Territories, where many Reform 
members come from, about the tremendous import and export 
opportunities that Canadians have.
<P>
	We are living in an age of movement of goods, services and 
people across all jurisdictions and boundaries. As Canadians we 
have to be able to meet the demands of markets and complex 
areas of services. We must have knowledge of those markets. We 
have to be able to get into them. How do we get into those 
markets if we do not have the language skills and a knowledge of 
the culture of those markets in which we want to participate?
<P>
	We have heard much about China in the House in the last 
while and for good reason. Many people estimate that by the 
year 2025 China will be the largest single economic factor in the 
world. As the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee 
Kuan Yew said about China: ``It is not possible to pretend that 
this is just another big player. This is the biggest player in the 
history of man''.
<P>
	Napoleon said, when China comes on the scene: ``Quand la 
Chine s'éveillera, le monde tremblera''. This is true. Again, is 
this a danger or is it an opportunity for us? It is an opportunity 
for us. The third largest language group in Canada is Chinese. In 
Toronto alone there are 350,000 people of Chinese origin and in 
Vancouver there are more.
<P>
	This month alone in Toronto we had four trade delegations 
from China led by senior representatives of the Government of 
China. All were spearheaded by relations that were established 
by people in our communities who speak the Chinese language, 
know the Chinese culture, are Canadian citizens and proud of it.
<P>
	One of the proudest days of my life was a while ago when I 
talked to a colleague of mine, a person I consider to be a great 
friend who lives in downtown Toronto. He is Vietnamese. He 
told me the story of how he came to Canada 20 years ago as a 
Vietnamese refugee and how he barely survived. Today he has a 
prosperous business in downtown Toronto.
<P>
	He told me of going to the Vietnamese embassy a while ago. 
He is Vietnamese of Chinese origin and so he speaks Chinese as 
well. He told me very proudly: ``I went to the Vietnamese 
embassy, not cap in hand as a Vietnamese refugee but as a 
Canadian citizen who speaks Vietnamese and Chinese. I believe 
I can build a bridge between this society and the Asian society 
which is an important power of the future''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7257"> 7257 </A></B>
<P>
	Those are the values to which this multiculturalism 
department addresses itself. The member opposite from the 
Bloc seems to consider this an invasion into the jurisdiction of 
Quebec. Quebec citizens do not consider it that. They consider 
it an opportunity to participate in an evolving, extraordinary 
world.
<P>
	We are a bicultural, bilingual, bijuridical society that has 
become multicultural. By multiculturalism I do not mean dance 
groups and festivals. I mean the creation of a society where 
other traditions, values, languages and cultures are respected 
within the Canadian mosaic and in which those cultures may 
flourish alongside and strengthen our own.
<P>
	As I said earlier in this speech, my riding of Rosedale has as 
many as 57 different language groups represented. All these 
groups have rich cultural experiences to offer Canada and 
through Canada to the world. In that sense Canada may be, as 
has been said by others, the world's first non-nation country.
<P>
	We are not a nation in the tribal sense of 19th century nations 
but rather a country which in many ways reflects the global 
society of which we are a part. Many other older states are now 
evolving in this direction.
<P>
	We in this party and in this government are anxious to create 
instruments of government which reflect this new national and 
global reality. This bill moves us toward that important goal. I 
am proud to be a part of it and proud to support it.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in the House to discuss Bill C-53, an act to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	As a new member of the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage, I have been looking forward to this time when I can 
stand before my colleagues in the House and have the 
opportunity to hold the government and particularly this 
department accountable for its actions and decisions.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is a prime example of what is wrong with the 
country. It lacks leadership and direction. This was a perfect 
opportunity for the government to show Canadians that it truly 
does care about the future of Canada, not just in the short term 
but in a future which our children's children can enjoy.
<P>
	Bill C-53 was an opportunity for the government to take the 
lead and make some hard decisions regarding funding practices. 
We are, as everyone knows, in rough waters. Canada is currently 
barely treading water. Our debt and deficit are reaching 
astronomical levels. For that reason federal spending must be 
controlled and ultimately reduced.
<P>
	We are spending $110 million more each and every day than 
we are currently collecting in revenues. To make matters even 
worse, we are continually funding programs and activities that 
must be seen as low national  priorities when the debt is 
considered. These would include multiculturalism, official 
languages and amateur sports.
<P>
	In fact, in a survey conducted in 1991 Canadians were asked 
whether they agreed or disagreed that the government should 
stop funding multiculturalism and make these projects 
self-financed by multicultural organizations themselves. Over 
two-thirds of all respondents agreed and in fact 45 per cent of 
them strongly agreed that multiculturalism should be funded by 
multicultural organizations rather than the federal government.
<P>
	Another area of contention is official languages. The Reform 
Party would eliminate the unnecessary federal funding and the 
divisive official language policy and would instead implement a 
policy of territorial bilingualism, maintaining official 
languages in key institutions such as Parliament, the Supreme 
Court and in federal institutions where demand is sufficient to 
warrant cost effective minority language services.
<P>
	A final illustration of the program which I will describe as low 
national priority in the Department of Canadian Heritage is 
amateur sports. However, I want to make it clear that this list of 
three, multiculturalism, bilingualism and amateur sports is by 
far not inclusive.
<P>
	There are presently 88 sports organizations that are solely 
funded by the federal government. This amounts to 
approximately $45 million plus an additional $12 million 
through areas such as major games hosting, athletic assistance 
programs and applied sports research. The overall consensus by 
these same 88 sport organizations is that there are insufficient 
funds available and that the current funds are spread too thinly 
among a large number of sports.
<P>
	The federal government cannot be all things to all sports and 
the issue of core sports must be addressed. The concept of core 
sports financing should be supported in the short term with the 
criteria for eligibility of the core program becoming more and 
more selective until such time that the federal government no 
longer funds amateur sports.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a commitment to balance the federal 
budget in three years and therefore the time of priority spending 
must begin. Therefore, the elimination of amateur sports 
funding over a three-year period would enable them sufficient 
time to find funding in the private sector. We feel that more 
emphasis should be placed on community based involvement 
regarding funding through such areas as corporate sponsorships, 
membership fees and volunteers.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7258"> 7258 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada has also created a bureaucratic, top-heavy sports 
bureaucracy. It ensures that the majority of funding which we as 
a government are allocating is not going where it was intended, 
to the athletes. It is for these reasons that the only role for the 
state in amateur sports is the provision of sports facilities which 
would be accessible to all Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-53 attempts to give Canadians the illusion that the 
government is streamlining its activities. We in the Reform 
Party live in the real world and see that the bill is not streamlined 
but rather an ocean of overlap and confusion.
<P>
	To illustrate my point, between the departments of heritage 
and industry there are overlaps in such areas as the Broadcasting 
Act, the National Telecommunications Power and Procedures 
Act, Telesat Canada Act, Radio Communication Act, Canadian 
Radio and Telecommunications Commissions Act, and the 
Copyright Act.
<P>
	It is incomprehensible to me that we need such an overlap and 
duplication in areas where for the most part government has no 
business becoming involved in the first place. The level of 
separation and degree of responsibility created through Bill 
C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry, and Bill 
C-53, an act to establish Canadian heritage lack clarity.
<P>
	On the one hand we have Canadian heritage which ultimately 
oversees overall regulations for the CRTC and the Department 
of Industry becoming more and more entangled in the overall 
direction of industries involved in the information highway and 
technological industries.
<P>
	The questions that must be asked are: Why is the Department 
of Industry interfering in the natural progression and expansion 
of the private sector by over-regulation? Why is the department 
of heritage interfering with the natural progression and 
expansion of the private sector by over-regulation?
<P>
	The answers to these questions are unclear. Perhaps it is 
because the government sees an opening where it can generate 
more revenues in the form of some sort of taxation, or perhaps it 
just enjoys over-regulating certain industries.
<P>
	Both of these explanations are plausible. It is my obligation as 
a Reform member of Parliament not just to criticize but to be 
supportive where warranted and to always present an 
alternative.
<P>
	I would like to tell my hon. colleagues that both 
over-regulation and overtaxation stifle business growth so stay 
out of the private sector as much as possible.
<P>
	From my research and dealings with the information highway 
every expert I have talked to has told me the same thing, that the 
government is for the most part one or two years behind the 
private sector and their involvement only impedes the growth 
and productivity of  firms involved. I reiterate we must stay out 
of the private sector.
<P>
	Specifically, looking at Bill C-53 the government has in its 
ultimate wisdom left the cable industry in heritage while 
transferring the telecommunications industry to the industry 
committee. Have the Liberals read the CRTC 
telecommunications decision 94-19 which deregulates the 
telecommunications industry which, in short, opens 
competition to local telephone markets and means the cable 
companies will now be able to compete with phone companies 
for local home and business service. If comments coming from 
the chairman of the CRTC, Mr. Keith Spicer, are any indication 
there will be more deregulation in both cable and 
telecommunications industries.
<P>
	Yet these two similar industries are now under two different 
ministers. I feel therefore I have to give the Liberals credit here 
as they are truly looking as if they know what they are doing, 
even though nobody on this side of the House, or the business 
sector, or the Canadian public knows what they are doing or why 
they are doing it.
<P>
	What the Liberals have to understand is that less government 
will ultimately mean more freedom and more prosperity for all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	We as parliamentarians have an obligation not only to our 
constituents but to all Canadians. We must start to make the 
right decisions which will enable our country to lower our 
deficit.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that I am opposed to Bill C-53. It does 
nothing to reduce government spending or waste, government 
mismanagement or incompetence, government overlap or 
duplication. It does not set an example for other ministries nor 
does it have the direction needed to lead this country.

	The House resumed from October 19 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-226, an act to amend the Criminal Code, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary had 
six minutes remaining when the House adjourned last time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to continue my 
remarks regarding Bill C-226, an Act to amend the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no doubt that the creation of section 745 was unique 
in the criminal law of this country. However, this section was 
included in the first reading of the original bill in 1976 and it 
was fully reviewed and discussed by the justice and legal affairs 
committee before it was finally debated and passed by 
Parliament.
<P>
	Rather than the original proposal to have three judges to hear 
a case, Parliament amended the bill so that a jury would decide 
the case instead and this was done specifically to increase public 
participation in the process.
<P>
	There was even a press release at the time which highlighted 
this provision in the proposed legislation. Clearly there was 
debate and communication in the public arena and efforts were 
made to make the resulting judicial review hearings as public as 
possible.
<P>
	Let me review briefly how the provision works because there 
are many misconceptions about the process. An offender whose 
parole ineligibility period exceeds 15 years may apply for a 
judicial review hearing after at least 15 years have been served. 
Provided the criteria are met a superior court judge in the 
province in which the  offender was convicted empanels a jury to 
hear the application.
<P>
	In making a decision on the application the jury considers the 
character of the applicant, the applicant's conduct while serving 
his or her sentence, the nature of the offence for which the 
applicant was convicted and such other matters as the presiding 
judge deems to be relevant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some people who are against section 745 hearings suggest 
that the judicial review process is equivalent to automatic 
parole, but this is not so.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say that even though it is true that 
36 applicants out of 47, or 77 per cent, have obtained favourable 
decisions to date, the fact is that juries are free to reduce or 
maintain the period of ineligibility for parole.
<P>
	Several juries, particularly in Ontario and in Alberta, have not 
allowed some offenders to apply for parole. Moreover, a 
decision in favour of the applicant does not mean that he will 
automatically be granted parole.
<P>
	As noted by the Supreme Court, section 745 simply allows the 
offender who obtains a favourable decision to submit an 
application to the National Parole Board. There is no guarantee 
that parole will be granted.
<P>
	Therefore, based on information they are given, jury 
members, our fellow Canadians, choose to allow some offenders 
to apply for parole.
<P>
	The jury does not have the mandate to determine the length of 
the sentence or the manner in which it must be served. An 
offender who has received a life sentence will serve his sentence 
for the rest of his life, whether or not his period of ineligibility 
for parole has been reduced.
<P>
	Parole does not mean the end of the sentence, but rather the 
beginning of the ``community phase'' of the sentence. In short, a 
life sentence never ends, it stays in effect throughout the 
offender's life.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another misconception is that all or even most offenders 
convicted of murder will apply for a judicial review hearing. 
This has not proven to be the case. At the moment 128 offenders 
are eligible to apply for a judicial review but only 71 have 
actually made an application.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7262"> 7262 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	One argument frequently put forward to discredit section 745 
is that families of victims are left out of the process and their 
rights are ignored. I would emphasize that judicial review is a 
public process. Although judges have not admitted victim 
impact statements as evidence so far, this government has 
introduced legislation in the form of Bill C-41 which would 
permit the introduction of victim impact statements as a matter 
of course in these hearings. When passed, this amendment 
would give victims a greater role and achieve a better balance in 
the process.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would urge my colleagues to contemplate 
seriously what the courts have said in relation to this provision. 
For example in Regina v. Vaillancourt, the court concluded that 
section 745 hearings strike a balance between the considerations 
of leniency for the well-behaved convict in the serving of his 
sentence and the community interests in repudiation and 
deterrence. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the purpose of 
a section 745 hearing is to call attention to changes in the 
applicant's situation which might justifiably impose a less harsh 
penalty.
<P>
	While cynics such as the opposition Reform Party members 
may say that offenders cannot change, the Canadian Sentencing 
Commission noted that some offenders, and I quote: ``genuinely 
repent or make changes in their lives which alter their risk to the 
public or alter the public's interest in seeing them so severely 
punished''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously, the courts and the Canadian Sentencing 
Commission think it is both fair and justified to have a section 
that provides for a review of sentences, since human beings can 
change and rehabilitate.
<P>
	The clearest message of all probably comes from jurors, who 
are ordinary citizens like you and me, Mr. Speaker. To this day, 
36 juries have determined that the parole ineligibility period 
should be reduced for some applicants. Is this not clear evidence 
that this section is both fair and desirable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour for me to rise in this House today and speak in favour of 
Bill C-226, an act to amend the Criminal Code. We are debating 
this evening the repeal of a section of the Criminal Code that has 
raised outrage from coast to coast across Canada.
<P>
	Section 745 allows early release of convicted murderers. This 
section of the code sends a confusing message to Canadians. It 
sends a message that the federal government does not believe 
that murder is a very serious offence. It sends a message to 
judges that their sentences are not taken seriously any more. It 
sends a message to victims of violence that their pain is just not 
as important any more. It sends a message to criminals  that their 
crimes will be tolerated. It sends a message to all Canadians that 
their streets and playgrounds will not be as safe.
<P>
	Unfortunately a family in my riding has had personal 
experience with section 745 of the Criminal Code. I want to 
share with all members of the House the experience of Joanne 
Kaplinski whose brother was brutally murdered.
<P>
	On January 29, 1978 her brother Ken Kaplinski was working 
as a night clerk at the Continental Inn in Barrie. He was a hard 
working law-abiding citizen working to support himself and his 
little boy John who was then only three years old.
<P>
	The Continental Inn was robbed that evening of 
approximately $2,000. Joanne's brother was taken by car some 
two hours north of Barrie and was shot twice in the head at close 
range, execution style. His decomposed body was found in a 
snowbank some two months later. Subsequently two men, 
Edward Sales and Allan Kinsella, were each convicted of first 
degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with no 
parole for 25 years.
<P>
	But on January 29, Ken's survivors received a life sentence of 
their own. They became members of a very exclusive club to 
which no one wants to belong. The initiation fee is the death of a 
loved one by violence. Membership dues are extracted from the 
members each anniversary of the death of their loved one, each 
birthday that cannot be celebrated, each Christmas their loved 
one cannot come home for, and each and every day as survivors 
of such violence.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	The Kaplinski family endured two months of not knowing the 
whereabouts of Ken. They endured the police investigations, the 
public rumours, the media intrusions loaded with wild 
speculation and accusations. They endured the identification of 
his personal effects and the anxious wait for forensic 
identification of his body. They somehow survived the funeral 
and the clean-up of the remnants of their brother's life. They 
raised his young son. In sum, they have spent some 16 years 
coping with the aftermath of these two killers' actions.
<P>
	They got on with their lives, or rather got on with picking up 
the pieces of their shattered lives. Never would they see the 
world through the same eyes again. Evil was no longer some 
abstract concept; it became real and tangible. Their profound 
despair came from being forced to look into the abyss of human 
cruelty and selfishness.
<P>
	This past December they were once again forced to revisit that 
pain, to relive the nightmare of 1978. All their pain and horror 
was resurrected by the section 745 application of one of the 
murderers, Allan Kinsella. They thought that after the original 
trial the men responsible for taking Ken's life in such a cruel and 
brutal fashion were being made to pay for their actions by 
forfeiting at least 25 years of their lives under the conditions of 
incarceration. They simply could not believe that release  after 
serving only 15 years was an option. For Kinsella to have early 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7263"> 7263 </A></B>
<P>
parole seemed to them to make a mockery of the original 
sentence handed down by the trial judge.
<P>
	The public perception of lack of truth in sentencing serves to 
further erode the public's confidence in the justice system. They 
feel duped by the delays and doublespeak of the bureaucrats. By 
making available section 745 the judicial system is sending out a 
very clear message to society that murder indeed will be 
tolerated. It conveys a very sad statement about the value of our 
lives, yours and mine, as Canadian citizens.
<P>
	Fortunately for Canadian society and the Kaplinski family, 
justice was served in the Kinsella hearing. The jury rendered a 
decision to deny the application for a reduction in parole 
eligibility.
<P>
	However, the story does not have a happy ending. The family 
will again be required to revisit their pain when the 
co-convicted advances his application. They may never cancel 
their membership in the victims club, a club where membership 
indeed has no privileges.
<P>
	Joanne Kaplinski may not have had to endure a finding in 
favour of Allan Kinsella, but this is the exception and not the 
rule in most of these hearings. As of the end of March of this 
year, 43 reviews have been held under section 745 and only 11 of 
these convicts have been denied a reduction in sentence. In the 
majority of hearings, 31 in total, the criminal has received 
partial or full parole. This is totally unacceptable in the eyes of 
most Canadians.
<P>
	Our criminal justice system is overloaded with cases and 
burdened with high costs. The Kinsella hearing cost taxpayers 
over $100,000 and there are 600 more convicts waiting in line 
for their turn at a potential cost of some $60 million. Why would 
we even consider revisiting the final conviction of the worst 
kinds of criminals when there are so many more important cases 
to try?
<P>
	This country has a serious debt problem. There is no 
justification for spending our limited resources on such 
questionable reviews. Let us get the sentence right the first time, 
at the conclusion of the original trial and put the offender away 
for the full sentence with no exceptions.
<P>
	Many of the proponents of section 745 like to talk about how 
good it is that victims of violence will be able to read an impact 
statement at the judicial review. They mention the fairness that 
this implies. In their view this balances victims' rights with 
those assigned to the convicted.
<P>
	The truth is that currently there are no legal requirements for 
the crown to notify the victim's family so they may testify at 
these hearings. The judge may decide not to allow such 
statements. Even if such statements are allowed, what about the 
victims of the violence? What about the pain they must relive 
and the public scrutiny they must endure? Many victims may be 
fearful of the convicted and refuse to testify, and with  good 
reason considering the recent case of Allan Kinsella and the 
testimony of Joanne Kaplinski.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Now, as many members of the House will be aware, one of 
Ken Kaplinski's murderers has escaped from a so-called 
medium security prison near Kingston. As a result the Kaplinski 
family lives in terror. Joanne Kaplinski is now under 24-hour 
police supervision because she had the courage to stand up as a 
victim at the section 745 trial of Allan Kinsella, a trial that 
should never have taken place.
<P>
	Many of the supporters of section 745 have talked about the 
value of offering inmates faint hope. They believe convicts will 
be better behaved and work toward rehabilitation. We should not 
be providing incentives for prisoners to behave, this should be 
expected. Rehabilitation of prisoners is of secondary 
importance to deterrence and punishment. These arguments in 
favour of offering faint hope are just plain wrong.
<P>
	We have an immediate example in the case of Allan Kinsella. 
This brutal murderer should never have been given the time of 
day let alone an expensive court hearing and the right to intrude 
on the lives of his victims once again.
<P>
	There is no fairness in the system for the victims of violence. 
Sentencing should be certain and should be determined by the 
original judge in the original trial.
<P>
	The justice minister stated in this House yesterday that an 
amendment would be made to section 745 so that the courts 
would have to hear from the families of the victims. What if 
these families are too frightened or pained to testify? What if 
this is interpreted by the courts as non-interest by the victims 
and a point in favour of early release? This amendment would 
offer no guarantees to a public concerned about its safety.
<P>
	There are three principles that are fundamental to sentencing: 
deterrence, punishment and the protection of society. All of 
them may be violated by section 745 of the code. Deterrence is 
lessened by section 745 because a potential criminal knows his 
crime may not receive the otherwise full punishment available. 
Punishment may of course be violated because murderers who 
have been given a full sentence may get away with only serving 
three-fifths of it. Protection of society is lessened as more 
criminals are freed to commit more crimes and serve less time.
<P>
	For the sake of Joanne Kaplinski, for the sake of her family 
and indeed for all victims of this most brutal violence, let us put 
a stop to this madness and remove section 745.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7264"> 7264 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly there is a problem with the criminal system in this 
country. The criminal system needs the justice put back in it. 
This was an election issue and I was elected on a very specific 
platform. The Reform Party introduced a comprehensive policy 
on criminal justice during the 1993 election. It states very 
clearly where we stand on section 745.
<P>
	We support a criminal justice system that places the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens 
above all other objectives. We also state very specifically that 
we support amendments to the criminal law which ensure 
greater certainty in sentencing.
<P>
	I will close by asking all members to think of the Kaplinski 
family and indeed all other families who have lost loved ones to 
such senseless and vicious killers. Support Bill C-226 and 
remove section 745.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-226, tabled by the 
hon. member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	I have to admit that, when first asked if I wanted to discuss 
this issue, I almost decided to resort to demagogic comments 
such as: A criminal is the victim of his own action. All sorts of 
ideas like that are expressed and, unfortunately, too often by 
parties in this House, including the Reform Party, which I 
certainly respect. However, these comments sometime distort 
the reality.
<P>
	I have met a few individuals who did truly regrettable things, 
including murder. Some of them never repented; they wilfully 
committed their crime. Even after a rather long time in jail, they 
had not learned anything. I think they would have been capable 
of committing the same crime again. Yes, there are such 
individuals.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	We also have in mind the recent example of people who 
committed unfortunate acts. We know famous elected officials 
who ruined their careers by mere shoplifting, like the one who 
took a jacket from a department store.
<P>
	That is why I have always said that the brain is the weakest 
organ in the human body. The brain sometimes betrays its 
owner.
<P>
	Recently, in the Gaspé region, a father threw himself off a 
bridge with his three children. If this man had survived, I think 
he would have been the unhappiest of men. This unexplainable 
act is still a mystery.
<P>
	When dealing with a mistake made without forethought and 
often unintentionally, our society must not act out of revenge in 
handing down sentences and guarding prisoners. It is not up to 
society to avenge victims.
<P>
	Society benefits from the incarceration system, which 
removes dangerous offenders from its midst. However, it 
eventually realizes that these people are rehabilitated-as we 
often realize from the outset that rehabilitation is possible by 
reading pre-sentence reports, etc. As soon as  offenders start 
serving their sentences, correctional officers have a pretty good 
idea if they will eventually be able to reintegrate society.
<P>
	Jailing people also entails social costs, major repercussions 
on their immediate families, not to mention purely financial 
costs. Unfortunately, there have been reports lately that our 
prisons are overcrowded.
<P>
	I believe that section 745 of the Criminal Code, which this bill 
seeks to strike down, has its purpose in the sense that, in certain 
cases, it provides for the re-evaluation, after the fact, of the 
state of mind of individuals who committed crimes and allows 
for an assessment of the advisability of their release. There is 
nothing mandatory in section 745. The jury hearing the 
application is not obliged to release the inmate. This review can 
only take place 15 years after sentencing. Then, people who 
know right from wrong and can weigh the pros and cons, may 
recommend that the individual be released.
<P>
	I believe that in a society like ours, we must be able to afford 
acts of mercy of this kind since, as I mentioned before, 
sometimes people who committed crimes were not in their right 
minds at the time, a situation which can change after a while.
<P>
	Therefore, in my opinion, it would be mean and would not 
benefit society. It could even be costly. When people are truly 
repentant, when they acknowledge their wrongdoings, take 
appropriate actions to solve their problems while in prison, and 
get positive results, keeping them in prison would be an act of 
revenge on the part of society.
<P>
	A society which acts out of revenge is often ill-inspired and 
ill-advised. Revenge is a very poor adviser.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I know that there are heinous crimes. The Reform Party never 
fails to mention a few during Question Period. It is like an 
endless round of quotes from reporters on the police beat: ``In 
Winnipeg, between 42nd and 32nd Avenue, at 2.25 a.m., 
So-and-so stabbed and killed Ms. Someone, as she left the 
hospital where she worked. She was wearing hushpuppies''. 
And so on.
<P>
	We hear this time and time again, and every time the Reform 
Party asks for stiffer or longer sentences. There is truth in what 
they say. Society must not leave crime unpunished and violence 
should not rule our society. I heard the hon. member for York 
South-Weston during the referendum debate. I was not a 
member then, I was not even in politics, but I heard him speak 
heinously of Quebec. That was at the time of the Charlottetown 
and Meech Lake agreements and the hon. member was probably 
driven by his well-known fiery spirit. I can understand that, but 
in Quebec we were hurt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7265"> 7265 </A></B>
<P>
	We do not bear a grudge against the hon. member who 
introduced this bill. We understand that this fiery spirit of his 
and boundless love for this beautiful country can lead to the 
fits of anger he is known for.
<P>
	I read in the papers, yesterday, that the hon. member was 
himself the target of violence, and that he had to seek help and 
protection from the authorities, and I feel for him. I said to 
myself: a man of his intelligence must realize how violence 
feels-parliamentary violence, or verbal or political violence or 
whatever-we could even talk about ecological violence, for 
instance. Violence in any form, no matter who the perpetrator, is 
always bad, and I am sure the hon. member for York 
South-Weston realizes that now, which probably explains why, 
since last year, he has become extremely civil in his dealings 
with his colleagues in the Bloc.
<P>
	I think the hon. member has seen the light. He is aware that 
society can and must exercise a measure of clemency at some 
point. If society does not believe in rehabilitation, why did we 
get rid of capital punishment?
<P>
	I am somewhat baffled by all these considerations. The 
section they want to abolish was used by 40 people in the past 28 
years. I have seen no statistics to show that these people became 
repeaters or abused their freedom.
<P>
	For all these reasons, and considering the small number of 
cases that have come before the courts since this section came 
into effect, I am inclined to vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in this debate to strongly oppose Bill C-226. As 
has been mentioned the bill would remove the 15-year review 
with respect to parole eligibility for convicted murderers. I want 
to make clear that the provision we are talking about does not 
deal with the reduction of sentence. It deals with a change in the 
parole eligibility date, that is the date at which an individual 
offender can go before the parole board and request parole or 
release on to the street.
<P>
	We are talking about a provision which can change the parole 
eligibility date between 15 years and 25 years. It is not a 
reduction of sentence, because the sentence for murder is a life 
sentence and a life sentence cannot be changed by any provision 
in the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Prior to 1976 when capital punishment was on the books in a 
very limited way and the sentence for murder was life, the parole 
eligibility date was 10 years. When it was set at 10 years there 
were very few tragedies. As a matter of fact the average date of 
release on parole was not 10 years, although that was the 
eligibility date. It was more or less 15 years. The average date 
for people who were paroled was near 15 years. A good number 
of people who were eligible to go before the parole board at 10 
years were never released; they spent their entire lives in prison 
under a life sentence.
<P>
	The suggestion that parole eligibility dates mean automatic 
parole is nonsense, misleads the public and misleads the House.
<P>
	With the abolition of capital punishment in 1976 once again 
the sentence for murder was fixed at life. The parole eligibility 
was set at 10 years for second degree murder and 25 years for 
first degree murder but with the provision that an offender could 
seek review of the parole eligibility date at 15 years. Once again 
I repeat the sentence remained a life sentence.
<P>
	I hear people talking in this debate, in the press and so on 
about a 25-year sentence being reduced to 15 years. That is not 
the case. By the way, no one is automatically released at either 
15 or at 25 years. Offenders are paroled by the parole board and 
not by the provision of section 745. They are subject to 
conditions of parole, must report to a parole officer and can be 
returned to prison to continue a life sentence if they commit not 
only a minor offence but if they break the conditions of parole. I 
will deal with that in a minute.
<P>
	A person on parole is serving his sentence on the street, 
outside the institution, rather than serving it inside the 
institution. Under the section 745 process the offender must 
apply to the court in the province where the offence was 
committed for a review of his parole eligibility date. If the 
parole eligibility date was 25 years, the offender can ask the 
court to reduce it to at least 15 years. It can be set at any time 
between 15 and 25 years. The matter goes to a jury and the jury 
can only make a decision to reduce the eligibility date with a 
two-thirds majority; it is not a simple majority.
<P>
	If the jury reduces the parole eligibility date by a two-thirds 
vote the person is not released as suggested by the Reform 
member who spokes a few minutes before me. When the date 
arrives, if it is 17 years, the individual offender must go to the 
parole board to prove that he is no longer a danger to the public 
and has been rehabilitated. If he cannot prove that he is not 
paroled. It is never automatic. It is not automatic with the 
section 745 process and it is not automatic before the parole 
board.
<P>
	Furthermore the provision is not a loophole, nor was it ever 
hidden. It is a very specific provision written into law and set out 
very clearly. When members of Parliament voted on the measure 
in 1976 they knew exactly what it was and so did the press. It 
was not hidden. It was in the bill like any other measure. It can 
be read in the law right now. It is not a gap or a crack in the law. It 
was provided for intentionally. It was Liberal Party policy put 
forward by a Liberal government and supported by the majority 
in the Liberal Party and by the majority in the House. It is 
consistent with long time Liberal policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7266"> 7266 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is it there? It was put there because we in the Liberal 
Party believe that a reasonable parole eligibility provision is 
an incentive to reform. It gives hope. It provides for correction. 
It provides for redemption. It provides for an opportunity to 
start over again. It is also a control mechanism. When there are 
reasonable parole provisions people who work in the 
penitentiary or the institution can expect that prisoners will 
attempt to behave well. There are carrots or sticks and parole 
is a type of carrot which is an incentive to good behaviour and 
to reform.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, if the person is really reformed and no longer a 
danger to the public, that person after 15 years can be put back 
on the street to earn his or her living, to support his or her family 
and to pay taxes rather than being paid for by the state while in 
prison, while the family is being supported by welfare. I am 
talking about a person who is no longer a danger to the public, 
who is no longer a risk and who is deemed to be rehabilitated by 
the parole board.
<P>
	This is a Liberal Party policy and always has been. I can 
understand members of the Liberal Party wanting to change it if 
it did not work, if there was some massive failure in the 745 
provision, but that is not the case. Since 1976 when this 
provision was brought in, 128 people have been eligible to apply 
under section 745.
<P>
	Only 71 people have applied. The others perhaps felt they 
would not be accepted and did not even bother applying. As of 
March 31, of the 71 that have applied, 43 cases have been heard 
by courts with judge and jury. Of those 43, 19 were granted full 
reduction from 25 years to 15, 13 were granted a partial 
reduction, which means somewhere between 25 and 15, and 11 
were denied any reduction whatsoever.
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform Party did not mention that 
those persons that were granted a reduction in parole eligibility 
date were not released from prison. They had to go to the parole 
board when the eligibility date came up to apply for parole. 
What happened to them? After a change in their parole 
eligibility date, 30 of those cases finally went to the parole 
board. Of those only 11 were granted full parole; 6 were granted 
day parole; 2 were granted temporary absence and 11 were 
denied any kind of parole.
<P>
	Through this provision, of the 128 eligible since 1976, only 2 
have been returned to prison. One was returned, not for 
committing an offence, but for breaking the conditions of parole 
while out on the street. This person was put back in to serve a life 
sentence because the conditions of parole were broken. The 
other was put back in for an armed robbery offence.
<P>
	It means that out of 128 eligible people, one person was 
returned to prison for committing another offence. That is not a 
failure of the provision. Kinsella was mentioned in the examples 
that were given. Kinsella was turned down by the system.
<P>
	I have heard reference to Clifford Olson as if he was going to 
be accepted for parole. Of course Clifford Olson will have the 
right to go to the court in 15 years and ask for parole eligibility 
to be reduced, but he will never get it. He would have to go 
before the parole board.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to look at the profiles of the cases of those 
who have been released and those who have been turned down. 
They would realize that it is a red herring to suggest that Clifford 
Olson would be released under this provision. Charles Manson 
in the United States has gone to the parole board in that country 
six times because he was eligible. He has been turned down 
every time. He is not reformed, he is not rehabilitated and he is 
still a danger to the public. It is not automatic. We are simply 
talking about parole eligibility date.
<P>
	The Liberal Party definition of justice is not the Reform Party 
definition of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It is not 
revenge. That is not our definition of justice. We believe the 
purpose of the criminal justice system is to protect the public, 
including the public who work in prisons: the teachers; the 
correctional officers; all the people that must work in prison. 
They deserve protection too. That is the purpose of the criminal 
justice system. We believe that one of the best ways of 
protecting the public is by rehabilitation through treatment, 
through correction.
<P>
	Once people are rehabilitated and no longer a danger to the 
public it is ridiculous to keep them in prison forever, when they 
can be on the street doing good. One of the persons released 
under this provision won the medal for the best volunteer in 
Montreal a few years ago. That person came out of prison and 
established a reputation as an outstanding volunteer in the 
community.
<P>
	My time is up, but I want to say that the bill being presented 
by my colleague is not a Liberal bill. It is more of a Reform Party 
policy rather than a Liberal policy and it should be defeated.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-226 today.
<P>
	This is the type of legislation for which Canadians from all 
parts of the country have been calling. This is the second hour of 
debate on the bill and much of what has been said related also to 
the death penalty. I am not going to be addressing that issue. It 
remains part of the background of everything that we say. I am 
not speaking in cliches.
<P>
	Unfortunately I was not able to be in the House during the first 
hour of debate. However I did read <I>Hansard</I> to check what the 
other members of Parliament had to say about this bill. I was 
particularly outraged by what the Bloc Quebecois members 
said. I will quote from <I>Hansard</I> directly: ``For a person who has 
received a life sentence the parole system is the light at the end 
of the tunnel. I do not think that the victims' relatives will suffer 
after 20 years. They certainly have suffered and everybody  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7267"> 7267 </A></B>
<P>
deplores that fact. However, we do not have to always give in to 
the people who shout the loudest''.
<P>
	This statement is absolutely appalling. If the speaker had ever 
experienced the murder of a close friend or a relative I doubt that 
he would be speaking so casually. I do not think that the 
sentiments of that member represent mainstream Canadian 
values.
<P>
	On February 24, 1976 the Solicitor General of Canada 
introduced Bill C-84. This bill defined two categories of 
murder: first and second degree. As well Bill C-84 abolished the 
death penalty.
<P>
	According to section 231 of the Criminal Code, first degree 
murder is that which is planned and deliberate, the murder of 
police officers or prison guards acting in the course of their 
duties; or murder committed during hijacking, sexual assault or 
kidnapping.
<P>
	When Bill C-84 was introduced Jim Fleming, then 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Communications, 
said that it was most important to give criminals a glimmer of 
hope. He said that some incentive has to be left when such a 
terrible penalty is imposed on the most serious of all criminals. 
Incentive for what? My observation is incentive to con the 
system.
<P>
	Last week I received a fax from a citizen in Mississauga, 
Ontario who wrote of the horrendous story involving the murder 
of RCMP Constable Brian King in 1978. The writer is a nephew 
of Mr. King. I understand that the member for York 
South-Weston had previously mentioned this story in his 
speech, but I think it is too important not to mention it again.
<P>
	Constable Brian King was an RCMP officer in Saskatchewan 
and was on that fateful night to be the trophy of two men who 
were full of hate, determined to stalk, capture and kill a cop. 
They wanted their friends to see how powerful they were. The 
two successfully distracted Brian, overpowered him, seized his 
service revolver, secured him with handcuffs, threatened him at 
gunpoint and eventually went on to murder him with two rounds 
into the skull. This was no crime of passion. This was cold, 
calculated, premeditated murder.
<P>
	They were both sentenced to life imprisonment with no 
eligibility for parole for 25 years. When the two men were 
sentenced one commented: ``What's 25 years?''. Twenty-five 
years is not a deterrent.
<P>
	Under section 745 these two same murderers were eligible for 
an early review. Constable King's family now has to suffer 
through months of reliving the memories and the grief as well as 
the fear that these convicted cop killers will be out, possibly to 
kill again.
<P>
	The Bloc member who said that the families will get over it in 
20 years has not read a letter like this nor has he spoken with any 
person who has gone through such a trauma. What kind of 
representation is that?
<P>
	There is more to section 745 than just the simple direction of 
it. The entire parole system is in disrepute with Canadians. My 
office has received letters concerning  the operation of the 
parole system. In almost every case the comments are that the 
parole board does not do what it is supposed to do. However, the 
mission statement of the National Parole Board paints a rather 
nice rosy picture. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The National Parole Board, as part of the criminal justice system, makes 
independent, quality conditional release and pardon decisions and clemency 
recommendations. The board, by facilitating the timely reintegration of 
offenders as law-abiding citizens, contributes to the protection of society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On October 6 the new chairman of the parole board appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. At 
that time I asked him whether he could give me a written job 
description of exactly what the chairman does. Unfortunately at 
the time he was not aware of any written documentation on this 
but stated that he would get back to me with some information.
<P>
	I received a letter from Mr. Gibbs this past Monday but no full 
job description that could be used for performance evaluation 
was included. Instead this was what was written: ``Further to my 
recent appearance before the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs on October 6 and your request to be provided with 
a copy of the chairman's job description, I wish to report that 
such a document has never been produced. I can assure you 
however that although no written mandate has been provided, 
my role is well defined in law and policy and my expectations 
very clear''.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	After reading this and understanding the climate of 
unaccountability that this represents, I know exactly why 
Canadians are upset that they are paying top level bureaucrats 
six figure salaries to state that they only know by word of mouth 
what their job entails. It is a matter of trust. It is a matter of 
public accountability.
<P>
	Let me talk briefly about the success rate of our great parole 
system. From April 1978 to March 1988 there were 17,444 cases 
of offenders released. As of March 1993, 73.6 per cent 
successfully completed their terms of supervision.
<P>
	Some might look at that and say that is an excellent result. I do 
not. The remaining 26.4 per cent were split between two 
categories: 2,494 cases violated their conditions of parole and 
2,111 cases violated parole because of committing a new 
criminal offence. All in all, this is a rather poor success rate.
<P>
	This past summer Allan Kinsella, a convicted murderer, asked 
the court for release after serving 15 years of his life sentence. 
His appeal for a section 745 hearing was denied. Because of that 
Kinsella got mad from this procedure and then with another 
inmate escaped last week. Police are still searching for these two 
men who are considered to be dangerous.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7268"> 7268 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me recap these events. First, Kinsella commits a murder 
and is sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for 25 
years. Second, at 15 years into Kinsella's sentence section 745 
of the Criminal Code kicks in. Third, December 13, 1993 the 
section 745 review is denied. Fourth, in July Kinsella is 
transferred to the Bath institution in spite of the fact that the 
assistant attorney general for Ontario sent letters to the 
Solicitor General warning that Kinsella was dangerous and 
unsuitable for transfer and that there was a good chance he 
would attempt to escape. Fifth, on October 19 Kinsella and 
another inmate escaped and are now considered dangerous.
<P>
	I should not be having to give this example because if section 
745 had not even been put into place and had the Solicitor 
General of Canada been doing his job, Kinsella would now be 
locked up in Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison 
for dangerous offenders, exactly what Kinsella is and always has 
been.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated in the House that the 
government's position is crystal clear. Let me quote from 
<I>Hansard</I>: ``We introduced an amendment to section 745 to 
provide plainly that whenever an application is brought under 
this section that the court is obligated to hear from the families 
of the victims''.
<P>
	I say including the victim in a process may be good but it is 
not good if a murderer gets out on early parole. I would really 
question whether Liberal backbenchers across the way know 
what the minister is really saying. People are fighting for life to 
mean life and not to make a statement at a parole hearing that 
might have little effect on keeping a prisoner in prison.
<P>
	My question to the justice minister yesterday certainly 
revealed that the government is completely out of sync with 
what Canadians want on this measure.
<P>
	People are in prison for a reason. In the case of murder they 
took someone else's life and for that they should serve life. 
Section 745 brings disrepute to the operation of the justice 
system and its presence in the Criminal Code has implications 
beyond the technicalities of the section.
<P>
	I call on the members of this House, the people have spoken 
and now it is time for the people's representatives to speak and 
vote for this bill regardless of what the justice minister says.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to join in the debate on Bill C-226 which seeks to 
repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In 1976 Parliament restructured the law of homicide. At that 
time Bill C-84 essentially brought into being the current regime 
for murder. It reclassified murder according to degrees, first and 
second degree murder, and provided a mandatory minimum life 
sentence. For first degree murder parole may not be considered 
for 25 years. For second degree murder that period is generally 
reduced to between 10 and 25 years as imposed by a judge.
<P>
	Bill C-84 at that time also created the application for judicial 
review which has become section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
That section provides that a person who has been convicted of 
high treason, first degree murder or second degree murder with a 
parole eligibility date beyond 15 years to apply to the 
appropriate chief justice in the province where the conviction 
took place for a reduction in the offender's parole ineligibility 
period. The application may only be made after the offender has 
served at least 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	Some hon. members and others would have people believe 
that this provision was hidden away in the bill and was sneaked 
through Parliament without parliamentary scrutiny. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.
<P>
	The solicitor general of the day who sponsored the bill called 
attention to the proposal during second reading debate. During 
the deliberations of the House of Commons Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs, to which the bill was referred, the 
provision was again closely examined.
<P>
	Indeed during the committee hearings the provision was 
amended. The amendment was subsequently endorsed by the 
House of Commons and by the Senate. At second reading of Bill 
C-84, the solicitor general of the day explained that the proposal 
provided a built in additional incentive to motivate the inmate to 
rehabilitate himself or herself and provide a protection for 
prison guards.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code provides these same 
benefits today. The very fact of having section 745 in the 
Criminal Code can serve as an incentive for an inmate to attempt 
to change his or her ways. As many murderers are ultimately 
released on parole, it behoves us to do all we can to encourage 
these persons to rehabilitate themselves. The interests of public 
protection are better served having section 745 in place than by 
repealing it as the bill seeks to do.
<P>
	We should also keep in mind the enormous economic and 
social costs of detaining inmates for prolonged periods of 
imprisonment. Moreover, to repeal this section would make the 
life of prison guards that much more difficult in managing 
murderers serving life sentences, people without hope within 
the walls of our penitentiaries. I am one of those Canadians who 
feels that prison guards perform an important and difficult task 
for the benefit of the rest of us and that they deserve our 
protection and our support. Accordingly section 745 should 
remain in the Criminal Code.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7269"> 7269 </A></B>
<P>
	Originally Bill C-84 proposed that the offender would have 
the right to apply to a chief justice for judicial review. The chief 
justice would then appoint three judges to consider the 
application. An amendment was moved at committee to have 
the proposed three judges replaced by judge and jury, in which 
two-thirds of the jury must agree on the decision to retain or 
reduce the parole ineligibility period.
<P>
	According to the procedure which still exists today the 
public's interest is expressed by the persons acting as a jury in 
these proceedings. The change was made to ensure that 
sufficient public input would be brought to bear in these 
hearings. The change was a good change because it ensures that 
the community's view of the matter will prevail over the system 
professionals. It was a change that made sense and it is not 
surprising that it received parliamentary support.
<P>
	Even today the decision to retain or reduce the offender's 
parole ineligibility period at section 745 hearings rests with the 
jury. Jury members are drawn from the province in which the 
conviction took place. They represent that community.
<P>
	In making its decision the jury shall consider the character of 
the applicant, the applicant's conduct while serving his or her 
sentence, the nature of the offence for which the applicant was 
convicted, and such other matters as the presiding judge deems 
relevant in the circumstances. The jury is thus not bound to 
agree to the applicant's request. It makes its decision in light of 
information brought forward at the hearing.
<P>
	I believe these hearings can be very difficult for the families 
of victims. Part of the reason for this is that in the past victims' 
families have been frustrated by being denied any participation. 
In many cases they could not make representations or be heard at 
all.
<P>
	The present Minister of Justice in Bill C-41, the sentencing 
bill introduced in the House last June, addresses the issue. That 
bill proposes to amend section 745 of the Criminal Code to 
ensure that if an offender applies for early parole eligibility, the 
court will be obliged to admit into evidence information from 
the victim's family. This evidence will be considered by the jury 
in deciding to retain or reduce the period of parole ineligibility. 
This proposed change would help victims' families. It does not 
force them to testify. It makes their evidence admissible.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	It is worth noting that there are a number of other proposals in 
Bill C-41 which deal effectively with other concerns of victims. 
I would like to make one thing very clear. Because an offender is 
allowed to apply for early parole this in no way means that it will 
be granted. The jury has the absolute power to say no to an 
offender who applies for a reduced ineligibility period. A 
reduction or immediate termination of the offender's parole 
ineligibility period is not guaranteed. Further, if the jury  
decides to reduce or terminate this period, the offender's actual 
release on parole is not guaranteed.
<P>
	Discussions of section 745 bring out a tide of emotions on all 
fronts. Victims' families and victim action groups must have a 
strong voice in our criminal justice system. Their experience 
and perspective offer very specific and valuable input. With the 
victim impact statement they are given the opportunity to have 
their voices heard. We need to establish a balanced approach 
toward every aspect of our criminal justice system, and I think 
section 745 provides that balance.
<P>
	With this in mind it is important in this debate to say a few 
words about conditional release and to discuss the important 
role that the National Parole Board plays in the overall process. 
As well, ongoing initiatives by the government to strengthen the 
National Parole Board merit our attention.
<P>
	The decision whether to grant parole to an offender is the 
responsibility and the decision of the National Parole Board. 
The granting of parole is not guaranteed to an offender who has 
been successful before the court in having his or her parole 
ineligibility period reduced or terminated at a section 745 
hearing.
<P>
	Understandably the National Parole Board has a difficult job 
to do but it is equipped to do it. National Parole Board members 
come from diverse background and from all regions of the 
country. They take their jobs seriously. Board members are 
assisted in their decision making by a set of criteria developed 
by the board to assess an offender's chances of obeying the law 
if released on parole. They are also assisted by information 
provided to them by Correctional Service Canada, the RCMP 
and other police services throughout the country.
<P>
	I am thoroughly in support of the government's steps to 
strengthen the National Parole Board. The appointment process 
is currently under review to make certain that appointments to 
the board are on the basis of competence. As part of this process 
openings for full time board members will be advertised in the 
<I>Canada Gazette</I>. The qualifications of applicants will be 
carefully examined with board members chosen on the basis of 
merit, competence and integrity.
<P>
	As hon. members will know, last June the Solicitor General 
tabled Bill C-45. Among other things the bill proposes that a 
mechanism be created to permit the discipline or removal from 
office of National Parole Board members in specified 
circumstances. This measure was introduced to increase 
accountability.
<P>
	The board itself remains committed to ongoing training for 
board members. The training programs are geared to improving 
sensitivity in decision making and to increasing responsiveness 
to community needs. All new members, for example, undergo an 
intensive orientation program.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	To conclude, I believe that section 745 hearings serve a 
useful purpose. Mechanisms are in place to ensure adequate 
public protection. The Minister of Justice has introduced Bill 
C-41-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The member's time has 
expired unless there is unanimous consent. There are two or 
three minutes left in the debate. Does the member wish to seek 
unanimous consent to continue?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is requesting 
unanimous consent to continue with her remarks. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Bill C-41 proposes to 
codify the right of victims' families to make their views known 
in these hearings. The Minister of Justice will also continue to 
monitor the operation of the section to determine if any other 
improvements need to be made. In addition, initiatives are under 
way to strengthen the composition and the workings of the 
National Parole Board.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	As you can see from my remarks this evening, Mr. Speaker, 
there are several reasons for which I cannot support Bill C-226.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley wishes to start his speech.
<P>
	Since he wishes to take the floor next time we will call it 7.12 
p.m. and the member will have the floor next time the matter is 
before the House.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93 the 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I had the opportunity to ask a question 
with regard to manpower training and I could feel the minister 
does not really understand the situation in Quebec. Therefore, I 
would like to take this opportunity to give more information so 
that people understand the basis for the consensus existing in 
Quebec on the issue of claiming jurisdiction over manpower 
training.
<P>
	You know there is, in Quebec, an agency called Forum sur 
l'emploi. It is a forum for stakeholders from every field of 
endeavour, such as social sciences, economics, or culture, and 
they all came to the same conclusion:  ``Quebec forms a specific 
region in the economic, cultural and social terms. It is a natural 
unit and, if we want to implement a dynamic employment 
policy, if we want Quebecers to make the best possible use of 
their human resources, we must have control over all the 
development programs related to manpower training''.
<P>
	This is all the easier because both the Canadian Constitution 
and the British North America Act state that education comes 
under provincial jurisdiction. Therefore, the issue of manpower 
training as we now call it, including the reform of social security 
programs and continued training, should also belong to Quebec. 
Quebec would then have all the necessary tools for its 
development.
<P>
	We must remember it was only in the 1942 Constitution that 
unemployment insurance was turned over to the federal 
government. Before that, provinces also had jurisdiction in that 
area. So the Fathers of Confederation really meant for anything 
related to training and manpower, or just simply training, to be a 
provincial responsibility, in particular because of Quebec's 
French identity.
<P>
	That is why I am asking the government why it does not agree 
to that totally logical request, which has met with unanimous 
approval in Quebec, and allow the province to have control over 
the development of its human resources, which are, and which 
will increasingly be, the source of all development.
<P>
	By making the fullest use of our potential, we will build a 
society better suited to adapt quickly to all aspects of 
competition on the global market. There is always, in the 
background, the special situation of Quebec, the only place in 
America where you find a majority of francophones, which 
implies different practices, in particular regarding population 
mobility.
<P>
	As regards mobility we cannot apply the same policies, 
objectives and national standards to Quebec as we do to the rest 
of Canada. That is why I am asking the government to explain its 
lack of understanding of the Quebec fact and to tell us why it 
does not accept our request, which is made not only by the Bloc 
Quebecois but by all stakeholders in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very interested to hear what the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup had to say, and, of course, he 
conforms to the separatist rhetoric. I agree that the Constitution 
provides for the rights of the provinces in certain jurisdictions.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7271"> 7271 </A></B>
<P>
	In this particular case, the federal government has made it 
very clear where the difference lies between the two 
jurisdictions in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the elements of the federal government's agenda is in 
fact the rebuilding of Canada's social security system. Creating 
jobs and growth requires the modernization of our social labour 
market and learning programs. One of the key principles of the 
reform that has been proposed is to provide greater clarity, as I 
indicated, in the roles of the federal and provincial 
governments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government has taken a major step towards a new 
partnership on labour market programs. The federal 
government's main objective is to improve services for 
Canadians, to make those services more effective and to 
eliminate any duplication and wasteful spending.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a result, in June of this year the Minister of Human 
Resources Development invited interested provinces and 
territories to assume increased responsibilities in the labour 
market sector. The federal offer entails implementation of a 
three year interim labour market agreement with each province 
which could be put in place immediately. The 
federal-provincial discussions are currently under way across 
this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, we are still waiting for a reply from the Government 
of Quebec. The federal offer includes:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Provincial planning of $480 million worth of federal labour 
market programs in Quebec, about 60 per cent of the federal 
labour market program budget; provincial management of 
federal purchase of institutional training, valued at $140 million 
in the case of Quebec; provincial planning and implementation 
of a network of single window offices that would put together 
under one roof the programs and services of both levels of 
government; and provincial management of certain other 
federal programs such as co-operative education, stay in school 
programs and Canada employment centres for students, valued 
at $12 million in Quebec.
<P>
	With regard to the estimates of massive wastage, although the 
federal government has heard a number of such claims over 
recent years, there has never been any serious analysis to 
support these kinds of numbers. These huge claims have no 
basis in fact.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member to consider the federal proposal and 
urge the Government of Quebec to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 7.18 p.m., this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).

	(The House adjourned at 7.18 p.m.)
