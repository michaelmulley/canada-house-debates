	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
has been almost 100 days since the government took office.
<P>
	We have established a clear approach of being straight with 
Canadians, of facing difficult problems head on and dealing 
with them decisively. That is what we intend to do today. We 
intend to deal with smuggling and to take steps to re-establish 
the rule of law. A civilized society requires that the rule of law 
be respected, that it be enforced and that it apply equally to all 
citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are confronted today with a very serious problem which is 
not limited to tobacco smuggling alone. I want to take a few 
minutes to explain the magnitude of the problem, to discuss the 
options and to tell Canadians why we have come to the 
conclusions we have reached.
<P>
	Many Canadians in the past days and weeks have been 
discussing among themselves the whole issue of smuggling and 
in particular the consequences of cigarette smuggling. I think it 
is fair to say that no one can be certain of the right approach. We 
all have doubts about any course of action. We are dealing with a 
very complex problem of law enforcement and organized crime, 
with health issues, with federal-provincial relations, even with 
relations with aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	This is not an issue of left or right, or English or French, or 
aboriginal or non-aboriginal. This is an issue in which there is 
no absolute right answer and no absolute wrong answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Governing is supposed to be the art of the possible. What I am 
announcing this morning is what this government believes is the 
best possible solution to an almost impossible problem. Let me 
explain.
<P>
	Many Canadians and many members of the House may not 
realize how deep rooted and far reaching the contraband tobacco 
trade has become. This is a problem that has grown over several 
years. There was a question asked in the House of Commons in 
1990 by the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell about 
this problem. Almost four years later we are still faced with the 
problem.
<P>
	This problem has grown over several years. It is no longer a 
regional problem confined to specific communities and areas. It 
is now a national problem requiring a national solution.
<P>
	At first the smuggling was just in Quebec and some Atlantic 
provinces. It has now spread to Ontario in which 35 per cent of 
cigarettes sold are now contraband. It is growing in western 
Canada. It has a foothold in virtually every part of the country 
and is spreading at an alarming rate.
<P>
	Let us consider the facts. Illegal tobacco now accounts for 
about 40 per cent of the $12.4 billion Canadian tobacco market. 
Organized crime now controls up to 95 per cent of the 
contraband tobacco entering the country. More than two million 
Canadians are purchasing this contraband.
<P>
	More than $1 billion in federal tobacco tax revenues and $1 
billion in provincial revenues were lost in 1993. These losses 
will climb steadily if action is not taken, and the social costs in 
terms of increased crime and violence in loss of business to law 
abiding merchants and in lawlessness are considerable and 
growing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1030"> 1030 </A></B>
<P>
	As the portion of the Canadian market supplied by smuggled 
tobacco has increased, the average price paid for cigarettes has 
dropped. Access to cheap contraband tobacco undermines the 
government's health policy objectives to reduce tobacco 
consumption, particularly among youth.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	I want to stress this last point. The issue is not how to keep 
prices high so that young people do not smoke. The issue is how 
to keep cheap contraband cigarettes out of the hands of young 
people. Quite frankly that is the great dilemma we all face today.
<P>
	The organized crime networks that control 95 per cent of the 
tobacco smuggling also supply and distribute smuggled liquor, 
firearms and drugs. It is essential that we take strong steps to 
dismantle these organized crime networks. That is what we are 
going to do starting today.
<P>
	Our actions today are aimed at these gangs. They are aimed at 
the tobacco companies that have benefited from this illegal 
trade and that also bear responsibility. They are aimed at the 
breakdown in respect for the law that this trade creates. This 
breakdown cannot and will not be tolerated.
<P>
	I say to those Canadians who buy smuggled goods, I know 
they must be frustrated with taxes. They should stop a minute 
and think of what they are doing when they buy contraband 
tobacco. They might think it is a victimless crime. That is a 
myth. When they buy contraband cartons of cigarettes they are 
not just saving a few dollars for themselves. They are directly 
supporting organized crime. Every time they light up they are 
supporting gangs that have committed murders and car 
bombings, that are smuggling illegal drugs into Canada, that are 
terrorizing entire communities.
<P>
	If they do not like some of the things their tax dollars get 
wasted on, they should think of the investment they make in 
buying illegal tobacco. They should think of the decent, honest 
business men and women they are pushing out of business. They 
should think of the revenues that are not available to the 
government for health and social services. They should think of 
the consequences of their actions and they will understand why 
the government will not allow some Canadians to take the law 
into their own hands.
<P>
	We will not allow this breakdown of respect for the law to 
continue. That is why I am announcing a four point action plan 
to combat smuggling. The four elements of this action plan are 
an enforcement crackdown, a reduction of consumer taxes on 
tobacco, special action on tobacco manufacturers and the most 
intensive anti-smoking campaign in Canadian history.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I speak, the RCMP is dramatically stepping up 
enforcement, particularly at key spots along the Canada-U.S. 
border. The government will substantially increase RCMP and 
Customs personnel dedicated to  fighting smuggling. Along 
with these resources are new strategies to crack down on 
organized smuggling groups and to increase surveillance of 
these groups.
<P>
	The Department of Justice will increase prosecutions, and 
make full use of proceeds of crime legislation. The RCMP and 
other enforcement agencies will focus their resources on the 
major player controlling smuggling: organized crime.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	This enforcement will be applied everywhere-and 
anywhere-there is illegal smuggling activity. There will be no 
refuge for criminals. ``No go'' areas are not acceptable in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There will be no ``no go'' zone in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is one country with one set of laws that applies to all 
citizens and in all communities. Increased pressure on criminals 
in the contraband trade will succeed in disrupting illegal trade in 
alcohol, drugs and firearms, as well as tobacco. But this is only 
part of the answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While we will put great effort into enforcement we also need 
to weaken the market for smuggled tobacco products. At present 
the demand is high and so are profits: $500 for a case of 
contraband cigarettes, half a million dollars or more for a 
truckload. We need to change this. Nothing would please me 
more than to be able to address the problem simply through law 
enforcement combined with an export tax.
<P>
	The best advice the government can get is that law 
enforcement and an export tax alone is simply insufficient to 
curb the growth in smuggling activities. It is advice that I accept 
with great reluctance. If the House agrees I would like to table 
the letter of the commissioner of the RCMP, addressed to me, 
and ask that it be printed as part of today's <I>Hansard</I>. In his letter 
the commissioner said very clearly to me that if we want to 
resolve this problem in short order we have to do this. With the 
permission of the House I would like to table a copy of this letter 
so that it can be printed in <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it agreed that this letter be printed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See Appendix.</I>]
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Therefore, much as we may 
all regret the necessity of lowering cigarette taxes, we must do 
so at least until we have put the smuggling networks out of 
business. Then we will be able to restore the appropriate level of 
taxation that the situation needs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1031"> 1031 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have taken steps today to immediately lower the federal 
excise tax by $5 a carton. We have also informed the provinces 
that we will match dollar for dollar any reduction they make 
above $5. The total federal reduction will not exceed $10 per 
carton.
<P>
	The provinces will be able to choose their own rate of 
participation. Of course, the largest reduction in taxes will occur 
in provinces where the problem is most severe.
<P>
	The cost to the federal government is significant. Smuggling 
has steadily eroded federal revenues each year for the last three 
years. The best estimate of the Department of Finance is that 
today's tax cuts will reduce revenues in fiscal year 1994-95 by 
approximately $300 million.
<P>
	But this action, combined with the enforcement measures 
planned, will stop this tax revenue erosion and stabilize the 
contribution which tobacco taxation makes to the federal 
treasury, and eventually to restore an effective taxation level to 
help discourage smoking. In the short term we will no doubt lose 
revenue.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The cost of inaction will be much higher. Federal and 
provincial governments will continue to lose huge and growing 
amounts of revenue. We will have lost more than the money I 
indicated we are losing anyway and, of course, organized crime 
will flourish.
<P>
	We do not want tobacco manufacturers to receive any benefit 
from the difficult decision we have made today. The fact is the 
that Canadian manufacturers have benefited directly from this 
illegal trade. They have known perfectly well that their tobacco 
exports to the United States have been re-entering Canada 
illegally. I believe they have not acted responsibly.
<P>
	It is going to end now with taxation and regulatory measures. 
The government is imposing immediately an export tax of $8 per 
carton on Canadian tobacco exports. This export tax reflects the 
fact that 80 per cent of cigarettes being sold on the black market 
are Canadian cigarettes that were manufactured for export. The 
new export tax will work to reduce the profitability of tobacco 
smuggling.
<P>
	We are imposing, effective immediately, a substantial 
increase in corporate taxes on Canadian tobacco manufacturers. 
We are imposing a three-year health promotion surtax on 
tobacco manufacturing profits. The surtax will increase the 
federal tax rate on manufacturing and processing tobacco 
products from 21 per cent to 30 per cent. Companies will pay 40 
per cent more federal tax on manufacturing profits than they 
have in the past and the federal government will receive up to 
$200 million in extra revenue over the three years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The money generated by this surtax will fund the largest 
anti-smoking campaign this country has ever seen.
<P>
	The government will also require manufacturers to clearly 
mark their cigarettes to distinguish those for domestic use from 
those for export use. This will greatly help our enforcement 
efforts because smuggled cigarettes will be easily recognizable.
<P>
	It is quite simple: if people smoke legal cigarettes in Canada, 
every one around them will be able to tell they are smoking legal 
cigarettes. I think that, once the distinction between legal and 
illegal cigarettes has become obvious, many people will prefer 
to be seen smoking legal cigarettes rather than illegal ones, and 
smuggling will decrease accordingly.
<P>
	Through legislation, regulation and education, the 
government will take action to discourage Canadians, especially 
children, from taking up smoking or continuing to use tobacco 
products.
<P>
	For years the government's policy of forcing up the price of 
tobacco through taxes resulted-it did-in a steady decline in 
the number of Canadians who smoke. It was particularly 
effective at keeping young people from starting.
<P>
	But the fact is that today cheap, contraband cigarettes are 
readily available to Canadians everywhere. Under such 
circumstances, controls on the distribution, sale and 
consumption of cigarettes are useless.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The government recognizes that lower taxes and therefore 
lower prices for legally purchased cigarettes may prompt some 
people, particularly young Canadians, to smoke more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is why the government will take strong action to 
discourage smoking, including legislated and regulatory 
changes to ban the manufacture of kiddie packs targeted at 
young buyers, raise the legal age for purchasing cigarettes, 
increase fines for the sale of cigarettes to minors, drastically 
restrict the locations for vending machines, and make health 
warnings on tobacco packaging more effective.
<P>
	We will also examine the feasibility of requiring plain 
packaging of cigarettes and will also ask the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Health to make recommendations in 
this area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are also launching immediately a comprehensive public 
education campaign including a national media campaign to 
make young people aware of the harmful effects of smoking; 
new efforts to reach families, new parents and others who serve 
as role models for children; support of school education 
programs; increased efforts to reach young women who are 
starting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1032"> 1032 </A></B>
<P>
to smoke; and new approaches for reaching groups who have not 
responded to earlier campaigns.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are determined through the four point national plan I have 
outlined today to eliminate smuggling as a significant national 
problem. Even more, this program will help restore respect for 
the laws of the land, will help restore safety in our border 
communities and will help destroy smuggling rings.
<P>
	I will be honest with Canadians. This has not been an easy 
decision for the government or for me. I know it is not a perfect 
solution but, more important, I know there is no perfect 
solution. We have come up with a fair, workable, decisive action 
plan. I am convinced it is the right thing to do.
<P>
	I ask members of the House and all other Canadians for their 
help and support. It is our responsibility to end this unacceptable 
situation that is destroying all the values in our land. Three or 
four years of tolerance of smuggling and people defying the law 
is unacceptable. We have to restore order and respect in our 
land. This is what we have decided to do and we shall succeed.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start 
by apologizing for the absence of the leader of the opposition, 
who had a previous engagement in Montreal North, made more 
than two months ago, while we only had a 24-hour notice of the 
Prime Minister's statement.
<P>
	I would also like to say that I deplore the government's lack of 
courtesy, considering that for the past three weeks, it was the 
Official Opposition that moved this issue along, patiently 
asking question after question, day in day out, to make the 
government and the Prime Minister realize there was a problem.
<P>
	I may add that despite our contribution, the government gave 
us only 24 hours notice that there would be a statement, ordering 
a briefing session behind closed doors at 9 a.m. today. Our 
members did not come out of the lockup until 10 a.m., when the 
Prime Minister started his statement in the House. Obviously, 
we would have liked to examine carefully every aspect of the 
action plan announced by the Prime Minister. We would have 
liked to provide a thorough analysis-based on the figures-of 
each of these measures, because there are measures that would 
require further study.
<P>
	At this stage, we cannot do much more than give our 
impressions of several aspects of the plan. I may recall that three 
weeks ago, in response to our first questions in this House, the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance said that the tax on 
cigarettes would not be changed. Three weeks ago, the Prime 
Minister told us that the RCMP was doing its job and was doing 
it very well. It was arresting all smugglers, and if the opposition 
had any names, it should say so. Three weeks ago, the Prime 
Minister told us that the law was being enforced throughout 
Canadian territory, without any problems.
<P>
	Today, the government said, basically, that there is a problem 
with cigarette smuggling. The law is not fully enforced 
throughout Canadian territory, and so far the RCMP has not been 
able to prevent these unlawful sales of cigarettes and tobacco. 
That is what we heard this morning. Today the Prime Minister 
hit the jackpot, after three weeks of making what proved to be 
totally inaccurate statements.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are sceptical, 
because the Prime Minister says that from now on the law will 
be enforced throughout this country, no exceptions.
<P>
	The RCMP's has figures that both confirm and emphasize the 
figures of the Official Opposition, according to which in 1993, 
only one per cent of contraband cigarettes were seized by their 
officers. I repeat, one per cent, while today we heard, as we were 
told in the lock-up, that 70 to 75 per cent of this unlawful trade 
was being carried on through Mohawk territory in southern 
Quebec and southern Ontario. Seventy-five per cent of this 
trade is carried on in those territories. So far, the RCMP has been 
unable to improve its score of one per cent interception, and 
today we are told that 350 additional officers should be able to 
deal with the matter.
<P>
	It may be a significant improvement, but there are a number of 
very serious questions that have yet to be resolved. We have 
chiefs of Amerindian nations and the Mohawks saying they have 
arms on the reserves and that any police intervention might 
cause a blood bath. It might lead them to use the illegal weapons 
now on the reserves. The question that I should be asking the 
Prime Minister, and one that will most certainly be put to him, is 
this: Good God, what means does the RCMP have now that it did 
not have before to intervene and intercept the remaining 99 per 
cent of smugglers who conduct their business virtually in broad 
daylight? Is it that it lacks the means to intervene or does it fear 
reprisals from persons who are illegally armed?
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister informs us that an $8 export tax will be 
imposed on each carton of cigarettes. I will remind you that a 
similar tax was introduced in 1992, only to be withdrawn two or 
three months later because it proved to be completely 
ineffective. Why could the government not come up with a more 
original solution that simply to reintroduce a tax that only a 
short while ago proved to be totally unworkable, inadequate and 
unenforceable?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1033"> 1033 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, the government has stated forcefully that tobacco 
manufacturers would be hit with a surtax in order to finance a 
health promotion campaign. We fully endorse a health 
campaign. However, what the Prime Minister has failed to say is 
that there is a danger that the first chance they get, 
manufacturers will pass on the cost of the surtax to consumers 
through a price increase. Has the Prime Minister received any 
assurances that the surtax to be paid by tobacco manufacturers 
will not, at some point, be passed on to Quebec or Canadian 
consumers? The Prime Minister was silent on this matter and the 
whole issue remains unresolved.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that these two measures, 
namely an export tax and a surtax on tobacco manufacturers, 
could drive jobs out of Canada. Manufacturers could be inclined 
to produce the same quality of cigarettes somewhere else where 
they would not have to pay the surtax or the export tax. Does he 
not see the danger not only of failing to take highly effective 
means to get to the root of the problem, but also of driving our 
manufacturers out of the country? Has the Prime Minister 
received assurances that manufacturers will go along with this 
measure, stay here in Canada and pay taxes to finance the health 
promotion campaign? This question too remains unanswered.
<P>
	Is there not some risk that the refusal of the other provincial 
governments to participate in the Prime Minister's action plan 
will create a serious problem elsewhere than in Quebec? Is there 
not some risk that the smuggling network, the contraband 
activity and the illegal sale of cigarettes will move to southern 
Ontario and to other Canadian provinces since measures will be 
in place in Quebec to curb this illegal activity? Has the Prime 
Minister made provision for a mechanism which would ensure 
that the problem is simply not shifted elsewhere? I remind him 
that his government would then also be responsible for the 
illegal cigarette trade outside Quebec. His government would 
then have to take measures that would be applied everywhere in 
Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would simply like to say that the Prime 
Minister's action plan will have a limited effect. First, only 
Quebec has agreed so far to come on board. Second, the plan 
would drive away well paid jobs in the tobacco manufacturing 
sector. Third, it is not likely that the RCMP will succeed in 
properly controlling the contraband tobacco trade which is 
taking place mainly on native reserves. I remind you that thus 
far, the RCMP's success rate in this area is one per cent. Fourth, 
I want to say that the opposition supports the anti-smoking 
measures which have been announced.
<P>
	We are pleased to see that the questions we raised in this 
House and the work we have done on this side to compel the 
Minister of Health to assume her responsibilities have prompted 
the Prime Minister to include a health promotion component in 
his action plan. This concludes our comments at this time. 
However, we will very likely come back to this subject because 
in our  opinion, the government has been trying for three weeks 
to hide the truth. Now that it has its back against the wall, it 
proposes solutions that are a long way from being the most 
effective. A more comprehensive analysis of the situation would 
have been in order.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by commending the government for its 
response to, as the Prime Minister said, a very complex problem 
and also to thank the government for the briefing provided to us 
earlier today on the details.
<P>
	Our understanding of the government's program is that it 
consists really of four components: first, a stronger enforcement 
of the laws against smuggling; second, a stronger anti-smoking 
educational campaign to be financed by a surtax on tobacco 
company profits; third, an export tax on tobacco exports; and, 
fourth, the reduction of federal taxes on cigarettes consumed in 
Canada.
<P>
	Our initial response to this program is this. First, we 
commend the government on its program but want to point out 
one missing element in the presentation the Prime Minister 
made this morning and in the briefing package presented to us. 
That is a detailed estimate of the cost of the program. How much 
is it going to cost? Who is going to pick up the tab?
<P>
	Our understanding in going through the material is that the net 
impact of the tax changes is in the vicinity of about $300 million 
a year. It is my understanding that the implementation of the 
other parts of the package are probably in the vicinity of about 
$150 million per year. Therefore we are talking about a package 
of about half a billion dollars net cost per year.
<P>
	I would like to encourage the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister that when these programs are presented to the House, 
no matter what their merits, that they be accompanied by a more 
detailed presentation of the cost implications because of the 
financial situation that the government is in.
<P>
	We find ourselves in support of about three-quarters of the 
government's program, three of the four major items. We find 
ourselves supportive of stronger enforcement of the laws 
against smuggling, supportive of the stronger anti-smoking 
educational campaign and supportive of the concept of 
reinstating the export tax on tobacco exports.
<P>
	I do have to tell the government that the majority of our 
members believe the majority of their constituents are not 
convinced at this point in time of the wisdom and viabilityof the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1034"> 1034 </A></B>
<P>
fourth point in the government's program, namely the reduction 
in federal taxes on cigarettes consumed in Canada.
<P>
	We share the concern of many of the health groups that tax 
reduction will encourage smoking. We recognize this proposal 
is not yet supported by a majority of the provinces which is 
necessary to affect the differential between the price of 
cigarettes in the United States and in Canada.
<P>
	We question the reduction is really sufficient, particularly 
without full provincial co-operation to deter smuggling 
activity. We assume the revenues lost through the tax reduction 
will be compensated through tax increases in other areas. We 
would very much like to know what those tax increases are and 
who will be paying them.
<P>
	We recognize that the tobacco tax issue is becoming, as the 
Prime Minister said, more than a tax issue. It is becoming a 
justice issue. It is becoming a social issue. It is becoming an 
aboriginal issue. It is becoming an issue of interprovincial 
relations, but at the root of it is overspending that leads to 
overtaxation in the first place and all these side issues.
<P>
	We believe the House and the government have yet to deal 
with the root of the problem which is the overspending. We 
expect and hope that will be dealt with in the budget 
presentation in a couple of weeks.
<P>
	The Reform caucus will be reviewing the government's 
program in detail tomorrow morning and we hope to have 
further contributions in the days ahead.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I wonder if I might seek unanimous consent of the 
House to make a very brief response to the Prime Minister's 
statement on behalf of my party.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> The New Democratic Party knows that 
smuggling is a very complicated problem. It is not a very 
effective way of solving the problem, but I have a few comments 
concerning the government's plan.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first point I would like to make in response to the 
statement of the Prime Minister is that while we recognize this is 
a very complicated problem, we think it is based on several 
assumptions.
<P>
	One assumption is that this is a problem related only to 
cigarettes and tobacco products. It is clear, as we heard from the 
alcohol manufacturers, that they are gearing up their campaign 
for similar treatment. It seems to me this is a very slippery slope, 
reducing the tax on cigarettes, the government has embarked 
upon without a full framework of all the ramifications on other 
products as well.
<P>
	The assumption that this issue will be dealt with is a major 
assumption indeed since there are other products, other 
manufacturers, other issues that are going to be affected very 
quickly. The government should in my view have brought in a 
plan which would deal with the whole issue and all the products 
that might be included.
<P>
	Second, this was not a plan developed in conjunction with the 
provinces and the territories in a way that there could be a 
coherent plan across the country. Clearly, if provinces set 
different tax rates, we are going to see that there will be a similar 
problem between and among provinces.
<P>
	I want to say that we are very much in favour of the export tax 
and the surtax proposed by the government. We are not in favour 
of lowering taxes on cigarette products. However, it is based on 
the assumption that the cigarette manufacturers will not raise 
their prices to compensate for the increased tax. I just raise that 
as a problem.
<P>
	The third point I would like to make is on enforcement. Our 
party very strongly believes there needs to be increased 
enforcement both for those who buy contraband products and 
those who sell them. However, the government will know there 
has been a significant reduction in financial resources both to 
the RCMP and to customs officers. The question this raises is: 
What is the capacity of the RCMP and customs officers with the 
reductions in their own budgets that they have felt over the last 
few years? What is their capacity?
<P>
	We oppose the reduction of taxes on cigarettes because this is 
not within the framework of a full plan. Clearly the statistics on 
health and, as the Prime Minister mentioned, young people are 
clear. The higher cost has resulted in a reduction of the use of 
tobacco products. There are over 37,000 Canadians a year who 
die from the use of tobacco products. I believe this plan will be 
very detrimental to health care in Canada.
<P>
	Finally, this morning we heard many provincial 
commentators saying that they are concerned that the unilateral 
plan of the government without full consultation and a joint plan 
with the provinces may undermine the national health forum. 
The government has undertaken an attempt to solve a very 
difficult problem. However I believe it is on a slippery slope 
when it simply sees the reduction of the cigarette tax doing this.
<P>
	The other areas are very important and I hope the government 
will not, as the previous government did, back down on the 
export tax when manufacturers start to complain about it.
<P>
	I would say that we in Canada are left with a very serious 
problem regarding smuggling of a number of products not 
included in this plan. We are still left with a significant health 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1035"> 1035 </A></B>
<P>
care problem that I believe we had found a way to address but 
now that way is being undermined by the government's plan.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know we allowed unanimous consent to allow the leader to give 
a statement. I am wondering if there might be unanimous 
consent for me to also give a brief statement.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course the Chair is always in the hands of 
the House. Unanimous consent has been sought by the member 
for Haldimand-Norfolk to intervene in a minister's statement. 
Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. I want to thank hon. 
members on all sides of the House. Many members realize the 
work I have put into this issue over the past number of years.
<P>
	My riding has the majority of the tobacco farmers in the 
country. They are farmers who are looking very intently at this 
policy. They tried for a number of years to push the previous 
government actually to crack down on this issue.
<P>
	I also have the Six Nations Reserve in my riding, which is the 
largest native reserve in the country, one whose communities 
have been fraught with a number of smugglers in this country.
<P>
	In my riding alone I have 200 smoke huts on the reserve. I 
have had many people including the band council and most 
people on the Six Nations say: ``Mr. Speller, would you please 
do something about this problem. This problem is hurting our 
community. We are getting a bad name across this country 
because people are blaming this problem on natives''. I was glad 
that the Prime Minister today pointed out that 95 per cent of this 
problem is organized crime and it is not with natives in the 
country.
<P>
	I was also pleased to learn that the Solicitor General had 
sought to have the head of the RCMP to sit down with my 
community of the Six Nations and discuss ways in which this 
problem could be resolved. I commend the Solicitor General for 
that.
<P>
	In terms of my tobacco farmers who have a large concern with 
this because of the problems that they have been having in the 
tobacco communities and the surrounding infrastructure, we 
have a number of people within my community and the 
surrounding ridings who consider this to be a very important 
issue. I know they will be pleased today to learn that the 
government has finally taken the initiative to come forward and 
has given a commitment to work with these communities in 
order to resolve the problems of adjustment that may occur 
because of some of the policies that have come forward today.

AND FEDERAL POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION AND

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-3, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education 
and Health Contributions Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to debate Bill C-3 at second 
reading. It amends the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements 
Act and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health 
Contributions Act.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-3 is centred on the renewal of the equalization 
program, which is in fact the cornerstone of fiscal federalism in 
Canada. The objective of equalization, whose principle is 
enshrined in the Canadian Constitution, is to enable provincial 
governments to offer to the Canadian people fairly comparable 
public service levels at fairly comparable tax levels.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Equalization has a long tradition. It was established as a 
program in 1957. Even here the wartime and post-war tax rental 
agreements implicitly equalized provincial revenues. Indeed in 
1867 higher statutory subsidies were paid to Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick than Ontario and Quebec in recognition of their 
disproportionate loss of customs duties and excise taxes upon 
entry into Confederation.
<P>
	Because equalization is paid only to the less wealthy 
provinces, it is the most progressive of the major federal 
transfers to the provinces. In 1994-95 it is anticipated that the 
government will provide about $8.5 billion in equalization to 
receiving provinces. This means that a provincial government 
along with its local governments that levies average rates of tax 
will have per capita revenues of $5,000 from taxes and 
equalization to fund public services.
<P>
	However as we all know the context for this year's renewal of 
equalization is unprecedented. The federal government's fiscal 
situation is worse today than in 1992 and much worse than in 
1987 and 1982, previous times of equalization renewal.
<P>
	In our deliberations on renewing equalization we have 
balanced the need to be fiscally responsible with the singular 
role of equalization in underpinning the unique sense of 
Canadian sharing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the bill is moving in that direction. It calls for an 
increase in equalization payments of 5.5 per cent a year for the 
next five years. It also provides for several changes to the tax 
base in order to update and improve the measurement of 
provincial tax capacity, which is essential to maintain the equity 
of the program. For the provinces these tax base updates will 
translate into gains of about $165 million next year and some 
$900 million in the next five years.
<P>
	In addition, the government has promised the provinces not to 
amend this formula in the next five years. The provinces will 
then be able to plan their budgets in a stable climate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly the renewal package has to be affordable. This is why 
we have retained a ceiling on equalization, one that will be 
effective in providing protection to the federal government's 
ability to finance the program. The ceiling limits the cumulative 
growth in equalization to no more than the growth of the 
economy from a base year. This means for example if the 
economy grows 5 per cent from the base in the first year, 
equalization can grow no more than 5 per cent. If in the second 
year the economy grows a further 5 per cent, the cumulative or 
total two-year growth of equalization is 10 per cent.
<P>
	The year 1992-93 has been retained as the base. It is a year of 
relatively modest equalization payout. Unlike previous 
equalization renewals where the first year of the term was not 
subject to a ceiling constraint and in fact set the base year, we 
have put a limit on the payout for the first year. In current fiscal 
circumstances it is simply not appropriate to have an 
open-ended first year. Having 1992-93 as the base year uses a 
year where the data 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1037"> 1037 </A></B>
<P>
are close to final, that is to say subject to little revision. This will 
provide more certainty on payments for both the federal 
government and the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Now let me go into some details of the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, equalization will be renewed for the next five years. 
Given the commitment to maintain the structure of the formula, 
this will give more stability to the provinces receiving 
equalization payments.
<P>
	Second, the level of the five provinces, namely Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, whose 
provincial fiscal capacity is being raised will be maintained.
<P>
	Third, as I said earlier, the ceiling based on the 1992-93 fiscal 
year will stay in place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fourth, the program floors will remain unchanged. The floors 
provide protection to provinces against large year to year 
declines in equalization.
<P>
	Fifth, certain tax base changes to update the measurement of 
the provinces' fiscal capacity will be introduced. This is 
essential to maintain the integrity of the program.
<P>
	Sixth, the legislation will contain a means to alleviate 
excessive reductions in equalization for provinces with specific 
and exceptionally large proportions of the tax base for certain 
natural resources. This will remove a longstanding irritant to the 
provinces on this so-called tax back issue.
<P>
	Finally it is important to note the base for the ceiling will be 
adjusted so that the provinces can benefit from the tax base 
updates and tax back even if the ceiling applies.
<P>
	In closing, passage of this bill will have beneficial effects for 
Canadians and the provincial governments, providing essential 
services to them. It will provide for the next five years a stable 
funding regime for equalization. It will provide substantial 
support for the less wealthy provinces, underscoring the priority 
the government puts on equalization. It maintains the fairness 
and equity of the program and it is fiscally responsible. It is fully 
consistent with the government's deficit target.
<P>
	I commend the bill for the consideration of the House. I hope 
with co-operation from all sides we can obtain second reading 
of the bill promptly this day so that it can be studied in detail in 
the standing committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wish to inform the House that 
because of the ministerial statement, Government Orders will be 
extended by 39 minutes, pursuant to Standing Order 33(2)(b).
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to share with you the Bloc Quebecois's opinion on 
Bill C-3, to renew the Canadian equalization program.
<P>
	First of all, we cannot properly appreciate this bill and its 
impact and propose amendments to it and deletions from it 
without considering equalization among the other kinds of 
transfers made by the Government of Canada to the provinces. 
Besides equalization, these federal transfers are established 
programs financing, which is the federal contribution to 
provincial health and post-secondary education programs, and 
shared cost programs, of which the Canada Assistance Plan is 
the most important.
<P>
	Nor is it desirable to analyze this bill without looking at the 
reason behind equalization, which was entrenched in the 1982 
Constitution, a Constitution that Quebec has not approved, by 
the way. By reviewing these two aspects of federal transfers, we 
will be able to demonstrate clearly that from the time ceilings 
were imposed in 1982, this equalization program no longer 
meets the objectives for which it was established. An 
examination of the other transfers will complete our analysis 
and show the need for a complete review of federal transfers. It 
will show the bankruptcy of fiscal federalism as designed on the 
basis of the Rowell-Sirois report of 1941, which I had an 
opportunity to analyze in my youth at university.
<P>
	The spirit of the Rowell-Sirois report is mocked by the doings 
of this government and the previous one. For example, transfers 
help provinces which need them least. Is it any surprise that the 
gap between rich and poor provinces has been growing in the 
last ten years or so?
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Indeed a close examination of the way federal transfers work 
reveals that since the mid-eighties transfers have increased 
more rapidly in the well-to-do provinces, namely Ontario, 
Alberta and British Columbia, than in the poor provinces, which 
should logically be the ones benefitting from such transfers. For 
example, between 1984 and 1991, total federal transfers have, 
on average, increased by 6.9 per cent per year for Ontario, and 
by 3.1 per cent only for Quebec. And Quebec is considered a not 
so well-to-do province.
<P>
	Why do we have this situation, which I find absurd? Simply 
because of the very nature of federal programs, because of the 
federal withdrawal and, more specifically, because of the failure 
of Canadian fiscal federalism.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at the situation; let us examine each 
program, one at a time, starting with equalization. As the hon. 
member opposite said, the purpose of federal equalization is to 
reduce disparities  between provincial governments regarding 
their ability to collect taxes and to impose taxes on their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1038"> 1038 </A></B>
<P>
territory, so that they can provide uniform services among them, 
such as regular public services. This capacity is measured by 
using various provincial and municipal taxes. And, as the 
document prepared by the federal Department of Finance says, 
equalization payments are calculated by using a formula 
established in the federal legislation. First, revenues which each 
province could draw from a typical, and therefore theoretical, 
tax base are calculated. Then, the overall ability of each 
province, on a per capita basis, to draw revenues from these 
sources is compared to a ``representative standard'', which is 
based on the fiscal capacity of the five provinces-this standard 
is currently estimated at $4,800 per capita, or roughly $5,000. If 
the total per capita capacity of a province is below that standard, 
federal equalization payments are used to bring revenues to that 
standard, so as to standardize the ability to provide public 
services.
<P>
	In theory, based on this calculation, the average fiscal 
capacity of the seven poorest provinces should be more similar 
after making equalization payments to enable those provinces to 
provide comparable public services. In fact however, this is not 
the case at all.
<P>
	Since 1988-89, because of the ceilings set, payments made to 
provinces do not enable them to reach that representative 
standard. According to the terms of these ceiling provisions, 
equalization entitlements of all the beneficiary provinces can no 
longer increase more rapidly than the economy, as measured by 
the gross national product. The ceiling for equalization was used 
twice in recent years: once in 1988-89, and again in 1990-91, in 
the middle of a recession that hit hard the economy of Canadian 
provinces, and especially that of Quebec.
<P>
	During those two periods, this ceiling translated into a loss of 
revenue of more than $2.9 billion for the beneficiary provinces. 
I might add that Quebec, because of its distinctive features, 
especially from a demographic point of view, absorbed more 
than 60 per cent of that loss, including $1.8 billion for 1992-93 
alone.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will remember, as will the members who are 
here, that this situation is what triggered the famous retroactive 
tax of the previous Minister of Finance in Quebec, the late 
Gérard D. Lévesque. So, by extending this ceiling on 
equalization, the federal government is once again putting 
Canadian provinces in a difficult position.
<P>
	Moreover, this ceiling reduced the transfers that provinces 
should have received to maintain their fiscal capacity standard, 
so much so in fact that this capacity currently varies by as much 
as 12 per cent between have and have-not provinces. That 
finding is not mine, nor that of my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois. This statement was made by a great federalist from 
Quebec, the present Minister of Finance of that province,Mr. Bourbeau, who, when it was announced that the  
equalization agreement was being extended, made some veiled 
criticisms, since a great federalist does not lash out at one of his 
colleagues, but he nevertheless criticized the government for 
extending the application of this ceiling.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	This ceiling deals a blow to fiscal federalism as well as the 
Rowell-Sirois principles. Equalization has not been reaching 
the federative goal set originally, especially since the end of the 
Second World War.
<P>
	Let us now examine established programs financing, another 
main element of the federal transfer program. Established 
programs financing represent the federal health and 
post-secondary education contributions to the provinces. Yet, 
the federal withdrawal from this area has been quite obvious. 
Since 1982, the federal government has been gradually opting 
out of established programs financing. For example, in 
1990-91, basic contribution per capita was frozen to the 
1989-90 level for fiscal years 1990-91 to 1994-95.
<P>
	This freeze and the equal per capita cuts arising from this 
overall reduction program hit the have-not provinces more 
harshly. Again, not only is equalization not aiming for the goals 
originally set when the system was created, but even the other 
transfer programs are not as fair to the have-not provinces as 
they are to the have provinces.
<P>
	In fact, since the average income of taxpayers is lower in the 
have-not provinces than in the rich provinces, the poorer 
provinces are less able to levy taxes even after equalization, 
with a current difference of 12 per cent, as we saw earlier.
<P>
	Thus the have-not provinces must raise their tax rate more 
than the others to be able to maintain the health care and 
post-secondary education they offer their own people through 
the established programs financing.
<P>
	The situation gets even worse when the equalization ceiling is 
reached as is the case since 1988-89, that is, when needs exceed 
the nominal GNP growth. Indeed, the additional revenues levied 
by the provinces do not bring additional equalization and the 
poorer provinces must make a greater effort than the others to 
levy even one dollar more per capita. In Quebec, for example, 
the loss in revenues resulting from all the changes made to the 
established programs financing since 1982 amounts to $1.8 
billion for fiscal year 1993-94.
<P>
	Since established programs financing provides for equal per 
capita transfers, another kind of unfairness has developed over 
the years in that 59 per cent of the funds are handed to the three 
richest provinces in Canada. As we have seen earlier, all of the 
transfer programs were originally meant to help the have-not 
provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	As for the shared cost programs, their operation raises the 
same kind of problems. The majority of existing programs do 
not do enough to reduce economic disparities in Canada since 
they favour the provinces that have a greater fiscal capacity and 
can afford a higher level of services. Again, the richer provinces 
are favoured by cost-shared programs.
<P>
	Second type of problem, the fact that the federal government 
uses its spending power in various areas-and Quebec is well 
aware of this situation-leads to overlap, duplication and 
conflicting priorities which, in turn, unquestionably lead to a 
waste of public funds.
<P>
	Third type of problem, here again, as was the case with the 
two previous programs, we are witnessing the progressive 
withdrawal of the federal government from several areas in 
which it had encouraged the provinces to make commitments. 
The circumstances are always the same. Because of its spending 
power, the federal government gets involved in areas that should 
be under provincial jurisdiction. Then, it decides that it does not 
want to be involved any more or that it cannot afford to be 
involved any more. Since its involvement has created a need 
over the years, its withdrawal forces the provinces to honour the 
commitment previously shared with the federal government.
<P>
	Among cost shared programs, the Canada Assistance Plan is 
the most important of all federal transfer programs. If my 
memory serves me correctly, transfers under this program 
totalled $7.8 billion this year.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The Canada Assistance Plan, commonly known as CAP or the 
federal contribution to social assistance, is a good illustration of 
the problems associated with shared costs programs: first, the 
lack of explicit consideration of the gaps in needs and financial 
resources between provinces; second, the obligation for 
provinces to spend in accordance with the rules set under the 
plan, known otherwise as national standards that we 
traditionally have disliked in Quebec; third, inefficient 
management; and fourth, high administrative costs. Here again 
we have an absurd situation as far as shared cost programs are 
concerned, a situation that makes one question the value and 
strength of Canadian fiscal federalism.
<P>
	Between 1984-1985 and 1989-1990, for example, federal 
transfer payments under the Canada Assistance Plan have grown 
at an annual rate of 11 per cent in the more advantaged 
provinces. Over the same period the less advantaged provinces 
showed an annual growth rate of 4.3 per cent only. As for 
Quebec, the growth rate was even less than the general average 
for the less advantaged provinces, amounting to 3.3 per cent 
over the same period.
<P>
	In the budget speech for 1990-1991, the federal government 
announced that it was also setting a 5 per cent cap on the growth 
of its transfer payments under the Canada Assistance Plan. This 
capping contributed to reducing the share received by the more 
advantaged  provinces-thank goodness for that ceiling-which 
decreased from 55.1 per cent in 1989-1990 to 50.2 per cent in 
1992-1993. But we are talking about a lot of money. A shared 
cost program such as the Canada Assistance Plan provides more 
than half the funds to provinces that need them the least, that is 
the richest provinces in Canada. That is why the federal transfer 
payment system is flawed.
<P>
	The shared cost programs include many other programs 
besides the Canada Assistance Plan. In 1992-93, there were 
more than 60 federal-provincial agreements under which 
Quebec, as well as all the other Canadian provinces, were 
getting transfer payments. Since the early 1980s, the federal 
government has opted out from many of these programs, as it did 
with previous programs, so that provincial governments, 
including Quebec, are now in a very difficult position which is 
also forcing them to raise taxes, while the federal government 
washes its hands of the matter.
<P>
	What are we doing with Bill C-3? What we are doing is 
carrying on with all the problems that I mentioned to you, the 
almost absurd problems in transfers to rich provinces as 
opposed to poor provinces. So we carry on with this nonsense by 
attacking only one type of these transfers which is called 
equalization. The government sticks to the same absurd position 
by keeping the ceiling previously established, a position which 
misrepresents the role that equalization payments should play.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-3, because it simply 
renews the ceiling on equalization payments. This Bill is 
contrary to the goal of equalization payments which is to reduce 
the differences in the ability to raise taxes between the 
better-off provinces and the less well-off provinces .
<P>
	If the government is unwilling to remove the ceiling it should, 
like the previous government, acknowledge the fact that it is 
putting into question the goal of equalization payments and the 
principle of fiscal federalism expressed in the 1941 
Rowell-Sirois report.
<P>
	The ceiling, when it applies, reduces the transfer payments 
that a province would have received otherwise to maintain the 
same standard of fiscal capacity as the other provinces. I will 
quote the Quebec Minister of Finance, although it is not very 
often that I refer to Mr. Bourbeau. Mr. Bourbeau said, in 
referring to the ceiling, that today there was a difference in 
fiscal capacity of about 12 per cent between the wealthier 
provinces and the poorer provinces, after equalization. The 
question therefore arises whether the poorer provinces are really 
in a position to provide public services comparable in quality to 
those offered in the wealthier provinces, and at comparable tax 
rates.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1040"> 1040 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	For a committed federalist to raise this issue, which goes to 
the very heart of Canadian federalism, is a clear indication that 
it is a problem that must be dealt with quickly, as soon as it 
reaches the Finance Committee with Bill C-3.
<P>
	We must not forget that, as I said before, the ceiling applied 
from 1988-89 to 1990-91 caused recipient provinces to suffer a 
potential loss of over $2.9 billion. In this case, recipient 
provinces means those that are least able to absorb these tax 
losses. Quebec absorbed 60 per cent of this potential loss and 
thus suffered a loss of $1.8 billion in revenue.
<P>
	Assuming that the GDP annual growth rate will be between 5 
per cent and 6 per cent per fiscal year, the federal Department of 
Finance expects that applying the current ceiling provided in 
Bill C-3 will cause the recipient and thus poorer provinces to 
lose nearly $1.5 billion over the next five years. Quebec will 
again absorb 60 per cent or nearly $900 million.
<P>
	Earlier, I had to smile when I heard the hon. member say that a 
change in the reference tax base used to establish equalization 
amounts for each province would give another $300 million to 
the poorest provinces and about $70 million to the province of 
Quebec. The mere fact of extending the ceiling for the next five 
years will cause Quebec alone to lose $900 million. If we take 
this loss of $900 million and subtract about $300 million gained 
over the next five years as a result of redefining the tax base, the 
result is still a net loss of $600 million for Quebec alone.
<P>
	This will only happen if the forecast growth of nominal GDP 
over the next five years-the optimistic forecast made by the 
federal Department of Finance-is accurate. Recently I have 
seen figures of 5 to 6 per cent. In particular, a number of 
organizations in Quebec were talking about growth of around 4 
per cent, so if we have 4 per cent growth and if there is a 4 per 
cent ceiling on equalization payments, losses may be well in 
excess of the figures I just mentioned.
<P>
	The federal government, by tabling Bill C-3 and ignoring all 
the problems, incongruities and even absurdities found in other 
federal transfer payments, has made it clear that, like the 
previous government, it intends to shift the burden of the deficit 
onto the provinces and, by the same token, undermine the grand 
design of federal equalization. Like the Conservatives, this 
government will let the provincial governments take the blame 
for tax increases and wash its hands like Pontius Pilate.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Blameless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Absolutely. Like Pontius Pilate.
<P>
	If I were a federalist, I would recommend a complete overhaul 
of the transfer payment system and go back to the position taken 
in 1941 an expressed so well in the Rowell-Sirois report. 
However, I am not. And even the  most committed federalists are 
starting to have doubts about the effectiveness of the tax system 
and Canadian fiscal federalism.
<P>
	I am a sovereigntist, like the Bloc Quebecois. To us, the best 
reform would be to give Quebec its sovereignty, and we cannot 
repeat this often enough.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	If one looks at the mix-up there is in standards, federal 
transfer payments, the necessity to respect national standards, 
duplications, overlapping, et cetera, only one solution comes to 
mind and that is the redefining of the relationship between 
Quebec and Canada, the establishment of a new relationship 
which would allow a sovereign Quebec to adopt consistent 
policies on income security, policies combining income security 
with education programs and manpower training; a new 
relationship where there would be only one stakeholder and not 
two who sometimes implement contradictory measures which 
cancel one another.
<P>
	Just think how much we could reduce disparities between 
regions, income levels and generations that constitute a major 
problem in developed countries today. Think of all the 
possibilities we could have in Quebec and in Canada if we would 
only review the federal transfer programs, of all the 
opportunities there would be for us to face today's great modern 
challenges like globalization and job creation-jobs, jobs, jobs. 
We are also concerned about jobs considering all the measures 
that have been on our mind for almost two decades if not three.
<P>
	We will contribute nevertheless, as we have said since the 
beginning, since we have taken on our role as Official 
Opposition in a responsible and efficient manner; we will 
continue to play that role and when Bill C-3 is referred to the 
finance committee, we will propose, among other things, that 
the equalization ceiling be removed.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to add a few elements to the 
evaluation of equalization and other federal transfer payments. 
A word of warning for my colleagues from other parties. Let no 
one come and tell us, during the debate on equalization in this 
House or during the finance committee proceedings, that 
Quebec receives more than its share of equalization and transfer 
payments, that Quebec receives more than its share of the 
Canada Assistance Plan and therefore of social assistance. 
Quebec does not need equalization payments nor does it need 
CAP, and it definitely does not need equalization payments 
rendered useless since being capped. What Quebec needs is a 
strong, well structured and vibrant economy providing it with 
the necessary tax revenues. That is what Quebec needs. It is jobs 
we want in Quebec, not the Canada Assistance Plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1041"> 1041 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us consider the surplus Quebec gets from the Canada 
Assistance Plan and the supposed surplus from equalization 
payments, since there are losses and shortfalls in that area, and 
let us compare them with the losses Quebec incurs because of 
unfair distribution of federal funds in terms of productive 
investments, that is to say federal investments in, for instance, 
research and development. In the past 30 years, Quebec has been 
receiving between 13 and 18 per cent of all federal R and D 
funding, both intra and extramuros. Let us figure what this loss 
of revenue means, not so much in accounting terms, but in terms 
of lost opportunities.
<P>
	What would the situation be today in Quebec if it were not for 
this unfair distribution of R and D transfer payments? Would 
Quebec be one of the have-not provinces now, supposedly being 
helped by a sham of an equalization system, or would it be able 
to have sufficient tax revenues, just like Ontario does? For the 
last 30 years, Ontario has been receiving around 50 per cent of 
all federal funding. And you would have us believe that it has 
nothing to do with a weaker economy in Quebec?
<P>
	Having said this, we will do our best to defeat or amend Bill 
C-3 when it goes to the finance committee, and as I mentioned a 
little bit earlier, we will fight against the continued capping of 
equalization payments. We will strive to bring about changes to 
help our Canadian friends to take better advantage of a system 
that might have been excellent at the start but which now borders 
on the absurd.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there are no questions or 
comments following what the spokesman for the Official 
Opposition said, I recognize the Reform Party. The hon. member 
for Calgary West.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
lead off our party's contribution to this debate on amendments to 
the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal 
Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act. In 
Bill C-3 we are discussing amendments or renewal of the 
equalization program.
<P>
	As I understand it this bill does several things. The 
parliamentary secretary alluded to these and I will repeat them. 
It renews the current equalization program to the end of fiscal 
1999. It retains the GDP ceiling on equalization transfers. It 
makes some changes to tax base calculations in the formula tax 
base updates. It provides relief on tax back of some unique 
resource capacities in certain provinces.
<P>
	Under this bill equalization payments are projected to grow 
from $8.4 billion this year to about $10.4 billion by the end of 
the century. That will be an annual growth rate of about 5 per 
cent per year. It includes about 2 per cent additional growth that 
is being added by the measures in the bill. Because of the cost of 
the program, rather than the particulars of the formula or some 
of the  elements of the bill, our finance committee within the 
Reform caucus has recommended to Reform MPs that they 
oppose this bill at second reading.
<P>
	During the past election our party campaigned-and I have 
made reference to this several times-on the need to undertake a 
dramatic program of expenditure reduction to get us on the path 
to long run financial sustainability of all our most valuable 
programs. It was the zero in three plan to balance the budget 
within the life of this Parliament.
<P>
	In that plan we have projected and continue to maintain that 
spending at the national level is at least 15 per cent above our 
long run ability to sustain it. We have attempted to examine 
categories of spending and we will continue to do so, including 
spending on social programs and within that transfer programs 
to the provinces.
<P>
	The zero in three program proposed relatively small cuts in 
these areas. That was the feedback we received through 
consultation with the public. In fact we had proposed only 
reducing federal transfers to the provinces by about 5 per cent of 
the total from this level of government or about $1.5 billion. 
Another way to put it would be about 1 per cent of provincial tax 
revenues.
<P>
	Let me review what we are talking about in this particular 
envelope of spending. I am quoting from a recent publication of 
the Department of Finance. It states that in fiscal year 1992-93 
this category of spending would include such things as 
established programs financing in the health care field, $8.3 
billion; the equalization program discussed in this bill, $7.4 
billion; Canada Assistance Plan transfers, $6.7 billion; 
established programs financing transfers for post-secondary 
education, $2.9 billion; and various other transfers, the 
so-called minor transfers.
<P>
	Things become minor when they are less than $1 billion. That 
includes significant transfers to territorial governments, all of 
which total according to the documents roughly $28 billion that 
fiscal year. That does not include tax point transfers which add 
considerably to the total. We are talking about one-quarter of all 
program spending and more than that if we take into account the 
tax points.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	As I indicated, people did not want to target the area of social 
programs and transfers generally for reductions. However given 
that these are now two-thirds of all current spending, it is hard 
to avoid some kind of action in these areas.
<P>
	In developing our program we found that what people wanted 
to preserve most strongly were the funds dedicated specifically 
to the maintenance of health and post-secondary education 
programs. The public felt there was some room to reduce 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1042"> 1042 </A></B>
<P>
transfer payments toward such things as equalization and the 
Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	I suspect the reason for the less strong support for those 
programs as compared to the others was not just the nature of the 
programs but the fact that these two programs have strong 
discriminatory elements that are funded more favourably in 
some provinces than in others.
<P>
	I do not want to say that the bill costs too much but I would 
specifically suggest to the government this alternative. We have 
proposed that equalization payments should be reduced by about 
10 per cent at some point and that these reductions should focus 
on middle income rather than on the poorest provinces. 
Something like this could be achieved by reducing the 
equalization standard to less than 100 per cent of the average 
fiscal capacity. If one says in the range of 98 per cent to 99 per 
cent that would achieve the objective.
<P>
	More important, it would retain the principle of equalization 
which is not only something we support but which is embedded 
in the Constitution Act, 1982, which our party recognizes and 
which other parties do not necessarily recognize. Under our 
proposal one would retain inflation protection in the growth of 
formulas over the long term.
<P>
	I would also suggest that other elements of the equalization 
formula and calculation should be examined both on grounds of 
fairness as well as some of the incentive issues in these various 
programs.
<P>
	We will be voting on this later this afternoon. We will be 
voting on looking at fairness and incentive issues in the 
structure of transfer programs, largely the transfers to 
individuals such as welfare and unemployment insurance. We 
will be looking at those kinds of programs.
<P>
	I would suggest a similar study is warranted in this area. My 
colleagues will be commenting at greater length later today on 
some of these problems. Let me give a couple of examples.
<P>
	The formula used now assigns Alberta, which is not a 
recipient province, a 25 per cent higher fiscal capacity than the 
province of Ontario. While this obviously is not going to have a 
direct impact this year as neither are recipient provinces, I 
would suggest it clearly indicates some bizarre functioning in 
the calculations. Alberta does not have a 25 per cent higher 
fiscal capacity than the province of Ontario.
<P>
	I would also note that the way this program has increasingly 
operated, the costs are now linked to economic growth. In other 
words there is a tendency for the payments under this formula to 
be limited at precisely the time that provinces are having 
difficulty with their revenues.
<P>
	During boom times the ceiling operates in a way that would 
allow provinces to collect greater revenue in federal transfers. 
That would seem to me to be something that should be examined 
in terms of the efficacy of the equalization program.
<P>
	Maybe I could spend a few minutes commenting on the bill in 
a little more detail in light of the Liberal position. I have found it 
somewhat strange that the Minister of Finance would announce 
he is going ahead with a guarantee on this program and these sets 
of funds when he has indicated he is reviewing other major 
transfer programs to the provinces and there is no necessary 
guarantee at this moment they would be renewed in their current 
form. That is a series of priorities I have trouble understanding. 
It is obviously not consistent with our party's priorities. It seems 
particularly inconsistent with the fact that we are waiting for a 
budget and most of these issues are soon to be addressed. I do 
not understand why this particular program has been guaranteed 
in advance before the budget consultations have been 
completed.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I can say some things on the positive side, though, in terms of 
the specific elements. I would like to commend some of the 
smaller changes, in particular the excessive tax back provision 
element of this bill. That at least conceptually will move us 
toward a somewhat fairer system, even if the dollars involved 
immediately are not terribly significant.
<P>
	I also would like to urge the government to continue what the 
previous government did in 1982, that is retain the GDP ceiling. 
Obviously we would like to see stronger reductions in that, but it 
is necessary for the federal government to protect itself against a 
situation in which it would be liable for open ended transfers.
<P>
	Maybe I could also take a minute to comment briefly on the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois and on some of the comments 
that were made by the critic from that party. It is important that 
we say these things. I do not want to get into these regional kinds 
of debate at great lengths, but we should be really clear here. I 
am sure members of the government will agree with me. We are 
discussing here a very major transfer program of Confederation, 
and one that is mandated under the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	Regardless of our differences with the government on the 
cost, what we are talking about is a program that is going to cost 
$8.4 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. Of that $8.4 billion, 
$3.7 billion or 45 per cent of those funds is targeted for the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	My constituents pay into this and our provincial government 
receives nothing. Surely the appropriate response is not to say it 
is not enough, but we have serious problems in the country, not 
just with our annual deficit but with the $500 billion of debt that 
we have accumulated. Whether we have a major constitutional 
reform or even the sovereignty of Quebec as the Bloc Quebecois 
would like, surely we recognize we are going to be stuck 
managing this debt for decades to come. I would anticipate that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1043"> 1043 </A></B>
<P>
at some point we will get some realistic discussion of how to 
deal with that and the impact of that from all the parties in this 
House.
<P>
	I am floored by some of the comments that I have heard. I 
would urge the government to consider something that we asked 
for in the previous Parliament. Our caucus had asked that the 
government publish regularly the regional and provincial 
distributions of its tax expenditure and transfer policies so that 
those things are on paper and clear, so that we can see the impact 
of changes on provinces and so that we can have this kind of 
discussion in a rational atmosphere rather than it becoming 
simply a matter of scoring points in a particular province.
<P>
	We have done considerable work in this area to get a greater 
understanding of these kinds of considerations. Let us be clear 
about it once again. To assist in the running of the government in 
the province of Quebec $3.7 billion is being voted here. It is a 
principle we share, an equalization payment, because there is a 
lower fiscal capacity in that province. Let us be clear that this is 
what this bill does. I am also looking for some realistic 
discussion of this in the next couple of years. Let us be clear that 
the option the Bloc Quebecois is proposing to deal with this, the 
sovereignty of Quebec, would result in the province of Quebec 
receiving zero.
<P>
	I am really looking forward to the day we begin to discuss 
both sides of the argument and, in a much more realistic fashion, 
these kinds of considerations.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	In concluding my remarks I would urge the House to 
reconsider Bill C-3 and to reconsider at this point committing to 
a growth in our financial commitments that will amount to $2 
billion over the next five years before we have even had 
presented a financial framework.
<P>
	I am under no particular illusion that our colleagues on either 
side of the House are going to support such reduction proposals. 
I do not think the time has come yet when all parties are willing 
to bite the bullet. I would at least suggest that the Liberals give 
this some consideration as in the upcoming months and year 
they have to grapple more seriously with the financial mess of 
the country.
<P>
	We will be discussing the bill in committee and at third 
reading. In the meantime there will be a budget. We also will be 
examining our position on this matter in light of the budget, in 
light of the data we get out of that, and in light of proposals we 
have and we are expecting in areas of other fiscal transfers.
<P>
	Once again, we will examine this in light of our deteriorating 
financial situation. In the meantime I believe my colleagues will 
be opposing this extended financial commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question concerning the speech made by the member for Calgary 
West. What would be the fiscal capability of the western 
provinces if the federal government did not pay $2 million to $3 
million for the wheat?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
precisely what the question is driving at. I think the member is 
asking me what would be the effect on the western provinces if 
there were not bridge payments in the event of the kind of 
agricultural crises that have occurred in the prairies.
<P>
	In the context of the current equalization program 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba are recipients of this particular 
program. Other provinces and individuals are also recipients of 
other transfer payments.
<P>
	The member alluded to one in particular. There are 
contributions that all governments and individuals make to 
certain agricultural stabilization programs. There are also 
periodically payments under those, an emergency payment 
under those. Obviously if those things did not come to pass in a 
timely fashion the impact would be negative. Nobody doubts 
that and nobody is debating the principle of there being fiscal 
sharing when that is appropriate.
<P>
	I have suggested today to the government, and I will reassert 
that particular suggestion, that we begin to publish in an 
objective manner the comprehensive effects of these things on 
all provinces, not just individual programs. We can all point to 
programs in which we are short changed or there is a special 
consideration. Let us officially, through the Department of 
Finance, begin to regularly have this kind of analysis so that we 
can discuss these issues in a rational manner.
<P>
	In short response to the member's question, there is 
absolutely no doubt that the impact of not receiving some of 
these programs would impact western provinces as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the statement by my colleague from the 
Reform Party. I particularly noticed a remark which I found 
rather biased and uncomplimentary, I would say, towards 
Quebec, namely that Quebec received 45 per cent of 
equalization and suggesting that Quebec was the spoiled child of 
Canadian Confederation. If he did not understand, probably 
there are problems with the simultaneous translation. Maybe he 
did not get my message just now, which was that equalization is 
meant to raise the revenue of provinces and that Quebec is a 
have not province. If Quebec is less well off, they should ask by 
looking at it objectively, since they seem to be objective once in 
a while when their ridings or home provinces are concerned 
what

Quebec has had in terms of research and development, federal 
purchases of goods and services, transportation and agriculture 
in the past 30 years. Do not tell me that when it comes to 
agriculture, the three prairie provinces, with  payments of about 
$1.5 billion a year since 1986, in addition to regular programs, 
are not favoured provinces in the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Before throwing figures around left and right, I would ask for 
a real debate in this House on the federal government's 
contribution to Quebec, if they want such a debate, and I will be 
pleased to answer all their pernicious arguments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate the question.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make was not that other provinces do 
not receive payments. I was not even suggesting that Quebec 
receives too much. I was merely suggesting that an $8.4 billion 
program, of which $3.7 billion is going to the province of 
Quebec, is not something to sneeze at. It is not a drop in the 
bucket. It is not something to deny the importance of. The thrust 
of the member's remarks, as I heard it, was to dispute the 
workings of the ceiling that has been in effect more or less since 
1982 and about how much had been lost through the ceiling.
<P>
	It was the intention of the member to give to members of the 
House, other Canadians and Quebecers who may be watching 
the impression that they are not getting anything out of this 
program or that they are experiencing tremendous losses from 
this program, none of which is the case.
<P>
	Our party is suggesting that we make major reductions in 
spending and is willing to look at all these categories and at the 
impact on our region as well as Quebec and Ontario. This is an 
important exercise and is why I suggest we have this open 
debate.
<P>
	However, it is important because the time is going to come 
when these things have to be looked at realistically. We have 
studied with some comprehensiveness the overall workings of 
the federal finances for various provinces over the period of the 
last generation, and we know the kind of negative effect it has 
had on our particular province.
<P>
	Let me just mention equalization, for example. Alberta 
received no equalization at the height of its recession in the 
early 1980s, a recession brought about largely by federal 
government policy. Albertans have never quarrelled with the 
concept of sharing and contributing to the pot. These things have 
to be addressed realistically.
<P>
	It is my view and the view of many Canadians and many 
Quebecers that Quebec does experience some significant 
economic gain from its participation in Confederation. There 
are some problems, but there are significant economic gains in 
being tied to the stronger economic units of Ontario and the 
west.
<P>
	In my view that is not the reason or the only reason to stay in 
Confederation, but it is a reason Quebecers are going to have to 
consider and the Bloc Quebecois is going to have to address 
realistically at some point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, just prior to 
making my comments I would like to inform the House that 
members on this side of the House will now share their speaking 
time at 10 minutes each.
<P>
	I rise to speak about a topic which goes to the very heart of 
Canadianism and it goes to the very centre of the reason for our 
being as a nation, the subject of equalization.
<P>
	At the outset I would like to congratulate the Minister of 
Finance for the announcement he made in Montreal on January 
21 of this year when he told the provincial and territorial finance 
ministers that the equalization program would be renewed for 
the next five years. This gives them the opportunity to 
realistically plan for the future while we at the same time fulfil a 
major campaign promise made by our party to bring about 
stability to federal-provincial financial relations.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	As hon. members know the equalization program remains the 
most important federal program for reducing disparities in this 
country. After equalization transfers the fiscal capacity of the 
less wealthy provinces is raised to about 93 per cent of the 
national average compared to about 85 per cent before 
equalization. This means that any province which levies average 
rates of taxation will be assured about $4,800 per capita with 
which to finance public services.
<P>
	As hon. members also know equalization is an unconditional 
transfer to the provinces. The payments under the program are 
determined by an established formula which calculates each 
province's capacity to raise revenues and then compares its 
fiscal capacity to a standard level. The payments then raise the 
less wealthy provinces to the standard level and the payments 
are made in per capita terms.
<P>
	As a person who comes from one of the smallest and one of the 
poorest provinces in Canada, I can assure hon. members how 
important equalization payments are to our province. I can also 
assure hon. members how upsetting it was for our provincial 
government on those occasions when it received less in 
equalization than had been anticipated.
<P>
	This five-year equalization renewal will allow our smaller 
and poorer provinces to provide consistent levels of service in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1045"> 1045 </A></B>
<P>
the future. In looking at the estimated equalization entitlements 
over the next five years, I see a  projected increase from $8 
billion in 1993-94 to approximately $10.4 billion in 1998-99. 
This represents an average growth of approximately 5 per cent.
<P>
	Looking at my own province I see it is estimated that Prince 
Edward Island's entitlement is projected to increase by some 
$16 million in the next fiscal year and in increments of $10 
million per year for each of the following years until the end of 
the agreement.
<P>
	The equalization program allows people in all regions of the 
country to enjoy roughly an equal level of service from our 
governments at reasonably equal levels of taxation. Looking 
back through history it is easy to see the historical precedents 
for making things equal across the country.
<P>
	This country, Canada, was brought together by the railway in 
defiance of economic and geographic factors which would have 
pulled us toward the United States. However, because the 
Fathers of Confederation felt it was important to establish an 
east-west axis in the country, great efforts were made to make 
the colonies unified from sea to sea by the railroad.
<P>
	That same philosophy applies to equalization. Canadians are 
united by a common level of service no matter where they live. 
The richer give part of their wealth to aid the poorer. If and when 
the economic patterns of the nation change, those areas which 
now receive these transfers would only be too happy to share 
their good fortune.
<P>
	Tariffs which were designed to protect industries in central 
Canada were an accepted part of the economic policies of the 
country and were of great benefit to Ontario. Preferential freight 
rates were of great assistance to the farmers of the Canadian 
prairies. Even projects like the St. Lawrence seaway are 
examples of the whole of Canada participating in programs 
which benefit one particular region.
<P>
	In the years since Confederation prosperity has moved from 
one part of Canada to the other. Canadians have responded to the 
changes by aiding and assisting those areas which are down on 
their luck.
<P>
	At the time of Confederation my region of Canada was the 
most prosperous. Later prosperity moved west, first to Ontario 
and then to the western provinces. The western provinces which 
suffered the worst in the great depression came to a time of great 
prosperity in the seventies and eighties. Now Atlantic Canada is 
the poorest region of Canada and we receive help from our 
fellow citizens.
<P>
	When we examine the documents released by the Minister of 
Finance we can see that Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, 
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in that order are the highest per 
capita recipients of equalization. The last few years have not 
been good in Atlantic Canada. We have suffered through the 
lengthy recession like the rest of the country. Now we are faced 
with the collapse of the ground fishery which was once part of 
our economic salvation.
<P>
	We all realize things are tough but we are optimistic that 
better days lie ahead. I can assure hon. members that we in 
Atlantic Canada are not terminal welfare cases. We are proud 
Canadians who through a combination of factors need this 
assistance at the present time. I would venture to say there is not 
one politician in Atlantic Canada today who would not willingly 
see funds from our region go forward to help poorer regions of 
the country if and when the economic basis were to change.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Right across the region governments are cutting back 
becoming leaner and more efficient. People are being 
encouraged to generate more economic activity. We must and 
we will develop the resources we have in Atlantic Canada and 
we will return to the prosperity we once enjoyed. What we need 
now is the level and stable assistance of the federal government 
to get us through these tough times.
<P>
	I must also say that we are living in a time of increasing 
optimism in my province. The fixed link project, the biggest 
construction project in Canada today, is bringing a new wave of 
confidence into Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, a 
confidence which our people will carry forward into the next 
century. I look forward to the day not many years from now 
when people from all over the world flock to Atlantic Canada to 
see this engineering wonder and when Atlantic Canadians who 
have constructed this massive project are in demand for similar 
projects around the world.
<P>
	The equalization program marks our compassion as a nation. 
Because of equalization no citizen of Canada is a second class 
citizen regardless of where they live. The citizens of Cape Race, 
Newfoundland, of York, P.E.I., of Montmagny, Quebec, of 
Watrous, Saskatchewan and of Vancouver, B.C. are all entitled 
to roughly the same level of service in the government. That is 
the essence of Canada. That is why this country remains united.
<P>
	As I noted earlier, that is why we have equalization, the 
levelling of service, just another manifestation of the Canadian 
way of doing things.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too have a few words to say on Bill C-3. I am rather pleased with 
the provisions of the bill. It does introduce a bit more certainty 
into the process of federal-provincial fiscal relations and avoids 
the excessive tax backs that have become not only an 
aggravation but such a big problem in real terms for several 
provincial governments, including the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador
<P>
	I share at least what my friend from Calgary West was saying 
in so far as that issue is concerned. There are other things I do 
not particularly share, but he is not in sight at the moment so at 
another time I am sure we will have an opportunity to pursue that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1046"> 1046 </A></B>
<P>
debate, not to give the impression that he and I are poles apart on 
this, but there are one or two points that need some discussion.
<P>
	The issue of transfer payments generally gets characterized in 
several ways as handouts, as assistance of some sort and I 
suppose in the general broad term it is assistance. I completely 
reject the notion of the handout context that some people want to 
talk about from time to time.
<P>
	The best way to illustrate my point is to go back in history just 
a bit to what Newfoundlanders and Labradorians call 
Confederation. To most in this Chamber and in this country 
Confederation conjures up the period of 1867. But for 
Newfoundlanders, when we talk about Confederation we refer to 
the great Confederation debates of 1946 to 1948, the two 
referenda of 1948 and the actual becoming part of Canada or, as 
we like to say, when the two dominions became one, because 
that is in effect what happened and what technically happened 
on March 31, 1949. Therefore when we talk of Confederation we 
mean that particular period.
<P>
	At that time we entered into a partnership. We did not apply to 
go on a welfare role. We entered into a partnership. In the 
process we gave up certain things.
<P>
	We stood by and had our small but rather vital and vibrant 
manufacturing base destroyed. We had a heavy trade going with 
what we called the Boston states, the New England states. We 
had a particularly lively trade going in fish and fish products, for 
example. It was a trade that was essentially wiped out by the 
coming of Confederation in 1949. We had some other 
manufactured commodities which had to take second place to 
the new central Canadian reality, the Ontario and Quebec 
reality, in terms of manufacturing prerequisites.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Therefore we have always seen transfer payments not in the 
context of some kind of handout but rather as part of a 
partnership that was entered into in 1949. As Newfoundlanders 
we have never made any apologies for the fact that we have a 
system of established programs financing and equalization 
payments.
<P>
	I see my friend from Calgary West has taken his seat again. 
We have to choose our words well around here. We are not 
allowed to draw attention to the absence of a member, but we can 
draw attention to his presence.
<P>
	This is the theme on which I was speaking last week. I 
understand the member for Calgary West speaks from a 
somewhat different perspective and so he should. We only have 
to look at the average family incomes of the ridings that he and I 
respectively represent.
<P>
	I represent a riding where the average family income is 
$24,900 and my friend from Hillsborough who spoke a moment 
ago represents a riding where the average family income is 
$24,220. Of course the gentleman from Calgary West represents 
a riding where the average family income is of the order of 
$41,000.
<P>
	If one looks to his colleague, who was there a moment ago and 
who has now joined us at least temporarily, the gentleman from 
Capilano-Howe Sound, he represents a riding where the 
average family income is $52,500. That is quite a difference. He 
is sitting with the gentleman from Scarborough East where the 
average family income is $44,800. I can see why they are 
talking; they have a fair amount in common. I say to my friend 
from Scarborough East that I hope he will persuade the 
gentleman from Capilano-Howe Sound to stay on. We could 
use his talent on this side of the House.
<P>
	We represent very different perspectives. The gentleman from 
Lethbridge and I have a fair amount in common because the kind 
of average family income in that riding would be of the order of 
$35,000 which is a bit higher than in my riding.
<P>
	It is not a bad indicator. If one looks at average family 
incomes in various parts of this country, one will very often 
understand why the delegates, the MPs from those areas, are 
saying very different things.
<P>
	That is why I have special compassion for my friend from 
Lethbridge. I wonder how he is managing in that caucus where 
all the high priced discussion is going on when he does not 
represent a very high priced riding, not in dollar terms at least. 
However I wish him the best. I know he is equal to the task. He 
has been in politics long enough not to need very much advice 
from me on the subject.
<P>
	Let us come back very briefly to Bill C-3, the equalization 
bill. It does two or three things I am rather happy about. Transfer 
payments generally help ensure that a province will have the 
means to provide a certain basic level of service. Surely that is 
the whole principle of equalization. That is what it is all about. 
What the Minister of Finance is doing here today is ensuring by 
building a little more certainty into the program that we can 
continue to discharge that mandate which is the principle under 
equalization.
<P>
	The whole business of transfer payments does something else. 
It provides for the mobility of people across the country. Those 
who have been here before have heard me talk about how people 
from my province literally have gone to the four corners of the 
earth, but particularly to the four corners of Canada to work.
<P>
	There are of the order of 10,000 or so in Fort McMurray in the 
riding of Athabasca. There are many thousands and tens of 
thousands in southern Ontario and all over the country working 
on the CP rail lines, including in Saskatchewan and in British 
Columbia. We in Canada are contributing to the economic 
stability of the country by having that mobility of people. If we 
have labour skills then they are accessible not only in terms of 
the province of origin but right across the country. That is a good 
thing. It flies in the face of all the myths we hear about people 
from Newfoundland and from Atlantic Canada generally being 
too lazy to get up and go where the jobs are. That is a theme you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1047"> 1047 </A></B>
<P>
will hear me talk on  very often because it is one that needs to be 
rejected at every possible opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	As I think I said in this House on Thursday, there are more 
native born people from my province living outside the province 
today than living inside. That is the best indication I can give 
that they are there where the labour activity and economic 
activity is.
<P>
	Transfer payments do something else, have traditionally done 
so, and continue to do so. They help to stabilize the economic 
situation in the seven provinces which are recipients of 
equalization. Surely it is the goal in the Canadian national 
interest to ensure that each of the provinces no matter how 
poor-poor in the context of fiscal yardsticks, certainly not poor 
in terms of human resources but poor in the first context-each 
province in the confederation, each of the 10 provinces and 
territories, is in an economically stable situation.
<P>
	It is easy to support Bill C-3. I invite members of the House 
on all sides not to confuse this debate with some other axes they 
want to grind later. This is a good bill. It brings them certainly to 
the old issue of transfer payments and it introduces a rate of 
growth of around 5 per cent. That is legitimate in the context of 
the demands of those particular provinces.
<P>
	I would hope that in this debate we would put our other axes 
which we have to grind aside and focus on the merit which is 
contained in the bill and give it the support of the entire House if 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for Burin-St. George's for his 
remarks. I know him by name. I have known him for a number of 
years but I can never remember the riding, which is why I am not 
Speaker, and unlike the hon. member was not even qualified to 
run for the post. We all know about the hon. member's legendary 
memory for the ridings and details of the ridings of every single 
member in this House.
<P>
	I want to ask a question of the member, maybe a little off the 
topic of his remarks, but I think would nevertheless be 
interesting for the House. He spoke about some of the economic 
problems that Newfoundland experienced after Confederation, 
some of the unfavourable restructuring of the Newfoundland 
economy that occurred, in his view, because of Confederation.
<P>
	He has talked about some of the benefits of Confederation, 
obviously this particular program which I reiterate we support 
the principle of, equalization and the benefits of transfers. He 
talked about the benefits of the mobility of the Newfoundland 
work force leaving the province.
<P>
	I think he would agree that if we look at the sum of that it is 
not a pretty picture, the loss of economic capacity in exchange 
for out-migration and transfer payments.
<P>
	I wonder if that is really how he would characterize 
Newfoundland's experience in Confederation. Whether he 
would or would not characterize it that way, would he share with 
us some of the options he sees for Newfoundland in terms of a 
greater economic participation in Confederation and what 
alternatives there are to long run dependence on programs like 
equalization or on developments like out-migration of 
population.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Calgary 
West. I would not characterize it that way. That is not the 
tradeoff at all.
<P>
	The point I was wanting to make at the beginning of my few 
remarks was with regard to those who talk condescendingly 
about transfer payments, as though somehow we are helping 
those poor people down there who are trying to keep body and 
soul together. I do not subscribe to that notion. I am saying that 
part of the tradeoff that we entered into in 1949 was the one that I 
described. In the interest of time I will not repeat that.
<P>
	I want to come to the second part of the member's question 
about what opportunities I see. One does not need to be a nuclear 
specialist to realize a couple of things. By the way in 1949 when 
we agreed to take on Canada as part of a larger nation, we were in 
the black in Newfoundland, don't forget.
<P>
	I did not hear the heckle so I do not what was said. Enjoy it 
anyway.
<P>
	We came in with a balance in 1949. That is not quite the case 
right now. There were a couple of reasons. We had a very 
thriving post-war economy based largely on the military. When I 
say ``the military'' I mean the very large presence of American 
forces in St. John's, many thousands in my riding of 
Stephenville and many thousands in Argentia and so on. That 
was a part of it. The strategic realities of the last few years have 
changed, hence the need for deployment of forces in 
Newfoundland. American forces have drastically altered over 
the last few years.
<P>
	We had a thriving fishing economy as well. I do not need to 
take the House through what has happened to that, particularly 
in the last two or three years. When I came to the House for the 
first time federally in 1979 I used to brag that my riding had the 
same unemployment rate as the province of Alberta at that 
particular time which was 3.8 per cent or 4 per cent. That was the 
unemployment rate in the riding of Burin-St. George's. The 
south coast of Newfoundland is essentially ice-free year round 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1048"> 1048 </A></B>
<P>
so people work there eleven to eleven and a half months a year. 
They do what all smart Newfoundlanders do: they take two 
weeks off at  Christmas and have a party and then go right back 
at it in January. That was the unemployment rate.
<P>
	It has changed considerably since then. There is a factor that 
the downturn in the fishery has caused problems for us. The 
opportunity, to respond to his question, is to crank the fishery 
back up.
<P>
	In closing, I am sure I will rile my friends from Quebec but 
this is not the intention. If we were were getting the economic 
value for hydro power we would not be one of those seven 
provinces today. We would be in the other column. We would not 
be getting any equalization payments, thank you very much, at 
all. If we were getting the economic value for our resource, 
Churchill Falls Power, we would not be needing one cent of 
equalization from the federal government.
<P>
	The opportunities are somewhat constrained by some of the 
political realities at the moment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-3, 
an act to amend the federal-provincial fiscal arrangements and 
more precisely the equalization system in place, is not a very 
exciting subject. If invited to give a lecture somewhere, one 
would certainly choose another topic to grab the public's 
attention.
<P>
	However, even if it represents a somewhat boring task, we 
must have debates like this one, especially in this House. Today 
we must examine closely the bill on equalization payments. Of 
course there are precise measures we must look at because they 
come to term at the beginning of April, but equalization is a 
measure which is part of the complete transfer program.
<P>
	Members will know that transfers are crucial for the 
provinces. These payments represent a very important part of 
their revenues, a share which has decreased over the recent 
years, particularly in Quebec we look at the province's situation 
as a whole.
<P>
	We examine the equalization system today, but soon, next 
year, there will be other obligations, we will have to examine 
other transfers, particularly as regards established programs 
financing. Even if it looks like transfers are being increased in 
that area, we must be very careful and follow closely any future 
developments. We cannot have this debate and disregard the 
present state of government finances. The finance minister 
cannot but take it into account when reviewing transfer 
payments to the provinces. It is probably his main concern, 
which explains his drifting away from the initial objectives of 
the equalization system.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	We do not want to disregard the present state of government 
finance, however, we cannot ask others to make choices for us. 
In the past few years, it has been a concern and a trend which 
could very well continue.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, during the election campaign, it was 
very difficult to pinpoint the position of the Liberal Party in this 
respect. The position of the Conservative Party was much 
clearer: transfer payments to the provinces would be cut. Among 
the Liberal ranks, they did not talk a lot about that; they skirted 
the issue and talked instead about the infrastructure program; 
they kept on pointing at the infrastructure program as a means of 
creating jobs, but we never got to the bottom of things regarding 
what the Liberal Party really intended to do with the whole issue 
of transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	At the very beginning of their mandate, they came out with the 
first part of their plan, saying: ``Look, we are not going to cut 
transfer payments to the provinces,» since it appears that we are 
going to have a 5 per cent increase in equalization payments this 
year. And they gave us projections. But we have to be careful 
regarding this 5 per cent, especially compared with the 
objectives of the equalization system; I will get back to that later 
on.
<P>
	Let us look at what transfer payments comprise. They are 
made up of four parts, for a total of $40.5 billion a year in federal 
expenditures.
<P>
	First, there is established programs financing, mainly in the 
education and health care fields; it is a very important part. 
Then, there is the Canada Assistance Plan, which deals more 
with social assistance, and accounts for around $7.8 billion; it is 
indeed a lot of money. The third part is the equalization 
payments which total approximately $8 billion. There is also 
cost-shared program financing which is one of the central 
elements, with $12 billion.
<P>
	There has been much pulling out in this regard in the last few 
years. What causes a major problem is that the government 
attaches so-called common objectives to these shared costs and 
then pulls out, leaving the provinces to shoulder the burden of 
these programs by themselves or to pay the political price when 
they are axed.
<P>
	It is not always easy to explain this to taxpayers who, 
understandably, cannot follow closely what goes on every day. 
But we recently went through a gradual transfer that started here 
and ended up with the municipalities. It is not easy for a mayor 
or a city councillor to explain that budget cuts in federal 
transfers to provinces led provincial governments to make more 
difficult choices that ended up in the municipalities' court. It is 
obvious that, from a political standpoint, efforts are being made 
to soften the blow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1049"> 1049 </A></B>
<P>
	All this was done to make users more aware of costs. It is not 
necessarily a bad thing, but we must be careful: objectives and 
cutbacks are not always defined in the same terms as we do not 
always agree.
<P>
	The equalization system is special in the sense that it transfers 
money to provincial governments, which have much more 
flexibility to do with it what they want.
<P>
	It is these four elements that define transfer payments. Let us 
now look at the basic objective of the equalization system, 
which is one of these elements.
<P>
	The basic objective of equalization is to ensure horizontal or 
vertical redistribution. This can seem very theoretical but the 
objective is to ensure that, in the end, each province has the 
same capacity to provide an adequate level of service.
<P>
	Equalization measures the provinces' capacity to collect 
revenue according to various factors and a 31-element tax base. 
This is all very complex. Equalization is a mathematical system 
that would give nightmares to any professor having to teach it in 
a maths course, even an advanced maths course. Not many 
people are looking at this closely to try to understand how the 
system works, but it is important. These very serious matters 
affect our daily decisions and actions. And these links are not 
easy to establish.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	So, after assessing the capacity of the provinces to generate 
revenues, you compare it to a sample of five provinces, make 
some adjustments, and translate the result in dollars per capita. 
That gives you the amount of money to be given to the 
provinces. There are seven provinces which actually get some 
money under this program, including Quebec, which will 
receive, yes, $3.7 billion out of the $8.4 billion set out for next 
year. There are reasons for this, and I will get back to them, 
because I heard the hon. member for Calgary West refer to them 
earlier, and I will address this issue in a little while.
<P>
	This whole issue is important for the Bloc Quebecois, but 
there is one thing we have to remember. Soon, Quebecers will 
have collective choices to make. At that time, it is true that we 
will not have to deal with this equalization system. We may have 
to create another one within our own country. Nevertheless, this 
system will not be affecting us, not anymore. Meanwhile, the 
Bloc Quebecois has to protect Quebec's interests here and play 
its role as the Official Opposition. That is what we are going to 
do, and that is what we are doing. We will try to improve the 
whole principle behind the transfers to the provinces. There is 
room for a lot of improvement.
<P>
	The bill before us has two major flaws. The first one is the 
ceiling, which affects the basic principle of the equalization 
system, since transfers are subject to a maximum level of 5 per 
cent if economic growth is higher. Given the situation, some of 
the richer provinces will be able to get even richer, and if the 
poorer provinces have trouble generating revenues, the gap will 
widen. At the present time, in spite of the equalization  system, 
there is a 12 per cent difference in the capacity to generate 
revenues between the have provinces and the have-not 
provinces. You should remember that that capacity is what 
differentiates the richer provinces from the poorer provinces.
<P>
	A previous ceiling was set at the end of the 1980s, and another 
one for the 1993-94 fiscal year. Of course, during the recession, 
when economic growth was slower, the ceiling had less severe 
consequences, but still resulted in a decrease of $2.9 billion in 
transfers. Of the additional $2.9 billion in transfers, $1.8 billion 
would have gone to Quebec. These lost revenues forced Quebec 
to make the difficult choices I was telling you about a moment 
ago. They forced Quebec to gradually pass the burden on to the 
municipalities and, increasingly, to the taxpayers.
<P>
	We will not be able to say forever that the principle of 
equalization justifies the measures now being taken. It is not the 
principle, it is the fiscal constraints that justify these measures. 
Let us not mince words. We have to say it because it is the truth. 
That is the reason for this provision. As I was saying at the 
beginning of my remarks, the fact that the government wants to 
increase transfer payments does not mean that we will not have 
to examine the whole issue of transfers to the provinces. We 
have to look at what is going on to realize that there is an 
election looming in Quebec. I can hardly imagine the present 
premier, Mr. Daniel Johnson, campaigning with cuts in 
equalization payments pending, on top of all the other problems 
he has to face. This would be very difficult for him since he will 
have to demonstrate the effectiveness of federalism, including 
from a fiscal point of view. It will be a real challenge for him, 
and I can tell you that we will be there to take part in this debate 
and he will have to prove his point. So, this will be very difficult 
for him.
<P>
	But what will happen next year, when the election is over and 
other programs have to be renewed? It is something that we will 
have to watch. Maybe this is just a smokescreen to hide the 
Minister of Finance's real intentions, and this is why we heard 
him say that it would be a tough budget this year, that he would 
reduce the deficit to perhaps $38 billion. We will know soon. 
But watch what will happen next year, watch where the money is 
going to come from.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The other principle contained in the bill is that there will be 
changes-and that is even more technical-in tax bases as such 
and in their composition. It would be interesting if the 
committee could review the regulations in order to evaluate 
their impact more precisely. We already have an idea of that 
impact but they really should be made available to the 
committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1050"> 1050 </A></B>
<P>
	In that regard the Quebec government has some demands of 
its own, especially in the field of property taxation, that may 
seem legitimate in certain respects and that deserve to be 
examined. The finance committee could take a look at it. That 
would add to its workload but that committee does not have a 
reputation for idleness. We will give it a look.
<P>
	I would now like to speak about the results of equalization 
because one day we might have to question the way transfers are 
made to provinces. I repeat, despite equalization, there is a 12 
per cent gap between the fiscal capacity of the richest and the 
poorest provinces, even though equalization has been paid all 
these years. The principle of transfers to the provinces has 
existed since after World War II. Inequities are still visible 
across Canada; all regions have not reached the same level of 
development. That can be explained and I will do that while 
commenting a bit on the speech of my colleague, the hon. 
member from Calgary West, who said that what counts is not the 
amounts spent but the quality of the spending.
<P>
	In this regard, we fail to understand why the federal 
government has spent so little on research and development in 
Quebec compared to Ontario which does not get equalization 
payments. But then one cannot have it both ways. One cannot get 
50 per cent of all research and development expenditures and, at 
the same time, equalization payments that are often used to 
finance shared cost programs, welfare programs and so forth.
<P>
	We would very much prefer a better dollar. We would be quite 
proud to contribute to equalization rather than benefit from it. It 
would be a sure sign that we have greater fiscal capacity and are 
in a better financial situation.
<P>
	We do not need to be geniuses to understand that provinces 
who do not benefit from our equalization system are in a 
relatively good financial situation. Ontario, as we shall see, 
experienced numerous problems in the last few years. But 
British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario get by pretty well.
<P>
	Things do not look as good in Quebec, because of a lack of 
vision or all kinds of reasons. Expenditures and investments 
there have been ill advised. Spending was done more on 
structures than on research and development. It would be 
interesting to look at other programs too. Those issues are being 
discussed. During the election campaign, we talk about them to 
a certain extent, and even quite a bit. In the next few years, this 
House will have to look at them because the political context 
will leave us no other choice. We will prove our point, and we 
will be delighted to hold the debate the hon. member for Calgary 
West mentioned earlier.
<P>
	A little while ago, I skimmed through a fascinating magazine 
called <I>Options politiques</I> in which an article by Gilles Godbout 
lists a number of points in his assessment of the equalization 
system of federal transfers to provinces. He points out a number 
of contradictions. He  says, and I will quote his five points, 
starting with the following: The importance of the redistribution 
function played by transfer payments to provinces has been 
recognized in the 1982 Constitution Act. The purpose of 
equalization, which is to guarantee that provinces have enough 
revenues to ensure comparable levels of public services at 
comparable levels of taxation, was even spelled out in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	The same year, the federal government placed a ceiling on 
equalization payments, thus reducing the redistributive effect of 
the program. This is the first contradiction in the first year.
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government made repeated cuts to the 
other transfer programs, regardless of regional disparities, 
particularly in the funding of health and post-secondary 
education. When we look at the data on the system's funding, for 
health as well as post-secondary education, when we look at the 
contributions that are made, and I have looked only at those 
made for Quebec, I can tell you that the situation is tragic 
because payments are going down instead of going up.
<P>
	In spite of its financial withdrawal, the government has 
reaffirmed its commitment to maintain national standards in the 
health sector. These standards significantly limit the provinces' 
capacity to better manage essential public services.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	That is not new. Because of its spending power, the federal 
government always wanted to set the standards, although when 
it reduces financing, they stay the same. We soon discovered the 
problems that caused for the provinces. It is very hard to 
maintain standards, requiring funds, when there is no money 
available.
<P>
	Finally, it is said that the federal government is interfering in 
several sectors with its shared cost programs, a fact 
advantageous to provinces with a high spending power. Of 
course, it is often a question of money per capita. This way, the 
provinces which are well off are managing quite well. Members 
who are interested in equalization and transfers to provinces 
could find that article very revealing.
<P>
	Now, let us examine the situation as a whole, in the few 
minutes left. The Bloc Quebecois is sensitive to public finance 
issues and that is why we suggested alternatives. We said we 
wanted to look at expenditures item by item. We would like a 
review of the tax system which is generating a lot of unfair and 
unjust privileges. We are ready to work towards this end. A lot of 
work is being done, but a lot more could be done to make this 
into something very positive. This is very important for the 
economy of Quebec and the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I am afraid that the whole problem of public spending will be 
passed on to the provinces and that they will have to pay the 
price and make some difficult choices, the choices we have 
trouble making here, or that the government will try to make 
them start sooner. It may be tempting to look at items like 
transfer payments to the  provinces, which total $40.5 billion 
and are a major share of the federal budget, and say that we will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1051"> 1051 </A></B>
<P>
start cutting there. This would force the provinces to go the same 
route. It is risky to take the lead and impose certain standards. 
Federal spending powers mean that the government remains 
involved in a lot of areas where there is overlap, because of joint 
standards. We must also realize that taxes raised at both levels 
are used for the same purpose. The system is not exactly a model 
of efficiency.
<P>
	We must be vigilant in this respect, and we intend to monitor 
this very closely. As I said earlier, I am mainly concerned about 
the fact that this year, equalization payments will be increased, 
but with a ceiling, which in our opinion is inefficient. Wait and 
see what happens next year to the rest of the transfer payments to 
the provinces, and watch the announcements in the next budget.
<P>
	I intend to keep today's speech and take it out again and look 
at it after next year's budget. I am sure there will be some drastic 
cuts in transfer payments to the provinces. That is an easy 
prediction to make. It is understandable in the current political 
climate that we should want to wish to help our federalist friends 
from Quebec on the other side of the House and support a 
one-year postponement of cutbacks in transfer payments to the 
provinces.
<P>
	In concluding, there are a number of measures that would be 
appropriate to improve equalization and the system of transfer 
payments to the provinces, and I will mention a few. Reforms 
should be carried out in accordance with certain principles. 
Criticism should be constructive.
<P>
	First of all, there should be no cuts in transfer payments to the 
provinces, either in real terms or per capita, to ensure that 
fairness remains a part of the equation and that the provinces are 
able to offer quality services to their residents. There is also the 
question of national standards which do not reflect Quebec's 
specific needs. National standards have always been a problem. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot referred to this 
earlier, and we often hear people talking about problems 
generated by national or joint standards and the time it takes to 
solve these problems.
<P>
	My next point concerns federal interference, especially in 
matters of provincial jurisdiction, which is another source of 
inefficiency. Reforms should aim at improved redistribution of 
revenues among the various provinces, especially in the case of 
equalization payments. The ceiling on such payments should be 
removed, since it contradicts the very principles of the system. 
Reforms should provide incentives for more effective financial 
management. This measure concerns shared cost programs such 
as the Canada Assistance Plan.
<P>
	These are the principles that would guide us if we had a choice 
and if the government were willing to change the transfer 
payments system. Of course, there will be choices to make in 
Quebec so that eventually we may be ahead of the game. 
Nevertheless, these principles would be useful for all 
Canadians. The situation is serious because of the inequities in 
the system. I will now conclude my speech, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Injustice is often the root cause of disobedience, civil or 
otherwise, as we have seen in the smuggling issue. People must 
feel there is fairness in the system. It is not enough to talk about 
fairness and justice. We must practise what we preach. And we 
could start right now by removing the ceiling in this bill. It 
would certainly be an improvement.
<P>
	For the reasons I mentioned earlier, we cannot support this 
bill and intend to vote against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated some of the comments made by my hon. 
colleague. I would, however, like to ask him a question. With 
respect to national standards, it seems to me that the Bloc is 
truly unaware of what it going on in the world today.
<P>
	In Europe, for instance, a number of countries have 
established national standards that go way beyond what had long 
been in existence as far as different cultures, languages and so 
forth were concerned. Why this hesitation to go along with 
national standards? Why can we not sit down together and agree 
on reasonable national standards and give the provinces the 
chance to decide how they will meet these standards? Why 
dismiss or simply ignore what is going on in a number of other 
countries in the world, not to mention the benefits of having 
national standards?
<P>
	There seems to be a feeling that national standards are a bad 
thing. This is not the case and I would like the hon. member to 
comment on this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> One should not believe that the Bloc is alone in 
taking this stand. There is a fairly broad consensus in Quebec on 
the issue of national standards. One need only look at manpower 
training to realize how difficult it is to have common programs.
<P>
	I think that the principle here is not being grasped. When the 
Meech Lake agreement was signed, there was a willingness to 
recognize the principle of two nations. Language and culture are 
not the only things that set a nation apart. Often it is the way 
things are done. We have different aims and we go about solving 
certain problems differently. National standards prevent us from 
achieving our goals since they are defined and often imposed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1052"> 1052 </A></B>
<P>
even by virtue of the sums of money allocated. This is very 
difficult to accept.
<P>
	If each side were able to set its own standards, this would not 
preclude, for example, that at the international level-and this is 
a very specific example and I would hope that this would be the 
case in the future, even though it would prove very 
difficult-there would be general agreement on minimum 
environmental standards to be met. This would be desirable.
<P>
	Which is not to say that minimum standards should be set to 
instruct each community on the training of its workers. Each 
economic milieu has its own specific characteristics, its own 
special niches, therefore, it can adapt more quickly. National or 
broad measures or standards are often cumbersome or slow to 
respond. The closer one is to that milieu, the more one is 
grounded in reality and the quicker one is to react.
<P>
	The constraints we now face in terms of international 
economic development, namely the opening up of markets and 
the free movement of goods, capital and people, mean that those 
who have the ability to respond the fastest will be the ones who 
are best able to cope in the future. We have to avoid getting 
bogged down in national standards that are not to our liking, 
often do not correspond to our needs and create a great deal of 
friction between Canadians and Quebecers because they cannot 
agree on their definition.
<P>
	When Quebec is a sovereign country, and I hope this comes to 
pass, we will set our own standards, while Canadians will set 
theirs. I think that it will be much easier for both sides to set 
their own standards and if we were to agree eventually on 
common standards in specific areas such as the environment, 
well then so much the better. But first, we have to start with the 
basics, with our own milieu. This is the preferred approach of 
the Bloc Quebecois and of a good many Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for Témiscamingue for his excellent speech. 
He talked a lot about equity and I would like to make a few 
comments in this regard. When we talk about equity, we are 
talking about a fairer redistribution of wealth among the 
provinces. What we should be asking ourselves is why some 
provinces are poorer than others. We could look at the problem 
before distribution and ask why Ontario is a wealthy province 
while Quebec is not so well off. I do not like to hear that my 
province is poor or not so wealthy.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	When we are making every effort to succeed in life and some 
higher authority, the federal government for instance, keeps us 
from developing to our full potential, I do not like to be seen as 
poor. I would like to use every opportunity to develop to my full 
potential, as the hon. member said earlier. For example: why did 
Ontario receive research and development contracts worth $1.2 
billion more, in 1989, than Quebec. Would research and 
development not enable us to make money and to help our 
businesses grow? Is this not the reason why Quebec is a little 
poorer than Ontario? I do not like to be seen as  poor. I would 
like to be able to give money to other provinces, as the hon. 
member said earlier. But it is not the fault of Quebecers if their 
province is poorer, it is the fault of the federal government that 
does not give Quebec the means to develop to its full potential. It 
is for these very reasons that we want to leave.
<P>
	Here is a flagrant example of the other reason: in 1989, I asked 
the head of Statistics Canada how their employees were 
distributed across Canada. I was told that they were distributed 
very fairly, with about 180 employees in Ontario, 150 in 
Quebec, about 80 in the Maritimes and 80 in the West. I told the 
head of Statistics Canada that there was something wrong with 
his calculation since their total workforce is about 4,000. He 
said yes, but 3,500 people work here in Ottawa. But where is 
Ottawa? Ottawa is in Ontario. These people pay taxes in 
Ontario. They are fuelling the Ontario machine. They are 
helping Ontario to prosper. It is for these reasons that Ontario is 
better developed and richer than Quebec. For all these reasons. 
One does not have to look very far to see that Ontario is richer 
and more successful because the federal government treats it 
better.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Boniface should pay more attention 
so he can understand all this. He would then realize that he, too, 
is being penalized. He should react a little more, too.
<P>
	I would like to say, once again, that the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue has delivered an excellent speech. He did an 
excellent job of outlining the problems we, in Quebec, are 
facing. I totally agree with what he said in his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the comments of the 
hon. member for Longueuil whose example of Statistics Canada 
illustrated the situation well. A little over a year ago, I did some 
work, a study on research and development expenditures. As it 
were, almost all the money spent within the federal government, 
the intramuros expenditures as we call them were made here, in 
Ottawa and the National Capital region. So, by force of 
circumstance, most of the R and D investments are made in this 
region.
<P>
	In some cases, the determining factor is the fact that the 
National Research Council is located here, but that does not 
explain everything and even then, the rest of the R and D funds 
should be distributed more equitably. That is why, as the hon. 
member said, we must look at the causes and the root of 
problems if we want to have a clear understanding.
<P>
	I would like to mention a point that is coming back to me 
regarding the definition of the standards mentioned earlier. We 
would not be too happy in some ways-and I do not know what 
the hon. member for St. Boniface thinks of this-if we were to 
have common standards and that standards set by the Americans 
would apply to Quebec and Canada. It would not always be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1053"> 1053 </A></B>
<P>
pleasant to have models that are far from our reality, especially 
in the area of health, where we have a completely different  
system here, although the Americans are starting to lean in our 
direction now.
<P>
	In that regard we must be careful. This does not mean that we 
cannot agree eventually to standards in very specific areas like 
the environment, as I pointed out earlier. But for the rest, we 
must be very careful with regard to standards and that is why we 
have this plan.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
speak about this legislation and interesting to listen to the 
comments of others.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	We in New Brunswick would like to be a have province. As we 
continue working toward improving our economy and 
improving our lot, we feel we ultimately will be a have province 
and will be able to contribute to those provinces which are less 
fortunate. Right now we have the problem where our resource 
base and our economy do not generate as much wealth as we 
would like. Therefore this legislation and the program that is 
contemplated by the changes recommended by the Minister of 
Finance are vitally important to New Brunswickers.
<P>
	For those who are not aware of exactly what the bill contains, 
we are talking about equalization and making things fair. Each 
province has its own complaints. I have listened to members 
opposite talk about the different things that bother them, that 
they do not feel they are getting a fair shake. From time to time 
all provinces have complaints and feel they are hard done by. 
Most of the rest of the people in the world would like to be as 
hard done by as we are, with the resources, wealth and 
opportunities that exist for us.
<P>
	Over the years the Liberal Party has stood for many things. 
One thing it has stood for is the principle of equality for all 
Canadians. This has been under attack by some. It is a difficult 
situation to maintain but it is a goal and an objective to which we 
should aspire. The changes this legislation puts forward will go 
some way to help the situation.
<P>
	The purpose of equalization is to enable provincial 
governments to provide their residents with comparable levels 
of public service at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. It 
could not be achieved in the country without the principle of 
equalization.
<P>
	Right now we face a situation in which approximately seven 
provinces qualify for equalization payments. I imagine that each 
one of those seven provinces is hoping it will be out of that 
situation and will be contributing rather than taking.
<P>
	It is important to realize that in this legislation not only is 
some additional money going to the provinces. The legislation is 
also going to make changes which are also being made to help 
the natural resource based provinces of Atlantic Canada and in 
the west. What happens is a tax back because of the resource 
based economies. In part I a change is contemplated that will 
alter the formulas that are being applied so that it will not be a 
detriment to those provinces that have large natural resource 
contributions to their GNP. I imagine the members from Alberta 
and British Columbia are very pleased with this legislation and 
what it will do to assist them. Obviously Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba will see great benefits.
<P>
	As well we have to look at what we are trying to equalize. We 
are not talking about frivolous things. We are talking about basic 
public services that are rendered to all Canadians. With that in 
mind this legislation goes a long way toward correcting some of 
the anomalies that have developed.
<P>
	In 1991 the former Conservative government cut $100 million 
in support to the province of New Brunswick just by changing 
the formula. The government in New Brunswick had already 
prepared a balanced budget and all of a sudden with a change in 
the formula and support the federal government was going to 
provide, the province of New Brunswick lost $110 million in 
equalization payments. For a province like New Brunswick it 
blew the whole budget process out of whack. As Premier 
McKenna said at the time New Brunswick was being penalized 
for being better off: ``The better off we are the worse we do''.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The net effect of that was to take a province which probably 
has one of the most dynamic economies in the country right now 
and to penalize it when we should be trying to assist it. This 
legislation and the changes that are contemplated here will go in 
some measure toward getting a certainty back into the system. It 
will change the ceilings on the formulas so that they are applied 
more equally and better to all of the provinces in the country. It 
will allow provinces like New Brunswick to expand their 
economy, make things happen, but at the same time not penalize 
them when they are successful.
<P>
	It reminds me of the situation with UI, which is another 
program that this government is finally going to deal with. It 
seems that any person who is on UI and tries to better themselves 
or tries to take advantage of educational retraining programs is 
automatically penalized as far as their UI program is concerned. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1054"> 1054 </A></B>
<P>
They stand to lose their UI support while they are trying to 
retrain themselves.
<P>
	We see in that circumstance an anomaly which is applicable 
here. A province which starts to pull itself up by the bootstraps, 
starts to make its economy function better, is being penalized so 
that it is going to lose rather than gain. Those are the types of 
things we have to change and this program goes a long way 
toward that.
<P>
	I am not sure whether people understand exactly how the 
program works, but the payments are determined by a formula. 
You probably have the formula committed to memory, Mr. 
Speaker. It does calculate each province's capacity to raise 
revenue, compares the fiscal capacity to a standard level, and 
then raises less wealthy provinces to that standard level. The 
payments are calculated on a per capita basis.
<P>
	What we see is that after equalization transfers the fiscal 
capacity of the seven less wealthy provinces in Canada will be 
about 93 per cent of the national average, compared with 85 per 
cent before equalization.
<P>
	That is an obvious benefit to those provinces. It will allow 
them to continue to maintain the basic services that each 
province offers. It will help curtail the trickle down effect of 
what the federal government does as it relates to municipalities, 
and that too should have some benefit.
<P>
	What was happening, and we saw it in all provinces, 
particularly in mine, was that the provinces were taking some of 
the cuts that were hitting them from the federal government and 
passing those down to the municipalities. We all know that 
municipalities have the least amount of resources available to 
them to raise taxes and to provide services to their citizens. In 
that sense we should see some benefit by arresting this process 
of trickle down cuts.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to thank the Chair for the opportunity to 
address this particular issue. We are going to see $8 billion 
spent. We are going to see it equally spent on the basis of per 
capita and on the basis of the formula throughout the country.
<P>
	Over the long term we are going to see a huge expenditure of 
money. I think the total when the program is over is quite 
substantial, I believe up to about $900 million in additional 
expenditure, with $160-odd million in the ensuing year. All of 
that is again going to assist governments in maintaining a basic 
level of service. It is also going to see money being put back into 
the economy. Hopefully we will see us start to move forward 
rather than stay in the recession mired economy that has existed 
for the total period of time that the Tories were in power.
<P>
	I realize my time is over and I thank the Chair for the 
opportunity.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the renewal of the 
equalization program for the next five years, starting April 1, 
1994, because I believe that this transfer program is among the 
most important. In a way, it makes our country unique, in that we 
are ready to share, albeit imperfectly, the wealth of all this great 
country.
<P>
	According to the current provisions, equalization payments 
will grow from $8 billion in 1993-94 to $10.4 billion in 
1998-99, that is, within five years. This is an average annual 
growth rate of more than 5 per cent. It is a very large growth rate, 
considering the financial situation we are in now.
<P>
	What are we trying to do with this program? Well, quite 
simply, we are trying to establish a level of funding within 
Canada to provide services of comparable quality for all 
citizens. As I just said, it is an important program, although less 
than perfect, but it still succeeds in giving more to the provinces 
that have less.
<P>
	We were just talking about national standards. I accept them 
provided that they are established with elected officials who 
meet and discuss possible objectives. Then the provinces should 
be allowed, not just allowed but asked, because some of them 
have a constitutional responsibility, to decide how they will 
achieve these objectives that were established in discussion, 
dialogue and co-operation with one another.
<P>
	I find the following fact interesting. Are agreements like 
GATT or NAFTA not bilateral or multilateral standards? If I 
understood correctly, the program between the province of 
Quebec and the federal government was just being criticized. 
There is a flagrant contradiction in that. Clearly they are 
prepared to enter agreements with other countries involving 
dialogue, discussion and co-operation, but here, because we 
belong to the same country, they are not prepared to do so. I find 
that unfortunate and even unhealthy.
<P>
	I believe that all Canadians, including Quebecers-note that I 
do not say Canadians and Quebecers; I say ``all Canadians, 
including Quebecers''-derive significant benefit from this 
transfer program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was just indicating that this is one of the very important 
transfer programs because it attempts to ensure that all 
Canadians, whether they live in the territories, in Quebec, in my 
home province of Manitoba or wherever in this grand nation, 
receive comparable levels of service so that the quality of life 
for each Canadian is as even as possible and as like one another 
as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1055"> 1055 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not perfect but let us remember that it is an attempt to 
redistribute wealth so that we can have from our provincial 
governments and from other levels of government services that 
compare favourably with one another and that we do not have 
one part of the country so terribly disadvantaged that the basic 
essentials of life such as health, education and other services do 
not exist or have for all intents and purposes disappeared.
<P>
	We want to remind each other that there are three provinces 
which give. That is often forgotten. The provinces of Alberta, 
British Columbia and Ontario redistribute some of their wealth 
to the seven other provinces. It is unfortunately something that 
is forgotten and probably something that is resented by certain 
citizens of those provinces on occasion. I would say generally 
speaking it is reasonably well accepted that those with more, 
even though it has been difficult, will share some of that extra.
<P>
	It must be remembered as well that this is an unconditional 
transfer payment. In other words we do not really put conditions 
that it must be spent on such and such a program.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	However it must be spent in such a way that the essential 
programs or those basic programs to citizens are maintained so 
that they enjoy as much as possible a quality of life as similar as 
possible to that of others in other jurisdictions.
<P>
	I have heard today the ceiling and the floor criticized. Surely 
if we are going to be responsible we need to have a ceiling and a 
floor. We cannot simply pay out without any restrictions. We 
cannot simply let the bottom fall out without any restrictions.
<P>
	I was really surprised that no one got up and applauded the 
government or said thanks for having come to its senses unlike 
the previous government. Five years of this particular program 
has been given so we can plan. We know what the ceiling is. We 
know what the floor is. Now we can make decisions much more 
easily on those programs that are under our jurisdiction, our 
responsibility. Perhaps that will happen before the debate is 
over. I am hoping it does.
<P>
	Finally, we need to remind ourselves that if we did not have 
the program there would be a lot less equity, a lot less fairness. 
Some provinces would have a lot less than others. This gives us a 
sort of efficiency capacity, in other words being like one another 
in terms of providing basic essential services, of roughly 93 per 
cent as opposed to roughly 85 per cent if we did not have this.
<P>
	It makes up a significant contribution to equalization of 
services to bring additional equity into the country in the 
services we offer our citizenry.
<P>
	Let me make two final comments before I invite remarks. I 
want to read to Canadians and my colleagues here the kinds of 
moneys being transferred through this particular program 
during fiscal 1993-1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, we transferred $910 million to the Northwest 
Territories, $164 million to Prince Edward Island, $880 million 
to Nova Scotia, $895 million to New Brunswick, $3.739 billion 
to Quebec, $854 million to Manitoba and $522 million to 
Saskatchewan, for a total of nearly $8 billion in 1993-94.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a lot of dollars being redistributed for the benefit of 
citizens who happen to live in those particular provinces and in 
those two territories.
<P>
	I believe this is the kind of program that makes Canada 
unique. It is the kind of program that takes, even in very difficult 
times such as the ones we are experiencing right now, from those 
who have more-the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and 
Ontario-and redistributes to those other seven provinces and 
the territories that have considerably less, relatively speaking.
<P>
	I applaud the government for the five-year program, for the 
limitations that it has put in place, because it is good for 
long-term planning. It is wise management. I would hope we 
would put aside our political differences which need to exist for 
a moment at least to see how the program can serve Canadians 
and perhaps be improved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think that is what we should aim for today, tomorrow and 
beyond.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was impressed by how the hon. member for St. 
Boniface paid close attention when my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois made his speech.
<P>
	I myself listened very carefully to his own speech, which the 
hon. member was kind enough to make in the two official 
languages, since he is fluent in both, and I thank him for doing 
that.
<P>
	However, I would like to point out to him some nuances. For 
example, when the hon. member compares standards related to 
Canada's signing of an economic treaty such as NAFTA, it must 
be stressed that those are international standards. It seems to me 
that, in French, national and international standards are two 
different things.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	NAFTA standards apply specifically to agreements on the 
economy, the environment and labour relations, among others 
things. I must admit here that I am not an expert on this treaty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1056"> 1056 </A></B>
<P>
	National standards, to the extent that they apply to this large 
country, aim at somehow putting all the provinces on an equal 
footing. It so happens that, out of the ten provinces in Canada, 
one claims to be different. What makes people and nations 
different is precisely their differences. You will understand, as 
will all the members in this House, I am sure, that when the 
federal government tries to impose standards in the education 
sector to Quebecers, our province, which defines itself as a 
state, and which will soon officially become one, must reject 
such national standards. I might add that the federal government 
has been trying to impose those standards for several decades.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to say that I 
appreciate the comments made by the hon. member. I agree with 
her first comment. Indeed there are major differences between 
national and international standards. However, the process is 
quite similar in that elected representatives sit down together to 
discuss issues and reach some agreement. The agreement is not 
imposed: it is negotiated. I do hope that the hon. member will 
recognize that other side of the coin. Of course, nothing can be 
perfect but this is not to say that there is no similarity, because 
there is some similarity.
<P>
	The hon. member also said that the Canadian government 
imposes its decisions, but the Quebec government has also done 
the same on occasion, as well as the government for the 
Northwest Territories. It may be that we impose our views too 
often. But to claim that Canada constantly does that is unfair, 
insensitive and totally inappropriate.
<P>
	I would like to make another comment. If, some day, Quebec 
does become an independent nation, then that new nation will 
decide how it will negotiate and decide whether it wants to deal 
with Canada. But this is not a fait accompli. Why not work 
within the existing structure? Why not consider that your party, 
which forms the Official Opposition, is there to represent all 
Canadians? I deplore the fact that this is often overlooked. We 
only talk about Quebec, Quebec and Quebec. I truly love 
Quebec. My ancestors came from Quebec. I have not forgotten 
my language nor my culture, but I have a responsibility, as the 
member for St. Boniface, to represent not only my constituents 
but also the rest of Canada. And that includes Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in entering this 
debate on Bill C-3, an act to amend the federal-provincial fiscal 
arrangements, I want to focus on two things. First, I will make 
some comments on the bill and equalization and, second, look at 
equalization in other areas of governments in reference to the 
formula that we are establishing today.
<P>
	The bill has two basic purposes. The first purpose is certainly 
to try to eliminate the disparities that may exist among the 
provinces. The second is to design a formula for the 
redistribution of federal taxes to these seven provinces; some $8 
billion in the early stages and as we move to 1999 some $10.4 
billion.
<P>
	There are some positive aspects of the bill as I examined it. 
First, the bill does have the support of the provinces of Canada 
and that is significant in itself.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Those who have worked at official levels and at ministerial 
levels have worked it through. They have reached agreement 
with the provinces and the provinces support the equalization 
formula that is here and the basic concept. That is important as 
we as legislators pass this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The bill is an attempt to reduce fiscal disparities among 
provinces. As my colleague from Calgary said earlier in the 
House, basically we as the Reform Party support that objective.
<P>
	I look back at my own history as a legislator and think back to 
the 1960s when I entered the legislative assembly of Alberta. 
This program, as we all recognize, came into effect in 1957. It 
was in its early stages of maturity and understanding in the 
mid-1960s. I remember raising the question when I came into 
the legislature with the premier of the day, the Hon. Ernest 
Manning. I asked about the resources and the revenue of Alberta 
being distributed to the other provinces and on what basis we 
made that decision.
<P>
	I recall the premier's comments very clearly at that time. He 
indicated to me that as a have province which has been blessed 
with natural resources, oil, gas, water and forestry, we have an 
obligation to help others not blessed with some of the same 
types of resources. That was the thinking of the fathers of fiscal 
arrangements with regard to equalization. I see in this bill the 
same type of thinking.
<P>
	Another aspect that is positive about this bill is that the 
formula has a ceiling and a floor to protect the provinces from 
major revenue reductions and to protect the federal government 
at the same time from open ended growth in payments. There is 
also the tax back problem that is dealt with here in this 
legislation. That is positive in itself.
<P>
	Still another aspect that is significant is that the payments are 
unconditional. When we transfer payments from the federal 
government to the provincial governments, and we expect it to 
bring about the most amount of equity possible, those dollars 
cannot have conditions on them. If they are targeted and have 
conditions on them, what we are going to do is build in another 
interface that will not allow for flexibility, priority setting and 
certainly the ability of the provinces to reflect the wishes and the 
needs of their respective electors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1057"> 1057 </A></B>
<P>
	On the other hand, as I look at this bill there are some 
concerns and questions I would raise. There are two questions. 
Can the federal government, under our present fiscal 
circumstances, afford to continue the current level of 
equalization transfers to the seven provinces? This House must 
answer that question.
<P>
	It is more incumbent upon us than previous houses because we 
are faced with an upcoming budget. We are faced with a deficit, 
most likely in this new budget, of at least $38 billion dollars as I 
understand. In the current budget we are faced with $44 billion 
to $46 billion of deficit. We have an accumulated deficit of $500 
billion and most likely if things continue as they are by the end 
of this 35th session the accumulated deficit could be $600 
billion.
<P>
	We must show respect for that. Our concern, as pointed out 
well by my colleague, is that we feel this is one of the areas 
where we should have reduced the cost of government and we 
called for a 10 per cent cut. That is a question that I raise in the 
House. The rest of the members should raise the very same one 
as we raise in the Reform Party.
<P>
	The second question I want to raise is equally significant. Is 
there equality in the federal transfer payments to provinces 
beyond Bill C-3 which we are facing today? Is there equity built 
into other programs beyond Bill C-3?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I would again like to remind hon. members of the objectives 
of Bill C-3. The first objective is to transfer federal funds to the 
seven provinces to raise their per capita income to a 
representative sample of $4,800 on a per capita basis. The 
second objective, and this is from the material given to us in our 
briefing, set out by the government, is to enable provincial 
governments to provide their residents reasonable, comparable 
levels of public services at reasonable levels of taxation.
<P>
	In other words, Bill C-3 is to create a level playing field 
across Canada. Every province has a somewhat equal 
opportunity to serve its electors with services that they need in 
terms of health, education and social services, supporting their 
highway structures, their infrastructures and so on.
<P>
	It is to build in that level playing field. That is what we are 
doing with Bill C-3. I want to raise a point to put the government 
on notice, that when it moves into new program areas it keeps 
that understanding in mind. It is very important.
<P>
	Government often forgets. I can give some personal 
experiences which I will in my remarks. We must think of the 
infrastructure program that we just announced to Canadians. We 
said in that infrastructure program that we would have a factor in 
there in terms of employment or unemployment that would 
allow some provinces to get more of the infrastructure dollars 
than others.
<P>
	If we create equalization by Bill C-3, why then do we build 
that into the infrastructure program if it is not already there? We 
could look at retraining programs. One will find the very same 
thing.
<P>
	I would like to look at a document that I received from the 
Privy Council just a few days ago. It is a good reference when I 
examine the question that I raised in this Parliament. This 
document is called ``Federal-Provincial Programs and 
Activities: A Descriptive Inventory 1992-93''. The Privy 
Council put it out as of November 1993. It is an up to date, 
current document that should be referenced.
<P>
	How does one recommend it to all the members of 
Parliament? It is a document that I used many times as a leader 
of the opposition in the Alberta legislature to raise the question 
with the government at that time. I asked if it were receiving a 
fair share as Albertans from various federal programs. If one 
looks through the document one will find the answer to that 
question.
<P>
	I would like to raise a couple of points. First there is the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. I was one of the 
ministers from Alberta who negotiated Alberta's share of the 
moneys available through that program for housing in Alberta.
<P>
	I remember sitting around the table and walking through those 
negotiations. I remember my attitude and it reflects on the 
question I raise here. My attitude at that time was that if some of 
the other provinces, the maritime provinces, Saskatchewan, or 
the Northwest Territories, required more funding to meet some 
of its social housing needs, I was prepared to be flexible, move 
on that and to give a portion of Alberta's moneys to them.
<P>
	In other words I was saying because Alberta should have <I>x</I> per 
cent or whatever it is, 10 per cent or 11 per cent of the federal 
funding relative to our population, I was willing to give on that. I 
saw that there may be a need out there that needed to be met. 
There were less fortunate in terms of revenue than we were in 
the province of Alberta. I was willing to give.
<P>
	As I look at this today relative to Bill C-3 and equalization, as 
a minister at that time I could have sat at the table and said 
equalization has occurred. We had a formula in place. Today we 
are putting through Bill C-3 hopefully to become legislation. 
We are going to put that in place.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps Alberta at that point in time should have received a 
percentage of the grant relative to its percentage of the Canadian 
population. Looking at the structure it does not quite work that 
way.
<P>
	For example under the RRAP Newfoundland received $12 per 
capita, Alberta received $2.10 per capita, and Ontario received 
$1.85 per capita. The question is: After equity, should there have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1058"> 1058 </A></B>
<P>
been a $10 differential  between Alberta and Newfoundland? 
Should the numbers have been skewed in that direction?
<P>
	A second example is under transportation looking through the 
report I mentioned a few moments ago. Even under 
transportation there is disparity. For instance as noted in this 
report New Brunswick received $131.3 million under a program 
negotiated between 1987 to 1996 to do highway and 
transportation work. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, 
Quebec and Newfoundland received millions of dollars to 
improve their highways. Yet when we look at Alberta, British 
Columbia and Ontario on the list there are no dollars for those 
respective programs.
<P>
	The question is: Did we create equity by the formula to begin 
with or not? If we did, should we be allocating special funding 
over and above? Should not all provinces and all residents of 
Canada be able to receive the same type of treatment if 
equalization is real and that we do not have to keep shoring it up 
by giving political funds or other kinds of funds at a later date?
<P>
	Another example cited in the document is that some provinces 
receive additional money for health and education. Special 
dollars are allocated. Around $1 billion is provided for what are 
called the seven less prosperous provinces, the same seven 
provinces that are receiving moneys through equalization.
<P>
	As legislators and as people who want to create fairness, we 
want fairness. When Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia say 
that the formula is fine and that they are receiving no benefits, 
they should raise the question: Are the benefits after that of 
other government programs allocated fairly across this nation? 
We should ask that question.
<P>
	Looking back at my own political experience provincially I 
raised this once in a while but not in the same context. I often 
look at provincial treasurers and those who negotiate at the table 
as to whether they ask the same question. If we created equality 
with Bill C-3, why are the other funds not allocated from the 
Government of Canada done equally for all Canadians no matter 
where they live?
<P>
	We should think about that in this assembly as we proceed to 
the budget in the third week of February and look at the new 
programs and raise the question: Are all Canadians no matter 
where they live going to receive equal treatment, have equal 
access? Will each province have some equality in the 
distribution of the funds of that budget? If that is so, then we 
have improved the circumstances and we have made a 
contribution.
<P>
	I am not always sure going back in history whether 
parliamentarians or governments look at it on that basis. It was 
often allocated for political reasons. Often there was this 
misconception that equalization had not occurred so some more 
would be added to some of the provinces that are called the have 
not provinces of Canada.
<P>
	With those remarks, we in the Reform Party in general support 
the concept of equalization. We are concerned about the dollar 
amount of $8 billion and that there was not some kind of 
reduction. Because of that we are not going to be voting for the 
bill. The other concern I have is the one I raised about continued 
equalization and fairness in other moneys that become available 
for us to distribute as parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of observations and a question. Maybe I can allude 
to the question and then go on to the observation.
<P>
	I appreciated the remarks of the previous speaker with respect 
to this matter and especially Bill C-3. I want him to elaborate a 
little with respect to his comments on programs outside of the 
equalization program.
<P>
	Perhaps I misunderstood him but the message I got was that 
the hon. member supported the notion of equalization within the 
ambit of what we call the equalization program. Then he began 
to raise questions about the notion of equalization as a principle 
as it pertains to other programs and he specifically mentioned a 
couple of programs. One in particular was the RRAP. If I recall 
correctly he pointed out that on a per capita basis Newfoundland 
was getting about $12, Alberta about $2, and Ontario even less.
<P>
	It makes me wonder if he is saying that equalization is fine 
insofar as the large equalization program is concerned, but when 
it comes to specific programs, RRAP for example, that we 
should not consider equalization at all, that we should just throw 
it out the window. Also, if we use population as a basis Alberta 
will get whatever its share is according to population and 
Ontario the same and Manitoba the same. That is what I am 
beginning to wonder.
<P>
	I do think that equalization as we understand it embodies the 
highest ideals of this country. It reflects our society, that being a 
caring and sharing one. It says we are one country. We are not 
two countries; we are one and everyone is going to be treated 
equally in so far as some of these basic programs are concerned.
<P>
	As I listened to the previous speaker from the Bloc a few 
minutes ago I thought that it must be embarrassing for a 
separatist in this House to be participating in this kind of a 
debate. Embarrassing. In fact to participate would suggest that 
the participants are almost shameless because when we talk 
about equalization we are talking about the benefits of Canada, 
the benefits of the citizenship of the country. That is what 
equalization is about: As Canadians they are treated by their 
federal government with a particular standard of respect. It does 
not matter where they live, in Newfoundland, Alberta, Quebec 
or wherever, they are going to be treated with respect and with a 
certain touch of equality. Imagine the kind of embarrassment 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1059"> 1059 </A></B>
<P>
those people must be feeling right now because they want to 
shove that all aside.
<P>
	I want to get back to the previous speaker from the Reform 
Party because I want a little more clarity. I think the member 
understood my question. Is he suggesting more or less 
disregarding equalization outside of this program called 
equalization?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> I want to make the statement I 
have made very clear to the hon. member who raises the 
question. The purpose of Bill C-3, and I read this verbatim out 
of notes from our briefing, ``is to enable provincial governments 
to provide their residents reasonably comparable levels of 
public service at reasonable levels of taxation''.
<P>
	In other words Bill C-3 creates a level playing field across 
Canada. This bill provides that we will bring the per capita 
payment up to the standard of $4,800. Now that does not bring it 
up to 100 per cent but it brings it from 85 per cent to 93 per cent 
in terms of comparability. A group of factors have been taken 
into consideration to bring about this standard and to do the best 
in comparability.
<P>
	If we have equalized the opportunity for Canadians in 
whatever community they live, whether it is Quebec, 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia or Alberta or wherever it is, we 
have equalized it by Bill C-3. That is the starting point. Any 
programs allocated after that should not require an equalization 
consideration.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	For example, housing through RRAP and if everything is 
equal, if it is $10 per capita in Newfoundland, then it should be 
$10 per capita in Alberta and $10 per capita in British Columbia 
or Saskatchewan or Quebec so that we should not have to 
consider it as much. However as we observe the distribution of 
federal funds in a variety of programs, and we even note it in the 
infrastructure program, we built a factor into that program that 
said it was still not quite equal in some of the provinces and that 
we had to consider the unemployment factor so those provinces 
receive more per capita.
<P>
	That is really saying that our equity considerations were not 
working and that we still have to work on them and shore them 
up. I am saying let us be careful so we do not overdo that in the 
programs we design from this period of time on and in the 
programs which will be introduced in the budget which is 
coming up in February 1994 as well.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.40 p.m. I do

like to congratulate Mr. Luc Plamondon and all those who made 
possible the remarkable success of <I>Starmania</I>, the rock musical.
<P>
	At the ninth Victoires de la Musique award ceremony 
yesterday in Paris, the third Paris version of <I>Starmania</I> received 
the Victoire award for the best musical of the year. Most 
performers in that rock musical are Quebecers. Therefore, I 
think it would be appropriate to thank them most sincerely, in 
everybody's name, for the honour they bring us and for their 
contribution to the promotion of French language song.
<P>
	This recognition by the large French public is reason enough 
to be proud of our artists and to increase our support of all 
cultural industries which contribute to Quebec's uniqueness.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
number of journalists have recently chronicled the financial 
boondoggle associated with the new Canadian embassy in 
Beijing, China.
<P>
	From the lease of 1.3 hectares of prime swamp land in 1978 to 
the purchase of imported Utah grass and Canadian maple trees at 
a cost of $5 million in more recent times, Canadian taxpayers 
have seen this project go from $18 million to $79 million.
<P>
	Now we all know the current government was not responsible 
for this spending nor should we believe it condones it. However 
Canadian taxpayers, like Roger Napier on Thetis Island in my 
constituency, would like some assurance that this type of 
chaotic spending will not occur again.
<P>
	My constituents simply ask that the current government learn 
from the mistakes of past governments to prevent a repeat 
performance which we surely cannot afford.

	The inherent right to self-government is a unique and special 
relationship between Canada's First Nations and the crown. The 
formal acknowledgement of self-government is a historic 
occasion even though it is just an acknowledgement of this right

<P>
	In acknowledging the inherent right to self-government the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
announced to move to implement self-government.

expressed to me by many of my constituents.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Many people in Nipissing feel it would be unfair for this 
government to lower the maximum contribution which 
individuals may place in registered retirement savings plans. 
Many of these people are self-employed with no access to 
corporate pension plans, making RRSPs their primary 
retirement investment mechanism.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would like to encourage the finance minister to 
extend the RRSP home buyers plan which will expire this 
month. Approximately 200,000 homes across Canada have been 
purchased through this plan, contributing of course millions of 
dollars to local economies.
<P>

his budget, but it is my hope that he considers some of the 
suggestions which have been brought forward today when doing 
so.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
several of my constituents have brought to my attention their 
concerns that there is a grave problem with the taxation of child 
support payments.
<P>
	Child support is paid for the benefit of the children, not the 
custodial parent. According to statistics, 60 per cent of single 
parent families live below the poverty line. Child support does 
not cover the cost of raising a child. However, for income tax 
purposes child support is considered part of the income of the 
custodial parent as opposed to the income of the contributing 
parent.
<P>
	Therefore, I call upon the ministers of finance and national 
revenue to review this problem, to find a solution that will create 
greater equity between the custodial and contributing parents.

small businesses are central to the Liberal strategy for economic 
revitalization. I commend the Minister of National Revenue for 
the work his department has done with Bill C-2. Once enacted 
this initiative will go far to reduce the excess paper burden on 
small business owners.
<P>
	In keeping with our concern for small businesses, I would 
make one further recommendation for the consideration of 
members of this House on another small business concern.
<P>
	Under the last government, remittance of payroll deductions 
for small and medium sized businesses were increased from 
once a month to twice a month. The result of this change in the 
process of payroll deductions has been to place an extra and 
unnecessary burden of time and paperwork on an already 
overburdened small business sector.
<P>
	I am confident that with initiatives like Bill C-2 and a review 
of the frequency of payroll remittance we will be able to free 
small and medium sized business owners from the burden of 
paperwork which will allow them to spend more time doing 
what they do best, running their businesses.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On January 20 last, the Prime Minister said: ``If both levels of 
government cannot co-operate, if one acts and the other does 
not, then we will not get the hoped-for results''.
<P>
	Fifteen days later, does the Prime Minister still agree with 
what he said and can he tell us whether he believes his plan to 
roll back cigarette taxes to combat smuggling could prove 
ineffective given that no other provincial government, aside 
from Quebec, has agreed to come on board?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
certain provincial governments have not yet reacted. They are 
studying the proposal which is being extended equally to all 
provinces.

<B><A NAME="1063"> 1063 </A></B>
<P>
	In my opinion, the Government of Quebec is facing a much 
more serious situation, which explains why it has decided to 
accept the offer we made very seriously. I am pleased that it did 
so.
<P>
	As for the other provincial governments, we will see what 
they will do. We however have not backed away from our 
responsibilities. We began discussions with the provinces, and 
specifically with Ontario in December. Eventually they will 
have to make a decision and that is what we have done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of 
some vigorous opposition from Ontario members within his own 
caucus, the Prime Minister has decided to move on this plan 
anyway and to roll back cigarette taxes. Is he not concerned that 
Ontario's refusal to come on board with his plan could turn that 
province into the next centre of smuggling in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as Prime Minister of Canada I took my responsibilities. If others 
do not want to act that is their responsibility.

quote: ``Along with these resources are new strategies to crack 
down on organized smuggling groups and to increase 
surveillance of these groups''.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell us whether other strategies will 
include providing the RCMP with new equipment or action 
plans appropriate to this particular situation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have told the RCMP officers we would support them in this 
difficult endeavour. We intend to do what has to be done to help 
them. As far as day to day strategy is concerned, that is the 
RCMP's responsibility, and in situations like this, it is no use

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister. As the 
RCMP itself admits, cigarette seizures by police forces last year 
amounted to only 1 per cent of all the contraband. It is a real 
sieve! Nevertheless, the government repeated again today in this 
House that it intends to enforce the law throughout Canadian 
territory.
<P>
	Can we take the government seriously today when it promises 
to enforce the law throughout Canada, without exception, while 
smuggling is going on with the knowledge and in full view of the 
police authorities, who have not made any move to stop the 
smugglers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that the figures given by the Solicitor General in this 
House in recent days prove that a tremendous amount has been 
seized and that there will be much more now that we have given 
them everything they need to do so, and we have also helped the 
personnel of the Department of National Revenue do a better 
job. Given the size of the problem, they needed reinforcements 
and the government has given both the RCMP and the 
Department of National Revenue the necessary reinforcements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to ask the Prime Minister a supplementary 
question.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister make the commitment that the 
federal government will end the activities of some 500 
smugglers in the Akwesasne region, identified yesterday by his 
colleague from Sault Ste. Marie, the Minister of Indian Affairs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that I said very clearly that the law will apply everywhere 
in Canada. The notion of some people trying to make this just a 
problem of the natives of Canada is not correct. It is not true at 
all. There are problems across the nation. What the member is 
trying to do is create the impression that the problem is a native 
problem when, as I said today in the House, there are two million 
people in Canada who are buying illegal cigarettes. So there are 
two million people involved. That does not mean it is just an 
Indian problem. It is very unfair to try to create that impression.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is also for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister 
announced today the government's action plan on smuggling but 
the plan was not accompanied by a detailed breakdown of the 
costs of this program to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us what the net cost of this 
program will be on an annual basis and is he willing to table in 
the House the detailed cost breakdown of this program?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there will be a budget in a couple of weeks and all the 
expenditures of the government will be listed on the balance 
sheet for the whole nation. This is a problem we are tackling at 
the moment. I said this morning that it will cost some money. 
However if we do not act now it will cost a lot more in the 
medium term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1064"> 1064 </A></B>
<P>
	We think that over a period of one year or a year and a half not 
only will this program be effective but we will gain more 
revenues than we have right now if we are successful and we 
intend to be successful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary for the Prime Minister on the revenue 
side.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that the proposed tax cuts in 
connection with the action plan on smuggling will reduce 
federal revenues in the fiscal year 1994-95 by approximately 
$300 million. This figure is obviously based on certain 
assumptions about provincial participation.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell the House what the total loss in 
federal and provincial tax revenue would be if all provinces 
participated in the plan to the same extent as Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, from the federal government's point of 
view, the fact is that the more provinces that participate, the 
greater the legal sales that will occur and therefore the less the 
hit on the federal government.
<P>
	The numbers that we have, and these are really based on an 
average, show that in the first year, as the Prime Minister has 
said, there would be a $300 million hit coupled with an 
approximately $150 million inventory rebate. That will very 
quickly decline to $25 million in the second year. In fact by the 
third year the nation's fisc begins to show a substantial 
improvement, rising to $150 million to $275 million.
<P>
	In addition to the costs that I outlined at the beginning, it 
would appear that there would be approximately $150 million to 
$160 million of enforcement costs arising out of RCMP, 
customs, justice and health.
<P>
	That does not lead to very substantial government revenues 
that are going to occur immediately as a result of the tax 
measures that the Prime Minister announced in his speech this 
morning relative to the companies themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for that answer. I have a further 
supplementary for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's announcement today was not quite clear 
on all of the additional costs that will be incurred by the RCMP, 
the customs branch, the ministry of health, the justice 
department and so on to implement the various aspects of the 
government's action plan on smuggling.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell the House what the total 
implementation costs will be on an annual basis and can he table 
a detailed breakdown of that cost?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
would be about $150 million to enforce that, but we have to keep 
in mind that if we are very successful we will gain more 
revenues from stopping the smuggling of liquor, which is not 
mentioned at this time. A lot of Canadian citizens who are 
making money under the table now will have to pay income 
taxes. There will be an offset that cannot be measured with a 
spoon. We have to see what exactly will be the effect of the 
program.
<P>
	However, when the people of Canada respect the law and pay 
all of their taxes we will be in a very positive position.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the acting minister of health.
<P>
	It is known that any reduction in the price of cigarettes will 
lead to increased consumption, especially among the youth. In 
fact it is predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in price will result 
in an 8 per cent in the overall consumption, especially a 15 per 
cent increase among adolescents and youth.
<P>
	It is also estimated that these cuts that are proposed today will 
result in 800,000 new smokers of which a quarter of a million 
will be the youth.
<P>
	Is it the official position of the ministry of health to support a 
bill that jeopardizes the health of Canadians, especially the 
youth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously it is the position 
of the Government of Canada to help stop young people from 
smoking.
<P>
	Smoking is a killer. It is a killer of young people and it is a 
killer of all Canadians.
<P>
	Right now there are two million Canadians smoking 
smuggled cigarettes. To extrapolate the statistics of the Cancer 
Society, between 600,000 and one million of those Canadians 
smoking smuggled cigarettes can expect to die from cancer.
<P>
	It is our intention to cut down on smoking by making sure that 
every effort is taken including the abolition of kiddie packs, 
including raising the age of smokers, including charging fines of 
up to $50,000 for retail outlets that sell to minors.
<P>
	We have an attack and a plan that is going to safeguard the 
health of Canadians, not a plan that will hide its head in the sand 
by doing nothing when two million Canadians right now are 
smoking smuggled cigarettes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	The minister should know that 40,000 Canadians die each 
year of smoking related illnesses and that billions of dollars are 
already spent every year on health care problems related to 
smoking.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister have any idea of how much 
this is going to cost our already overburdened health care 
system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada 
recognizes the fact that almost 40,000 Canadians die every year 
from smoking.
<P>
	The Government of Canada also recognizes the fact that for 
the first time last year cigarette smoking in Canada increased as 
opposed to decreased.
<P>
	The Government of Canada also recognizes the unfortunate 
fact that young women in particular have continued to smoke 
despite the general decline in smoking of the population. That is 
why the Government of Canada is introducing a four-pronged 
strategy to make sure that we have a strategy that encourages 
every single Canadian to stop smoking by ensuring that the base 
price level for cigarettes is at a level that is out of reach of young 
Canadians and hopefully very soon out of the wish of most 
Canadians.

are the provisions concerning the reserves which the Prime

has control over the situation on the reserves.
<P>
	His request for an amendment to the Indian Act which would 
recognize Indian self-government is fundamental but has not 
been answered yet.

<P>
	The CBC recently issued a $380 million bond to finance the

$4 million a year for the next 30 years because the bond is being 
issued at a rate higher than a regular government bond would be. 
This $120 million is excess interest costs.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister declared on many occasions, and said it again today in 
the House, The law applies to everybody and everywhere. 
Everyone agrees, as mentioned by the Mohawk leader in 
Akwesasne, that one of the major problems faced by the three 
reserves is the unrestricted circulation of a high number of 
firearms. The presence of such firearms has contributed to the 
creation of a climate of terror; in the last seven years, 70 of the 
7,000 people living in the Akwesasne reserve have been killed; 
the circumstances of their death remain a mystery.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is as follows: Will he 
recognize that one of the major problems in the Akwesasne, 
Kanesatake and Kanawake reserves stems mainly from the 
proliferation of firearms in the hands of a few individuals 
allowed to terrorize the people?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is the reason why we have asked the RCMP to do its job on 
the reserves just as anywhere else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, to put an 
end to this slaughter, what kind of concrete measures does the 
Prime Minister intend to take to enforce the provisions of the 
Criminal Code regarding the control of firearms, more precisely 
on these reserves?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
they consistently give the impression that the problem of 
contraband cigarettes is partly or completely located on Indian 
reserves; which is not true.
<P>
	I said earlier that the law will apply on Indian reserves as 
anywhere else, but I find totally deplorable that this constant 
line of questioning involving natives gives the impression that 
they are to be blamed for everything happening in this country.

consumption of alcohol in these messes.

	Can the Solicitor General inform the House what measures 
the RCMP will take with respect to the consumption of alcohol 
in these RCMP messes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the RCMP has completed a comprehensive review of its mess 
structure. A new national constitution governing the activities 
of messes will be implemented. One result will be that the 
serving of alcoholic beverages will no longer be available in 
RCMP messes without the explicit approval of the commanding 
officer and this approval will be governed by the definitions of 
special events described in the national mess constitution. I 
hope this will give reassurance to people in Prince Edward

eight crown corporations are exempt from the provisions of the

<P>

<B><A NAME="1067"> 1067 </A></B>

Canada Council, the National Film Board, the National Arts 
Centre Corporation among others.
<P>
	At a time when Canadians are demanding that governments 
spend their tax dollars wisely, can the minister explain why 
these crown corporations are exempt from part X of the 
Financial Administration Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the exemptions are perfectly in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. They 
are principles that have been followed by the government for 
quite some time and they in no way imply that proper 
supervision of crown corporations is not taking place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> A 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister act on 
the Auditor General's recommendation to make these crown 
corporations responsible under part X of the act so they are 
properly accountable to this House and therefore to the people of 
Canada and subject to examination by the Auditor General?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

they are responsible to their boards first and ultimately, as in all

and therefore to the House.

question is directed to the Prime Minister. All stakeholders 
agree on the need for an anti-smoking campaign to make young 
people aware of the harmful effects of smoking, and the 
government's action plan makes provision for such a campaign.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that no anti-smoking 
campaign can be conducted without the co-operation of the 
provinces? Can he give us the assurance that the provinces will 
follow his lead with the tax reduction or, failing that, at least 
support the health component of his action plan?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that the provinces will examine the proposals we have put 
forward today and I am sure that they will be prepared to 
cooperate and contribute to the success of our campaign to 
discourage young Canadians in particular from using tobacco 
products. We have said that we were embarking upon a

we have tabled today contains specific measures with regard to

tobacco products to young people under 18 years of age will be 
fined up to $50,000. We will also take action to ban the sale of 
so-called ``kiddie packs'' to young buyers. And we have other 
specific measures to combat smoking among the young. This is 
all part of the health component of our plan, to prevent smoking 
from causing more harm to our young people.

	The Prime Minister will recall the letter he wrote to the people 
of Cornwallis, and in particular Annapolis and Digby counties in 
which he strongly supported this peacekeeping training centre 
for both Canadian and non-Canadian troops.

	When will the government act to meet its commitment to the 
people of Annapolis and Digby counties to establish a Canadian 
forces peacekeeping training centre in Cornwallis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, we are reviewing all of the facilities 
that National Defence has and every aspect of the operations 
budget of the Department of National Defence in conformity 
with the promises outlined in the red book.
<P>
	In the red book we talked about the establishment of 
peacekeeping centres, and that is actively under consideration. 
Canada takes second place to none in the world in the 
development of peacekeeping. We shall keep this in mind when 
we announce the changes to defence policy later this year and 
certainly with respect to expenditures over the next 60 days.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, through 
the impetus given by the big American brewers, the United 
States are now trying to force the Canadian provinces to widely 
open their market to these brewers, despite the beer agreement 
that was signed by the two countries in August 1993. The 
Americans are questioning the imposition by the Quebec 
government of a minimum price on any beer sold in Quebec, 
when British  Columbia and Ontario have already imposed such 
floor prices.
<P>

<P>
	My question is for the Minister for International Trade. Could 
the minister tell us whether he supports the position taken by the 
Quebec government to impose a minimum price on beer sold on 
its territory with a view to reduce alcohol consumption by 20 per 
cent by the year 2000?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in the memorandum of 
understanding between Canada and the United States on beer 
which prevents a GATT-consistent minimal price practice. It is 
that policy that we have supported in three cases, British 
Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

believe that the House will agree now to start debating Bill C-10 
at second reading and then refer it to committee of the whole, 
before third and final reading, thus completing all the necessary 
stages before adjournment tonight. I believe you will find 
unanimous consent to proceed through all three stages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
agreeing to that request, I would like to point out that we had to 
wait until the very last minute to receive the request just made 
by the hon. member to proceed with this bill.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	We are going to agree because of the interest we have in 
Western agriculture and because it is necessary to pass that 
legislation, but we object to being informed so late of a measure 
which disrupts the work schedule and upsets the planning of 
members who were to take part in the debate. However, we 
accept willingly on behalf of western farmers who really need 
our help.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> I rise on the same point, Mr. 
Speaker. My understanding is that my hon. friend is asking for 
unanimous consent to consider all stages this afternoon. 
Considering the immense importance of this legislation, it 
would be more appropriate to take it one step at a time.
<P>
	At the moment, I would like to say that on behalf of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party, we would certainly 
give unanimous consent to proceed to second reading debate and 
then we will see how things transpire for the rest of the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could we call for a vote on that on that matter to see if 
there is support in the House for that position?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Could I seek from you, Mr. Speaker and the Chair, 
clarification as to just what it is you are seeking unanimous 
consent for? Is it to proceed through all stages of the bill at the 
moment or is it just simply to proceed to second reading of the 
bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I can assist in the 
circumstances. I have heard the representations of the hon. 
member for Kamloops. I recognize that he may not wish to 
proceed with all stages today. He will want to see what happens.
<P>
	I appreciate the comments of the hon. member for Roberval 
very much. I wonder if it would be possible to proceed with 
second reading now by unanimous consent with the motion to 
read that the bill be referred to a committee of the whole so that 
on conclusion of second reading the bill would be referred to a 
committee of the whole. If we are able to complete that on a 
timely basis we will seek unanimous consent to proceed to third 
reading. At least we can do second reading and committee stage 
today, the aim being that we would complete all stages by six 
o'clock if possible and see how the House progresses in the 
afternoon.
<P>
	The unanimous consent that I would ask for now is that the 
bill be called for second reading debate and reference to a 
committee of the whole at the conclusion of that debate.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent under these 
conditions?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Accordingly, the bill stands referred to 
committee of the whole. Pursuant to Standing Order 100, I do 
now leave the chair for the House to go into committee of the

committee of the whole right now when we have second reading 
of the bill now?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I asked permission of the House. I did not see 
any members standing so I presumed that you had instructed me 
to go ahead with the second point. We can revert if there is 
unanimous agreement. Does the House wish to revert to second 
reading?

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Does the House wish to revert to the 
second reading of the bill? Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the 
same point of order. I would like to know whether reverting to 
second reading means that all members who wish to speak will 
be able to do so or whether this is just to allow the member who 
so requested to make his speech, and we then go into committee 
of the whole.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is to give any other members who wish to 
speak an opportunity to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the government 
had made its intentions clear, there would be less confusion. If I 
understood correctly, consent was given for proceeding with 
second reading, with speeches from all sides of the House, then 
into committee of the whole followed by third reading, so that 
we would finish this evening at about 6 p.m. That was our 
understanding, but this does not seem to be quite clear, even on 
the government side. Could they decide one way or another? 
Then we will give our consent.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> One moment please. Could the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands explain exactly what he intends to 
do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggested to the House, and I 
thought we had agreed, that the motion for second reading we 
would propose to the House would be for second reading and 
referral to committee of the whole instead of to a Standing 
Committee of the House. That is all. There will be a debate on 
second reading: first the minister, then the opposition, the 
Reform Party, and perhaps a few other members, and after the 
motion for second reading is passed, the bill would be referred 
to a committee of the whole, according to the motion. That is  
all. And perhaps afterwards we can have unanimous consent for 
other business, but not now.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is that clearer now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is another 
point I would like to make. We understand the procedure, but 
there was a motion before the House to the effect that voting on 
Bill C-3 would take place this evening. However the 
proceedings on this bill have been suspended. Would it be 
possible by some procedure of the House to continue the 
proceedings tomorrow on Bill C-3, contrary to the initial order 
of the House? If there had not been any changes, we would have 
finished this afternoon, but now, of course, that is not the case.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> One moment. It would be possible if we had 
unanimous consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will re-read the motion. Is there unanimous consent to the 
motion by Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre), seconded by 
Mr. MacLaren, that Bill C-10 an act to provide for the 
maintenance of west coast ports operations be now read a second 
time and, by unanimous consent, referred to a committee of the 
whole?
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt this motion? We are 
going to have debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With 
respect you asked if there was unanimous consent to do that and 
it was granted. Therefore there is no need for the motion at this 
point. It is just a question of allowing the debate to take place. 
We did not rise in our place nor did others because normally the 
minister rises in his place to give the first speech on second 
reading. That is what we were waiting for when you stood up to 
go into committee of the whole.
<P>
	We agreed to go into second reading and then have committee 
of the whole. That is what unanimous consent was given to and 
now we wait upon the minister to justify the bill before us.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Understood and so ordered then. There 
is unanimous agreement for having second reading. We are 
going to go to debate and then we are going to come back to the 
committee of the whole. Compris?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the West Coast Ports Operations Act. It is 
legislation aimed at bringing about the resumption of longshore 
operations in the west coast ports. I should say in introducing 
this bill that I feel a sense of real regret and some frustration in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1073"> 1073 </A></B>
<P>
having to once again intervene in the collective bargaining 
process.
<P>
	I am certain that hon. members will comprehend why the 
decision is necessary once I lay out in very brief fashion the 
details of the dispute and the extensive efforts that went into 
trying to resolve it.
<P>
	The dispute which gave rise to the introduction of this 
legislation involves the British Columbia Maritime Employers 
Association which represents ship owners, stevedoring firms 
and agents, the longshore industry on the west coast of Canada, 
and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's 
Union, involving some 2,300 full time workers and about 1,300 
casual workers. They were covered by a collective agreement 
which expired December 31, 1992.
<P>
	During that period we offered very extensive conciliation 
services to the parties and progress was made in a number of 
areas, but there were still some outstanding areas, particularly 
those relating to wage differentials and some degree of security.
<P>
	The parties were advised of a decision I took on January 19 
not to provide further conciliation procedure and to let the 
parties resume honest bargaining between themselves. I did so 
because the issues were not complex in nature. The two sides 
should have been able to achieve a complete resolution of the 
contract dispute. However in direct negotiations that were held 
on January 22 and January 26 the parties failed to resolve their 
differences.
<P>
	Members of the longshoremen's union commenced legal 
strike activity at the port of Chemainus on Vancouver Island on 
January 27. The following day the employer indicated it would 
not request the union to supply labour at any of the west coast 
ports as of 8 a.m. on January 29. In response the union initiated 
strike action at other B.C. ports during the afternoon of January 
28. On January 29 all longshoring operations ceased.
<P>
	Indications from the parties at the time indicated that because 
there was not much dividing them, there could be an early 
resolution of the dispute. We believe there was a desire to settle 
this on an amicable basis.
<P>
	I am fully aware, and I think all members are, of the enormous 
economic importance the Vancouver west coast ports carry. It is 
the major outlet of foreign export markets for this country. Its 
cessation as an active outlet has already brought a number of 
major impacts to the Canadian economy, in particular the grain 
economy of western Canada.
<P>
	Some 25 grain ships are in west coast ports awaiting loading 
and a further 38 ships are due to arrive over the next two weeks. 
The major escalation in requirements to have our exports moved 
was one of the reasons for bringing in this legislation.
<P>
	The scheduled loadings represent approximately 2.1 million 
tonnes of grain or close to $500 million in exports. In addition at 
least five container ships containing 5,000 containers have been 
diverted from the port of Vancouver. Other commodities such as 
lumber, potash, sugar and minerals have also been affected by 
the work stoppage and the diversion of other commodities to 
other ports.
<P>
	The cessation of longshoring activity has had a chain reaction 
among many other workers. More than 170 grain handlers have 
been laid off, 200 rail employees and some 190 federal grain 
inspectors have been notified of lay-off status. Firms such as 
B.C. Sugar Refinery and Cominco have indicated they will be 
facing reduced operations or lay-offs in the very near future.
<P>
	Given the impact which these early hours or days of the strike 
affected, we immediately appointed a mediator on February 1 to 
provide the parties with a further opportunity to deliver on their 
commitment to resolve the dispute. Mediation talks began on 
February 2 and carried on till the following morning. Talks 
resumed on the afternoon of February 3. Again, despite these 
extensive efforts the parties remained in a dispute on the issue of 
wages and the talks adjourned.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	As one who strongly believes in collective bargaining, 
including the rights and responsibilities it places on the parties, 
I was reluctant to allow the two parties to abdicate their 
responsibilities to the Canadian public.
<P>
	On February 4 I requested again that the parties return to the 
negotiating table with the assistance of the mediator, as well as 
the director general of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have told the parties involved how disappointed I was that 
they had been unable to reach an agreement to date. I also 
indicated that I expected that they do their utmost to settle their 
differences without further delay so that grains and other 
Canadian goods might again be shipped abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mediation talks resumed in Vancouver on the afternoon of 
February 6. Unfortunately, even though we had applied both 
mediation and persuasive techniques, I must again report that 
the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association and the 
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union 
failed to arrive at a settlement of their contract dispute.
<P>
	As a result the legislation brought in today calls for 
immediate resumption of longshoring operations on Canada's 
west coast on the coming into force of the act, which I hope will 
be soon.
<P>
	It provides for a mechanism of settlement of the remaining 
issues in dispute through the process of final offer selection. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1074"> 1074 </A></B>
<P>
passage of the bill by hon. members will see import and export 
cargo moving to west coast  ports and the contract dispute 
between the two parties referred to an arbitrator for the purposes 
of selecting the final offer of one of the parties on the items 
remaining in the dispute.
<P>
	I have heard some members say we should begin to take action 
immediately to look at declaring grain handling and other 
aspects of our west coast port economy to be essential services. I 
resist these measures. I still believe strongly that the collective 
bargaining process provides the best protection of rights and 
obligations for both sides to end a dispute.
<P>
	We have seen in this particular game that both sides played a 
very dangerous game of poker with very high stakes, putting in 
real risk not just their own livelihood but also the economic 
health of Canada.
<P>
	The reputation of Canada as a reliable shipping partner has 
been put in some jeopardy and ongoing efforts by the port of 
Vancouver to attract new shipping lines in the face of stiff 
competition from U.S. ports has also been put at risk.
<P>
	I would say, however, it is appropriate that we begin to look in 
a more broad and open way at some of the questions of industrial 
relations in Canada at the present time. It is important to 
recognize that as we try to re-gear our economy and come to 
grips with a number of new economic and competitive 
situations, the vital issue of labour relations is part of that 
examination. As I indicated in a speech to the House a week or 
so ago we have already taken actions in conjunction with the 
Canadian Labour Congress and others to set up a special group 
to look at the issue of work and its distribution.
<P>
	We should begin to take a look, perhaps through House 
committees, at other aspects of our labour relations, to bring 
them into line with present day realities, especially when we 
look at many of the challenges facing the economy to ensure that 
we may provide better ways for parties in disputes to come 
together.
<P>
	The parties involved in the west coast dispute failed to 
recognize the benefits of the various approaches that were 
offered to them and consequently have left the government with 
no recourse but to step in and bring about a resumption of 
longshoring activities. While the process of arbitration is not a 
new concept in resolving contract disputes, the concept of final 
offer selection has not previously been utilized in conjunction 
with federal legislation to settle strikes.
<P>
	The bill before hon. members today provides the parties with 
seven days from the coming into force of the act to provide the 
minister with the name of a person who is mutually acceptable to 
each side to serve as an arbitrator for the final offer selection 
process. Failing agreements by the parties the bill provides for 
the minister to appoint a person who he or she considers to be an 
appropriate arbitrator.
<P>
	The proposed legislation provides for the arbitrator, within 
time limits which he or she establishes, to receive from the 
parties a list of those issues agreed upon, a list of those matters 
remaining in dispute, and the final offer in respect of those 
issues in dispute. The list of issues agreed on and the final offer 
on the remaining issues are to be submitted in contractual 
language.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The arbitrator within 90 days of being appointed shall 
determine the matters on which the employers association and 
the union were in agreement, determine the matters which were 
in dispute and select a final offer of one of the parties on all of 
the issues in dispute. The arbitrator is required to issue an award 
to the parties in the form of a new collective agreement which 
will be binding on the parties until December 31, 1995.
<P>
	The legislation provides enforcement procedures for any 
instance of non-compliance with the provisions contained 
therein. All the costs incurred by the crown relating to the 
appointment of the arbitrator and the carrying out his or her 
duties is recoverable on an equal basis from both parties.
<P>
	Members may ask, why a final offer selection in this 
particular case? For the benefit of those members who are not 
familiar with the bargaining relationship, I would point out that 
these two parties, the BCMEA and the ILWU are no strangers to 
the introduction of legislation to terminate work stoppages and 
provide for the resolution of contract disputes. Although the last 
two rounds of bargaining have resulted in settlements without 
work stoppages, the parties have exhibited a sad record of labour 
relations in the past and have been subject to special legislation 
in Parliament on four previous occasions, 1972, 1975, 1982 and 
1986.
<P>
	In addition to relying on government to relieve them of their 
collective responsibility to settle their differences, the parties 
have become far too comfortable with the standard third party 
arbitration features of past legislation for the resolution of 
remaining issues in dispute.
<P>
	The provision of final offer selection procedures in this 
legislation puts the onus back on the parties and once again 
requires them to make clear, economic, rational decisions on 
behalf of their members, their companies and the public interest 
at large. It does not take away the responsibility of coming to 
decisions themselves which so often in the past they have 
declined to do. They will have to make judgments about what 
they think is a proper settlement and what would be a proper 
accommodation.
<P>
	To do otherwise in my opinion would curtail the 
responsibility and onus of each of the parties in this dispute. It 
would also provide a message to other parties who are now 
beginning to engage in collective bargaining or who have 
already reached strike deadlines that this government wants to 
have both parties 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1075"> 1075 </A></B>
<P>
in any dispute, in any port, in any transportation system or 
anything under  federal jurisdiction, to rely on their own best 
efforts to resolve their differences and come to some conclusion. 
We will not provide a constant crutch for them to find an easy 
way out of their responsibilities which under our labour 
relations laws they have been expected to assume.
<P>
	To summarize, the BCMEA and the ILWU have shown an 
inability to resolve the obstacles standing in the way of 
settlement and the resumption of longshoring operations. The 
legislation will restore port operations on the west coast, get the 
ships and export and import cargoes moving and at the same 
time allow the two sides to come back and assume responsibility 
and arrive at a resolution.
<P>
	As I indicated at the outset of my remarks, the introduction of 
legislation of this kind is not a pleasant task for a minister 
responsible for labour matters in this government. However, as 
the minister I have a duty to intervene when the parties fail to 
make the system work and in so doing inflict considerable harm 
on those not directly involved in the dispute.
<P>
	There had been reason to hope that labour and management at 
the port of Vancouver had moved away from the dismal patterns 
of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s when Parliament was 
forced to provide for resolution of their disputes on a continual 
basis. The negotiation of settlements in the last two rounds gave 
some reason to believe that the pattern had changed and that the 
parties were entering a new era of constructive labour relations. 
Sadly once again it shows that old habits die hard. Therefore, we 
hope the legislation will provide a strong reminder, a wake up 
call if you like, that we want a new regime and a new set of 
labour relations in this country.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	My wish, and one which I am sure is shared by members of the 
House, is that the current difficulties do not represent a 
reversion to previous form. The parties will endeavour to find 
better ways of resolving their differences. They owe it to 
themselves, the competitive future of the west coast ports, and 
to the wider community of the country that relies on this vital 
gateway for world commerce.
<P>
	In sending forth this legislation I want to express my 
appreciation to members on both sides who have given their 
unanimous consent that this legislation can proceed with 
dispatch and with the kind of urgency that many people in the 
economy would respect.
<P>
	I recognize that there will be questions and we will certainly 
be prepared to entertain them once we get into committee of the 
whole. I would only add to my appreciation my request that 
members do consider strongly that once they have had the 
opportunity to express themselves in second reading that we 
move on to consideration in committee of the whole and 
hopefully toward third reading.
<P>
	I understand that our colleagues in the other place are quite 
prepared to deal with the legislation this evening so it can go 
into effect and we can then take the final step. I do so with the 
strong invitation and willingness to sit down with members 
opposite to talk about how we might at a future date, not too far 
in the future but reasonably so, come to grips with how we could 
have a broader examination of labour relations and use their 
wisdom and judgment of the past on how we might proceed with 
a different kind of regime and proposals and policies that might 
help avoid situations that we now face with this legislation.
<P>
	With that, I urge all hon. members to provide for prompt 
passage of this legislation to allow for the immediate 
resumption of activities in the ports.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
a very sad moment when Parliament, any parliament for that 
matter, must legislate an end to a labour dispute. Having worked 
for many years in this field as a unionist and later as a teacher, I 
known that back to work legislation means failure, not only for 
the parties involved, and perhaps more so for one side than for 
the other, but also for the labour relations process.
<P>
	I would just like to say that this dispute signals a singular 
failure. It is difficult to understand why with so little separating 
the parties, they were unable to settle their dispute within the 
time allowed. I realize the minister was feeling some pressure, 
but with all due respect, perhaps the announcement of pending 
legislation did not speed up the settlement process. I say perhaps 
it did not, since I am familiar with the labour relations 
environment.
<P>
	May I remind you, Mr. Minister, that although this group of 
employers and these unions have had trouble getting going 
many times and have had some major disputes settled by special 
legislation, namely on four occasions, as you pointed out, in all 
fairness to the parties, I would also-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I would 
simply like to remind all members of the House to direct their 
comments to the Chair and not to speak directly to a minister or 
to other members.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding the minister's 
comments to the effect that the two parties had a lengthy history 
of confrontation which could only be settled with legislation, in 
defence of the parties, one has to say that the last two 
agreements were reached by mutual consent. No doubt this is the 
reason why legislation was not introduced early on. To my 
understanding, all issues have been settled, except for the 
question of salaries. The last attempt at mediation brought the 
parties closer together than was reported in the newspapers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1076"> 1076 </A></B>
<P>
where mention was made of a gap of 25 cents. Today I believe 
the spread is 10 cents.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Yes, under these conditions, it is a failure. It is a failure 
because, as far as I could tell from a great distance, they had 
made efforts. I talked to the union side. Since the law was 
announced hastily, I did not have time to talk to management, 
but I understood that an effort had been made, perhaps on both 
sides, but at least on the union side, to change the relationship, 
as shown by the last two settlements which were achieved 
without a strike.
<P>
	After this brief reminder, I would also like to say-and for me 
this is a major point that the minister should consider when I 
move an amendment-that the union several times, and even 
when the first strike in a port began, as far as I know, on January 
27, the union always said that it was ready to help ship grain. 
This absolutely must be said because I think that what happens 
to the grain is the most important and most urgent. It is a busy 
period when the equipment cannot be used for storage; the 
system must operate in such a way that there is no loss either at 
the point of departure or at the port.
<P>
	From the time the strike began, the union thus showed that it 
would ship the grain. I say that because in everything I have 
read, that is not said and my source is reliable; it is the same as 
the minister's. In keeping with the tradition of openness, he 
generously made it available to me. This source says that, faced 
with a rotating strike, the employer threatened a complete lock 
out, and the employer locked the workers out on January 29, thus 
stopping grain shipments. I think that must be taken into 
consideration.
<P>
	Nevertheless, as we saw, the mediation which took place 
narrowed the gap separating the parties. For the benefit of hon. 
members, let me remind you that the employer added 5 cents an 
hour to his initial offer, taking it to 65 cents, and the union 
lowered its initial demand to 75 cents, which is a big effort on 
their part under the circumstances. That is where matters stand 
now.
<P>
	One thing that this House must consider is that in labour 
relations, we must always seek to understand. It is easy when we 
are here, removed from what is happening in real life, not to 
consider the motives for which people act. If we want to move 
ahead as a Parliament, we must always try to consider the 
motives that drive people.
<P>
	In British Columbia, as far as I know, there was no recession. 
All the figures available show that while Quebec, of which we 
often speak, perhaps too much for some hon. members, had a 
severe recession, Ontario, for which this was really the first 
shock, had a more severe recession in 1990 than in 1982-83, but 
that was not the case in British Columbia. We must therefore 
understand the union's demand in light of economic activity in 
British Columbia and not of what is happening elsewhere. I 
think that, in the opinion of members, it is important.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	However, I understand how serious the situation is. I know 
how important the transport of grain and other products is for all 
of Western Canada. We have read in the newspapers that 26 
shiploads of grain are stopped and that another 38 are expected 
to follow. We also know that, so far, the Canadian Wheat Board 
will have to pay around $6 million in docking fees due to delays. 
It is a serious situation from an economic standpoint and I 
understand the anger of those who would like to see a quick 
solution to the problem. It is also important for Canada, for the 
reliability of Canadian ports.
<P>
	If I may have the floor for one minute, I would like to say that 
I understand very well since my constituency includes the port 
of Montreal and I became very angry last year when I realized 
that the Canadian Coast Guard did not do everything it should 
have to ensure that the harsh winter-but there have been worse 
winters-did not close the port for more than three weeks. We 
thought then that the Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers were 
taking a long time to find their way to Montreal.
<P>
	Whenever a port closes, it causes a lot of anxiety because it is 
like the heart of economic activity in the region, so I understand 
very well the anger of Western producers. But I remind you that 
British Colombia's prosperity can help us to understand how 
such a conflict happened, and I would like to add that I know, 
without having heard it, that the workers themselves are 
undoubtedly extremely disappointed given the effort they put 
into this and that their employers are anxiously waiting for a 
solution to this whole situation.
<P>
	Let us go back to the bill itself. I intend to propose an 
amendment to the final offer process. I will return to it during 
the debate. But I would like to tell the House right now that the 
final offer process may appear fair in some cases but that, in 
other cases, it may put one of the parties at a disadvantage, 
especially if the parties had not planned on this process putting 
an end to their conflict.
<P>
	I should say that labour law is the fastest-growing kind of law 
because once a bill becomes law, the parties go to great lengths 
to ensure that it is in their best interests and one must admit that 
they are acting very intelligently although some are more 
powerful than others.
<P>
	Given the circumstances, I will propose an amendment so that 
the arbitrator chosen by the parties or appointed by the minister 
responsible pursuant to the law would not have to choose 
between the two offers but, since the minister is entrusting him 
with choosing one or the other, he can also entrust him to choose 
in the two offers the elements that seem the most equitable to 
him, on the understanding that he would be limited to the two 
offers.

<P>
	In closing, I feel sad that we need to have this debate now but I 
think that, under the circumstances, Parliament can only 
recognize failure and hope that such failures will be as few as 
possible, by ensuring that this legislation will guarantee the best 
chances of equity under the circumstances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
all I want to praise the government for its sensitivity on the 
spreading economic impact on the labour dispute involving 
3,500 west coast grain handlers.
<P>
	The basic orientation of the Reform Party caucus to this 
proposed government legislation is that we support the 
imposition of the government settlement one last time due to the 
seriousness and widespread impact of this dispute.
<P>
	At the same time we would like to make a suggestion that the 
government form as soon as practical a special joint committee 
among House standing committees on agriculture, labour and 
transportation in order to formulate legislation leading to the 
long-term resolution of this reoccurring national problem. The 
need for a long-term solution becomes apparent when one looks 
at the number of times labour disputes at the Canadian ports 
have been ended by government legislation.
<P>
	For example, in 1972 there was the resumption of operations 
of ports on the St. Lawrence as well as the West Coast Ports 
Operations Act. There was the West Coast Grain Handling 
Operations Act of 1974, the West Coast Ports Operations Act 
again the following year, the St. Lawrence ports in 1975, the port 
of Halifax in 1976, the west coast again in 1982, Prince Rupert 
in 1988 and the British Columbia Grain Handling Operations 
Act of 1991. It is a long, sad history.
<P>
	It is obvious that the seriousness of the underlying factors 
affecting labour and employment in the Canadian economy must 
be dealt with in a better fashion. One of those underlying factors 
is the steady improvement of productivity per person employed 
in handling grain or, to phrase it another way, the steady 
decrease in the number of people being hired to do the job.
<P>
	According to figures supplied by Gordie Westrand, president 
of the Canadian area of the International Longshoremen's and 
Warehousemen's Union, in 1988 a total of 5.446 million man 
hours were required to move 54.591 million tonnes through the 
west coast ports of Vancouver, New Westminster, Victoria, 
Chemainus, Port Alberni, Port Simpson and Stewart.
<P>
	In 1992, 4.648 million man hours moved 53.128 million 
tonnes in those same ports. Primary figures show 4.2 million 
man hours for 1993. Therefore, tonnes per man hour have 
increased from 10.2 in 1988 to 11.43 in 1992 and there will be an 
increase again in this crop year.
<P>
	Basically this means that fewer people are being employed to 
move more grain than ever. Mr. Westrand estimates his 
Canadian union membership dropping by 120 to 130 every year. 
Once again we are talking about Canadian jobs and their 
disappearance altogether. As I pointed out previously to this 
House, employers with their backs to the wall are often faced 
with cutting labour, one of the few options left, faced with 
increasing overhead such as the recent increase in premiums for 
unemployment insurance paid by both employees and 
employers.
<P>
	At the same time the number of longshoremen is decreasing, 
productivity of wheat and demand for that wheat among Pacific 
Rim customers is growing. In part ``Grain Matters'', a letter 
from the Canadian Wheat Board, reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Far East and Oceania, home to 3.2 billion consumers, could account for 40 
per cent of world wheat trade by the end of the century.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Population and income growth, increased urbanization and the resulting 
dietary shift away from rice are expected to lead to greater use of the wheat based 
products. Canada could secure as much as 30 per cent of this market.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	We are all familiar with some of the major losses from the 
current dispute, losses which Canada's economy can ill afford, 
loss of wages for the 3,500 longshoremen and transportation 
employees primarily in the railroads, loss of income from grain 
sales for the farmers, and loss of income for all maritime 
employers. Perhaps the most serious loss of all may be the 
long-term loss of our Canadian international reputation as a 
reliable supplier of goods.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves what happens in boardrooms around 
the Pacific Rim when executives see that a shipment expected 
from Canada was delayed for two weeks due to a labour dispute. 
According to figures supplied today by experts from both the 
Department of Agriculture and the Department of Human 
Resources the Japanese have already cancelled some of their 
barley orders for April.
<P>
	The 26 ships currently in port, plus the 38 ships due to arrive 
this week and next if not filled with grain, cannot merely be 
shifted like some big steel cart. On the contrary, unfilled or 
seriously delayed orders profoundly damage the willingness of 
our customers to buy from us if they can possibly obtain 
adequate grain from Australia or the United States. Losing such 
orders would have obvious long-term ill effects on the entire 
economy of Canada, especially on western Canada.
<P>
	It is apparent that major long term improvements are needed 
in labour relations in the Canadian ports, especially west coast 
ports which handle the majority of Canadian grain shipments for 
the hungry world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1078"> 1078 </A></B>
<P>
	In the Reform Party tradition of consulting and trusting the 
common sense of ordinary Canadians, we also propose that the 
parties in this dispute should be called as witnesses by a new 
special joint committee such as I mentioned before.
<P>
	Expert testimony should also be sought from working groups 
already functioning under the chairmanship of Mr. Warren 
Edmondson, director general of the Mediation and Conciliation 
Service. Any long-term solution must include from all these 
sources their insights, their full co-operation and the education 
of all concerned to the numerous interconnected facets of our 
changing Canadian economy.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Reform Party supports immediate passage 
of the government legislation together with the strong 
suggestion that we provide a new special joint committee of the 
House standing committees on agriculture, labour and 
transportation as an appropriate channel for obtaining a long 
term solution to this persistent national problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always a regrettable day when the House has to deal with back to 
work legislation. It has happened before and our view today is 
the same as it has been in the past, that it is regrettable when the 
government has to take such action.
<P>
	Generally there are things that the government could have 
done before taking this action that might have, because nothing 
in this life is for sure, prevented the situation from developing to 
the point at which the government felt it had no option.
<P>
	It is particularly regrettable in this case because it has already 
been said to some extent there is very little that separates the 
parties, although what may seem like very little to us may seem 
like a lot to those who are involved in the intimacy of collective 
bargaining and it is very hard to know the full story of that 
bargaining. We have to accept that what is left is significant to 
the respective parties.
<P>
	In any event, I would like to say I listened very carefully to the 
minister who was careful to be measured in his remarks, critical 
of both parties for not coming to a negotiated settlement.
<P>
	I put it to him that what he has brought in today plays, at least 
in the perception of the union involved, to the strategy of the 
employer and a strategy that the employer had as far as the union 
is concerned for some time. If I understand the situation 
correctly, it was the employer who called for a final offer 
selection mechanism to be used before the situation went to 
mediation.
<P>
	In effect the employer has what it wanted out of the situation, 
out of allowing the strike to continue and creating a situation in 
which the government felt it had no choice.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The government did have some choice. If the minister, as 
previous ministers have, feels that it is time for the government 
to sort of lay the law down literally and say get back to work, 
why is it that governments are not equally willing to lay the law 
down to companies and make sure they do what would be in the 
best interests of the situation?
<P>
	I am referring here to the fact that the grain handlers were 
willing to continue to handle grain because grain is obviously 
one of the things that is a pressure point as far as the politics of 
this situation. There still would have been plenty to argue about 
and worry about. We would not have had to worry about grain if 
the longshoremen who offered to continue to handle grain were 
permitted to do so by the companies involved, but they were not.
<P>
	This raises two questions. Why did the companies not allow 
them to do so? I think that is pretty obvious. If it was the strategy 
of the company in the first place to create a situation in which 
the government would eventually come in and provide through 
legislation what it had recommended earlier then that makes 
sense from the company point of view. However, it does not 
make any sense from the point of view of the government if the 
government was genuinely concerned about making sure that 
the flow of grain to port and offshore was uninterrupted.
<P>
	Why could the minister not have been tough with those 
companies and said whatever strategy they have must be a 
strategy that does not include blackmailing the country with 
respect to the export of grain? Why could the minister not have 
done that? Maybe we will have a chance to ask him that when we 
get into committee of the whole.
<P>
	It is also interesting that the minister, given that he is a Liberal 
from Manitoba, has brought in final offer selection as part of the 
package. I recall that it was the Liberal Party in Manitoba that 
voted against final offer selection when the NDP government of 
the day brought it in or, to be more precise, co-operated with the 
Conservative government in doing away with the final offer 
selection that the NDP government had brought in.
<P>
	I hope this is a lesson to Mr. Edwards in Manitoba and to 
others that perhaps this is something that ought to be revisited 
by his cousins in Manitoba as something that may prove to be a 
useful device in labour management relations and in the settling 
of labour disputes.
<P>
	Pursuing this theme that I started to some degree before, I 
want ask the question rhetorically at this point, but perhaps later 
on in committee of the whole in a practical way to the minister, 
why the onus is always on working people to serve the national 
interest or in this case in the interest of the country as it is 
represented by grain exports and all of the other exports that are 
tied up as a result of the strike.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1079"> 1079 </A></B>
<P>
	Every day in the country business people and corporations 
make decisions that are not necessarily in the national interest. 
They make investment decisions. They make all kinds of 
decisions that are not in the national interest but which are in 
their self-interests. When they do that people simply say that is 
the way the world works. These people act in their own 
self-interest and that is the invisible hand of Adam Smith 
working its wonderful way in the world and we just have to trust 
that this will all work out for the best. They are just showing 
good business sense when they look after themselves.
<P>
	When working people try to look after themselves and try to 
put their self-interests forward in an aggressive way that says if 
you do not do this we are going to withdraw our services, this is 
sometimes regarded by some, not necessarily the minister, in the 
country as a heinous act.
<P>
	People are doing this all of the time. We have had capital 
strikes in the country from time to time when people say: ``I am 
sorry, if I cannot make the return I expect on this particular 
investment I am not going to make it. If I cannot do this I am not 
going to do this''. This happens all the time. However, when it is 
done by the business community it is just called good business 
sense. When we respond to it we are just trying to create the 
right business climate.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	I just wanted to share the offence which I take not in anything 
the minister said, but in some of the comments which sometimes 
attend occasions like this when people comment on the actions 
of strikers and ask: ``Why do they not do what is in the best 
interests of the country?'' I would like to see everybody act in 
the best interests of the country. If that is what the minister has 
in mind in the coming reforms he spoke of, then I will be behind 
him, but we will wait and see.
<P>
	With respect to the port of Vancouver, in a larger policy 
framework, decisions are made all the time in transportation 
policy particularly with deregulation, et cetera, which have 
caused more and more traffic to proceed on American rail lines 
and to proceed to American ports. All this has happened in the 
name of creating the right business climate for shippers, for the 
railways, for truckers and what not. This harms the port of 
Vancouver. This harms the Canadian national interest. But this 
is all taken like the weather: something we cannot do anything 
about.
<P>
	Well something can be done about it. There could be a 
different macro policy framework in which it is ensured that 
people use the port of Vancouver and are not tempted in any way, 
or even permitted in some cases, to use the port of Seattle or any 
other American port when Canadian ports are waiting to provide 
services.
<P>
	The minister mentioned he would like to see changes in how 
labour relations are dealt with. I am not sure exactly what he 
means but I have a suggestion or two. One of them is that he 
could bring in anti-scab legislation in the appropriate areas. We 
have been calling for this  for a long time. It is certainly one of 
the things which might prevent many labour disputes and many 
strikes from occurring in the first place, or certainly not to occur 
for the length of time they often do.
<P>
	Although it is not in the federal jurisdiction I think of a strike 
at Northern Blower in my riding. They have been on strike for 
almost two years now. I see these poor guys out there every day 
when I drive to my constituency office. If we had had legislation 
to prevent the use of replacement workers that strike would have 
been over a long time ago. These people would not still be out of 
work and there would not be the acrimony. There would not be 
the situation which occurs there now and has put a lot of people 
in a very difficult position.
<P>
	I am sure there are many other things the minister will be 
considering, but I would ask him to please consider instituting at 
the federal level that kind of legislation and perhaps other ways 
of making sure there are no strikes.
<P>
	There are two kinds of strikes. There is this kind of strike 
which gets dealt with very quickly. Then there are the other 
kinds of strikes like the one at Northern Blower and many other 
places that drag on and on and on. They are very destructive of 
people's lives and in many cases their relationships with former 
workers and colleagues.
<P>
	I know the minister has a great many tasks ahead of him in 
terms of social programs. Perhaps he has too many. I have a 
great deal of respect for the minister but I do not know that 
anybody could do everything that is on his plate. I hope at some 
time the government considers that and provides him with some 
relief, particularly in this respect because I know the minister is 
going to be preoccupied with the social program review and will 
not be able to give his full attention to this kind of thing.
<P>
	Our position is that we regret this has happened. We are 
opposed to it, as we have always been opposed to any imposition 
on the collective bargaining process. We think this could have 
been avoided had the government acted sooner or had the 
government permitted those who wanted to continue handling 
grain to handle it. However, we are prepared to help the 
government get this particular bill through and we will have 
more to say on the matter as the day continues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
start by congratulating the government for bringing the 
legislation to the House. Reformers are pleased that the 
government finally listened to our persistence in Question 
Period to settle this issue. I would also like to thank members of 
all parties for their co-operation in allowing the legislation to be 
dealt with quickly.
<P>
	I want to speak on behalf of western Canadian grain farmers in 
making it very clear to the House that this disruption should 
never have happened. Legislation that provides a long-term 
solution to this problem should have been passed years ago. In 
this regard I would like to pledge leadership on behalf of Reform 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1080"> 1080 </A></B>
<P>
members of Parliament in reaching a long-term solution to this  
problem. Disruptions in grain handling must not continue.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	This legislation appears to provide for an adequate solution to 
this particular disruption. For example, the arbitration 
procedure proposed in this bill seems to be a fair one. I believe 
both sides will provide serious offers knowing that one offer will 
be fully accepted and the other fully rejected by the arbitrator. 
This bill should allow this House to legislate an immediate end 
to this particular problem.
<P>
	There is however a more important consideration. That is a 
long-term solution to the problem of disruptions in grain 
transportation and handling. The following points illustrates 
this.
<P>
	There have been nine disruptions which have ended in back to 
work legislation for longshoremen and management since 1956. 
They occurred in 1956, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1982, 1986, 1988, 
1991 and again in 1994. There have been over a dozen other 
labour-management disputes involving grain handling and 
transportation which have ended in back to work legislation. 
Many other situations have been settled through normal 
labour-management negotiations but all have caused 
disruptions in grain transportation and grain movement.
<P>
	Hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales have been 
incurred through these disruptions, but it is very difficult to put 
an exact figure on the value of the loss of sales due to unreliable 
delivery to our customers. Let me demonstrate the damage that 
has been done to the Canadian economy, especially to grain 
farmers.
<P>
	Agriculture Canada has estimated that this strike has cost 
between $100 million and $150 million. This figure however 
does not take into consideration the damage to Canada's 
reputation as a reliable supplier of grain.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board indicated that the Japanese food 
agency has cut its next order from 80,000 tonnes to 35,000 
tonnes. This reduction amounts to a loss of $6 million to 
Canadian grain farmers. Japanese buyers have indicated grave 
concern about depending on Canadian sources for future grain 
supplies. This is very serious.
<P>
	The chief executive officer of a large grain company quoted a 
Japanese buyer as saying in these last couple of days that Canada 
should implement a strike month so we can get all of these 
strikes out of the way and have reliable grain deliveries for the 
other 11 months. It is a serious problem. The Japanese are 
complaining about these disruptions and we have to deal with 
them. It is truly an embarrassment that the Canadian 
government is allowing this to happen.
<P>
	Lost shipment on the west coast amounts to 73,000 tonnes per 
day. However the losses go way beyond the two weeks of this 
strike. It will take several weeks for the system to operate at full 
capacity again. A catch up time is required. Demurrage costs 
alone will amount to $6 million, again paid for out of the pockets 
of western Canadian grain farmers. No one else covers these 
costs.
<P>
	Past strikes have cost tens of millions of dollars and the 
damage to long-term commitments has been severe. Direct 
losses, for example losses to grain companies, terminal 
operations and demurrage on ships waiting in port are losses that 
can be calculated. However, the losses are due to disruption in 
sales and therefore future lost markets cannot be easily 
calculated. All of these losses I emphasize again are to western 
Canadian grain farmers. I could continue with examples such as 
these but let us start talking about long-term solutions.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	There are at least two options which should be examined as 
possible long-term solutions. The first one is to declare grain 
handling an essential service. The second is to put into place 
better labour-management negotiation processes. I will explain 
the second option just a little later.
<P>
	In declaring all grain handling an essential service, Reform 
policy states that grain handling should be deemed an essential 
service if use of alternative shipping points should not prove 
sufficient in maintaining shipment levels and customer 
satisfaction. This option therefore is conditional on having 
available other cost effective options to ship our Canadian grain.
<P>
	The second option is to put in place a better 
labour-management negotiation process. This could involve 
ensuring that a new agreement will be in place before the old one 
expires. There would be no strikes under this option either.
<P>
	To accomplish that an arbitrator could be appointed 
approximately six months before a contract expires. If a 
settlement has not been reached within two weeks of the end of 
the contract, then an arbitrator would ask management and 
labour to come up with their best offer, their best position. The 
arbitrator would then pick one, either the labour position or the 
management position. One position would be completely 
accepted and the other position completely rejected. This is in 
line with what the Liberals have proposed to end this particular 
strike.
<P>
	Under this process a strike would not be allowed to occur. 
This is good for labour. It is good for management. It is good for 
western Canadian grain farmers and others using the system. 
These options should be considered in developing a long-term 
solution to the recurring disruptions in the grain handling 
system.
<P>
	In conclusion I once again congratulate this government for 
bringing forth this legislation. On behalf of western Canadian 
grain farmers and others hurt by these disruptions, I strongly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1081"> 1081 </A></B>
<P>
encourage this government  to work through an all-party 
committee in reaching a long-term solution to these recurring 
problems.
<P>
	The last strike lasted five days, this strike eleven days. Let us 
ensure there are no future strikes which will curtail grain 
movement in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
hon. member's outlining his solutions to labour disputes at the 
west coast. I am personally quite angry that this particular 
dispute has come about and the disruption that has occurred. 
Before we are finished with this nearly three weeks will have 
been lost in the shipment of grains, at a time when the shipping 
program was at its peak and in particular at its peak for those 
grades which we have had some trouble disposing of since they 
were in surplus in Canada: No. 3 wheat and the feed grains.
<P>
	In listening to the hon. member's solutions I wonder if he 
would square for me what I understood his party's position is 
with regard to property rights and the rights of the owners to 
manage that property. How would he square that right with his 
proposal to force these people to stay open, keeping in mind that 
this disruption for grain at least and the previous one or two 
disruptions came about as a result of a lockout where the owners 
of the longshoring companies or the grain handling companies 
simply refused to open their doors to let the workers continue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly would not want to point a 
finger, in this case or in past disputes, at either management or 
labour. That is not my intent at all. I recognize that some have 
been lockouts and some have been strikes.
<P>
	In terms of reconciling our position on property rights and 
ending a strike, we fully recognize that to make an open market 
system work well certain regulations must be in place. This is 
exactly one example of that type of situation. We have a near 
monopoly situation. Farmers have no option other than this 
route to get their grain to the customer. This is one time when 
government regulation is needed so that the system will work 
well.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment for the hon. member who just spoke. 
I make these comments as a former personnel director in an 
educational institution which has weathered the stormy 
seventies and seen better times later in terms of work relations. I 
think that there is a principle that is sacrificed with the best offer 
proposal: in labour relations, we must always have a win-win 
situation.
<P>
	Yet this proposal will inevitably lead to a choice being made, 
a situation where there will be a winner and a loser. When I look 
at past labour disputes, in 1972, 1975, 1982, 1986 an so on, it is 
clear to me that the worst thing we could do would be to make a 
decision where one side  would win and the other one lose. This 
would create a situation where, in terms of labour relations, they 
would always be at one another's throats and, when the time to 
negotiate a new agreement comes, they would dig their heels 
and ask themselves what would be the best way to play their 
hand with the legislator in order to end up on the winning side 
instead of the losing side.
<P>
	I think this is not a good way to put the responsibility in the 
hands of the bargaining parties. This is especially true in the 
present case where, beside the fact that the dispute has a major 
economic impact, it would seem that neither labour nor 
management exhibited totally inappropriate behaviour. The 
problem is much more due to the historical background.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to ask the hon. member if, based on 
the foregoing arguments, he would not favour instead the option 
to let the adjudicator set what the new work conditions will be 
for the workers involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, one possible solution I laid out was 
that all of these disputes would be settled before the end of the 
contract. Therefore there would be no labour disruptions in this 
type of dispute where there really is no option available for 
people using the service.
<P>
	I do not see that as really encouraging settlement through 
legislation. In fact I believe there is a higher probability of 
labour and management reaching an agreement before a 
negotiator or an arbitrator comes into play. This type of 
settlement where there is one option from labour and one from 
management put on the table is going to lead to more serious and 
more realistic offers. I believe a more fair settlement is reached 
with that type of mechanism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take a few minutes before we go into committee of the whole to 
express my surprise and disappointment as we consider this 
legislation, one of the first bills to be introduced by this 
government. It is similar in scope to legislation passed by the 
Conservatives between 1984 and 1992, mainly toward the end of 
their mandate, when there was a labour dispute at Canada Post 
and a dispute in the public service, where they acted with a total 
lack of imagination and a total lack of care.
<P>
	After keeping its distance, the present government had 
decided, now that things have come to a head, to intervene in 
this dispute in the tried and true way, on the advice of their 
senior officials or perhaps as a result of public pressure. One 
wonders, considering that it was clear a dispute was imminent, 
especially in January when the parties started jockeying for 
position, the unions had made their statements and the 
employers had shown a great deal of intolerance, why all of a 
sudden no one in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1082"> 1082 </A></B>
<P>
government showed any concern or if they did, they kept a very 
low profile.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	What amazes me in this dispute is that although it started as a 
rotating strike, the union maintained throughout its willingness 
to handle grain despite all kinds of pressures, out of respect for 
the farmers. After one day, plus a few days later on in only some 
of the ports, a lockout was declared. Someone over there knew 
the government had special legislation ready and waiting. They 
were already prepared for that eventuality, so there was no 
incentive to reach a settlement through mediation and 
conciliation during the weeks prior to the strike. If the appointed 
mediator had trouble reaching an agreement, especially on a 
clause that might easily have been dealt with, they could at least 
have tried another mediator.
<P>
	The minister could have intervened, perhaps directly in a 
meeting with the parties, but no attempt was made. They 
prefered to stick with the Conservative or Liberal tradition 
whenever there is a dispute in our ports that affects the economy 
of a region or of the entire country, including postal disputes and 
the public service, which means bringing in special legislation.
<P>
	How can we expect a normal bargaining process with a level 
playing field, when one of the parties knows that after a few days 
on strike, the government will table special legislation? There 
was hardly equality between the two groups and, in a difficult 
economic situation, an employer generally lends a deaf ear to 
union demands.
<P>
	It is in that sense that I voice my disappointment. The very 
first legislative measure passed by this government is going to 
be a special law to settle a dispute which could have been 
mediated.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that-although today we gave our 
consent in that particular case knowing full well that the 
government was unwilling to pursue any other route-we will 
not always agree so easily. In the future, the government will be 
faced with a barrage of interventions and they will have to 
demonstrate the necessity of such a measure.
<P>
	We contacted the striking workers and they proposed 
amendments. They were open to discussion, they were willing to 
compromise and they suggested amendments to the Bill. The 
discussion we had with those people shows without a doubt that 
something was not right out there. There are always two sides to 
a dispute, but one side was not consulted.
<P>
	The certainty of a recall bill was always in the mind of the 
negotiators. They did not have to make any concessions, they 
did not have to negotiate anything, they knew that a bill would 
be forthcoming. This is exactly the same attitude the 
Conservatives had when faced with similar disputes.
<P>
	The red book that Liberals waved during the last election is 
quickly turning blue. They are behaving like Conservatives 
when faced with a dispute like this one. I deeply regret that move 
by the government and I will vote against the bill. I support the 
suggestions made by our critic in response to the minister; his 
speech was truly outstanding.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the

	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Order. House in

<P>
	On clause 8:
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Chairman, we 
do this committee of the whole so rarely that none of us are as 
practised at it as we used to be, but I must say it is nice to be back 
on the front bench momentarily.
<P>
	I wonder whether this is the appropriate place to ask the 
minister a few questions. I have two things. This is the clause 
having to do with final offer selection. I wonder if the minister 
could indicate whether or not the fact that this is in the bill is 
simply a reflection of the fact that this is what the employer in 
this case had hoped for prior to the stage of mediation or whether 
this reflects a new policy thrust on the part of the government in 
labour relations by way of recommending not just in this bill but 
to the country that final offer selection will come to be seen as 
one of the ways in which labour disputes of this kind and others 
might be settled.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member from 
Transcona himself said earlier in the debate that the idea of final 
offer selection has very valuable precedents and that colleagues 
of his in the province of Manitoba introduced such proposals as 
a way of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1083"> 1083 </A></B>
<P>
trying to provide a more extended and active way of developing 
a collective bargaining process.
<P>
	I would say that the Government of Canada, which is always 
interested in learning and adapting to useful ideas presented at 
the provincial level, would feel that final offer selection in this 
case makes a lot of sense, particularly because in the one case 
the issues in dispute are not complex. They are basically 
monetary ones of a very limited nature.
<P>
	Second, as I tried to say in my opening remarks, because there 
are similar disputes of this nature brewing on the horizon, it 
would be very important for us to indicate that rather than 
having Parliament continually do a bailout of parties in the 
dispute that we once again try to, while the work stoppage may 
be harmful, restart or restore elements of collective bargaining, 
which in this case really requires both parties to make their best 
efforts to come out with what they think is the most reasonable, 
rational, effective solution. Then there is a certain risk that they 
play that they would not be accepted, but it is a way of putting 
some discipline, some pressure and some persuasion on the 
parties to get down to a serious calculation of what would be in 
the best interest of their industry in a collective way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Chairman, the minister mentioned the 
discipline that he would want to bring to both parties to the 
dispute in this case and in other cases if he should find a way to 
have final offer selection built more into the labour relations of 
the country. I wonder if at this point he could tell us, because 
there is no obvious point in the bill where this question might be 
asked, why he chose not to try to impose some discipline on the 
company at the point at which the longshoremen volunteered to 
continue to handle the grain and the company refused.
<P>
	It certainly seems to us, as I said in my earlier remarks, that 
this was an opportunity for the collective bargaining process to 
work without the pressure that it immediately creates when 
grain exports are held up. I wonder if the minister could explain 
why he did not say to the company: ``Look, you simply cannot 
have that advantage. If people are willing to continue to handle 
grain then you must be willing to continue to permit them to do 
so''. Why did he permit the lockout to transpire?
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
while the movement of grain is a major and vital part of the port 
of Vancouver activity, it is not the exclusive, sole activity. There 
are many other commodities that move through the port of 
Vancouver such as potash, sugar and other raw commodities 
from western Canada which are considered just as vital to those 
who produce them.
<P>
	Also, because of the containerization in the port itself and the 
clear diversion that was taking place, I think the employer was 
basically saying it would be wrong and the reason why we do not 
endorse a single shot or single item settlement is it would in fact 
be discriminatory against many others who have serious 
economic stakes in the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	One of the reasons, as I said in my remarks, for bringing in the 
legislation at this time is the reputation that Canada must 
establish in its west coast ports for reliability. In this case we 
have already noticed the shift of many container ships into the 
American ports to the south. If we just allowed the grain 
movement to take place by itself those other items would have 
provided damage to their own producers, their own 
manufacturers and would have have continually eroded the 
positioning of the port of Vancouver which is also in the vital 
interest of Canada to maintain as a viable port.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Chairman, must I 
still address the Chair? No. Then you will not hold it against me 
this time. It could be habit forming.
<P>
	My question, Mr. Minister, is along the same lines as that of 
my colleague from the NDP. Basically, you chose to let matters 
ride for quite a long time. Today is February 8 and since the 
employer declared the lockout on January 29, some time was 
allowed to pass. There was an attempt at mediation and I only 
learned of the concrete results after meeting with departmental 
officials. If I had had this information in hand before my 
meeting with them, I would have asked them different 
questions.
<P>
	I want to say at the outset that given the mediator's position, 
given the fact that the final offer was the employer's preferred 
means of settling the dispute, that the mediator agreed with the 
employer's minimum position or vice versa, in point of fact, the 
workers may have been quite convinced, and no one would have 
been able to convince them otherwise on the basis of the facts, 
that the final offer was in fact a veiled way of proving the 
employer right. That is why I announced that I intended to 
propose an amendment to clause 10(1).
<P>
	I do not want to start an argument because it is important to 
me that these workers are given the best possible chance to have 
an equitable solution put on the table. However, in order to 
ensure that they do get this opportunity given everything that 
has happened before, given this agreement on the 65 cents which 
was very close to the initial offer made by management and 
given the major concessions made by the workers, I think that to 
offer as the only solution a choice between two final offers is the 
same as supporting the employer's position.
<P>
	I have the impression that in the opinion of my colleagues 
opposite, and especially the Minister of Labour-whom I hope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1084"> 1084 </A></B>
<P>
is still listening to me-who has just taken up his new duties and 
as Minister of Labour, must maintain his neutrality toward both 
parties, that in  their opinion, disputes must be settled, but not so 
that there appears to be a bias in favour of one of the parties.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that under the circumstances, the minister 
should give both parties the opportunity to reach an equitable 
settlement. I want to stress that the state of the economy is 
different in British Columbia than it is elsewhere. I would like 
for things to be this way in Montreal. This may not be an 
interesting problem to resolve but, just between us, I would 
much prefer to solve this problem than some of the other ones 
that are tied to the state of the economy.
<P>
	Therefore, with regard to clause 10(1), I think that you should 
agree to my amendment since we are now at the stage of 
examining the dispute settlement process.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, let 
me say first that throughout this bargaining and dispute, both 
officials of this department and myself have not taken any sides 
and have retained very strict neutrality, as has been the tradition 
of this department. I think it is wrong to suggest otherwise.
<P>
	We feel that collective bargaining itself has both rights and 
obligations to it and in order to be exercised properly those of us 
who represent the third party, which in this case is the public 
interest, must ensure that there is no particular bias.
<P>
	The fact that along the way the employer in this case sort of 
suggested that the final offer of selection might be one means of 
settlement does not mean to say that it is a bias in favour of the 
employer. Quite the contrary as I said to my hon. friend for 
Winnipeg Transcona. It was an NDP government in Manitoba, 
which I may say was not known as a friend of management 
necessarily, that proposed that as an endorsement. Similarly in 
the province of Ontario we have had final offer selection.
<P>
	I do not think final offer selection in itself is attached to either 
side of the dispute, labour or management. It is just an important 
technique. The reason we are proposing it in this bill has nothing 
to do with the particular proposal of management in this case. 
We felt it was a better technique than arbitration which was tried 
in the past and failed. It has not succeeded in restoring a more 
legitimate useful process among the bodies.
<P>
	As I outlined in my speech we had four different occasions 
when Parliament had to bring back the grain handlers in the port 
of Vancouver. In each case arbitration was used and it clearly did 
not have a kind of leavening effect. The chastening effect might 
be a better way of describing it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What the hon. member for Mercier is proposing could well 
apply should a dispute arise at the port of Montreal. This 
provision in the bill sends a message to those in Montreal, 
namely that they should work out a solution through the 
collective bargaining process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the reason. I think we are trying to say to a number of 
parties to the dispute that final offer selection is a way of 
continuing responsibilities.
<P>
	In this case arbitration would not work. It has proven not to 
have been usefully exercised in the past to gain some kind of 
long term new set of labour relations. That is why I would appeal 
to the member.
<P>
	I recognize in the amendment that she has proposed, which 
she was kind enough to share with me, that in effect it is just 
another form of arbitration. It is a not a variation on final offer 
selection. It really is a slightly revised version of arbitration 
itself. Therefore I think it would not serve the purpose of this act 
nor would it serve the purpose of the hon. member who as she 
expressed would hope to try to avoid a dispute of this kind in the 
port of Montreal or other areas.
<P>
	As I said earlier in my remarks, I am quite happy to work with 
members to develop some propositions, policies and guidelines 
that we can better use, particularly in the transportation industry 
which is vital to this country. I would be very anxious to do that 
because I think we need to do it, but in this case I think it would 
be more effective and more appropriate if we use final selection 
which I believe is a fair device. Both sides have an equal right to 
present what they consider to be the most effective solution. 
Both sides have an equal right to win. Both sides have an equal 
possibility of losing. There are no flaws whatsoever in this 
proposal. It is fair to both sides.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>

<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Before giving the floor 
back to the hon. member for Mercier, I would like to rectify 
something I said earlier, if I may. When you first rose, you asked 
me if members always had to direct their comments or questions 
to the Chair. It would seem that I erred on the side of familiarity 
and that, in fact, even in committee of the whole, members must 
address each other through the Chair. That being said, the floor 
is yours.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> I did think there was a 
problem in there somewhere.
<P>
	I would like to tell the minister that he seems to be forgetting 
an important point. When he says that the final offer in itself did 
not constitute an approach favouring one side over the other, I 
agree with him.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1085"> 1085 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Not in itself but on that particular occasion there was the 
intervention of a mediator. I read this in the newspaper. The 
mediator is said to have agreed with 65 cents. The longshoremen 
had made an offer of 75 cents.
<P>
	It is very important that the minister listen to me. If I speak in 
English it is because I want to be sure to be well understood. I 
hope I express myself correctly.
<P>
	I want to defend the longshoremen of Vancouver. A mediator 
agrees with a settlement of 65 cents, which is only 5 cents more 
than the 60 cents offered. The union has asked for 95 cents and in 
front of the mediator because it wants a settlement goes as far 
down as 75 cents. I am sure if they went down to the docks they 
would have a real discussion with the guys there. I suppose that 
most of them are guys.
<P>
	Mr. Chairman, I do not think the minister is listening to me.
<P>
	We have a situation where the only point that is not settled, as 
I understand it, is the money gap. The mediator of the minister 
agreed to 65 cents. The employer wants a final offer and the 
minister presents a bill. When we speak to the longshoremen's 
union we think the minister is with the employer.
<P>
	I pray the minister will preserve the impartiality of the labour 
minister for the months and years to come. I hope this will be the 
case. I hope we do not have a conflict in Montreal but if we have 
one I hope that the labour minister will have all the impartiality 
that he should have.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
first of all, I would like to say that the remarks made by the hon. 
member for Mercier were impressive, in either official 
language. I did listen to her. Whether she is speaking French or 
English, the message is the same, if I understood her correctly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think the hon. member is beginning to stretch the point. 
There is no evidence of bias in this case. The role of the mediator 
is to make recommendations on what he or she thinks would be 
the best judgment. To suggest that it demonstrates a bias is 
simply saying whether it is a judgment call or not. I do not think 
they side with one party or the other. It would be unfortunate to 
cast aspersions on a mediation service which over the years has 
done very well by this country and has served in a very neutral 
and objective fashion.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I also believe that if the hon. member would look carefully at 
the legislation she will see there is equal opportunity for both 
sides at the start. Both sides have the right to recommend the 
selection of the arbitrator who would decide on final offer 
selection. We invite both parties to come together to find a 
person of their mutual choosing so there would be no suggestion 
there was any one side. On the other hand we also have to declare 
that  we do not, as I carefully pointed out before, fall into using 
the arbitration methodology which has proven in the past to 
become another form of avoidance by the parties to the dispute.
<P>
	I would argue it is very important to use final offer selection 
for the cases to follow. If we simply agreed with the hon. 
member and went back to the traditional forms of arbitration 
then it would give the message to all others who are facing 
similar disputes that once again they can rely on that crutch, that 
artificial lifeline and we would not have more relevant and 
realistic labour relations discussion in some of these crucial 
areas.
<P>
	I want to assure the member there is no bias and if the parties 
in dispute use the final offer selection as it is set out in this 
legislation they will find out it is to their advantage.
<P>
	It was put to both sides, employer and employees, the 
necessity of making a judgment based on the best interests of 
their overall industry. If there is a dispute how do we divide the 
spoils? To what extent do we ensure there is fair compensation 
for employees at the same time we retain the economic viability 
of the industry itself?
<P>
	We should not be debating these questions in the House of 
Commons. We are not the experts. We are not party to it. We 
should not be arguing whether it should be 65 cents or 72 cents. 
It is not our business. We are not the stakeholders nor should we 
presume to take over their responsibilities. What we should be 
doing is putting together a procedure that we think will arrive at 
a fair solution and in this case because of the inadequacies of the 
past by using arbitration I would not want to return to that 
methodology at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in 
the discussion of this legislation.
<P>
	I believe as the only member of Parliament from the greater 
Vancouver area who has spoken in the debate I want to raise a 
couple of concerns with the minister, particularly with respect to 
this final offer process.
<P>
	I want to put it in context because the minister has said that it 
is important there be no bias. It is also important there be no 
perception of bias, there be no perception on the part of either 
party that one party is being given undue advantage in the 
process that we as elected representatives are putting in place to 
settle this dispute. If the test is not only actual bias but a 
perception of bias, not only justice being done but being seen to 
be done, this legislation fails that test.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that I have spoken with 
representatives of the longshoremen, with Gord Westrand, the 
president, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1086"> 1086 </A></B>
<P>
and other representatives and they feel a sense of anger and 
betrayal at where this process has led.
<P>
	They tried hard to get a collective agreement. They bargained 
for many months in good faith trying to get a collective 
agreement. On the other hand I firmly believe the employer was 
well aware of the fact that if they just sat back and took a hard 
line, the government would move in and settle.
<P>
	Representatives that I spoke to asked the question my 
colleague asked earlier. I recognize the importance of moving 
grain and I know that my colleagues recognize the importance of 
moving grain because over half our caucus is from 
Saskatchewan. We do not need any lessons on the importance of 
grain movement to prairie farmers.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I see the Minister of Agriculture here in the committee. I see 
the minister responsible for labour. If it was so important to 
move grain, why did they not say to the B.C. Maritime 
Employers Association that it should move that grain? The 
longshoremen were quite prepared to move the grain. Of course 
the reality was that the employer was prepared to hold them 
hostage and to hold the grain farmers of the prairies hostage in 
order to put pressure on the government to do exactly what it has 
done, which is to bring in this settlement.
<P>
	The question I want to ask the minister is this. It comes back 
to the point that was raised by the hon. member for Mercier. This 
employer even before mediation started made it very clear that it 
wanted final offer selection. It made that very clear during the 
process as well.
<P>
	We think final offer selection would be a good idea. The union 
was quite prepared to accept even non-binding arbitration. It 
moved an awfully long way. However what is happening in this 
legislation is that the employer is getting exactly what the 
employer wanted.
<P>
	If the final offer selection process is in place as is proposed in 
this legislation, what happens? The employer and the union both 
have to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator. If they do not, 
who appoints the arbitrator? The arbitrator is appointed by the 
minister.
<P>
	This is the same minister who appointed the mediator. 
Therefore from the perspective of the union, quite clearly if the 
mediator has already said that 65 cents is enough the perspective 
and the perception of the union is that that is exactly what the 
acceptable final offer is. From the perspective of the union, it is 
a done deal.
<P>
	The employer's position will be maintained because after all 
the minister's appointee has already said that he thinks 65 cents 
is enough. It is not fair. Not only is it not fair but it is certainly 
not perceived to be fair by the men and women in the 
longshoremen's union.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether he would be prepared to 
reconsider. I believe this has been poorly handled. When one 
intrudes into the collective bargaining process in this very 
heavy-handed way one has a particular obligation to be fair. The 
fines in the bill are harsh and excessive. I know my colleague 
from Transcona is going to be dealing with that point later.
<P>
	The union made an effort to arrive at a settlement. It was 
prepared to move an awfully long way. The employer hung in 
there and said: ``To hell with you. We know the government is 
going to order us back. We know the government is prepared to 
impose a settlement which effectively will be in the interests of 
the employer''.
<P>
	How can the minister responsible for labour stand in his place 
and suggest that it is a fair process when he knows full well that 
the outcome of this process is almost certainly going to be in 
favour of the B.C. Maritime Employers Association?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
am quite intrigued by the point of view raised by the hon. 
member who is making a great plea for fairness but clearly 
expresses a bias on one side. He is hardly expressing what I 
would call a fair objective analysis of the situation.
<P>
	It is his right to do that but now he is putting me in an 
untenable position. If I was to take his position, I would be 
showing bias to the other side would I not? By his own verbal 
gymnastics he has been able to totally defeat his purpose. Now 
he has said that if I adopt his position that is bias on one side 
versus the other.
<P>
	Clearly and obviously in the interests of fairness I cannot 
adopt the hon. member's suggestion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I think we are getting away from the real point here.
<P>
	I appreciate the hon. minister acting in this matter. I would 
have liked to have seen him act a little faster as he knows. This 
legislation is here to do something for the victim and not for the 
offenders in this strike.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time that we as the House of Commons realize that we as a 
country are a victim of these senseless strikes. We cannot 
continue with them, regardless of whether we are for labour or 
for management. The whole country is suffering through this. I 
appreciate the hon. minister taking these steps. We have to 
realize that when we will not have food on our tables to eat, we 
will find out how important these strikes have been and I thank 
him for that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
take the hon. member's representation. I should point out that 
Premier Roy Romanow of the province of Saskatchewan 
endorses that position exactly as he stated in the Saskatchewan 
legislature yesterday and it unanimously passed the 
Saskatchewan legislature.
<P>
	I would be very happy to provide a copy of that to the member 
from Burnaby.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1087"> 1087 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to point out to the members of committee of the 
whole that we must make a decision based on the best resolution 
of conflict formula, so as to enable these professionals to deal 
with such a situation in the future. Indeed past experience in this 
sector is not a very good guarantee for the future. Therefore, 
what is needed is a solution which will provide a guarantee for 
the future.
<P>
	Finally, selecting the best offer means that there is a winner 
and a loser. Someone will be able to say afterwards: ``It is your 
collective agreement. You are the one who got it from the 
government, so you have to live with it''. By experience, after 
having gone through decrees on collective agreements in the 
public sector in 1982-83, I know that this is no fun, neither for 
the employer, nor for the union concerned. It is important that 
everyone be a winner in this exercise and, for that to happen, 
both sides must have the impression that they suffered and had 
to give something during the negotiation process. At the point 
where we are now, the only solution is to convince the two sides 
to submit proposals to the referee, and this referee must be able 
to decide what is best for both sides.
<P>
	An important technical aspect is that in a single offer, there 
are always areas regarding which the party making the offer 
would have been willing to give more and to bargain with the 
other party, but did not do so because it tabled what was a global 
and comprehensive offer no individual aspects of which could 
be amended.
<P>
	From this point of view, I do not think that the proposal will 
provide a solution that will make people as happy as possible 
afterwards and ensure them an adequate work environment. The 
worst thing which could happen, and which would prove that we 
are inefficient would be to find ourselves in the same committee 
of the whole in two or three years, following another breakdown 
in labour relations.
<P>
	I believe it is important for us to find a solution which will 
lead to an improvement in labour relations in that sector, 
because right now both sides seem to think that ``in the end, the 
government will decide''. We must put the two sides in a 
situation where they have to take their responsibilities, and the 
best final offer formula is not the solution, because then the 
whole process becomes a gambling exercise.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Chairman, on the contrary, I tabled 
proposals using the final offer selection. Under the 
circumstances this is the best way to define the responsibilities 
of the two sides.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member and some others seem to assume that going 
back to the traditional operation, which in effect is what the hon. 
member for Mercier is proposing, is a perfect solution. There 
are winners and losers under arbitration as well.
<P>
	The hon. member from Burnaby was just saying that if I 
appoint the arbitrator he is going to be biased and therefore he is 
automatically going to lose. I am trying to say I want to be fair. I 
want to say to both parties that they must decide what they think 
is the best solution, make the best offer and that becomes the 
basis for a decision; not cherry picking, not taking little bits and 
pieces, little fragments here and there. That is arbitration.
<P>
	We are saying we are trying to develop a different process. I 
say this with great reservations to my friends in the Reform 
Party because so far they have been very supportive, but we have 
had two NDP governments bring forward proposals on final 
offer selection in those provinces. They felt it was a way of 
giving a fairer resolution and retaining-and this is what I do not 
understand, in particular members of the Bloc who have been 
involved in the union movement-principles of collective 
bargaining, the full right of the parties to the dispute to become 
involved in making the solution themselves, not having it 
imposed by government.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	That is what this legislation does. Bring them back to work, 
set up a process in which both parties will still have to make a 
decision as to what is in their best interests and in the collective 
interest of the community. That is what this particular idea of 
fair offer selection will do. It will send out a message in other 
disputes down the way that we will expect them to recognize and 
act in their collective responsibility, not simply to look to 
government as a crutch or solution.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Chairman, as one who 
was involved with collective bargaining for over 12 years, I have 
to say that I tip my hat to the minister for the final offer 
selection. I want to say something to him.
<P>
	I have been in this position many times. In final offer 
arbitration I have to say that management was always the loser, 
particularly in my municipality. Final offer selection we tried 
once and I also was the loser. The chairman we had nearly 
always came out in favour of the union. Nevertheless, we had to 
accept that. In this case I am not sure because I have a major 
concern from what I have heard from my colleague from out 
west.
<P>
	Is it true that the chairman who is going to make this decision 
has made the comment that he is in favour of 65 cents?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1088"> 1088 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> He is no longer in 
the process.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> There has been absolutely no indication as to 
how the chairman feels about the final offer selection. I think it 
is most important. I have to say in the end that what we were 
looking at was appointing five people and saying that in our 
district, if there is a final offer selection coming forth, one of 
those five people would be appointed. Their period of time 
would only be for three years. They are totally independent. 
They know their length of time is three years and they are 
appointed for that period of time to enter into this sort of 
negotiation.
<P>
	It is very important and it is very key because I have to say 
that not only will it not be right, but we will know that it is not 
right if the chairman is leaning one way or the other. The key to 
this is an independent chairman. I have to say to my friends from 
out west who are members of the NDP not to worry, it does not 
always come out in favour of management. In most cases it 
comes out in favour of union.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the hon. member for an instructive lesson in labour 
relations in her part of the world, which I know she was very 
much involved in. It only makes my point. Some are arguing that 
the final offer selection has a bias to it, that it all depends on 
which end of the decision they are. There is no inherent bias one 
way or the other.
<P>
	However, I do think it is important to make a distinction 
because members here have tried to indicate that somehow the 
mediator was imposing a settlement of 65 cents. The mediator 
has no power to impose anything. All the mediator does is 
facilitate the process and make suggestions as to what he or she 
may think is the best way of resolving the dispute.
<P>
	Parties are quite in their right to disregard the mediator's 
proposals. He or she is simply there to try to find a solution. If it 
is rejected, that is when the mediation no longer applies and the 
parties can do it themselves. In this case they were incapable of 
doing it themselves and that is why we are in the House debating 
it today.
<P>
	An arbitrator, on the other hand, does have authority to 
prescribe a solution. In this case, the bill says very explicitly 
that both parties can come together and recommend an 
arbitrator. It is up to whomever they choose. I would think it 
would be in their interest to get somebody who is mutually 
acceptable. I am not sure of the procedure used in the hon. 
member's case when she was mayor but I do know that in this 
case we have set out in the bill that the arbitrator can be a 
decision of both parties.
<P>
	If they fail to come to a decision even on that because of the 
various chemistries at work then we will appoint an arbitrator, 
and I can guarantee that it would be someone who is totally and 
completely objective in the  matter, whose only interest would 
be to find a proper settlement based upon what the final best 
offers of the two parties would be. My hope would be that the 
mediator would be somebody chosen by both management and 
labour.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to 
point out that there are already losers in this situation and those 
are the hundreds of thousands of farmers, many of whom are 
going to lose drastically as a result of what has happened over 
the last eight or ten days.
<P>
	It seems strange to me and to them that the government of the 
country will grant groups the power to destroy their economic 
viability and not allow them a seat at the table. That is the 
situation. Inasmuch as that is what is happening, where the 
hundreds of thousands of people in agriculture are suffering as a 
result of this and do not have a seat at the table, their 
representative is the hon. minister who has brought forward this 
document. Inasmuch as this document represents the interests of 
the people in agriculture, I support the minister because we must 
move this forward.
<P>
	If the minister and the government of the country will pass a 
resolution or the necessary legislation that will allow grain to 
move through the Seattle port when it is having its strike, the 
agricultural community will not be injured at all and everyone 
will allow this strike and negotiate until the cows come home.
<P>
	I support the minister because he is representing the injured 
third party in this whole process. I am prepared to vote in favour 
of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to say to the hon. 
member that the fact we are sitting here shows we recognize the 
third party that is not here is very important. We do not like to 
agree on such a bill that will become a law, but it does not mean 
we do not have to take great care in how we resolve the conflict 
on the shores. We agree on the basis of the bill, but what will 
happen after that?
<P>
	I would like the minister to understand that the mediator who 
was named by him, which is within his power, was representing 
the law and he agreed. I read it in the newspaper. His proposition 
was 65 cents. The minister tells me that we do not have to talk 
about that, but concretely it is a very good way of seeing what we 
are doing.
<P>
	The real fact is that for everybody there this agreement 
between the mediator and the employees has all the chances in 
the world of being an agreement that will be kept by the 
employer and be agreed to by the arbitrator who will be named. 
Understanding what is going on makes me think that it will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1089"> 1089 </A></B>
<P>
very hard for the parties to agree on an arbitrator. It is crystal 
clear when we know a little about labour relations.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	With the best offers for resolving the conflict, the union will 
be sure that its proposition has the same weight as that of the 
employer. That is why in that particular case I urge an 
amendment to let the arbitrator choose and if he chooses the 
employer's offer we will at least have the possibility to choose a 
mix between the two. This is why the labour minister should 
preserve the faith in a process which is not biased. I am not 
saying that the labour minister is biased, but I am saying that he 
should preserve the process.
<P>
	I am sure that in conflicts to come he will see that the 
mediation will not intervene in the process. The final offer 
process is not normally used even in places where it is now part 
of the law.
<P>
	Those of us who are in labour relations have to know how to 
proceed with it. So the process itself must not be discredited. 
This is my main point and this is what I want to defend in the 
amendment I have brought forward. Otherwise the generous 
speech that was made is not in touch with the law being 
presented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
will not go back on old arguments because as the hon. member 
said the clock is ticking and time is whiling away. Let me see if I 
can deal with the hon. member's concerns.
<P>
	I looked carefully at the amendment the hon. member 
presented. The difficulty I have with the amendment is that it is 
arbitration by another name. It is not final offer selection. In 
effect it changes the act. It would therefore not be a way of 
testing whether final offer selection is a useful technique. We 
would simply be putting it off to another time, another 
circumstance and who knows what charges of bias would then 
erupt.
<P>
	I suppose what would happen is we would never have final 
offer selection because any party that did not want to have it 
would say there was a bias in that and therefore they do not agree 
with it. We would therefore be continuing to put off the day 
when we could try at the federal level to use it as an effective 
means of resolving some of our more difficult 
labour-management disputes.
<P>
	If the problem is the feeling that the mediator by 
recommending a 65 cent level which is perfectly within his right 
to do if in the best interests is the way they saw a solution which 
could be rejected by the parties that somehow that indicates 
some sort of a favour on one side or the other, let me make an 
offer to the hon. member.
<P>
	Under the legislation we say both parties can appoint an 
arbitrator on final offer selection if they can agree. The hon. 
member says that is not possible, they will not agree. I am glad 
the hon. member said this because it makes my point very well. 
We were not going to get agreement with these two parties. They 
were going to rely upon government intervention whatever 
happened because both parties, not just management but labour 
as well, were too used to that solution.
<P>
	It then comes that it is my responsibility to choose, and the 
hon. member is suggesting that we want to have perceptions of 
fairness. How about if the first thing does not work and it comes 
to me to make a selection, we will put together a list of names. I 
will consult with members opposite to determine who they 
would most like to see as a fair person to put in the arbitrating 
procedure to show that in fact it is a fair offer. I will make that 
offer today so we can get on with the business of this legislation 
and the business of moving the grain.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Chairman, it seems to me 
that this would have been a fine opportunity to settle a dispute 
without causing further dissension. I do not think that those 
involved would go along with the proposed solution, namely the 
appointment of an adjudicator to choose between the final offers 
submitted by each side. Neither side, be it the employers or the 
workers, has chosen to be governed by this forced arbitration 
process. The hon. minister will correct me if I am wrong, but 
thus far I do not think that either side has agreed to such a system 
to reach a final settlement.
<P>
	To impose this kind of dispute resolution system is to add an 
irritant. It will cause further frustration while a final settlement 
has to be reached in the matter of hours.
<P>
	Since the minister has no other choice but to impose an 
unwanted system to settle the dispute, at least could the 
arbitrator be granted more leeway somehow in selecting the 
contract proposals from either side? Considering that the 
adjudicator himself as well as the unions and the employers have 
no say in selecting the resolution system which is imposed upon 
them, the arbitrator should at the very least be allowed to settle 
the dispute by deciding what the best course of action is with 
regard to those unresolved issues.
<P>
	I think that the hon. minister should minimize friction points 
and irritants if we want this dispute to be settled. I have been 
involved in labour relations for 20 years and that is how to find 
the best solution.
<P>
	This is my recommendation to the minister in support of my 
colleague's proposed amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Chairman, I have simply said no to the 
amendment. I have agreed with the Bloc Quebecois to share the 
choice of an arbitrator if need be. That is the proposal. But I not 
prepared to accept the amendment because it rejects the final 
offer selection process. That is what this legislation is about: 
final offer selection. If we had decided on an arbitrator we would 
have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1090"> 1090 </A></B>
<P>
proposed arbitration, but we decided on final offer selection 
instead, that is all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Could I have clarification on the process, Mr. 
Chairman. I understand we are still on clause 8 and we have not 
proceeded from there.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> That is correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> We need to move to the clause where the 
amendment can properly be made and the House can properly 
divide on it and we can proceed from there.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> I take the occasion to 
thank the hon. member for his intervention. I was waiting before 
getting to the next clause to bring to the attention of the House, 
this being the first occasion in the 35th Parliament that we have 
sat in committee of the whole, that according to the standing 
orders on the question of relevancy speeches in committee of the 
whole must be strictly relevant to the item or clause under 
consideration. We should be more specific in our deliberations 
on the clause in question.
<P>
	I am sure that is something all members will keep in mind. 
Under the circumstances, this being the first occasion that we 
are in committee of the whole, I probably extended too much 
latitude.
<P>
	(Clause agreed to.)
<P>
	(Clause 9 agreed to.)
<P>
	On clause 10:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Chairman, I have an 
amendment. Let me move an amendment and say at the same 
time that I did hear the minister's answer, but I would still like to 
have this amendment. I find his proposal interesting, if there 
were no amendment.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 10(c) be amended by adding at the end: ``or concludes with the 
combination that appears most equitable based on the respective final positions 
of the parties''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If I may add a few words on the exact wording of the 
amendment, it preserves the final offer and requires the 
arbitrator to choose between the union's offer or the employer's 
or to determine a position in between the two which seems more 
equitable to him. But he does not have the mandate to go beyond 
that. This is very different from arbitration where the arbitrator 
has complete freedom.
<P>
	In arbitration, the arbitrator could decide on 85 cents or 59 
cents. He is free. Of course pressure is put on him, but in this 
case, it is between the two elements of the final offer. This 
means that pressure on the two parties would continue in a way 
that either of them could hope to be the winner.
<P>
	That is why we are presenting this amendment and we think 
that it preserves the labour minister's ability to act later and 
allows for use of the best conditions in the final offer. Under 
these conditions we cannot say that the final offer was tried, 
because everyone in all universities will say that the previous 
conditions were not such that the final offer could be judged.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> The amendment is in 
order.
<P>
	The debate is now on the amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Shall the amendment carry?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Chairman, this is the 
first time in a bill that all the costs of arbitration by the 
government, not arbitration in a collective agreement, are borne 
by the parties.
<P>
	I know that these are tough times, but I wonder if it would not 
have been better to propose an amendment to the code itself, 
rather than use a special law, which for the first time in such a 
case will make the two parties pay the costs.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Chairman, just as a matter of information, 
under the Canada Labour Code when grievance arbitrators 
establish such a procedure the parties to the dispute are asked to 
carry the costs on it.
<P>
	As the hon. member said, these are frugal times. As part of the 
discipline that we want to apply to parties in this dispute we 
expect that if there is a certain cost factor there that we should 
not ask the public, which has already paid an enormous cost over 
the past 10 weeks. The parties to the dispute should pay it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Chairman, I wonder if 
the minister could clarify for us what the points of the dispute 
are, what the financial differences are between the two parties. 
Reports in the press say that it is 10 cents the first year, 10 cents 
the second and a nickel for other benefits. Is that in fact the only 
thing that is at issue between the two parties at this time?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, as 
I said earlier, I do not think the floor of the House of Commons is 
the place to do the negotiations or to determine which side is 
right or wrong or who had which offer or which offer was fair or 
more realistic. I think what we are trying to establish in the 
House of Commons is a way of settling the dispute under a fair, 
honest, open, objective procedure.
<P>
	Let us let the arbitrator under this procedure make a 
determination after he gets the final offer proposals from both 
parties to determine what is proper and right in terms of a 
settlement.
<P>
	(Clause agreed to.)
<P>
	(Clause 14 agreed to.)
<P>
	On clause 15:
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
have just a brief comment. The question of fines was mentioned 
earlier by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway and I would 
like to reiterate the point on the clause in which we find this 
particular issue.
<P>
	I think the fines which are impossible by virtue of this 
particular clause, clause 15, may well be in keeping with the 
tradition of back to work legislation-I remember other 
legislation on which we had occasion to protest the stiffness of 
the fines-but I would just like to say that we find these fines 
particularly onerous.
<P>
	I find it somewhat passing strange that we can have 
legislation which comes down at least potentially very hard on 
people who may choose to disobey this particular legislation or 
may be seen to be counselling others to do it. I just wish we 
could come down this hard on a lot of other people who are doing 
a whole lot more damage to the environment, to society and 
everything else. Whenever it comes to labour relations and 
somebody might go out a day more than the strike called for or 
counselled somebody for a wildcat or to stay out one more day, 
the power of society is brought to bear with great force.
<P>
	I just wish we had the will to be as tough on polluters, 
criminals and all kinds of other people, tax evaders and 
everyone else as we do on strikers when they sometimes do out 
of anger things that are contrary to the law.
<P>
	(Clause agreed to.)
<P>
	(Clauses 16 to 19 inclusive agreed to.)
<P>
	On Clause 20:
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, with respect to the coming into force of the act, I have 
just spoken with the representatives of the longshoremen's 
union, including Mr. Westrand, the president, and they have 
indicated that it certainly would be their desire that the effective 
coming into force of the act not be before 8.30 tomorrow 
morning their time in order that they might have an opportunity 
to meet with their members. Their members start their shift 
around 5 to 5.30 in the morning.
<P>
	There has been good co-operation on this legislation. I would 
ask the minister if he would be prepared to accommodate the 
union in their return to work and in order to give them an 
opportunity to meet with their membership and, through you, 
Mr. Chairman, whether we might agree that the act come into 
force on the expiration perhaps of the sixteenth hour after the 
time at which it is assented to.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	That would facilitate the back to work arrangements of the 
members and the executive of the union.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Chairman, I could take the hon. member's 
representations but I suppose what we could do is look at time 
differences.
<P>
	If the Senate is able to get to this bill by nine o'clock tonight, 
there is a 12-hour period before the legislation comes into 
effect. I would hope that they could respond to that. However if 
it is a normal work routine, we will take that into account as long 
as it is being honoured properly.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member can give us the representation he has 
and we will consider it. We are not going to force an event 
unduly but we think 6 a.m. or 6.30 a.m. would be a proper time. 
Maybe it is a good time to start work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the minister 
would be prepared to consider an amendment that would 
substitute the word sixteenth for the word twelfth.
<P>
	This would give just a little more time and flexibility for the 
union to meet with its membership. I do not think it is an 
unreasonable request. I would hope that the minister would be 
prepared to consider that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
rather than unnecessarily accepting an amendment maybe what 
we can do is indicate that because we are settling the strike the 
employees do not have to be back at the very stroke of 6.30 a.m.
<P>
	The employer can call them back to work and they can do their 
shaping up and so on as need be. We can recognize that and not 
try to impose any enforcement action in those periods as long as 
it is done in a reasonably short time after the deadline is reached. 
I say this as a passing amendment.

<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. I have a motion that needs to be put 
before the bells ring at 5.45 p.m. I think you will find there is 
unanimous consent of the House for this motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That notwithstanding the special order of February 2, 1994, the Speaker shall 
not interrupt proceedings and put the question on second reading of Bill C-3 at 
15 minutes before the ordinary time for consideration of government business 
on this day but shall do so tomorrow, Wednesday, February 9, at no later than the 
ordinary hour of daily adjournment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of the motion is to defer the division on Bill C-3 
so that members whose speeches were interrupted this afternoon 
by this special debate will be able to make them tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will find there is 
unanimous consent of the House to dispose of third reading of 
Bill C-10 before the bells start ringing at 5.45 p.m.
<P>
	If that is the case, before the bells start to ring I have another 
motion to propose to the House dealing with the royal assent. 
But I would ask if there is unanimous consent to proceed with 
third reading at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When shall the bill be 
read the third time? By unanimous consent, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre)</B> moved that the bill 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That at the conclusion of the deferred divisions this day on government 
business No. 4, the sitting be suspended to the call of the Chair, and that when the 
sitting is resumed the sole business to be transacted shall be to attend at a royal 
assent; that when the House returns from the royal assent it shall adjourn 
forthwith until tomorrow at two o'clock p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, not 
to presume on the goodwill of the House, but on the Order Paper 
is Motion No. 5 standing under government business.
<P>
	It was the original reform motion and was superseded by a 
new one that was moved and carried with the indulgence of the 
House yesterday. The old motion is still on the Notice Paper. It 
requires the unanimous consent of the House to withdraw the 
motion standing in the name of the hon. government House 
leader. Since we have no intention of proceeding with it, to save 
printing costs and so on, I wonder if the House would give its 
consent to withdrawing government Motion No. 5.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion No. 5 withdrawn.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps it 
would meet the convenience of the House if I move that the 
sitting be suspended till 5.45 p.m. so that people do not have to 
sit here.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Shall I suspend the sitting 
until six o'clock p.m.?
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The bells are supposed to 
ring for 15 minutes starting at 6 p.m., so the vote can be held at 
6:15 p.m. With unanimous consent we could move the vote 
forward to 6 p.m. and the bells could start ringing immediately. 
Is that agreed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Does everyone understand? Instead of the bells ringing at 6 
p.m. for the vote at 6.15 p.m., we will move ahead and begin the 
bells ringing at 5.45 p.m. and the deferred vote will take place at 
6 p.m. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
The Right Honourable Jean Chrétien, P.C., M.P.<BR>
Prime Minister <BR>
House of Commons <BR>
Room 311-S, Centre Block <BR>
Ottawa, Ontario <BR>
K1A 0A6 
<P>
Dear Prime Minister, 
<P>
The purpose of this letter is to outline my serious concern over the alarming increase in cross-border crime which is occurring 
across Canada and growing on a daily basis particularly the smuggling of cigarettes, alcohol and other commodities. 
<P>
We are at a point where existing RCMP law enforcement resources are virtually incapable of turning the tide in this rapidly 
expanding problem given our other responsibilities across Canada. While seizures have increased dramatically, the extent of the 
problem has been rising at a much faster rate with the involvement of organized crime groups and as otherwise law abiding 
citizens engaged in the criminal activity through the open purchase of contraband. I am convinced that a comprehensive strategy 
is required to address the smuggling problem which goes beyond an enhanced enforcement initiative. 
<P>
What is needed, I believe, is an approach which includes enhanced enforcement, a strong communication package reflecting the 
extent of the smuggling problem as a law and order issue, enhanced public education on the health risks of smoking and a 
cigarette pricing policy which more closely reflects United States prices. This implies a need to reduce the tax on cigarettes 
significantly enough to approach parity, thereby eliminating the profit motive for smugglers. I believe we still need a moderately 
enhanced enforcement posture to remove organized networks which will continue to smuggle other commodities. 
<P>
I have not come to this conclusion lightly. Normally, an enforcement only enhancement would work but, in this case, the 
smuggling problem has become so pervasive that the number of additional resources required to resolve the problem would be 
so intrusive as to be unacceptable, both from cost effectiveness and public perception perspectives. A comprehensive approach, 
while perhaps on the surface appearing to be capitulating to the smugglers, is the most balanced and efficient way to resolve an 
issue which one could strongly argue is out of control in present circumstances. 
<P>
I would be pleased to discuss this matter in more detail, should you desire. 
<P>
Sincerely
<P>
N.D. Inkster
