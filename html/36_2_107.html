<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I notice that today we are not starting with Private 
Members' Business but with orders of the day.  I would just like 
to point out, and ask for guidance from the Chair, that this is, 
by my reckoning, the sixth time that the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge has not been available to move ahead 
with his private member's bill, which means that we will have no 
Private Members' Business today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mind if the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge cannot 
be here because of an illness, is sometimes unavoidably away or 
whatever it might be, but when it gets to the stage where we have 
gone through this six times, it means that someone else's private 
member's bill does not come forward today because a swap could 
not be made or whatever.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt, Mr. Speaker, you and the clerks have attempted to get 
us Private Members' Business today, but it does seem, in my 
opinion, to be very unfortunate when someone abuses the goodwill 
of the House and the goodwill of the Chair by continually putting 
this bill off and not dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to debate it, get on with it and have a vote on it, 
but it appears that there is some sort of strategy, that none of 
us are aware of, of putting it off indefinitely.  This is the 
sixth time now and today we have no Private Members' Business. 
The private members in the House deserve better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to reconsider what he has been doing here 
with this bill.  I would also ask the Chair to consider his 
options as to what can be done to expedite this.  It is not 
right, when we have such little time for Private Members' 
Business, that even that little time is not available to us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course this is not the first 
time this has occurred.  It has occurred with members from 
various parties where the same or a similar situation has arisen. 
However, that does not make it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that the private member's process 
that we have is not designed for a bill to come up in rotation, 
then back down again and never actually be debated.  With that in 
mind, I certainly will bring it to the attention of the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, about a year and a half or two years ago I asked 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs if it could 
devise a mechanism whereby after a certain number of times there 
would be a process whereby the bill would go the bottom of the 
list, cease to be votable or something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not be adverse to having a rule like that if members of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs want to 
have a look at it again because I agree with the sentiment 
expressed by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is a strategy or anything like that. 
Members have done this before.  Perhaps what we need is a 
mechanism to ensure that when a bill is votable it is debated or 
it ceases to be part of the votable bills so that another bill 
could become votable.  I think that would be a reasonable way to 
look at it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This particular circumstance does cause 
me some concern.  There are two issues here.  The first issue 
that I have been asked to deal with is the point brought up by 
the opposition House leader, that this particular bill has come 
up six different times.  I am quoting him on that.  Every time it 
has gone around.  I believe he is asking me to make some kind of 
a decision on this particular aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing was brought up by the government House leader. 
It was mentioned that a year and a half ago the procedure 
committee was asked to consider this problem in a more general 
form, not this specific problem, and to give us some guidance as 
to how many times a bill can come up and then go to the bottom 
again. I think this is reasonable.  I would certainly encourage 
the committee to consider this sometime soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with the first issue that was brought up.  I 
wonder if the government House leader would take it upon himself 
to ask the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge to please come to 
the House.  I would like hear what he has to say about it. After 
having heard what the hon. member has to say, I will bring a 
decision on the first part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second part, I encourage the committee to deal with the 
recurring problem.  We will take it from there.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK8">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-32, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in Parliament on February 28, 2000, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to 
address the House at third reading of Bill C-32, the budget 2000 
implementation bill.  The measures in the bill were all announced 
in the 2000 budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, the Minister of Finance reaffirmed that the 
government would observe its plan of sound financial management, 
that it would reduce taxes, and invest in abilities, knowledge 
and innovation.  This plan will make it possible for the quality 
of life of Canadians and their children to be improved. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several measures in Bill C-32 contribute to improving the 
quality of life for Canadians.  Amendments to the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act 
and the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, for example, 
will strengthen access to post-secondary education, provide 
support for health care and provide more financial assistance to 
families with children and students.  It is important that these 
particular measures be in place before the summer recess in order 
to benefit those Canadians who want and who need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a moment to provide the House with a brief overview 
of the bill.  The first announcement the Minister of Finance made 
in the 2000 budget concerned increased funding for post-secondary 
education and health care, thus reaffirming the importance the 
government attaches to these two areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 calls for a $2.5 billion increase in Canada health and 
social transfer payment for health, social programs and 
post-secondary education.  This is the fourth increase the 
government has made to the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additional funds will be distributed to the provinces and 
territories on a per capita basis and will go into a trust fund 
from which they can draw funds for four years once the bill has 
been passed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Combined with a value of tax transfers and this new supplement, 
total CHST will reach almost $31 billion in 2000-01, up from 
$29.4 billion in 1999-2000.  Put a different way, together with 
the $11.5 billion investment in the 1999 budget, the cash 
component of the CHST will reach $15.5 billion in each of the 
next four years.  That is a 25% increase in the CHST from the 
1998-99 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason to pass the bill without delay is to ensure that this 
much needed money gets into the health care system quickly to 
help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second measure in the bill concerns financial assistance to 
students. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, the Canada student loan program has 
been making post-secondary education more accessible since 1964. 
The current agreement under which financial institutions make 
loans to students on behalf of the federal government will, 
however, come to an end on July 31, 2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are debating today ensures that the Canada student 
loans program will continue to serve students after that date. 
There will be money available for student borrowers after July 31 
and there will be no interruption in service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated before, it is essential that this measure be in 
place soon so that there is money available for students who will 
need loans in September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third measure provides increased child tax benefits and 
indexed GST benefits effective July 1, 2000.  To assist families 
with the added expense of raising children, benefits under the 
Canada child tax benefit are being increased by $2.5 billion 
annually by 2004.  The government's five year goal is to bring 
the maximum Canada child tax benefit for the first child to 
$2,400 and to $2,200 for the second child by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve these goals, the Canada child tax benefit will be 
fully indexed.  The base benefit and the national child benefit 
supplement will be increased beyond indexation.  The income 
thresholds for the base benefit and the national child benefit 
supplement will be raised and the reduction rate for the base 
benefit will be lowered.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income families will benefit substantially from these 
changes.  For example, the CCTB benefit for a family with two 
children and an annual income of $60,000 will more than double, 
from $733 before the 2000 budget to $1,541 by the year 2004. This 
measure is one more reason Bill C-32 must be passed without 
delay.  Low and middle income Canadian families are depending on 
the CCTB increases and indexed GST benefits in July. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure in this bill also assists families. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 is extremely generous toward parents of newly born 
or newly adopted children, increasing the duration of parental 
leave allowed under the employment insurance program as well as 
the flexibility and accessibility of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duration of parental leave, which may be used by one parent 
or split between the two, will be raised to 35 weeks.  With 15 
weeks of maternity leave and the standard two week waiting 
period, this brings the leave related to the arrival of a child 
up to one full year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the number of insurable hours that must be worked 
to qualify for special benefits will be lowered to 600 hours from 
700 hours.  Parents will have increased flexibility to decide 
whether one or both parents will spend time at home with a new 
child, as only one waiting period per birth or adoption will be 
required instead of two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income earned while receiving parental benefits will be treated 
the same as for regular EI benefits and the Canada Labour Code 
will be amended to protect the jobs of employees in federally 
regulated workplaces during the extended parental leave period. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure will allow Canadians to further diversify their 
personal retirement savings plans. The limit on foreign property 
that can be held in registered retirement savings plans and 
other deferred income plans will be increased to 25% for 2000 
and to 30% for 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several bodies, including the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Finance, the Senate Standing Committee on Banking, 
Trade and Commerce, and the Investment Funds Institute of Canada 
have asked that this ceiling be raised. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These increases will also apply to the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board.  There is a change in Bill C-32 which directly 
affects the Canada pension plan.  The provinces are permitted to 
borrow money from the CPP under terms set out in the CPP 
legislation.  Bill C-32 responds to a request from the provinces 
that was agreed to by the federal-provincial ministers of finance 
last December as part of the CPP triennial review for a 
prepayment option for provincial CPP borrowings.  The provinces 
will now be allowed to prepay their CPP obligations in advance of 
maturity and at no cost to the CPP plan.  This will provide 
provinces which have fiscal surpluses with some flexibility to 
look for ways to reduce their debt.  It also means that more 
funds will be transferred to the CPPIB and invested in the market 
at higher expected returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international front, Bill C-32 amends the Special Import 
Measures Act, or SIMA, to bring Canadian countervailing duty laws 
into line with recent changes to the WTO subsidies agreement. 
Certain provisions in that agreement which rendered certain 
foreign subsidies immune from countervailing duty action lapsed 
last December 31. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 allows for the suspension of provisions in the Special 
Import Measures Act that implement these non-actionable subsidy 
provisions into Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will ensure that we are not treating our 
trading partners more favourably than they are treating us in 
countervailing duty investigations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two remaining measures in the bill concern first nations 
taxation and an amendment to the Excise Tax Act. 
Thirteen first nations will be allowed to levy a direct 7% 
GST-style sales tax on fuel, alcohol and tobacco products sold on 
reserve.  The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency will collect the 
sales taxes and the federal government will vacate the GST room 
where the first nation tax applies.  First nations which wish to 
follow suit in the future can be granted authorization through an 
order in council instead of a legislative amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill addresses the issue of tax evasion.  The 
Minister of National Revenue will be able to apply ex parte, in 
other words, without notice, for judicial authorization to 
proceed with assessment and collection action in instances where 
revenues may be at risk if GST and harmonized sales tax 
registrants are allowed their usual remittance period.  Until now 
the Minister of National Revenue has been powerless to proceed 
with assessment and collection action before the tax came due. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the measures included in this bill are non contentious 
and, because of three initiatives in particular, this bill 
should be passed quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that the CHST supplement be invested in the 
health network as quickly as possible. It is essential that the 
student loans program be in place by September. Finally, it is 
essential that the child tax benefits be increased and that the 
indexed GST benefits be available by the end of June. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these three measures are not enacted before the summer recess 
Canadians will suffer.  While the remaining measures are not 
facing a similar timeframe, they are nonetheless important for 
millions of Canadians and for the efficient operation of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly recommend that all hon. members give their support to 
this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right off the top I want to say that it is interesting that the 
hon. member across the way did not say that it is important to 
pass this legislation because it will give Canadians hope, 
because it will give them new opportunities or provide the 
hundreds of thousands of jobs that are necessary to help out 
people on the low end of the income scale.  He simply said that 
some benefits will be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech which my hon. friend across the way just gave speaks 
volumes about the approach of this government.  It is always 
“Let's try to manage the problem”.  It will not fundamentally 
fix it.  It will not provide people with opportunities. Instead, 
it is “Let's manage it.  Let's get it off the boil and put it on 
to simmer on the back burner”.  That characterizes the whole 
approach of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to talk about Bill C-32 in the context 
of something the Prime Minister said the other day in Germany. 
He said that the Canadian Alliance has an agenda of greed.  That 
is a serious accusation and I want to address Bill C-32 in that 
context.  If we asked ourselves what exactly does that mean, it 
becomes pretty apparent very quickly that there is a huge irony 
taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is greed?  What does it mean to be greedy?  It means taking 
something that one is not entitled to, something that one did not 
earn.  Thinking about it that way, that perfectly describes the 
government.  It is absolutely true that over the last six and a 
half years since it has been in power it has taken more and more 
money from people's pockets, money that does not belong to it. 
Truthfully, it belongs to the people who earned it.  They earned 
it by working hard.  What does the government do?  It now 
confiscates 50% of their income and, in some cases, at the 
margins people face a tax rate of 60%.  That is shameful, but it 
is what occurs under this government and it is completely 
unapologetic for it. 
That is the agenda of greed that we see in Canada.  I would argue 
that when this government taxes $7 billion a year away from 
people earning less than $20,000, that is an agenda of greed.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have those people done that they deserve to have that much 
money taxed away from them?  They have worked hard.  They may not 
have skills or education.  In some cases they may have fallen on 
hard times.  That is their crime.  For that they are punished by 
paying $7 billion a year in taxes.  It is absolutely 
unbelievable.  That does not include the taxes they pay in Canada 
pension plan premiums, which are going up, and EI premiums.  CPP 
premiums are going up far more than employment insurance premiums 
are going down.  People are paying more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about brain drain?  One of the factors which drives people 
out of the country is heavy taxation.  I would say that is an 
agenda of greed, of which this Liberal government is guilty.  The 
government is taxing people to the point where they are saying 
that the government obviously does not appreciate the fact that 
they work 50, 60 and 70 hours a week, creating, in some cases, 
hundreds of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government taxes the life out of people until they say “Why 
should I pay these high taxes?”  They do not mind paying taxes 
that are maybe a quarter or a third of their income, but why 50% 
or 60%?  That is what happens to some people at the margins in 
Canada today.  That is greed.  It is greed when the government 
takes money that it is not entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is greedy when the government puts people in the 
position in which both parents have to work.  How many times have 
we in this place heard people say “If I had a choice, I would 
stay at home with the kids.  That is what I would prefer to do. 
That is a choice that I would like to have”.  The government 
taxes people so heavily today that both parents have to work, one 
just to pay the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the definition of greed.  If the Prime Minister wants to 
look for an agenda of greed, he should look at his own agenda.  It 
is an agenda of greed when people are taxed that heavily to 
support the government.  It is not like people are getting great 
services for the money they send to the Minister of Finance and 
the Prime Minister.  Consider the human resources development 
scandal.  What happens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have $7 billion a year that comes from people making less 
than $20,000 a year.  A good chunk of that goes to a department 
like human resources development, and a good chunk of that money 
goes to things that are, to be charitable, questionable 
activities.  Consider all the money that is poured into the 
coffers of people who are great political supporters of the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not like there is some objective process that people have 
to go through to get this money.  We know, for instance, that in 
the Prime Minister's riding, because of political pressure, all 
kinds of grants to friends of the Prime Minister were approved. 
These people then gave money back to the Prime Minister for his 
campaign.  Now we have four police investigations in the Prime 
Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an agenda of greed.  The government takes $7 billion 
from the lowest income Canadians and then gives it to its 
political cronies, who then give it back in the form of campaign 
contributions.  That is an agenda of greed.  If there is anyone 
guilty of greed, it is the Prime Minister and this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time that we pulled the mask off and revealed the 
Prime Minister and government members for what they are.  They 
are people who too often use the tools of government to push 
their own political ends.  That is fundamentally wrong.  Many of 
us were sent to this House to change that, to turn it around.  It 
is absolutely disgusting how the Prime Minister can say with a 
straight face that the Canadian Alliance has an agenda of greed. 
That is ridiculous.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our purpose in this place is to allow people to keep more of the 
money they earn.  That is why we are promoting the tax proposals 
we are pushing today like solution 17.  We are saying that people 
should be able to keep the huge majority of the money they make 
and send in enough to ensure that we have a good health care 
system in Canada and that we can provide for pensions and things 
people really value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we should be using government for, not ripping off 
taxpayers to push the blatant political ends of people in 
government.  That happens all too often.  I resent very much the 
Prime Minister saying that we have an agenda of greed when it is 
so clear that everything the Liberals do is calculated to take 
more money out of people's pockets to further their own ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in a concept of justice that says we are entitled to 
what we work for and obtain honestly.  That describes 90% of the 
people in the country.  The massive majority of people in Canada 
work hard, are honest and are willing to pay their fair share of 
taxes.  They do not want to pay a whole bunch of taxes for 
unscrupulous activities.  We have seen that too often in the 
government.  It is time for it to come to an end.  People may say 
it is fine for me to say all this but that I should back it up 
and explain what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know for how many months we have been pursuing the 
human resources minister about the boondoggle in human resources 
development which is obviously guilty of gross incompetence, 
political pork barrelling and patronage on a scale that is 
without precedent.  I do not think we have seen anything this bad 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the transitional jobs fund or the Canada jobs 
fund.  The Liberals change names to try to hide what they are 
doing.  If that is not one of the most obvious examples of 
milking taxpayers to fund political patronage, I do not know what 
is.  Even the human resources development committee has said that 
this program does not seem to have any criteria.  It seems to 
have a pot of money that allows the minister carte blanche and 
members across the way carte blanche to fund their ridings, their 
friends and the projects they personally support in an attempt to 
lever themselves back into power.  It is disgraceful.  It has 
reached the point where even the Liberal chair of the committee 
brings down a report saying that it has to come to an end and 
recommending breaking up the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary says that Bill C-32 is good because 
it will enhance a GST credit and do this and that.  Those guys do 
not get it.  There is a much bigger picture. There is no vision 
across the way.  The Liberals simply ad hoc their way through 
parliament.  It is time for some fundamental changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will ask if we are really in bad shape.  Yes, we are and 
I want to talk about it for a moment.  Three weeks ago a report 
came down from Standard & Poor's DRI Canada which had the 
audacity to point out a pretty startling fact about which the 
government should be embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report pointed out that the people in the poorest U.S. 
state, Mississippi, have more disposable income per capita than 
the people of Alberta, the wealthiest Canadian province.  I would 
think that would be something government members would be 
concerned about.  If they want to talk about an agenda of greed, 
how is it that Canada, with its human and natural resources, can 
be in a position where the amount of money people have left over 
after the government is done with them is lower than that of the 
poorest American state, Mississippi?  How did that happen?  Is it 
right that it should happen? 
The money that people have left over to pay for food, shelter and 
clothing is diminished to the point where there is less in our 
wealthiest province than in the poorest American state, 
Mississippi.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speaks volumes about who really has an agenda of greed in 
Canada.  It is the government across the way.  The only reason 
that happens is because of public policy decisions.  The 
government has decided that the best approach is to tax the hide 
off people.  Then it will decide what is good for folks.  With 
half the income people earn and the government gets to keep, it 
will decide what is good for them.  It will spend it for them. We 
see it spent on all kinds of foolish projects.  We see it spent 
ineffectively.  We see it spent on things that people do not 
want.  We see it spent on things that are contrary to the values 
of the people it takes the money from in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a situation today where people in Canada are seeing 
their standard of living eroded and eroded and eroded.  I have 
given many speeches in this place on this point.  It has a lot to 
do with the government's contempt for people who are 
entrepreneurs, who risk their life savings to start businesses 
and who are innovative.  I believe it is contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister talked in Germany about the superior values 
of the Liberal Party and how it cares more.  That is a joke.  It 
is ridiculous.  As I just pointed out, we are in a situation 
where the government takes $7 billion a year from people making 
less than $20,000.  How can it say that it cares more?  If it 
wants to have an election on that issue, I say bring it on.   Let 
us have a contest, an election on that.  Let us let the people 
decide if it is compassionate and caring to take $7 billion from 
people who make less $20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it really compassionate and caring to tax people so heavily 
that both parents have to work, not because they want to work? 
According to every poll I have seen, 70% of two income families 
today said that if they had their druthers one parent would be at 
home with the children.  They do not have the option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it compassionate to entrench in the tax system a double 
standard when it comes to taxation of families?  A two income 
family pays a lot less taxes than a single income family earning 
the same amount of money.  That is the government's approach.  It 
is doublespeak.  It hopes that people will simply look at the 
sound bite and not observe what it really does.  As a result, 
people get more and more cynical about politics, and the 
government wonders why fewer people come out to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a day of reckoning.  I hope we have an election 
campaign on the issue of Liberal values or social values.  The 
record of the government is reprehensible.  It has done more 
damage than just about any government I can think of in recent 
memory in Canada.  I do not think there has been a government 
that has damaged the public more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider that over the next five years we will probably 
run a surplus of about $150 billion.  The government's approach 
is to jack up spending even higher, with more and more money 
going into more programs even though they have huge problems, not 
only in human resources development but in other departments like 
industry where there are billions of dollars in corporate 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the department of Indian affairs which is full of 
problems.  I see the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development is here.  We send billions of dollars into Indian 
affairs every year, and what do we get for it?  We get 70% 
unemployment on Indian reserves.  We see suicide rates that are 
through the roof.  There are substance abuse problems that are 
unbelievable.  Very little money gets beyond the band council 
level to rank and file natives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to drive spending through the roof. 
It will take more and more money from people to fund all kinds of 
programs that do not work.  I would say that is an agenda of 
greed.  When people take money that does not belong to them, when 
they take more than their share of the pie, that is greed.  That 
is unjust.  We see it over and over again from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 nods a bit toward things like reducing taxes, but on 
the other hand the government is ripping more money out of 
people's pockets.  It gives back a little with one hand and takes 
more and more with the other.  It is this duplicitous approach 
that makes people cynical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are probably wondering about Canada's position in 
the world after six and a half years of this approach to 
government.  People say that the economy is moving along fairly 
strongly and that unemployment is down to under 7%.  That is 
pretty good, but why is it not good enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the point that we should not be mesmerized by the recent 
strong growth in the economy.  While we all welcome strong growth 
in the economy we must remember there are two types of growth. 
There is the type of growth that is premised on strong 
productivity.  There is also the type of growth that is premised 
on a workforce that is producing more and more and generating 
more opportunities.  Then there is the type of growth that we get 
by allowing our dollar to sink to ever lower values by basically 
cheapening ourselves to the point where we in that way attract 
more investment into the country.  That is the approach the 
government has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 25 years we have seen a decline in the Canadian 
dollar.  There is no better indicator of the health of an economy 
than the strength of its dollar.  It tells us how we are doing 
relative to the rest of the world, and certainly in this case 
relative to the United States.  We measure ourselves, I think 
rightfully, against the United States.  We used to have a 
superior standard of living than that country.  According to just 
about everyone, including the government's own industry minister, 
our standard of living has now fallen dramatically as against 
that of the Americans.  I encourage people to remember we are a 
country that is blessed with uncommon resources.  We have 
tremendous resources, human and natural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that we have seen this decline in our standard of 
living and this decline in our dollar?  It has a lot to do with 
the sanguine approach of Liberal governments over the last many 
years and their rah-rah attitude:   “We are number one in the 
world.  We will spend our way out of this problem.  Let us wrap 
ourselves in the flag.  The other guys are bad because they want 
to cut taxes”.  We have seen that over and over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that investors see through all that stuff and ask 
what is really being done to keep the economy competitive.  They 
look at the statistics.  They see that our disposable income 
continues to fall relative to that of the United States.  Now, as 
I pointed out, our wealthiest province has lower after tax income 
than the poorest American state.  They look at things like our 
productivity.  What is happening with Canadian productivity?  We 
know that it has improved a bit lately.  However we also know 
that it is falling further and further behind that of the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember there is only an imaginary line between Canada 
and the United States and its public policy differences.  That is 
what explains why the U.S. economy is doing so much better than 
ours.  Why is it that in Canada today manufacturers and people in 
the industrial sector are investing about 30% less on equipment 
and machinery than they are in the United States?  Why is it that 
we are in a situation today where we have much less spending on 
research and development in Canada than in the United States? 
Why is it that we are in a situation where the new economy in 
Canada is producing fewer opportunities for people in terms of 
high tech start-ups?

there were exactly four initial public offerings for Internet 
companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange. At the same time in the 
United States there were 165.  It has 10 times the population.  I 
could understand if it had 40, 45 or even 50 more IPOs, but there 
were 165 IPOs in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is we are falling behind in that new wealth 
creating sector that is symbolized by the Internet. Canadians are 
leaving the country in droves to go to the United States.  A 
recent report from Statistics Canada said that many of the people 
who we educate here are going to the United States, particularly 
in the medical field.  It talked about doctors and nurses leaving 
in droves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government uses the soothing balm of saying yes, but people 
are coming in from outside Canada to fill some of those slots. 
This is where its thinking is so short term and superficial. 
Instead of replacing those people with people who in some cases 
are fleeing horrible regimes elsewhere, would it not be better if 
we were a net winner of brain gain instead of suffering from 
brain drain, where we are losing all those people in the first 
place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much sense does it make to educate people at huge expense to 
the taxpayers only to see them go to the United States and other 
countries around the world?  It is crazy and ridiculous that the 
government says it is not a problem, do not worry about it.  It 
speaks to the sanguine, carefree and even careless attitude of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could point to so many other things to demonstrate that the 
government is reckless and careless when it comes to managing the 
economy.  There is the falling dollar and falling productivity 
relative to the U.S., the falling standard of living and the 
output per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most amazing statistics I have come across is the one 
that indicates our output per capita between 1988 and 1998. 
Canada's output per capita over that 10 year period grew by 5%. 
What is the significance of that?  What is output per capita? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Output per capita is how much on average each person produces 
for the economy.  Why is that important?  That is what determines 
our standard of living.  The more we produce per person in an 
economy, the better the standard of living, the more money people 
will have, the more money people can use to look after things 
that are important to them and their families, the more money 
ultimately that people pay in taxes to the government to fund 
things that people care about, such as health care and higher 
education, those sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that 10 year period ours grew by 5%.  That is all.  In 
the same period, France saw its standard of living, its output 
per capita, grow three times faster.  Most people would say that 
France really does not strike them as a country that is at the 
leading edge when it comes to wealth production but it grew three 
times faster than Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia grew four times faster.  The U.S. grew four times 
faster.  Norway grew six times faster.  And Ireland?  It grew 18 
times faster than Canada.  Why was that?  Is it because Ireland 
has more resources than Canada?  I do not think so.  Is it 
because it is in a situation where it has much better educated 
people?  Hardly.  I think we are fifth in the world for spending 
on education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We produce some of the best educated people in the world. The 
fact that we are so often raided by the United States and other 
countries to pick those people off is a testament to that. What 
is the difference?  Why are we falling so far behind relative to 
the rest of the world?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big reasons is that in Canada the taxes are way too 
high.  Taxes basically shut down initiative.  They send a message 
to people who are really ambitious or who are prepared to risk a 
lot of money to get their ideas off the ground, the government 
tells them to get out of here, that they are not wanted.  People 
will be punished for the crime of trying to create jobs and 
produce new products and come up with new ideas.  People are 
fleeing in droves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our output per capita is so pale compared to that of 
our trading partners around the world.  That has to turn around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister uses a balm and medicates himself with such 
slogans as the Canadian Alliance has an agenda of greed, when it 
is precisely the government that has the agenda of greed. 
Nothing will get better as long as those guys are where they are. 
Things have to turn around. The government has to be replaced. 
The Liberals have to be thrown out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have to get the message that the Canadian Alliance will 
allow people to keep more of the money they earn.  That is not 
greed; it is justice.  That is being a government that is 
respectful of the work, effort and risk people take simply to 
make a living, to try to get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to throw off some of the ridiculous slogans we hear 
from the Prime Minister and really look at the record. How do we 
do that?  How do we turn things around? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing is to have some honest discussion with people. 
We do not try to medicate the public with slogans about Canada 
being number one and attack people who have other ideas simply 
because he chooses not to agree with them.  We sit down and 
address the hard issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the hard issues?  We have to ask how good a job is 
being done with the money the public already sends in.  Is a good 
job being done?  The answer is no.  The government is doing a 
lousy job.  Health care is broken.  Human resources is broken. 
Indian affairs is broken.  Transport is broken.  Defence is 
broken.  Justice is broken.  They all have to be fixed.  Let us 
go in there, take the money that is currently being spent and use 
it more wisely so that people get good results for the money that 
is being spent.  That is the first thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what do we do with the $150 billion in surpluses that 
will come our way over the next five years?  The first thing is 
to recognize that Canadians are among the highest taxed people in 
the western world.  Income taxes are around 50% higher than the 
G-7 average.  Those taxes have to come down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people at the low end who are taxed to the point where they 
can hardly feed themselves should not be paying taxes.  People at 
the middle should get a huge tax break. People at the upper end 
should get a big tax break too because we want them here.  We 
want to keep them here.  We do not want to drive them out.  We 
want them here.  They will pay taxes and put people to work.  But 
the government loves to engage in the demagoguery that suggests 
if people at the high end of the income scale get some kind of 
tax break, it is bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that the real agenda of greed is the one that 
comes from the government.  It seems to want to tax every loose 
penny it can find in everybody's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Except the Bronfmans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  “Except the Bronfmans”, as my friend in 
the NDP said, but it goes beyond that.  It goes beyond that 
because what we see is a government that not only taxes every 
cent it can find, but then it sends the money to all its friends 
in what I hope is a vain attempt to lever itself back into power 
in the next election campaign.  I hope Canadians throw out the 
Liberals for that insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to put an end to that crazy way of doing politics. 
Let us leave that money in people's pockets.  Let us show people 
the respect they deserve.  Let us allow them to maintain the 
dignity that goes with being able to feed our own families.  That 
is something people should ask for and expect as a bare minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would we do it?  The Canadian Alliance says to go through 
the envelope of spending that currently exists.  Get rid of the 
pork barrelling and patronage and put it into things that people 
care about, such as higher education and health care.  Let us fix 
the military.  Let us do something with the justice system.  Let 
us get the bare essentials fixed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us give people a big tax break.  We are advocating a tax 
plan which would see the basic and merit exemptions pushed up to 
$10,000 each and a $3,000 per child deduction for every family in 
Canada with children 16 years of age and under.  Right off the 
bat that would mean a family of four would have $26,000 of tax 
exempt income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that we would tax people at a rate of only 17%. Everyone 
would be taxed at 17%. That is it.  People would say, “I finally 
get the sense that maybe I am now being taxed fairly.  I am being 
allowed to keep the majority of my money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would have a wonderful impact when it comes to attracting 
investment and talent back into Canada.  By virtue of cutting the 
top rates from 29% and 26% down to 17%, the capital gains rate 
would fall down to around 20%.  That would be the total rate, 
20%, federal and provincial combined. This would be a wonderful 
incentive for people to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would mean that we would catapult ahead of the United States, 
Ireland, the U.K. and Japan.  We would start to attract 
investment and put more people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who suffers when we have an unemployment rate of almost 7%?  Is 
it people who have skills?  I do not think so.  Is it people who 
have education, who come from a good background?  No, it is 
people at the low end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister wants to talk about values.  Why does he not 
put in place an investment climate which would ensure that 
business would come to Canada to the point where so many 
companies would be looking to hire people that people without 
skills and education would be sought after? Why is Canada in a 
situation today where for every job there are three people 
chasing after it?  Why not reverse that? Why not have three jobs 
chasing every person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the remarkable things about what has happened in the U.S. 
is the economy is so hot there that many companies cannot find 
workers so they have set up in what are traditionally known as 
ghettos.  They said to the people, “We know you do not have 
skills.  We know you do not have an education.  Some of you have 
been on welfare your whole lives.  But we are coming to your 
community because we need workers.  We will give you on the job 
training.  We will give you skills.  We will give you 
opportunity”.  They get experience and contacts.  And they get 
the dignity that goes with being able to look after themselves 
and to buy food for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the great benefit of an economy which moves at its 
capacity.  The government seems to think Canada's economy is 
wonderful if unemployment is barely under 7%.  We have to do way 
better than that if we want to help all Canadians. The government 
is not doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what solution 17 would do.  It would get the economy 
moving rapidly and would allow everyone to have a chance to have 
a job, and the opportunities and dignity which go with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the parliamentary secretary gave his speech on Bill C-32, 
he said that we must pass this right away so people could get 
enhanced GST credits before the summer.  That is nice, but would 
it not be better to have opportunities and jobs that pay good 
wages instead? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening in the U.S.  I hate to keep referring 
to the U.S., but we used to be on par with it when it came to the 
standard of living.  I do not understand why the government wants 
to play second fiddle to the U.S.  Why does it think that is 
good? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear the proud nationalism coming from the other side, but 
the Liberals are content to allow the Americans to eat our lunch. 
Well I am not and the Canadian Alliance is not.  We think that 
investment belongs in Canada.  Those jobs belong in Canada. 
People need more than a GST credit cheque.  They need jobs.  They 
need the disposable income and the opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are tired of the middling busy work approach from across the 
way.  It is time for a fundamental change in Canada, a change 
which will allow us to shoot to the front of the pack instead of 
falling further and further behind, as we have done for the last 
20 years. 
That is just not good enough.  It is time to turn it around.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that if there is anybody in this place 
who is guilty of an agenda of greed, it is the Prime Minister and 
this government.  They show absolutely no compunction about 
taking more and more money out of people's pockets and spending 
it on things that people do not care about or, in some cases, 
things that I think are unscrupulous, things that benefit the 
Liberals to their political ends.  That is an agenda of greed. 
That is what has to come to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge people across the country who are watching this to help 
us bring an end to that by throwing the government out.  We have 
an election coming in the next year.  Let us get rid of that 
government.  Let us put in place a government that respects the 
hard work of the taxpayers and is willing to allow them to keep 
that money so that they can maintain their dignity and look after 
their own families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put in place a government that will stay out of the lives 
of taxpayers, that will quit interfering in their lives and allow 
them to raise their children as they see fit.  That is what the 
Canadian Alliance wants.  The only way to make it happen is to 
elect an Alliance government and get rid of the scoundrels across 
the way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak to the House on Bill C-32. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind our viewers that this is an act to implement the budget 
of February 28, which we are to pass so the government may make 
certain expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say right off that the budget the Minister of Finance 
presented on February 28 provided for surpluses of some $95.5 
billion for the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logically we should be 
delighted.  We should say “If the government is accumulating 
surpluses for the next five years, we are a long way from the 
budget cuts that were made to eliminate the deficit.  We are a 
long way from the situation in which we had a deficit of $42 
billion during the years of the Conservative government under Mr. 
Mulroney”.  Initially this looks like good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have to point out, with all due respect, that it does 
not represent good news if indeed the government will be raking 
in some $95 billion in the coming five years—it may in fact 
represent a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before becoming an MP, I had the opportunity to be a city 
councillor.  I am a resident of Boischatel on the côte de 
Beaupré and I had the opportunity of sitting on the municipal 
council for seven years.  I will draw an analogy, and it is very 
relevant to the situation we are in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that when I served as councillor between 1987 and 1993 
until my election as the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans we had budget 
surpluses in certain years.  I can still see the mayor of the 
time busting his britches and saying “We were good managers; we 
have a surplus”.  I am sorry, but what I am saying applies to 
the Minister of Finance as well.  If a government accumulates 
surpluses shamelessly, it means that it is accumulating them 
because it is overtaxing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government should tax according to its needs, rather than 
giving way, as this Liberal government has done, to an impulse 
to overtax and to reduce the income of certain classes of 
society.  We will come back to this, but this is the point I 
wished to make:  a $95 billion surplus over the next five years 
is hardly good news.  It means that this government is cutting 
too deep and taxing too heavily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government were realistic, it would set taxes at a 
reasonable level, so that taxpayers could breathe a little 
easier. 
They will not breathe any easier with the small tax cuts 
expected up until 2004.  On the contrary, Canadians are still 
heavily taxed by international standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have this to say to the Minister of Finance, the member for 
LaSalle—Émard, “If you have a $95 billion surplus, if you think 
you are so great, you should be able to do something about the 
real problems”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about a real problem, one which continues to drag 
on while this government, as usual, does nothing—I am referring 
to the increase in the price of gas.  The present situation in 
Canada, particularly in Quebec, is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that in addition to GST this government 
collects an excise tax on every litre of gas sold.  This excise 
tax is 10 cents per litre of gas at the pump, and 4 cents per 
litre of diesel fuel.  If this government has a $95 billion 
surplus, if it is crowing about how wonderful it is, let it 
immediately suspend the excise tax, in order to give taxpayers 
and consumers a little breathing space and slow down the 
inflationary trend resulting from recent increases in the price 
of gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois transport critic, I am regularly in touch 
with trucking associations, owners of bus companies, and owners 
of school and other buses.  These people, particularly the 
truckers, are all telling us that they have no choice but to 
pass on to consumers the increase in the price of gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, when young couples building new homes order 
landfill, or topsoil for their yards so as to start a lawn, the 
trucker will have no choice but to pass these costs on to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intercity carriers, who are barely making a profit at 
present, will have no choice but to pass these costs on to the 
consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example would be companies shipping goods by road.  If 
shipping costs rise, the costs of the goods will rise as well. 
This shows the whole inflationist spiral the recent rise in gas 
prices has triggered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Bloc Quebecois calling for immediate suspension of 
this tax?  To give companies a bit of a chance to catch their 
breath until prices get back to a reasonable level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member in this House, as well as those watching us at 
home, knows that the average cost of a litre of gasoline at the 
pump in Quebec was about 54.9 cents in February 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone finds gas prices far too high.  Some people have made 
what in my opinion is a logical and normal choice: to use public 
transportation.  In major cities, one sees growing numbers of 
people on in-line skates, or taking the bus or subway.  There are 
people who have decided that, because of the atmospheric 
pollution caused by automobile emissions, they are going to do 
their part by choosing not to use their cars to get to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine, but there are people who have no choice. Those who 
are faced with these gasoline price increases are telling us “It 
makes no sense, we are getting poorer by going to work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1999, when the price at the pump was 54.9 cents a 
litre, no one was saying that it was too much. It had reached an 
acceptable level, given inflation and people's incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I left my riding of Beauport to come here and I 
stopped in Montreal, where a litre of gas costs 84.9 cents. 
There is a huge difference, 30 cents a litre, between the price 
of 54 cents in February 1999 and today's price of 84 cents, in 
early June 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government claims that it is compassionate and that it 
respects consumers. It keeps repeating that it listens to 
Canadians, 
but which group of Canadians does it listen to? It listens to 
the big contributors to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government is listening to ordinary people, it should 
decide to immediately remove the excise tax, which accounts for 
10 cents per litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois raised another point regarding gasoline 
prices, namely the government's laxness regarding competition. 
This government is not doing anything to promote competition. 
Canada is the only country, relative to the United States, that 
lets companies be refiners, distributors and retailers at the 
same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether these companies are called Petro-Canada, Esso or Irving, 
they all have their own refineries. They get a margin of profit 
at the refinery. 
They send this gasoline to their own distributors and therefore 
get the profit from the distribution.  Then they send the 
distributors' gasoline to the retailers.  They have their own 
network of service stations—and so they rake in more profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who ends up paying?  Who pays the totally unacceptable gasoline 
prices, like the 84.9 cents a litre they are paying in the 
Montreal region?  Does anyone in this House think this is 
acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> This allows the big companies to report 
record profits.  Things are not going well.  The price of 
gasoline has reached 84 cents a litre, and the companies are 
announcing record profits.  In addition to making record 
profits, the companies are announcing massive layoffs. 
In addition to making more money, they are going to get rid 
of people so they can make even more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that acceptable in a free and democratic society 
such as Canada?  Absolutely not.  The Minister of Industry will 
say “But this is not our fault.  This is a worldwide phenomenon 
with the prices of OPEC, with the Arabs, Kuwait, the producing 
countries and Venezuela”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we in the Bloc Quebecois are saying that it is time 
to do some housekeeping.  It is time to look and see if there is 
perhaps a bit of incest in the relations among the companies. 
We should ask the Competition Bureau to do this, but, in the 
meantime, the government ought to free us, by cutting the excise 
tax by 10 cents a litre now, to provide the time necessary to 
look into the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House last Thursday or Friday, the Minister of Finance 
said that the Minister of Industry had commissioned a study.  Do 
people realize when this study will be made public?  The 
Minister of Industry has ordered that it be released by the end 
of the year—December 31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance promised us wonderful tax cuts.  “My 
February 28, 2000 budget,” he proudly told us “contains tax cuts 
for 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004”.  Right now, with the recent 
increase in the price of gasoline and the price of energy in 
general, we can see that, if something is not done immediately, 
any gains from these tax cuts will be completely wiped out for 
certain categories of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable.  The left hand is promising tax 
cuts and the right hand—not that there is one—is doing nothing. 
With the increase in the price of gasoline and energy, the 
upshot is that any gains from these tax cuts will be completely 
wiped out until 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of talk about gasoline.  This inflationary spiral 
will have an impact on many industries.  I mentioned the 
transportation sector, so food transported by truck, but there 
are a number of industries using petroleum-based products that 
will have to pass on price hikes to consumers.  I will give an 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and the members for Témiscamingue, Lotbinière and Sherbrooke, 
all of us representing the Bloc Quebecois, visited 21 ridings in 
Quebec.  We travelled to all regions and held press conferences, 
offering information specific to each of the regions we visited. 
We were able to note how much change there had been in prices at 
the pump between February 1999 and when we made our tour in 
March and April 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some service stations we held press conferences.  The press 
conference I particularly remember, however, was the one at a 
greenhouse in Rivière-des-Mille-Îles.  One tends to forget that the 
entire greenhouse industry is heavily dependent on energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the time when we are preparing our yards and putting in 
our summer plantings, and the nursery owner, who grows potted 
plants in his greenhouses, told us what the increase in fuel oil 
meant to his costs.  This was a small grower. 
At the present time, the major producers have the opportunity to 
heat with natural gas, but operators of small or medium 
businesses who are trying to earn a living do not have the means 
to convert to natural gas.  They are still dependent on fuel 
oil, the price of which has risen in leaps and bounds over the 
past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This greenhouse operator told us “I have two choices.  Either I 
keep prices at last year's level, and assume the increased cost 
of fuel oil, or I try to pass the increase on to the customer. 
If I do that, I have to compete with the major American chains, 
which have the opportunity of buying in bulk, so they can really 
slash their prices.  There is no certainty that I will be able 
to make it through this coming summer”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The rise in heating oil prices was mentioned in his case, but 
there is also a rise in the cost of styrofoam containers. 
Styrofoam is a petroleum based product.  Styrofoam suppliers, 
such as Cascade in the Drummondville region or in the Kingsey 
Falls region, which produce styrofoam flats and plastics of all 
kinds, polyethylenes, will be hit with an unavoidable price 
increase.  Farm producers will either absorb it or pass it on to 
consumers.  The wheel keeps turning, and the same consumers, 
the same taxpayers, take the blow.  This government, with its 
surplus of $95 billion, should do something about the increase 
in the price of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second aspect I would like to cover, which advanced somewhat 
last week, is Bill C-205, which I introduced in order to enable 
mechanics to deduct the cost of their tools.  The debate has 
gone on in this House for some ten years.  It involves a job 
category, a category of employees, vehicle technicians, who earn 
on average $29,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt, Mr. Speaker, you have a car as I do and when you go to 
a service station or to a dealer's you can see how vehicle 
technicians, more commonly known as mechanics, are members of a 
category of employees that work very hard.  Sometimes they have 
to work in very difficult conditions.  Their work is very 
physically demanding. 
Most of the time they work on concrete floors, in high humidity 
areas, under vehicles from which water, oil and slush drip in 
their faces in the middle of winter. These people work in areas 
where oil, dust, noise and toxic fumes are the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tabled Bill C-205 because some people told me about this 
issue. Let me say from the outset that I am not an expert on 
automobiles. I am not a car buff. I have a hard time just 
putting oil in my car engine, but luckily I have a good mechanic 
who does it for me. Some colleagues have asked me “Why are you 
tabling this bill? Is your father or your brother a mechanic?” 
Not at all. It is simply a matter of common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During an election campaign, or whenever we try to be receptive 
to people's concerns, we talk to ordinary people, to workers. We 
do not only talk to millionaires. On a typical day, a member of 
parliament is likely to meet many more hard-working, low-income 
people than he or she will meet millionaires or billionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is through these encounters that I was made aware of this 
issue. Workers in the automobile industry told me “It does not 
make sense; other categories of workers, including musicians, 
chainsaw operators and dentists, can deduct the cost of the 
tools required in their employment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I tabled Bill C-205 which, incidentally, was voted 
on on Tuesday. I want to take this opportunity to thank hon. 
members and to congratulate them for doing so. 
There were 229 members in the House and 218 of them, from all 
parties, voted in favour of a bill introduced by a Bloc 
Quebecois member.  I said from the outset that this was a bill 
that transcended party lines.  This was not a debate between 
federalists and sovereignists; it was not a debate about Quebec 
versus the rest of Canada.  It was simply a matter of common 
sense and fairness with respect to people whose work is 
physically very demanding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the 217 colleagues who voted with me to get this bill 
through second reading stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are a seasoned parliamentarian, as well as an 
expert in constitutional law.  You know that a bill from a 
private member, an opposition member to boot, rarely makes it 
past second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore that 11 Liberal members voted against the bill, but 
they will have to live with their decision.  Votes on private 
members' bills are free votes, with members voting according to 
their conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these 11 Liberal members are visiting service stations and 
automobile concessions during the next election campaign, I hope 
that they are given a polite reception by the mechanics, who 
work very hard in these establishments, but they will have to 
explain to these mechanics in person why they voted against my 
Bill C-205.  They will have to live with their decision.  That 
is not my problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will have to be considered in the Standing Committee 
on Finance before it can come back to the House at third 
reading.  I hope that the next election, which is expected this 
fall, will not kill this bill on the order paper. I hope that 
the government will give the bill top priority so that it can be 
passed before the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four year legal mandate is up on June 2, 2001.  Last Friday 
it had only been three years since we were elected. 
Let us keep in mind that, in Canada, the legal, normal and usual 
mandate is four years and that, under the Canadian Constitution, 
up to five years are allowed before an election is called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there is a tax cost related to this bill to 
allow mechanics to deduct the cost of their tools.  It is true 
that this is going to cost the government money, but the 
Minister of Finance is bragging of having a $95 billion surplus 
over the next five years.  I believe he has the financial and 
budgetary possibilities of accepting this bill, which would 
enable automobile mechanics to finally be recognized for their 
true value and to be allowed to deduct the cost of the tools 
required for their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that my purpose in tabling this bill was to 
help young men and women who are just finishing school. 
There are, unfortunately, not many young women working as 
mechanics but I believe that, as our society changes, it will be 
less and less a male-only trade, and we will see more and more 
girls choosing this profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another purpose of this bill was to give young people the chance 
of getting a job.  When a young person finishes school, he usual 
has debts because of his studies.  He then goes to a car dealer 
or a garage looking for work and the boss is going to ask him, 
for a certainty, “Do you have your tools?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the most basic tool set runs between $3,000 and 
$5,000.  There is no certainty that a young person just 
finishing school, with debts to begin with, is going to have 
that kind of money, and there is also no certainty that his 
parents will be in a position to help him either. 
Any set of tools that are the least bit specialized can run up 
to $30,000, $35,000 or $40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility of deducting the cost of tools would also be a 
recognition by this government of its desire to really give 
young people a chance and the opportunity to find work.  I think 
the Minister of Finance ought to give some thought to this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another private member's bill I introduced, which may involve 
some financial commitment by the government, concerns employment 
insurance benefits.  Over the years, the government has 
accumulated surpluses in the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois contend that, since 1993, this surplus 
has not belonged to the government, but rather to the employees 
who contribute to employment insurance every week from their pay 
cheques and to their employers, who also pay employment 
insurance contributions, the employer's share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider that the surplus of over $31 billion in the 
employment insurance fund—and I am sure that there is more than 
that today—belongs to the workers, and thus the unemployed, and 
to the employers.  The employer's contribution to unemployment 
insurance should be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last break, I visited many businesses in the Beauport 
industrial park in my riding.  People said to me “Mr. Guimond, 
we could create jobs if we could reduce certain payroll costs, 
employment insurance contributions, for example”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I took my degree in industrial relations, we talked about 
fringe benefits.  Today, we call them benefits.  Let me say in 
passing that these benefits are less and less fringe benefits, a 
name that is no longer acceptable.  Now we talk about benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the employer pays between 30% and 35% of benefits.  An 
employee hired today costs 35 cents for every dollar the 
employer pays in salary, even before he has worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many SMB owners say “Lower the payroll taxes, lower the 
contributions to employment insurance, and we will create jobs”. 
This is all the more appropriate in the context of today's 
budget surplus of $31 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I introduced my private member's bill and I can 
hardly wait for it to be debated in this House.  I can hardly 
wait to hear what all my colleagues from all parties on both 
sides of the House have to say on the matter.  I want students 
excepted from having to pay employment insurance contributions, 
to have the option of not paying them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When students do not work enough to qualify for employment 
insurance, why should they have to contribute if they hold a 
summer job? We currently have students here. They will begin to 
work soon, or they did at the end of April or in early May. 
These students will pay employment insurance contributions. In 
September, when they go back to school, they will not be able to 
get employment insurance benefits, because they will be full 
time students. Since they will not be able to look for full time 
work either, they will not qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill I tabled is designed to allow these students, if they 
think that they will not work long enough to qualify for 
employment insurance or that they will have too many hours in 
class in September, to be exempted from having to contribute to 
the EI program. Such contributions are an indirect tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these young people have more money available when they are 
working, it indirectly alleviates their parents' burden. If, 
instead of getting $195 net per week, a student takes home $210 
or $212, he will have more money in his pockets and be more 
financially independent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in turn means that the parents will not have to shell out 
as much money for a bus pass or a pair of sneakers when classes 
resume in September. This is the reasoning behind the bill. I do 
hope that the government, which boasts about a $95.5 billion 
budget surplus over the next five years, will listen to the 
public, particularly since the Prime Minister plans to call an 
election soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My 40 minutes are running out quickly. I could have talked about 
the lack of measures in the February 28, 2000, budget to truly 
fight poverty. I cannot understand the Minister of Finance, who 
claims to sympathize with the poor and to understand them. 
Maybe that is true.  Even though he has led a very sheltered 
life, even though we know he has a bank account big enough to 
buy out most members here, to buy us all out, he tells us he 
understands the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the Minister of Finance is the former 
president and owner of Canada Steamship Lines, one of the 
largest shipping companies.  He is therefore a prosperous 
shipowner, a fellow with money coming out his ears, whose 
company, Canada Steamship Lines, registers its boats abroad in 
tax havens and does not hire many Canadian sailors so that it 
can pay the lowest wages possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance says he understands the poor and is 
concerned about their situation.  There must be poor people 
living in LaSalle, in his riding of Lasalle—Émard.  Is there 
anyone listening who lives in LaSalle or Ville-Émard who thinks 
that their member of parliament, the Minister of Finance, is 
someone who understands and is in touch with the poor?  Is he 
someone who makes a practice of visiting soup kitchens and 
meeting with the poor, the disadvantaged and those who beg for 
money in Montreal?  Does he give them a quarter when he takes a 
walk along rue Sainte-Catherine?  Does this describe the Minister 
of Finance?  No.  He is insensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best proof is that his February 28, 2000 budget contained 
nothing for the poor.  He tried to throw together a few little 
programs to once again boost this government's visibility.  This 
government has an obsession with visibility. 
It wants to put the maple leaf everywhere.  It even put it on 
the front of Via Rail trains.  I do not know how many thousands 
of dollars it cost taxpayers to put a maple leaf on the front of 
Via Rail trains so that moose, caribou and deer watching the 
train go through the Gaspé park toward the town can be sure that 
it is really a federal government train.  Just to be sure, a 
maple leaf was added to the front of Via Rail trains.  This 
government has an obsession with visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, if this government has any sensitivity to the 
needs of the people of Canada and of Quebec, it should think 
twice and ensure that there are measures to allow the ordinary 
people, the members of the middle class, the hard working people 
who punch the clock in factories and other businesses, those who 
are supervised by others, those who do not make enough to make 
ends meet, those who are worried about losing their jobs, those 
whose have children in Cegep who want to be like everyone else 
and have things like everyone else, a bike for instance, to be 
able to benefit from concrete taxation measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is today's reality.  Canadian and Quebec society is made up 
of several different categories of people. 
I think it is regrettable that this government pays more 
attention to the powerful.  When we realize that the six biggest 
banks in Canada have recorded a profit of $8 billion in 1999, 
can this government be one that listens to those who have 
little? 
Can we believe that this government is one that listens to the 
middle class, when we see the six major banks making $8 billion 
in profits?

Toronto Dominion are announcing record profits for 1999—they have 
never made so much money—2,500 jobs are being cut, branches are 
being closed, there is no more service.  People are being told 
to use the automatic teller, which will cut down on the number 
of counter staff needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the branches, the tellers are being forced to tell us “Use 
the automatic tellers.  There is no charge for it”.  That is 
what they are being made to do. 
I said so the other day to my teller at the National Bank.  I 
said “Do you realize you are working to do yourself out of a 
job?  You encourage me to pay my hydro bill at the banking 
machine in order to save $1.25.  You are doing yourself out of a 
job”.  She said “Mr. Guimond, we have been instructed to direct 
our clients to the banking machine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we say we are in a better, more developed, society when we 
just do business with banking machines?  What about humanity's 
place in society?  Where will humans be taken into account once 
and for all?  When are we, as members, going to take those who 
sent us here into account?  They are the public.

expect of us?  We must represent them worthily and listen to 
their needs and concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I want to say that I will be splitting my 
time with my colleague from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words on the bill before us today, the 
budget implementation act, Bill C-32.  In many ways I suppose 
this is the wind up of the budget debate in the House that 
started back in February.  It actually started before that with 
the finance committee holding hearings around the country last 
fall, taking ideas to the Department of Finance and giving 
Canadians the opportunity to have a platform to express their 
ideas of what should go into the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great debate really was what to do with the so called fiscal 
dividend.  The prediction made by the minister in London last 
fall was that we would have a surplus of around $10 billion this 
fiscal year and $95 billion to $100 billion over a five year 
period.  Since then we have had revisions:  this was even too 
conservative; the surplus would be even higher; and the 
flexibility even greater than that in terms of the economy that 
is going pretty well full blast across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is about what we do with the money.  We hear from the 
Reform Party members of course, who basically want to spend all 
the money on tax cuts.  The Canadian people are saying that a tax 
cut is about their third, fourth or fifth priority.  What 
Canadians have said to us as we toured around the country and in 
poll after poll is that the main thing they want is to reinvest 
the money in the Canadian people, particularly in the health care 
and education systems for our future and the future of our kids. 
That is where the Canadian people want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing great opposition to that, not just from the 
Alliance Party but from the Liberals across the way.  The 
parliamentary secretary knows that the Liberals have cut back on 
spending on health care by more money than any Conservative 
government has done in the history of this country. They have cut 
back on health care by billions and billions of dollars, to the 
point where the federal government is now paying, in terms of 
cash, 13 cents or 14 cents on the dollar compared to 50 cents on 
the dollar some 20 or 30 years ago when medicare was introduced 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the pushing and prodding by the CCF and the NDP, the 
Pearson government introduced medicare back in the 1960s.  The 
deal at that time was that the federal government paid 50% and 
the provinces paid 50%.  Under the current Liberal regime, the 
Liberal government pays 13 cents or 14 cents on the dollar in 
terms of cash for health care.  That is why there is a crisis in 
health care from one part of Canada to the other.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the reason we are now being threatened with bill 11 in 
Alberta and the opening of the floodgates to a private health 
care system that would operate alongside a public health care 
system.  In other words, it would be two tier American style 
health care as a result of a Liberal government not putting 
enough money into health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the major priority of the Canadian people in poll after 
poll and in calls to our offices, e-mails and faxes.  When we 
talk to people on the street, they want more money in health 
care.  They want to keep a single payer health system, a public 
health system.  We do not want American style health care in 
Canada.  That is the way we will go if we do not persuade the 
government to change its ways and put more money into health 
care.  The money is there.  It is not as if the money was not 
there like four or five years ago.  The cash is there and it is a 
matter of what to do with this priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hearing a lot about education from young people and from 
people in general.  They want more federal funds going into 
post-secondary education and training to prepare people for the 
new economy.  I suggest that knowledge is power and extremely 
important in terms of building a strong economy for the future. 
That is the way we should be going in terms of more federal tax 
dollars going into educating and training people, building a 
strong economy, and building skills so we can be competitive with 
the rest of the world in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These should be the two big priorities of the government across 
the way, but what does the government do?  It put more money into 
cutting taxes in the last budget than it did into health care 
because it is afraid of the Reform Party, the so-called alliance 
party which keeps pushing the tax cut issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should mention a word or two about the alliance 
reform party.  It is now advocating a 17% flat tax across the 
board.  Regardless of how wealthy we are, we would pay 17% in 
taxes.  On first blush that might sound pretty attractive to some 
people.  Then we find out that for people making $30,000 a year 
their tax cut would be $488.  For people making $100,000 a year, 
their tax cut would be $7,988.  For very wealthy people making 
$250,000 a year, their tax cut would be $25,988.  People making 
that kind of money should be paying more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have historically had a progressive tax system.  Currently 
the system has three different tax rates: 17%, 26% and 29%.  The 
middle rate will be reduced gradually from 26% to 23%.  That is 
progressivity: 17%, 26% and 29%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the very same conservatives that now call themselves the 
alliance reform party were in power, they made the tax system 
less progressive.  There used to be seven or eight different tax 
brackets back in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Now they want to 
eliminate progressivity altogether.  A millionaire will get a 
huge tax cut.  One should vote for the Reform Party if one is a 
millionaire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the leadership candidates who is an extremist in more 
ways than one, Stockwell Day, has been pushing the idea of the 
flat tax and helping the rich for the last year or so.  He is not 
just an extremist in that regard.  He is an extremist in all 
kinds of social conservative ideas as well in terms of 
intolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way Canadian people want to go.  Canadian people 
want a progressive tax system.  They want to reduce taxes for low 
and middle income people.  They still want enough tax money from 
those who can afford to pay taxes to invest in health care, 
education, farmers, the fisheries and the basic industries that 
provide a job and livelihood for each and every Canadian.  That 
is the way we should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting how the government failed to eliminate 
some the loopholes in the tax system.  On the weekend I read with 
interest an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of Saturday, June 
3, headlined “Taxman ordered to justify $2B deal”.  There was 
the ruling of a judge in a court case on Friday.  The Federal 
Court of Appeal ruled that George Harris, a Winnipeg activist, 
could take Revenue Canada to court to contest the tax collector's 
decision to allow $2 billion in family assets, believed to be 
those of the Bronfman family, to be transferred out of the 
country and the capital gains to be transferred out of the 
country tax free. 
This was a ruling back in 1991 which did not come to light until 
1996.  The government promised legislation, but the government 
has not really acted upon the promise to bring in legislation to 
ensure this kind of thing does not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> and the information in the 
courts, the Bronfman family transferred assets worth $2 billion, 
I gather stocks in particular, from Canada to the United States 
in 1991.  The capital gains on those stocks were about $700 
million.  Some officials in the Department of National Revenue, 
in a secret meeting where no minutes were kept according to the 
court documents, decided that the Bronfman family did not have to 
pay tax on that $700 million of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the priorities of the government?  It will tax the 
ordinary citizen who is making $10,000 or $20,000 a year.  If 
that person fails to pay taxes he will get a tax notice.  He will 
be penalized and will have interest added to the tax owed. The 
government will go after him hook, line and sinker until that tax 
is paid.  One could be a widowed granny and the government will 
go after her, but the Bronfman family with $700 million in 
capital gains paid not one penny in tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that fair?  Is that just?  Is it a true, just and fair 
democratic society that has a system which is so unfair and so 
unjust? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that the Liberals have let this happen. The 
reform party alliance would make it go even faster.  Just this 
morning its finance critic said he wanted a tax reduction for the 
wealthy, for the rich.  Even my friend from Calgary is hanging 
his head in shame when he hears those words. The wealthy and the 
rich, the Pocklingtons and the Bronfmans of the world, would get 
a tax cut from the reform party alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not where the Canadian people stand.  The grassroots 
people say they want tax fairness, tax justice and equality. They 
want money in health care and money in education to build a 
strong economy.

I guess the member should ask that question of Liberals across 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose one reason they raised taxes so often was that they 
wanted to spend $60 million on an unelected Senate.  I know my 
friend is very interested in the Senate issue in terms of trying 
to abolish the unelected Senate.  We may disagree on what it 
should be replaced with, but certainly spending $60 million on an 
unelected Senate is a waste of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of other waste as well.  The member 
enumerated some of them.  I am aware of some of the ones he has 
talked about, but I do not know about sex changes for soldiers. 
Maybe he could elaborate on that, but I certainly know about the 
fountains in Shawinigan and all kinds of other money wasted 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one I referred to specifically was letting the Bronfman 
family get away with not paying a penny in taxes on the $700 
million in capital gains.  The member makes a very good point. If 
we do not tax certain things then other people will be taxed to 
fill the gap.  If the Bronfmans are not taxed on $700 million 
worth of capital gains, who will pay the bill?   It will be 
ordinary working people in British Columbia, Saskatchewan or 
anywhere else in the country.  They then pay the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gets back to my original point that we need a fair tax 
system based on the ability to pay. 
It should be a progressive tax system, not a flat tax system 
because the wealthy people get away with a better deal when 
everybody pays the same tax rate.  A progressive tax system based 
on the ability to pay is the way to go, with tax reductions for 
middle income people, with a lot higher exemption that would 
exempt more and more poor people, and with tax credits for 
children so that we have a children's agenda to invest in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, one of the great platforms of the 
New Democratic Party is the reduction of the dreaded GST and in 
Atlantic Canada the HST.  Could my hon. colleague from Regina 
elaborate on what a reduction of the GST would do for all 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, a reduction in the GST 
would be the best way to reduce taxes in a very fair and balanced 
way for ordinary Canadians.  One point in the GST means about $3 
billion in terms of total government revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the GST is a flat tax.  Everyone pays the same tax. 
When someone gets a haircut one pays 7% whether it is wealthy 
person, a poor person or a middle income person.  Some people do 
not get haircuts so they are at tremendous advantage here in the 
House of Commons.  It does not make much sense to reduce the GST 
for our friend from Vancouver, but for most people a reduction in 
the GST is the quickest way to create a fairer tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also the quickest way to stimulate the economy by putting 
more money back into the hands of consumers, particularly 
ordinary people who will spend it on the necessities of life and 
in turn create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-32, an act to 
implement certain provisions of budget 2000.  This morning I 
listened with great interest when the government member spoke 
about the wonders of budget 2000 and the wonderful effects its 
implementation will have on Canadians.  I thought about how a 
country measures success and realized that a country measures 
success by the success of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health and other government members talk about 
health care and the fact they have reinvested in health care 
because Canadians have said they want to maintain a public health 
care system.  I wonder why the government does not want to talk 
about the realities we see every day, certainly in my part of the 
country, with respect to what government cuts have done to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I turned on the television to watch a program about two 
individuals in two different provinces in Canada.  One was a 
young woman who had been diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour 
and had to undergo surgery.  Unfortunately she ended up disabled. 
She was only in her early thirties.  It was found out later that 
the tumour was not cancerous, that it was benign.  It was the 
matter of a misdiagnosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other case involved an older gentleman with some abdominal 
pain.  He went to the hospital and was diagnosed with cancer of 
the bowel.  Following surgery, approximately 10 or 12 days later 
he died because of complications from the surgery, only for his 
wife to find out that he too had not had cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The show went on to talk to approximately seven Canadian 
pathologists.  The commentator was asking them how this could 
happen in Canada.  The pathologists said very clearly that it was 
because there was not enough money being invested into the 
system.  There are not enough pathologists in Canada.   The 
number they quoted was 59 pathologists for every million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the health care sector.  I have found myself asking 
on a number of occasions what kind of a country we live in.  I 
heard the remarks of my hon. colleague in the Bloc.  He asked 
whether we were living in a better society.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to government members, I guess from their 
perspective there are some people who are living in a better 
society.  The hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has just 
mentioned a couple of them, those individuals in Canada who are 
not scraping by on a daily basis.  What about the areas of the 
country where people are not doing all that well, as in the 
unfortunate case of Cape Breton?  What is the government's 
answer?  It does not want to talk about the reality that we have 
1.5 million more children who will go to bed hungry than we did 
10 years ago.  The government does not want to talk about the 
fact that we are hearing from doctors and health care 
professionals that there is a major problem with the health care 
system and we need the government to reinvest money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody is saying that the system does not need to be changed. 
From the perspective of the health care system, we all know there 
is a need for innovation, but we also know, and we are being told 
on a regular basis, that the government has to put back what it 
took out of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of the country we have 25% poverty.  Child poverty is 
much higher.  Government members would tell us that their 
commitments to EI, health care and education have made things 
better for Canadians.  Better for all Canadians, or better for 
some Canadians?   We see on a regular basis that the answer to 
that question is that these policies have not been for the 
betterment of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five or six years ago Canadians were willing to do their fair 
share to deal with the deficit.  That was our responsibility as 
Canadians.  People did that, especially the workers.  As we all 
know, the government obtained its surplus on the backs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all familiar with a program that used to be called 
unemployment insurance.  It was there in case we lost our job. 
It was a safety net to help us until we got another job. The 
government changed the name to employment insurance and it has 
become nothing more than a cash cow to generate revenues for the 
federal government.  Might I say that those revenues are not 
assisting the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 30% of unemployed women in Canada qualify for employment 
insurance.  We have heard government members and the Prime 
Minister recently say that there are problems with employment 
insurance which will have to be fixed.  Maybe that will secure 
some seats for them in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  In my part of the country it has 
is changed the boundaries.  We used to have five regions in Nova 
Scotia.  The proposal of the government is to take it down to 
three regions.  The government says it will do this to ensure 
that the areas of the country which have the highest rates of 
unemployment will receive what the people need.  The reality is, 
in my part of the country the changing of the boundaries will 
mean that the people of Cape Breton will now only qualify for 30 
weeks of employment insurance, rather than 32 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something I have always found phenomenal when listening to 
government members is that they are wonderful at confusing 
Canadians with numbers.  We always hear them talk about 18% 
unemployment in my part of the country.  I have had the occasion 
to ask Statistics Canada how the unemployment rate is measured. 
An official told me that if people were unemployed for two years 
they would be included in the data of Statistics Canada. 
I do not know about central Canada, but in Cape Breton if someone 
does not have a job for two, three, four or five years, they are 
still unemployed.  They still do not have a job.  However, unless 
they have been unemployed for two years they are not included in 
the mechanism used by the government to measure the number of 
unemployed.  With the changing of the zones in my part of the 
country Cape Breton will fall under an unemployment rate of 15%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go home and talk to my constituents about the policies 
and the changes that the government is talking about, people 
laugh.  They know it is not 18%.  They know the rate is closer to 
40% or 45%, with some areas of Cape Breton at 50%.  With the 
stroke of a pen the government will now officially say that the 
unemployment rate on Cape Breton Island is 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my original comment.  How do we as a country 
measure success?  Do we not measure it by the success of our 
citizens? It certainly appears that the government does not 
measure its success by its citizens.  If that were the case, then 
the government would be addressing the issues and the concerns 
directly affecting Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government members talk about how good the budget is, I 
hope some of them have a conscience and recognize in their own 
heart that this budget will not assist the number of Canadians 
who have been drastically affected by the policies of the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in 1996 the Liberals increased the burden with regard to 
overseas employment tax credits, such that people had to leave 
Canada to find jobs because jobs were not available here, partly 
because of high taxes.  They were faced with an increased tax 
burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people have to leave Canada because of high taxes, when the 
Liberals increase the tax burden, something which is truly 
egregious, are they doing so to fund a subsidy to Wal-Mart?  Are 
the Liberals increasing taxes to fund a subsidy to Safeway?  Do 
the Liberals raise taxes to give a subsidy to Bombardier?  Do 
they raise taxes so they can give a subsidy to Shoppers Drug 
Mart?  Do they raise taxes on Canadians so they can give more out 
in corporate welfare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are there so many tax increases when there is so much waste? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Madam Speaker, as my colleague 
from Regina—Qu'Appelle said, I would never attempt to speak on 
behalf of government members or even attempt to explain why they 
have done what we have seen them do over the course of the last 
six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note for my colleague from out west that we 
on Cape Breton Island have never complained about paying our fair 
share.  In all of the years I have lived on Cape Breton Island, I 
do not remember ever hearing one person complain about paying 
their fair share.  What I have heard people talk about is the 
unfairness of the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to leave my hon. colleague with the message that my 
constituents tell me all the time.  They tell me that they would 
like to have a good job so that they could pay their fair share.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a question for my good 
friend from Cape Breton.  The question concerns what is happening 
to the economy in terms of the thousands of men who are losing 
their jobs and the effect that will have on the women and 
children, their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The women and children are usually the forgotten ones when it 
comes to budgets and tax cuts.  What happens to the women and 
children when their husbands, in the traditional roles of Cape 
Breton miners and steelworkers, lose their jobs due to economic 
concerns?  The Liberal government basically forgets that Cape 
Breton Island even exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From her own personal experience, if the hon. member could 
elaborate a bit more on that, I am sure the House would be 
greatly enlightened by her wit and wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to 
provide my colleague with some wit and wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated over and over again in the House, it is 
unfortunate every week when I go back to my part of the country 
to see the overwhelming effect government policies have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore has said, a number of the people who are being adversely 
affected are children and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently I had the occasion to talk to a young couple.  He 
worked on a fishing boat.  We all know what has happened to the 
fishery on the east coast.  He lost his job.  His wife was a 
process worker in a plant.  They were sitting in my office with 
the most beautiful three and a half month old baby girl.  They 
were in their late twenties and thought they had the world by the 
tail.  Neither one of them had a job.  We talked for a while. The 
woman finally broke down and told me that she had just put the 
last diaper she had on her daughter.  That is the reality in my 
part of the country, day after day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>   Madam Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-32, the 
budget implementation act for the 2000 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to take stock of where we are as a country and 
how we have achieved our current financial position.  This is the 
third budget in which Canada has had a surplus.  While the 
Liberals opposite will crow and take credit for this fiscal 
achievement, the very policies that were required to lead Canada 
to this point in economic history were vociferously opposed by 
the Liberals prior to their forming the government.  I will refer 
to a few of them specifically:  free trade, the GST, the 
deregulation of financial services, transportation and energy. 
All of those things the Liberals campaigned and fought against. 
Prior to 1993 they were completely and diametrically opposed to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, unburdened by the yoke of principle, the Liberals 
have embraced these policies and in some cases have claimed some 
level of originality in introducing them or spearheading them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we raise this issue at this time because on 
Thursday of last week McGill economist Tom Velk and historian A. 
R. Riggs released a paper evaluating Canadian governments back to 
World War II on economic criteria.  It should come as no surprise 
to members of my parliamentary caucus in the Progressive 
Conservative Party that the best economic record of any Canadian 
prime minister since World War II was held by none other than 
Brian Mulroney.  I think it is important that we recognize the 
vision and courage of a prime minister who actually took the big 
steps, who did not ignore the global trends and made the 
structural changes to the Canadian economy that were necessary to 
lead Canada into the 21st century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The headline in the <I>National Post</I> on Thursday was 
“Mulroney ranked first, Chrétien dead last as leaders of the 
economy”.  The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> said “Recession beating 
Mulroney as economic champ, study says”.  The study referred to 
a number of specific criteria upon which the economists based 
their judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In applauding Mulroney, the professors said that he presided 
over a general fall in interest rates that lasted more or less 
the entire term of his office.  Inflation took a beating during 
the Mulroney years.  Mulroney, unlike the present Prime Minister, 
inherited a troubled economy with tremendously high interest 
rates and high inflation.  They said that low income Canadians 
fared better under Prime Minister Mulroney than they did during 
the Liberal administrations of the present Prime Minister or 
under Mr. Trudeau.  That may surprise some of the members 
opposite, but the numbers speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study credited the vision and the courage of the Mulroney 
government in embracing the policies of free trade and the GST. 
These were not easy policies to embrace or to spearhead at a 
tumultuous time in Canadian political history.  In fact in what 
was referred to as the free trade election in 1988, over half of 
Canadians voted against free trade. The question of course should 
not necessarily be what policies are the most popular, but what 
policies will lead to the greatest level of economic growth and 
prosperity for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a government that was not focused on next week's polls 
as much as the present government is.  It was focused on the 
challenges and opportunities facing Canadians well into the next 
century.  The record of that government speaks for itself not 
just in terms of what it achieved during its years in office, but 
what its policies have achieved since then and are destined to 
achieve well into this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In studying the record of the current government, it said that 
under the tenure of the current Prime Minister and Minister of 
Finance, the dollar is lower than it has every been in Canadian 
history.  Productivity is comparatively low and its growth has 
lagged behind that of the U.S.  Per capita GDP is lagging 
comparatively to our trading partners.  In the last 10 years 
Canada has had a GDP per capita growth of about 5% while 
countries like Ireland have had a 92% growth in GDP per capita. 
The U.S. and Germany have had a 15% growth in GDP per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our neighbours to the south and our trading partners 
elsewhere are improving their productivity, production and 
success, we are lagging behind.  As citizens in other countries 
are getting richer, the Canadian citizenry is getting poor. 
Nowhere is that more exemplified than the dramatic and 
significant loss in the value of our dollar since 1993.  Under 
the Mulroney government, the dollar lost one cent in nine years 
of power. The dollar has lost around nine cents since the current 
government took power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the dollar drops, Canadians effectively have a pay 
cut.  We depend on our trading relations with other countries for 
many of the goods and services that Canadians need and enjoy. 
When the dollar drops, the purchasing power of Canadians drops 
and their standard of living drops.  There has been a significant 
drop in Canada's standard of living over the past several years. 
In the 1990s, take home pay in Canada decreased by about 8%. This 
was during a period when Americans enjoyed a 10% increase. An 18% 
gap has erupted between Canada and the U.S. in terms of disposal 
income or take home pay at the end of the day.  That is 
disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the impacts of that has been an unprecedented level of 
brain drain.  The number of Canadians who are going to the U.S. 
to seek greater levels of opportunity and prosperity has grown 
from 16,000 per year eight years ago to about 100,000 per year 
last year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the number of people who are going.  The most 
disturbing area of this trend is who is going.  In evaluating the 
type of people who are going we see that some of our young, 
bright talents, some of the best and brightest we have in Canada, 
are choosing to pursue their futures and opportunities in the 
U.S. Ultimately the loss will be to Canada not just in terms of 
future tax revenue, but in terms of the ability for these 
individuals to build stronger companies and ultimately a stronger 
country.  It will ultimately benefit the U.S. and not Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be doing more to keep these individuals and talents as 
opposed to driving them away.  Before we decide what policies we 
should be implementing to keep them here, we should be evaluating 
what specific current policies are having such a deleterious 
impact on our ability to keep those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Canadian tax system represents one of the largest 
impediments to growth and prosperity.  It is not the only clue to 
the brain drain crisis but it is a very important area of public 
policy that we need to be concerned about.  I can give a couple 
of examples of the degree to which our tax system affects the 
brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say a technology worker, a programmer in Vancouver, makes 
about $70,000 per year.  That individual is in the top marginal 
tax bracket in Canada.  We hit our top marginal tax bracket at 
$70,000, even after full implementation of the budget's 
initiatives.  In the U.S. one does not hit the top marginal tax 
rate until about $400,000 Canadian. As a result, the software 
programmer in Vancouver will be paying federal and provincial 
taxes combined of about 52% of his or her income. At the same 
level of income, about $70,000 Canadian, about an hour and a half 
away in Seattle, that same individual would be paying about 26% 
of his or her income, effectively half the level of taxation that 
he or she would be paying in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly for someone with a family and who is making student loan 
payments, car payments, mortgage payments and hockey costs for 
children, or whatever it is, that is not a lot of money. The 
notion that someone making $70,000 in Canada today is rich is 
probably wrong-headed.  We are taxing those people as if they were 
fabulously wealthy.  That is one of the reasons we are driving 
people, particularly within that critical $70,000 to $100,000 
range, out of the country. Those are the people we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where we need to address our tax issue 
significantly is at the lower end of the scale.  Currently, our 
basic personal amount even after the budget is almost $8,000. 
That is far too low.  The U.S. equivalent threshold in Canadian 
dollars at which an American starts to pay taxes is around 
$11,000.  We call ourselves a kinder, gentler nation yet we start 
taxing people at about $8,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term this should be increased to about $12,000 and 
over a period of time should be increased beyond that.  In the 
short term we should be looking at an increase to $12,000.  That 
would take millions of low income Canadians off the tax roles. 
It would reduce the tax burden of all Canadians in a fair and 
equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of impact on the new economy, there is probably no more 
negative tax in Canada than our capital gains tax regime.  The 
recent budget and this budget implementation act would see a 
reduction in the capital gains inclusion rate from 75% down to 
66%. 
That would still leave us with a 13% disadvantage over the U.S. 
in the critical area of capital gains.  No form of taxation 
affects the new economy more than capital gains taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The currency in terms of compensatory assets in the new economy 
is clearly stock options.  Increasingly, whether it is in 
biotechnology or e-commerce, stock options are used to incent and 
attract talent and to keep talent.  In Canada we have a 13% 
disadvantage even after this budget in the very critical area of 
capital gains taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons the government will not reduce capital gains tax 
further have very little to do with realities.  It is very 
dangerous when we build public policy, as is often done in this 
place, around perceptions and not reality.  Let me deal with a 
couple of those perceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the perception that capital gains taxes are paid 
largely by the rich and it would be inequitable to reduce capital 
gains taxes and thus to reduce taxes on the rich.  Over 50% of 
capital gains taxes in Canada are paid by people who make less 
than $50,000 per year.  Individuals throughout the small growth 
companies, from the receptionists to the CEOs, are all incented 
and paid with stock options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, with the level of market participation that exists today, 
more so than ever in the history of Canada, Canadians are 
investing in the equities markets through secure long term 
vehicles such as mutual funds.  They are able to achieve 
diversification with a relatively small amount of investment and 
as such are participating in record numbers at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other perception is that somehow we cannot afford to 
eliminate the capital gains tax, which is what I would like to 
see done.  A Progressive Conservative government would eliminate 
personal capital gains tax. Some people say we cannot afford to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capital gains tax only brings in around $1 billion per year. 
Estimates I have heard in terms of personal capital gains tax in 
recent years are revenues ranging from $700 million to about $900 
million.  If we assume that there will be some shift in the way 
employees are compensated as a result of the capital gains tax 
elimination, let us say if it goes from $1 billion to $1.5 
billion, that is a very conservative estimate of the loss of 
revenue to the Canadian government.  Ultimately that revenue 
would be made up significantly by the increased level of activity 
and by the unlocking of capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively one of the most pernicious impacts of capital gains 
taxation is the degree to which people make decisions not based 
on economic or business realities and criteria, but instead on 
tax criteria.  People hold on to investments far longer than they 
would have normally and do not make the types of investments they 
probably should be making in some of the new economy vehicles and 
opportunities. That locking up of capital denies many of Canada's 
growth industries, particularly in the knowledge based sector, 
access to the needed capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live north of the greatest capital markets in the world, the 
U.S.  We cannot afford to penalize and to handcuff our technology 
sector.  In any of the knowledge based areas of our technology 
sector, whether it is biotechnology or information technology, we 
cannot afford to deny these players, the individuals who are 
building their companies and who are building a stronger and more 
competitive Canada, the opportunity to access capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively by locking up this capital in Canada's capital gains 
prison we are actually preventing these companies from growing 
here in Canada.  Ultimately in many cases these companies are 
gravitating south of the border in trying to raise capital.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The venture capitalists, whether it is Perkins or the Sequoia 
capitalists of the world, are investing in these companies and 
are then encouraging these companies to move their research and 
development activities and manufacturing south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we would like to think that these investments can be 
made—and do not get me wrong, I encourage foreign investment in 
Canada's growth industries, we need the investment—I do think 
there is a significant risk which is borne out by the fact that 
when this foreign investment is made, it quite frequently leads 
to a movement or a migration of the companies and the innovators 
to the U.S.  It stands to reason that over a period of time that 
would have a significant cost to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that by unlocking this immense pool of capital to 
reduce or, as we are proposing, eliminate personal capital gains 
tax in Canada, we would actually be able to fund and raise 
capital for these innovators here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are innovators in the financial service sector now who are 
already doing that.  The one which comes to mind, Yorkton 
Securities Inc., has demonstrated that it is Canada's top 
investment bank in the knowledge based industries.  We are 
putting in front of the Yorktons and in front of the McLean 
Watson Capitals, which are raising money for Canadian knowledge 
based industries, the barriers to success which ultimately 
threaten their ability to raise the capital they need to invest 
in the innovators who we as a country need to grow and develop 
greater successes here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not competitive in that new economy, a lot of these 
arguments are effectively moot.  Our ability to afford the social 
investments that Canadians value and treasure, whether it is our 
health care, our social safety nets or the transfers to the 
provinces, become moot if we cannot afford them.  It is critical 
to build a tax system around growth, not greed, so that we can 
afford the types of social investments that Canadians want well 
into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some Canadians there is a belief that these investments, 
whether it is in our health care or equalization systems, define 
us as a country.  It is very important to get our fundamentals 
correct, that we reduce our debt in real terms, that we reduce 
over a period of time not just our tax burden but that we use a 
system of tax reforms to do what is required to make Canada more 
competitive in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we can achieve success with visionary policies that 
will lead Canada proudly into the 21st century, but we have to 
move now.  This caretakership government, which is taking baby 
steps when other countries are taking gigantic leaps, is clearly 
not appropriate or helpful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there have been a number of tax increases that have been 
brought in over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals brought in 62 different tax increases since they 
took government in 1993.  One of those was an increased tax on 
energy conservation and on pollution abatement equipment.  That 
tax which the Liberals brought in in 1994 resulted in $45 million 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ironic thing is that we often hear the Liberals talking 
about how they care about the environment but they actually 
brought in an increased tax, $45 million more, for investigations 
into energy conservation and pollution abatement equipment.  That 
is awfully strange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for my colleague is whether or not that 
money was raised so that things like video tracing the history of 
Chilean poets in Montreal for $28,000 is an example of where that 
money was going.  Is the history of Chilean poets in Montreal the 
reason why the Liberal government went ahead and brought in a $45 
million tax on conservation?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is clear that we need 
a significant level of tax reform and tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to a specific tax under the Liberal 
government.  I in fact was not aware of that tax and I appreciate 
his bringing that to my attention.  Relative to his citing one 
specific incident or evidence of spending, the history of Chilean 
poets in Montreal, I am not aware of that specific investment. 
However, since Pericles and ancient Athens, civilized societies 
have invested in culture.  Whether he believes that the history 
of Chilean poets in Montreal is relevant or irrelevant, it 
becomes a very dicey question to determine whether one cultural 
investment is worthy or one is not.  To try to discern whether 
that is worthy borders on censorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to many ways, particularly relative to the ministry 
of HRDC, where the government has continued to play the old game 
of picking winners and losers and ultimately doing what 
politicians do best in terms picking more losers than winners and 
interfering in the private sector in the course of that.  I would 
argue that while there may be some sensationalist benefit to 
identifying specific cultural investments, the substantive waste 
in HRDC is probably a more reasonable target for the hon. member 
to cite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also urge him to consider that there are some elements of 
culture that simply will not be privately funded and from which 
there is a collective benefit to investing in Canada. While I 
cannot comment on that specific example because I have not 
studied it, as a Canadian I do value the fact that we have an 
extremely diverse culture that contributes significantly to the 
cultural mosaic of our country.  That the government does play a 
role in the infrastructure of that is a valued tradition that 
Canadians in my riding and elsewhere value. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did appreciate the attitude and 
approach of my hon. colleague from Kings—Hants and his party. We 
on this side of the House support that initiative as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was his government, the Conservatives, that brought us the 
dreaded GST.  Now the Liberals in Atlantic Canada have tacked on 
the HSC which has created quite the underground economy.  Last 
year, according to the auditor general, federally and 
provincially that equated to almost $12 billion of untaxed 
underground economy going on in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member, who is the finance critic for his 
party, and his party plan to do to reduce the underground economy 
and start reducing or eliminating the dreaded GST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is important to 
recognize that at least the New Democrats, on the issue of the 
GST, have been consistent.  They did not like the GST in 1993 nor 
do they like it now.  Of course the Liberals were completely and 
diametrically opposed to the GST and have since embraced it, with 
the Prime Minister on foreign travels in fact taking credit for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I disagree with New Democrats quite frequently, I do 
respect that in terms of principles they are consistent, as 
opposed to the patron saints of hypocrisy opposite who campaigned 
on one agenda and then embraced another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing worse than the Liberal government stealing 
policies from the Tories and taking credit for the results would 
be if it were to implement its own.  I am glad it has not been 
terribly original in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relative to the GST, I would urge the hon. member to look at the 
tax that the GST replaced, the manufacturer's sales tax which 
actually, from a trade perspective, penalized Canadian 
manufacturers.  It made it more difficult for them to achieve 
competitiveness and reduced the opportunities for Canadian 
companies to create jobs and opportunities here in Canada. 
If we compare the GST to other taxes in terms of its impact on 
job growth and opportunities in Canada, it is probably one of the 
more sensible taxes we have.  If we reduce our personal and 
corporate income taxes and capital gains tax in some of these 
other areas, there will be a shift to a greater level of 
dependency on a consumption tax base.  There is a significant 
consensus among economists around the world that most countries 
should move in the direction of a greater dependency on 
consumption taxes and less on income taxes in the long term.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly some issues on collection that need to be 
addressed and there is an underground economy that has grown 
significantly.  That is because the government has refused to do 
what is necessary on the income tax side of the equation.  I 
do not think it is fair to blame that on the GST. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the finance critic for 
the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember reading some of the recent claims and statements made 
by the Progressive Conservative Party at a recent rally talking 
about increasing the spending on health care and other things. 
They talked about reducing taxes and eliminating the capital 
gains tax completely.  They then talked about $25 billion a year 
in debt retirement.  Those all sound nice and the themes are 
consistent with the Canadian Alliance Party, but in an effort to 
attract some sort of public support they go over the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish they would follow the lead of our finance critic who has 
submitted his plan to the academic community and economic 
forecasters who say that our plan has integrity because it 
balances out.  Our plan actually works with the numbers.  It 
balances and it makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why the member opposite does not consider adopting a plan 
and moving in a direction that has integrity, where the plan 
balances as opposed to what we have heard from his party in the 
past making wild promises that do not balance.  Canadians see 
that and will never embrace it.  Canadians are embracing our plan 
because it has been tested by academics and proven to be workable 
and real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the member to comment on that and to consider 
supporting the Canadian Alliance approach to tax reform in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  I appreciate the hon. member's 
invitation.  I will put it with the other invitations I have 
received from his party and consider it with the same level of 
seriousness as I have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed to a policy conference that my party 
recently held in Quebec City.  I thank him for mentioning it in 
the Chamber today.  Eleven hundred Canadians from all walks of 
life gathered in Quebec City to discuss the types of policies 
that our party, at the very grassroots level, would like to see 
implemented by a Progressive Conservative government and, prior to 
that, as part of our platform in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the impediments we have as a party is the fact that we 
are one of the most grassroots parties in the country.  That top 
down party, the Canadian Alliance, may develop its policies in 
smoke filled boardrooms and backrooms but my party develops its 
policies openly on the floor of convention halls, church halls 
and school basements.  It may take a little longer to develop our 
policies but I think we will be favourably rewarded because our 
tax proposals are not based on greed.  They are based on growth. 
I wish that party—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

important for everybody to know that the Liberals have increased 
taxes 62 times since they formed the government in 1993. 
Corporate taxes have increased 27 times.  Personal tax increases 
have gone up 22 times.  Bracket creep has increased six times. 
The Canada pension plan has increased seven times.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask what we are getting for the 62 Liberal tax increases 
since 1993.  That is the question.  I have done some research.  I 
would like to report to the House and to the world what types of 
things the Liberal government has done with those 62 tax 
increases since it came into power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding the Liberal government is subsidizing Wal-Mart. 
Wal-Mart is a pretty successful firm.  Yet the government has 
gone ahead and increased taxes on Canadians and is subsidizing an 
extremely profitable company like Wal-Mart in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets richer.  The research goes on.  Not only is the Liberal 
government subsidizing Wal-Mart but it is subsidizing Canada 
Safeway.  How is it fair that IGA, Calgary Co-op or any of the 
other grocery stores are subsidizing Canada Safeway?  That is 
what the Liberal government is doing.  It is raising taxes on 
everyone to give to the few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is also subsidizing Shoppers Drug Mart. 
All these companies are profitable.  It has raised taxes 62 
times.  What is it doing with all this tax money?  It is 
subsidizing all sorts of profitable corporations.  Shame on the 
Liberals for doing these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only corporate welfare that the Liberals are 
subsidizing with their 62 tax increases since 1993.  They are 
funding studies too.  They have done research just like I am 
doing research, but what are they doing research on?  What are 
the Liberals spending our money on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to have studies on lawn ornaments.  The Liberals 
actually had a study done on pink flamingos that are stuck into 
lawns with our tax dollars.  It actually happened.  Can we 
believe that the Liberals would give money to Bombardier?  In 
some respects that almost makes sense because Bombardier is a big 
funder of the Liberal Party.  I will deal with that at greater 
length in a little while.  Why is it that we are subsidizing 
profitable companies and spending money to study lawn ornaments? 
It does not make any sense.  Why have there been 62 tax increases 
for taxpayers since 1993 to do such things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through the individual tax increases and ask whether 
it makes sense what the Liberals have spent money on.  In 1994 
the Liberal government increased the tax on energy conservation 
and pollution abatement equipment, something that would reduce 
emissions and somehow help the environment as it likes to claim. 
It brought in $45 million of revenue.  On the flip side, what was 
the government putting the money into?  It took the money from 
one side, and what was it spent on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals gave $33,800 to examine major league baseball in 
Detroit.  The last time I checked Detroit was in the United 
States, but taxpayers in Canada were paying for 62 tax increases 
to the government since 1993 so that it could give their money 
away to study baseball outside Canada.  The next time people 
write their tax cheques to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
I want them to think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government continued its studies.  It spent 
$100,670, which a lot of tax money for the average taxpayer.  As 
a matter of fact it would take 21 average taxpayers to pay their 
taxes the whole year in order to fund the interactive study of 
video games.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have the Liberals raised taxes 62 times since they took 
office in 1993 so that they could spend over $100,000 in 21 
taxpayer years to study interactive video games?  That does not 
make any sense.  It is totally ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another infamous Liberal tax increase.  In 1995 
they brought in a 1.5 cent per litre increase on gasoline, which 
resulted in a whopping $500 million.  What did taxpayers get for 
putting $500 million more into the Liberal coffers?  What did the 
Liberals wisely invest that $500 million in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not go into roads.  Once again, some of the studies show 
that $44,000 of it went to the social construction of feminist 
meanings.  A lot of tax money came in, but I am guessing the 
average person who paid the 1.5 cent per litre tax on gasoline 
did not expect his or her tax money would go to a study on the 
social construction of feminist meanings.  Is it fair for those 
people to pay those taxes and see them go toward such things?  It 
does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another of the 62 Liberal tax increases which 
they have brought in since 1993.  In 1995 the Liberals had an 
additional tax on investment income from private corporations 
which brought an increased tax burden to Canadians of $120 
million.  What did the Liberals put all that extra money into? 
What did the Liberals do with the extra money they were bringing 
in as a result of all the tax increases in 1995? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They gave $33,000 to promote and develop music in alternative 
spaces.  I ask the average taxpayer to think about that.  Is 
$33,000 for music in alternative spaces something that average 
taxpayers, if they were the finance minister or the minister 
responsible, would have thought was a wise investment of taxpayer 
dollars?   Would they have thought it was worthy of a 1.5% per 
litre increase on gasoline so that Canadians were paying $500 
million more into the Liberal coffers?   Is that what they were 
paying their tax increases for?   I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on, because 62 tax increases takes a while.  In 1995 the 
Liberals increased the corporate surtax which brought in $120 
million.  They brought the the additional tax on investment 
income which I have just mentioned.  That was another $120 
million.  They eliminated the deferral of tax on business income 
for $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these hundreds of millions of dollars what more could 
the taxpayers possibly expect from the Liberal government?   Some 
161 different groups, associations and unions received $4,059,235 
in grants.  For average taxpayers paying more money in income tax 
and paying more money at the gas pumps for their gasoline when 
they have seen prices go up dramatically recently was it really 
wise for the government to spend $24,000 for a film entitled 
“Indians of Czechoslovakia: Interaction of Indigenous People 
With Mother Earth?”  Was that a wise expenditure of taxpayer 
dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about a tax cut?  That sounds a lot better to me and I bet 
that is what my constituents would vote for.   As a matter of 
fact I know that is what they would vote for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story goes on.  In 1996 the tax increases just kept on 
coming from the Liberals. 
They increased the taxes on Canadian pensioners abroad.  In 
Kingston, which is in the Speaker's riding, there may be people 
who were affected by this. I know it is even worse in Windsor. 
The taxes on Canadian pensioners living abroad brought in $10 
million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these pensioners paid the extra $10 million the Liberals 
levied on them in 1996, what did they get in return?  Some 
$28,000 were spent on a video tracing the history of Chilean 
poets in Montreal.  Was the reason the government went ahead and 
gouged $10 million from pensioners to fund a video on Chilean 
poets in Montreal?  Was that the rationale? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  Additionally in 1996 the Liberals froze the 
contribution limits for RRSPs.  More than that, they broke their 
own promise when they did that.  For what good reason did the 
Liberals break an election promise on RRSP contribution limits? 
For what good reason did they break the pact that they made with 
taxpayers when they were elected?  They went ahead and gave the 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women and the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women over $34 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the average taxpayer say that was a wise expenditure of 
funds?  I think it is pretty questionable?  The Liberals went on. 
In 1996 they forced seniors to begin early withdrawals from their 
RRSPs.  For what reason?

cancer during his or her lifetime.

also want to thank the many health care professionals and

life more comfortable for people faced with this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year over 700 communities across North America celebrated

June 4 to 10 is Environment Week 2000 and today is World 
Environment Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1971 environment week has been celebrated around the 
world.  Each year Canadians are challenged to demonstrate their 
commitment to creating a cleaner and healthier environment. The 
theme for this year is community action on clean air and climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Kitchener Centre, the city is hosting the 13th 
annual energy and environment forum.  This event brings together 
experts and community members to discuss how we can best work 
together to meet our environmental challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no doubt that the government is committed to 
improving the environment.  The $125 million investment in the 
green municipal enabling fund and the green municipal investment 
fund is a clear indication of our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives are being undertaken in partnership with the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities of Canada are enthusiastic participants in 
this program.  We are currently negotiating with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge that the definition of infrastructure be left to the 
municipalities.  They know where the need is greatest.  They know 
where funds are best allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government conducted an excellent national infrastructure 
program involving the provinces and municipalities in 1994.  It 
worked well with the municipalities selecting projects subject to 
clearly defined criteria and control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us build on the experience of that excellent program.  The 
municipalities need help soon with their infrastructure projects.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Canadian Cancer Society assisted in celebrating the 
13th annual National Cancer Survivors Day.  This day honours 
survivors who are living with and beyond cancer.  This day is so 
important as it also recognizes the role that family and friends 
play in the lives of cancer survivors, as well as health care 
professionals and researchers who devote their lives to helping 
those faced with this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cancer touches us all either directly or indirectly. 
Approximately one in three Canadians will be diagnosed with 
cancer during his or her lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today improved detection methods, increased availability of 
information and enhanced treatments allow for more people to 
achieve a full recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This day demonstrates that a diagnosis of cancer is not an 
automatic death sentence. Now observed in over 700 communities 
throughout North America, National Cancer Survivors Day is a 
powerful tribute to everyone whose lives have been touched by 
cancer.  It is a day to celebrate courage and hope.

Fernand Dumont used to say “Collective problems do not vanish 
because we have talked too much about them: they persist because 
we did not solve them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can never say often enough that the persisting gap between 
the health of our economy and the increase in poverty is a real 
shame for our society. That gap directly impacts not only on the 
physical and psychological health of individuals, but also on 
the chances of success, in their adult life, of children living 
in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Prime Minister feels that Canada is among the 
best positioned countries in the world to make other rich 
nations aware of the need of less fortunate people, the fact is 
that since he took office in 1993 we have had seven years of 
social deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois solemnly pledges to make the 
necessary representations to the federal government, asking that 
it alleviate the harm it has caused to hundreds of thousands of 
women, men and children, by making the fight against poverty a 
priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister went to Germany to say that people 
who advocate tax relief have an agenda of greed.  He could not be 
more wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greed is when one takes more than one is entitled to, more than 
one has actually earned.  If that describes anyone, it describes 
the Prime Minister and the Liberal government.  It is the Prime 
Minister and his government who are guilty of greed when they 
force people earning less than $20,000 a year to pay $7 billion a 
year in income taxes.  It is the Prime Minister and his 
government who are guilty of greed when they tax people so 
heavily that investments, jobs and young people are driven out of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is guilty of greed when it taxes people so 
heavily that both parents are forced to go out into the 
workforce, one just to pay the taxes.  It is greed when the 
government uses its power to overtax, to hand grants to its 
friends and to pour money into Liberal ridings in a transparent 
attempt to lever themselves back into power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve to keep a lot more of the money they work so 
hard for and honestly earn.  That is not greed; that is justice. 
I urge Canadians to join with the Canadian Alliance in the next

started as a cub reporter and worked through the ranks to become 
the business leader of that company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best part of this recognition of Ron Lenyk is that much of 
what Ron has done and continues to do is done in anonymity.  He 
is well known for just getting the job done, inspiring those who 
work with him and spending countless hours helping people.  He is 
a great choice for the business award and is quick to give 
everyone around him the credit for his success.  Maybe that is 
the secret.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the secrecy, deception and lack of transparency associated with 
free trade negotiations seems to be getting worse over time under 
the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Free Trade of 
the Americas Agreement would not be on the table at the OAS 
meeting in Windsor.  Yet we know the OAS is part of the 
secretariat for the FTAA and when the Prime Minister spoke to the 
OAS, he could hardly talk about anything else but trade.  Why the 
dodge about the relationship between the OAS and the FTAA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago we found out that the Business Council on 
National Issues had been quietly negotiating a free trade deal 
with Japan.  As CAW president Buzz Hargrove rightly observed, big 
business has decided to eliminate the middle man, that is 
government, and negotiate these deals itself.  No more is there 
to be even the charade of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OAS event in Windsor and the BCNI in Japan are all part of 
the same pathology.  Pro free trade politicians meet behind 
barricades to protect themselves from the people because they are 
now openly and shamelessly taking their orders from the corporate 
sector.  The Liberals should either build the metal fences even 
higher or reclaim their role as representatives of the people, 
one or the other.

last Thursday in the House two hon. members of the Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>In referring to the type of immigration system, the hon. member 
for Souris—Moose Mountain said, “We want the system we had in 
the last century that brought people into the country.  We had no 
immigration problems with law.  We had no immigration problems 
with unemployment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the immigration system we had in place in the last 
century.  A head tax was placed on Chinese nationals.  Parliament 
passed legislation which prohibited all Chinese from voting even 
if they were Canadian citizens.  Finally, restrictions were 
placed on the number of Chinese and East Indians coming to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were not the only such remarks made.  The hon. member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands said that the real problem in the 
immigration department is the refugees who arrive in Canada.  He 
further stated that we were doing these refugees a service by 
sending them back.

modernize Canada's grain handling system but instead of looking

million in the pockets of producers with a commercially 
accountable contract driven system, the Liberal government has 
chosen to look to the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite giving producers short term relief for freight costs, 
the so-called reforms in Bill C-34 will only entrench the 
inefficiencies and incompetence that have dominated western 
Canada's grain transportation since the turn of the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have 
shown that excessive government red tape is a serious impediment 
to improving productivity in the agriculture sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to reduce the role of the Canadian Wheat Board, the

there was a two day meeting of 40 top HRD officials; and on

</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this document and record of intense activity and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

“Note to file:  Minister Stewart was briefed on hot issues only 
at her request.  She preferred knowing what balls were in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has told the House 
repeatedly, and again today, that she was not made aware of the 
problems in her department until November 17, 1999, although she 
was sworn in on August 3 of that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister have us believe that, when she first took up 
her duties, she did not receive this kind of briefing from her 
deputy minister?  Did nobody warn her about what was going on in 
her department?  Was there never any mention of the final report 
of October 5 before November 17?  Is that really what the 
minister would have us believe?

news.  They are a matter of public record.  We have been through 
this on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was briefed on November 17.  At that time I indicated that I 
wanted a stronger response from the department.  When that was 
complete we made the internal audit public.  Since that time 
considerable work has been undertaken in the department, not only 
to share with the House where grants and contributions are—and I 
repeat that they are in every riding of members of the House—but 
also we have reviewed 17,000 files and found that there is $6,500 
outstanding.

we have obtained through access to information to prove what we 
have been saying for several weeks, if not months, now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is not new are the minister's evasive answers.  What is not 
new is her wish to conceal the facts, and what went on in her 
department.

fact that I and my department made clear to them that there were 
improvements we could make in managing our paper.  We made that 
public.  I think what Canadians appreciate is that we have a plan 
of action that is supported by the auditor general to ameliorate 
the difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what Canadians also know when they look at the report 
that I made to the standing committee is that this is not about 
$1 billion missing, as the opposition continues to suggest.

improve its administrative practices in support of the grants and 
contributions that make such a difference in the lives of—

tightening around the neck of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 14, 1999, a preliminary report was tabled.  On July 27, 
40 public servants from all over Canada were brought to Ottawa, 
to the department, to be briefed on what was going on in Human 
Resources Development Canada.  On August 3, the minister was 
sworn in and received a briefing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can she have us believe that neither the PMO nor the former 
minister, who was aware of the situation, nor the Deputy 
Minister, who organized meetings of staff to inform them, could 
not have taken the trouble to inform her, the minister, the 
person supposedly responsible for the department, that there was 
a problem at Human Resources Development Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

the department was doing preliminary work on an internal audit 
that was not complete until late in the fall.  Indeed, the 
department made sure that the audit was finished and the 
management response which they wanted to provide me was complete 
before they brought it to me.  That is the appropriate process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I received their work I said that I wanted a stronger 
management report.  That was prepared and when that was done we 
made the whole thing public.  Subsequent to that we have made 
significant progress in improving the administration of grants 
and contributions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we see 
happening today is enough to make a person totally lose hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either the minister is the one who co-ordinated the game of 
hide-and-seek that has been going on in Human Resources 
Development Canada for more than a year now, or she has been the 
puppet of the PMO and of her own Deputy Minister, who preferred 
to bring 40 public servants together from all over Canada in 
order to speak to them of the problems at HRDC instead of 
speaking to the new minister about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either way, whether she is the puppet or the puppet master, she 
must resign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again let me convey to him the process as it was undertaken. 
The department was completing an internal audit.  In the context 
of that it was doing preliminary work.  Beyond that, once the 
internal audit was complete, and once the management response was 
prepared, it was provided to me and I received a full briefing on 
November 17.

week the Deputy Prime Minister assured the House that the focus 
of the OAS meetings in Windsor would be human security, not the 
trade agenda.  He said that issues like the case of Francisco 
Ramirez would be on the agenda.  He is the Colombian labour 
leader who was being pursued by paramilitary death squads.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister outlined the government's 
approach to this matter, and contrary to the assertion of my 
friend opposite, the economic agenda did not dominate, as the 
Deputy Prime Minister said last week.  Human rights and democracy 
were foremost on the minds of all there and were mentioned by the 
Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister talked about the 
inclusiveness of societies in the OAS empowering citizens to deal 
with civil society.  He talked about people not being left behind 
by the technological revolution.  He wanted all people to share 
in the benefits of society.

the backbone of the government to provide some input on human 
rights issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 90 trade union leaders in Colombia alone have been murdered 
in the past year.  Assurances were given that the human rights

we discussed in the throne speech.  The second point is human 
rights, which it is important.  Democracy is an important issue 
also.  The third point is the inclusion of civil society on the 
agenda.  The fourth point is the agenda for the next summit of

Mr. Speaker, the recent disclosure by a staff member in the 
office of the Minister of Human Resources Development indicates 
that the problems in her department were known as early as 
October 20, and many would suggest earlier.  On February 9 I 
asked the minister to inform Canadians on exactly what date she

Mr. Speaker, given the spinning, the nuancing and the attempts 
that have been made to backdate this, it is clearly impossible 
that the minister's office would not have kept such politically 
explosive information from her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is equally impossible to believe that someone did not tell 
the minister at least verbally that there was a serious problem 
within that department.  Does the minister feel that Canadians 
can be misled and fooled into believing that she did not know 
this problem— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Let us stay away from words 
such as misled.  I want the member to go directly to his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  It is down to a matter of trust.  Does 
the minister believe that Canadians should trust her answer, 
given what has transpired in her department on her watch? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

E-mails were exchanged but that is the process as it would be 
normally undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say to the hon. member that it is clear.  It is in the 
public record that my briefing was on November 17.  There is 
nothing in the information that is being brought forward today 
that suggests anything otherwise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

chooses when she talks about when she was first aware of the 
problems in her department.  She keeps saying that prior to 
November 17 there was only preliminary work done on the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the briefing schedule for the minister that we received 
through access to information it says that on the afternoon of 
August 9 she received briefings on the transitional jobs fund, 
the Canada jobs fund, and grants and contributions because those 
were the hot issues of the day and the minister wanted to be 
briefed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did she or did she not receive a briefing on August 9 about 
those hot issues, the transitional jobs fund—

<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

occasions right in the House.  I have said that indeed I talked 
and was concerned about specific projects from the transitional 
jobs fund and from the Canada jobs fund.  There were many other 
issues of great concern to me as a new minister in this 
portfolio, and we talked about those as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here are the facts.  We know the HRD officials had a 
crisis management meeting in late July.  On August 9 the minister 
received a briefing on the hot issues facing her department.  We 
assume it included that information.  On September 23 the media 
lines about audit were on the way to her office.  On October 20 a 
key aide to the minister was aware of the audit.  By November 5 
even the Clerk of the Privy Council knew about the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knew about the boondoggle audit before November 17 
and yet she told Canadians something different, or she was the 
last one in the entire government to know about it.  Which is it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing new here.  The facts 
remain as they are.  Indeed an audit was being undertaken in the 
department.  Work was being done as a result of preliminary 
results of that audit.  That is fully appropriate.  I was briefed 
on the whole audit and the management response once that work was 
completed.  That was on November 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is critically important here is that we, once the 
management response was strengthened, provided information to 
Canadians that we had a problem, that we were prepared to deal 
with it, that we were going to fix it, and we are doing just 
that.

discussed it.  E-mails were sent.  Officials from the various 
regions of Canada met to discuss it, but she was not aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine that, when she joined the department, they said “Not a

funny about trying to get people to believe such totally crazy

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

was all about.  It was not about money.  We have shown that the 
money is clearly invested in programs right across the country, 
even in the hon. member's riding.  What it was about was missing 
paperwork, important paperwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made it clear to the Canadian public that we had an issue 
there.  We have made it clear to the Canadian public that we have

<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

mishandling and mismanagement of tax dollars.  Not only was the

and continued to write cheques for a further $425 million without 
changing a single procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A responsible minister would have suspended the program until it 
was accountable, not this minister.  She just kept right on

means one of two things:  Either the minister has no idea what is

answers remain the same.  There is nothing new here despite the 
sinister suggestions of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about mundane scheduling.  This is about the process of

British Columbia Court of Appeal on June 30, 1999 dismissed the 
appeal to reinstate subsection 163.1(4) of the criminal code,

Columbia is now legal.  The petitioners state that the well-being 
and safety of children are in jeopardy.  Therefore, the 
petitioners call upon parliament to invoke section 33 of the 
charter of rights and freedoms, commonly known as the 
notwithstanding clause, to override the B.C. court of appeal 
decision, and to reinstate subsection 163.1(4) of the criminal 
code, making the possession of child pornography in British 
Columbia illegal, and by so doing reinforce and affirm our 
objection to the B.C. court of appeal decision.

Speaker, when I was interrupted by question period I was going 
through the 62 different tax increases which the Liberals have 
brought in since they formed the government in 1993.  I was 
looking at what type of money the Liberals had brought in with 
the tax increases and what they were doing with that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about the tax increases which were implemented in 1994 
and 1995.  In 1996 the Liberals increased personal income taxes 
11 times and took $260 million out of the pockets of individual 
taxpayers.  They did that through an RRSP contribution limit 
freeze, which broke an election promise I might add.  Then they 
went to pension plan contribution limits being frozen, once again 
breaking an election promise.  Then they forced seniors to begin 
early withdrawals from their RRSPs.  Then the Liberals forced 
seniors to begin early withdrawals from their RPPs.  It gets 
better. The Liberals went on to eliminate the deductibility of 
administration fees for RRSPs.  They forced people to pay for the 
fees, which they had not done before.  They then went on to 
eliminate the deductibility of administration fees for RRIFs. 
The Liberals took $260 million out of people's pockets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I previously commented on something else the Liberals did in 
1996.  They increased taxes on Canadian pensioners abroad.  They 
fleeced seniors for another $10 million.  They did not just stop 
with individual income tax increases.  No, the Liberals had more 
on their agenda.  They increased the burden by $10 million on the 
overseas employment tax credit for people who could not find a 
job in Canada, probably due to high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always raises the question, with $260 million in personal 
income tax increases and $70 million in three corporate tax 
increases which the Liberals brought in in 1996, for a total 
increased tax burden of $330 million, what types of things did 
the Liberals do with that extra $330 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a program in Prince Edward Island called “I want to be 
a millionaire”.  It cost $31,000.  Six average taxpayers had to 
pay their full tax bills just so the Liberals could have that 
program.  What they did not tell people was that the government 
was making a number of people millionaires that year, and they 
happened to be the cronies and friends of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That program was not how to raise money for Jean, or somebody 
with that first name.  It was not about raising money for the 
Prime Minister, and therefore getting all sorts of lucrative 
contracts.  That was not what that program was about, but that is 
the reality of it.  These Liberals are very good about lining the 
pockets of those who support them, and lining the pockets of the 
friends of the Prime Minister.  It does not even matter if they 
are Canadians.  They can be overseas for all they care.  They 
make sure that they look after their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone gives a couple of thousand dollars to the Prime 
Minister's campaign in Shawinigan, it is a sure bet there will be 
a sweet deal on a hotel or something else.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else did the Liberals spend the $330 million on that they 
took out of taxpayers in 1996?  They spent $100,000 to establish 
an 18-hole golf course in Sudbury.  That is pretty serious money 
for the average person.  As a matter of fact, 21 taxpayers had to 
pay to the government income tax on everything they made. 
Twenty-one people paid tax to establish the golf course in 
Sudbury.  There are plenty of golf courses which the government 
has subsidized.  Sudbury is but one of a long list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What business is it of the government to take money from 21 
hard-working Canadians, their full tax bills, to subsidize golf 
courses?  How do the Liberals account for that type of spending? 
Is that the justification they use for $330 million more in the 
form of tax increases in 1996?  They ought to hang their heads in 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the most egregious of all.  What did the Liberal 
Party of Canada receive from the taxpayer?  How much did the 
taxpayers who never voted Liberal contribute to the Liberal 
Party?  Over $2 million in a tax subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These budget bills are a sham.  What the Liberals do not say is 
that they have hiked taxes 62 times since they took office in 
1993.  There have been 27 corporate tax increases, 22 personal 
income tax increases, six bracket creep increases and seven 
Canada pension plan increases.  What was all of this for?  It was 
for sex changes for soldiers, an unelected Senate, a fountain in 
Shawinigan, the Prime Minister's cronies, dumb blonde joke books, 
<I>Bubbles Galore</I>, meat dresses, HRDC boondoggles, studies for 
lawn ornaments, Bombardier, other forms of corporate welfare, as 
well as $200 million which was wasted in the budgetary estimate 
of HRDC.  Shame on the government for taking that money from 
taxpayers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I think I heard pretty well the hon. member's entire 
speech and I am not sure whether he mentioned anything about the 
debt burden that exists today.  He spent a lot of time talking 
about tax increases, where government is misspending its money 
and those kinds of things.  I was very sympathetic to what he had 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I kept thinking of our new grandson who just came into the 
world.  I look at that little boy and think about the debt burden 
he is carrying as a newborn child on the Canadian scene.  We are 
getting nothing for that.  We are paying interest charges of 
something like $40 billion or $42 billion a year.  That is 
roughly half of what we need to pay for our health care expenses 
on an annual basis in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague say something about the need for a plan to do 
two things?  First, there is a need to balance the budget.  Then 
there is a need to pay down the debt, and not in a happenstance 
kind of way where if we happen to have a little money left over 
we will pay down the debt a bit.  Should there not be a 
systematic plan that would reduce the debt so that the burden on 
young children coming into the world today will be reduced 
somewhat?  Could he comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question 
of my hon. colleague.  I would just like to say that I think the 
problem is even worse than what has been laid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pay about $42 billion a year in debt payments, in interest on 
the national debt of Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the Liberals 
across the way who helped to drag this country through the muck. 
It is just the tip of the iceberg.  It means that we are looking 
at about $20,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. 
The sad fact is that our demographics are such that not everyone 
will pay that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my hon. colleague and his grandchildren, the $600 billion 
that Canada owes right now as a federal debt will be multiplied 
because of unfunded liabilities with regard to the Canada pension 
plan, land claims, irresponsible management in the country, and a 
demographic bubble that will burst in 2017 with regard to the 
aged and health care expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and these Liberals are sleepwalking into a $2 
trillion debt in upcoming years.  That means that for youngsters 
out there such as the grandchildren of my colleague it will not 
be owing a mere $20,000.  I want to let the grandchildren of 
today know that it will be closer to $100,000 which they will 
pay.  That is sitting on them right now even if this government 
or any other government never charged a dollar more to the debt 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they get a university education, if they pursue 
post-secondary education and raise their expectations for their 
standard of living and their wages, as their high school guidance 
counsellors tell them to do, it will mean a $200,000 bill.  It is 
as if a house is sitting on their shoulders for which they will 
have to pay.  It is a house they will never own but it is a debt 
given to them by the Liberals.  Shame on them.

is certainly an honour to stand here to say a few words on Bill 
C-32.  Being a finance bill, it gives me a fair amount of 
flexibility.  As it is my first speech in the House, I would like 
to thank the people of St. John's West who let me come here to 
represent them in this great institution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years Newfoundland has been represented by some 
tremendous politicians in this Chamber.  I think of some great 
cabinet ministers.  We had the Hon. Don Jamieson.  We had the 
Hon. John Crosbie.  Of course now in cabinet we have the hon. 
member for Gander—Grand Falls.  As the great musical philosopher 
Meat Loaf would say, “Two out of three ain't bad”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pleasure to represent such a great district.  It 
is a province that has great riches but a province that has been 
treated very poorly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to be with you all today, to share my vision, 
my hopes, my dreams and my aspirations for this great country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However my dream of Canada is one where the provinces and the 
people are not only treated equally but are also treated fairly. 
Quite often to treat people equally does not mean that they are 
being treated fairly.  As we look across this great country it is 
so diverse there is no way that a made in Ottawa or made in 
central Canada solution is one that works in other parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have asked me if being sworn in a few days ago or 
being able to make my maiden speech today will be my most 
memorable moment in politics.  I have to say no.  The one moment 
in my political life that will always stand out was the moment in 
the House of Assembly in Newfoundland on the night when we were 
debating the Meech Lake accord, the night when eight of the ten 
provinces had agreed to the accord.  Out in Manitoba we had our 
friend waving his feather and holding up debate, yet knowing that 
the Manitoba legislature would agree to the Meech Lake accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our own house of assembly, despite the fact that many of us 
fought for the implementation of that great accord so that all of 
us could come together as a nation, the premier of our province 
pulled the plug when he saw the support of his own party slipping 
away.  He used the excuse that we were out of time.  That was the 
night that I thought the future of Canada changed.  I hope I am 
wrong but unfortunately I do not think I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is not that others are asking too much.  It is that 
sometimes some of us are willing to give too little.  I think in 
that case we lost a tremendous chance to unify this great 
country.  It may be some time before we get another.  However, if 
we treat people fairly rather than just say we are treating them 
equally, perhaps that chance will come again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use some of the topics in this bill to illustrate how my 
province of Newfoundland is being treated extremely unfairly.  We 
have CHST funding.  Before 1993 when the present government came 
into power, health care and post-secondary education were funded 
based on need.  Provinces that needed got.  Newfoundland at the 
time was a province in need, and we received a sufficient amount 
of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago the federal and provincial governments shared on a 
50:50 basis in funding health care.  Today in Newfoundland the 
federal input to our health care budget is only 15%.   We can 
just imagine what that does to the budget of a small province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the funding formula was changed to a per capita basis 
rather than a needs basis, most of the other provinces at least 
held what they had, if we factor in the cuts.  Many of them 
received increased funding because of increasing populations. 
Many provinces have increasing populations because the young 
people who are leaving Newfoundland and going to places like 
Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia.  These are young people of 
child bearing age who are not only adding themselves to the 
population but over the years will be adding their offspring to 
the population. 
The gain of other provinces is Newfoundland's loss.  We are not 
only left with a rapidly declining population.  We are left with 
an aging population.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the CHST funding was changed we got a double whammy.  We 
received fewer dollars and we have an aging population which eats 
up more of the health care dollars.  The statistics show that 
about 60% of our budget is spent on people 65 years of age and 
over.  Consequently we are suffering greatly from the change in 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we heard about the great one time supplement that was 
given to provinces.  Newfoundland received $42 million over four 
years.  That equates to a little over $10 million per year. 
Government members opposite will if that is not a tremendous 
extra addition to its budget.  Over the last six years, because 
of a change in formula, we have lost $750 million in CHST 
transfers. Is it any wonder that health care is in the state it 
is in?  The poorer the province, the worse off it is becoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CHST transfers also include funding for post-secondary 
education, an area where we have been extremely lax.  The 
greatest resource in our country is our young people.  We are 
forgetting that and we are ignoring them.  We are forgetting to 
invest in their futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the great demand on health care funding, much of the 
money designated to post-secondary education is swallowed up by 
the health care vacuum.  The dollars have to be put into health 
care.  The people who pay the price are those who should be the 
beneficiaries of post-secondary funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In countries such as Ireland and Iceland we see economies that 
have turned around tremendously.  We can talk about the effect of 
the European common market on Ireland and how well it is treated 
in relation to holding on to its royalty payments, et cetera. 
However, if we talk to officials in the Irish government they 
will tell us that the turnaround started when they started 
recognizing their primary investment should be in young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, because of the investment and because of the opportunity 
that every young man and woman has to become educated without any 
great costs, and in some cases without any costs, the Irish 
economy has turned around tremendously.  When industry beckoned 
they had a young, aggressive and educated workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask where is our young, aggressive and educated workforce.  In 
the case of Newfoundland, most of them are either moving to other 
parts of Canada or unfortunately along with our lobster friends 
in the other provinces are moving south of the border because 
they will make more money to offset the tremendous debt load upon 
leaving post-secondary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to grow a country.  The way to grow a 
country is to invest in our young people.  It is something that 
the present government has to think about and then act upon.  We 
are paying a heavy price now but we will pay a much greater price 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year we have heard about the federal government 
having to pay the banks millions and millions of dollars because 
of their input into the student loans program and their inability 
to collect some of the money owed to them.  Let us look at the 
horrendous service charges being suggested for handling loans for 
the government.  If we add up the amount of money we pay the 
banks, if we look at the tremendous amount of service charges we 
pay, and if we look at the money lost that young people cannot 
pay back, which quite often drives them into bankruptcy, would it 
not be a lot more sensible if we took the dollars we are throwing 
away and invested them directly into the education of our young? 
It does not make any sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days ago I asked the Minister of Finance a question about 
CHST transfers.  He basically sloughed it off by saying that the 
provinces were doing very well in equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Newfoundland is a very rich province. It 
is rich in its resources, its people and its potential. 
Unfortunately, as it develops its resources every dollar received 
from royalties for the development of its mines, its offshore oil 
and other industries, the federal government is there with its 
greedy hands to claw back anywhere from 75 cents to 90 cents of 
every dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we went to work today and made $100 but on our way home 
someone took $75, $80 or $90 from that $100, how could we 
advance, progress and improve our lot in life?  The answer is 
that we could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use the European experience.  As Ireland started to 
develop, the European common market had the sense to let it hold 
on to some of its own royalties so that it could invest in itself 
until it reached a certain plateau where it was equal with 
everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Newfoundland was allowed to keep the money that its people 
earned, it could be a have province instead of being looked upon 
by many as the poor cousin in the country.  Newfoundland is not 
the poor cousin.  It could be a rich cousin.  It could be a major 
contributor to this nation if this nation treated it fairly, not 
equally with a blanket rule made in central Canada, but fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labrador has major power developments.  A contract was signed on 
the Upper Churchill years ago with our friends from Quebec.  As 
we have been told by everyone, including the courts, a contract 
is a contract and we cannot blame our friends for that. 
Presently Newfoundland gets about $10 million out of that 
contract each year in profits.  Quebec gets closer to $1 billion. 
Hopefully, as we negotiate the Lower Churchill and with the help 
and input of the federal government, the deal will be fairer and 
all partners will benefit.  That is the way it should be in the 
Confederation of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government allows provinces like Alberta to 
feed its pipelines through other provinces and have access to 
markets, it is unfortunate that it refuses to let Newfoundland 
have a power corridor through Quebec so that it can send power to 
the markets on the eastern seaboard.  That is something for 
another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about fairness and equality let us look at the CBC. 
Yesterday my colleague from St. John's East and I had the 
opportunity to attend a rally sponsored by Friends of the CBC in 
St. John's, Newfoundland.  Hundreds of people come out to tell 
the government that they do not want their evening news programs 
cut.  Newfoundland and Labrador are spread out over a very large 
geographical area and the news coverage from that area is perhaps 
the only thing many of the hardworking people in Newfoundland get 
to see.  Everyone looks forward to the evening news because it is 
local, it is relevant and it is news from all over our great 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now recapitulating a bit and is telling us 
that we can have half the program.  It is saying that half a loaf 
is better than none and that we should be glad of it.  Half is 
not good enough if the news program is very successful and very 
popular.  Half or maybe none might be good enough in an area 
where the evening news programs are not even watched.  I have no 
problem with programs being cut if nobody wants them.  However, I 
do have a problem with programs being cut that are essential to 
the culture, the history and the people of the province when that 
program is one of the most popular in the province. 
Hopefully the government will get some sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not blaming the board of directors at CBC.  They can only 
do what they can with the money they have.  In this case the 
money comes from here.  It is the federal minister's 
responsibility to ensure that the CBC has enough funding for 
areas, and there are many across this great country, rural areas 
in particular, where their needs are best served by local 
programming, and in many cases that is sponsored by the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the infrastructure.  We have a harbour in St. 
John's, the first harbour to which any boat sailed to the island, 
if we look at it from the time of the European discovery in 1497. 
It is the oldest city in the province.  It wreaks of sewage 
simply because this government has failed to come up with its 
share of the money to clean up the harbour.  The municipalities 
have come to the table.  The province has expressed its 
willingness to come to the table.  The hesitancy is from the 
one-third input of the federal government.  If the federal 
government came to the table, this major problem could be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adjacent cities of St. John's and Mount Pearl are the first 
stop basically for most people coming to our great province, a 
province that has more tourism potential than any other place in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own district, which surrounds St. John's, the southern shore, 
St. Mary's and Placentia Bay, are the oldest settled parts in 
North America.  Every few miles there are a variety of 
attractions.  Walking along the shore we can see major icebergs 
sculptured as only Michelangelo could do.  We can watch whales in 
their natural environment and caribou on the opposite side in 
their natural environment.  There are birds, salmon rivers, 
historic sites, old fortifications and great archaeological digs 
of the colony that Baltimore settled in Ferryland.  We have some 
550 million year old fossils at Mistaken Point and the world 
renowned bird sanctuary at Cape St. Mary's.  I could go on and 
on.  These are all within a few miles of a major capital city, a 
city that with some help from the federal government could be a 
clean and beautiful city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the fair treatments for which we are looking.  In 
transportation, Newfoundland, being an island, is now being held 
hostage by two monopolies.  Marine Atlantic is the only ferry 
service to our island and over this last couple of years we have 
had our battles.  This year a fast ferry has been serving us when 
the weather is good.  Unfortunately, next year we will revert to 
a slow ferry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey done during the week showed that everybody thought the 
service by Air Canada had been downgraded.  It is more expensive 
and much worse than it was.  There is a need for fishery 
research.  We are a rich province but we need help, co-operation 
and we need to be treated fairly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, in the days, months and years to come, we will 
continue to work together for a strong and united Canada and a 
better one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If people think we cannot have a better Canada, I refer them to

not happen under just the Liberal Party.  They happened when the 
Mulroney Conservatives were in power from 1984 to 1993.  They 
started the cuts and the Liberals continued them.  Does the hon. 
member agree with the 1997 platform of the Conservative Party of 
further cuts to the CBC? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire him and the member for St. John's East who went to the 
Friends of the CBC rally.  I do hope they are able to change the 
way the Conservative Party thinks and stands up for public 
broadcasting in this country from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's own party leader said that he supported Ralph 
Klein's bill 11 and that he also supported advocates of two tier 
health care in this country.  We know that in Newfoundland and 
Labrador the majority of people when polled were dead against a 
two tiered health care system.  Being a long term parliamentarian 
in his own provincial legislature, the member for St. John's West 
should know very clearly what a two tier health care system would 
do to the people of the outports whom he so eloquently defended 
right here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member advocate further cuts to the CBC as his party's 
platform did in 1997?  Does he support his party leader's 
approach to a two tier health care system in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Madam Speaker, first, let me say to my 
hon. colleague that I visit his province fairly often.  My son 
attends Dalhousie University, which is in Nova Scotia, and I 
visit him about three times a year.  I would ask him to 
reciprocate by making that many trips to my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the hon. member's two questions, he was not 
listening very carefully when I spoke.  When I talked about the 
CBC, I said that if there are areas in the country where cuts are 
necessary, if people are no longer watching and the CBC wants to 
cut programs, then it is up to the people.  However, in areas 
such as rural Newfoundland, and Newfoundland generally, the 
evening news is an extremely popular program.  Therefore I 
certainly do not support cuts in the areas where the market is 
there, nor should anybody else.  I see that the hon. member 
agrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the two tier health care system, again if he had 
listened carefully to what our leader said at the time of the 
fiasco in Alberta—and perhaps it is the Premier of Alberta 
taking out a membership in the Alliance that has coloured his 
thinking—our leader said that he could not blame the local 
provinces for looking at ways to help their people because of the 
cuts imposed by the government.  However, our party stands firmly 
against any two tier system in health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
listening to the speech by our new member in the House, and at 
one point he spoke of the agreement Quebec concluded with 
Newfoundland on the development of Churchill Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He deplored the fact that, in this agreement, few benefits 
remained for Newfoundland.  Perhaps I misunderstood and he could 
enlighten me, but he seemed to be blaming Quebec for being 
greedy in signing this contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that no one wanted to support 
Newfoundland in its efforts to build the dam and develop 
hydro-electric power: neither New York—the Americans—nor the 
Canadians, nor Ottawa.  Only Quebec supported Newfoundland at 
the time.  Although Quebec set rigorous conditions for 
Newfoundland, no one else would have been satisfied with them, 
they would have demanded more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we have to go back.  It was many years ago.  Quebec helped 
Newfoundland at that time and is prepared to do so again with 
the development of hydroelectric power at the border between 
Labrador and Quebec.

the hon. member did not hear me or he did not understand me 
clearly when I spoke about the old upper Churchill contract which 
was signed many years ago before my involvement in politics.  I 
said quite clearly that a contract is a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think <I>Hansard</I> will show that I do not blame my friends 
from Quebec.  They signed a binding contract.  It is not their 
fault.  It is to their advantage that power rates increased.  We 
had settled for a flat rate.  I have never, nor have we ever, 
blamed the people of Quebec for this.  In fact, the future 
developments in our country especially as they relate to hydro 
power will be successful if there is a good friendly partnership 
between Newfoundland and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to my comments on Meech Lake, again I say to him that 
a lot of people in our province would love to see Quebec play a 
much more important partnership role within this great country of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-32.  It is an honour to 
represent the constituents of Saanich—Gulf Islands and British 
Columbia.  This bill is the budget implementation act which gives 
us a lot of latitude on what we speak about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we lead from the front. Quite often in this 
Chamber we do not put forward what Canadians, especially the 
younger generation, really want to see, how we will provide them 
with alternatives, how we will allow them to fulfil their dreams 
and aspirations and how they can become excited about this great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues spoke about the endless tax increases, 
particularly the employment tax increases that have occurred 
since the Liberals took power in 1993.  I am very enthusiastic 
about what the official opposition, the Canadian Alliance, has to 
offer the Canadian people.  A lot of work has gone into it and it 
is being reflected in the polls.  We are seeing dramatic 
increases daily.  There is a lot of encouragement that Canadians 
are ready for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first and foremost change that will come is a single tax 
rate.  We call it solution 17.  Our opponents, from the 
Progressive Conservatives to their friends in the NDP, are 
criticizing us for this.  They have said that we will cut taxes 
only for the wealthy.  Nothing could be further from the truth. 
I will go into a few of the specific details about solution 17, 
the single rate tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that Canada has three marginal tax 
rates:  17%, 26% and 29%.  We propose to bring those down to a 
single federal marginal tax rate of 17% which would provide tax 
savings for every single taxpayer in the country.  Most 
important, it is going to provide the greatest tax relief for the 
poorest taxpayers, those with the lowest incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important not only to emphasize the 17%, but we also 
propose to increase the basic spousal exemption from $6,000 to 
$10,000 each for adults who stay at home. 
That gives two adults $20,000 without any of the other numerous 
deductions which they can apply, such as their RRSP deductions, 
before they pay a dime in federal tax.  What is the net effect of 
that?  That is going to take 1.9 million, almost two million of 
our poorest off the tax rolls.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands has many people in 
retirement.  They go there because of the mild winters.  It is on 
the south end of Vancouver Island.  There are many seniors in the 
income range of $20,000 to $30,000 who are struggling and they 
are paying federal income tax.  The Canadian Alliance believes 
that is wrong and that these people should not be paying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize the importance of raising children and that 
there is a significant cost to it.  We would like to recognize 
that by bringing in for the first time a child tax deduction of 
$3,000 per child.  Let us look at a family of four with an income 
of somewhere between $26,000 and $30,000. They are still eligible 
for the deductions but their basic exemption would be $10,000 for 
each adult plus $3,000 for each child. They would be able to earn 
up to $30,000 before one cent in federal income tax was paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how anyone could say that is providing tax relief 
for the rich.  The biggest beneficiaries of our solution 17 will 
be the taxpayers with the lowest income. We will take them right 
off the tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that there is another thing taxpayers want, 
especially the younger generation.  I got into politics and ran 
in 1997 because the dreams and the aspirations of our younger 
generation had been shattered. They are frustrated. Our best and 
brightest are flocking to the south.  People will come up with 
numbers and say that there is not that big of a brain drain, but 
the very best are going, the brightest ones. That is what 
concerns me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic engine of our country 10 to 15 years from now, the 
future CEOs, the future entrepreneurs who will create the jobs 
are the ones who are leaving. In my own family, of my siblings 
and my wife's siblings, there is one who works in the United 
States now and there are two others.  Almost half of them are in 
the process or have at least applied for positions in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the right government and the right policies in place we can 
attract investment and Canada can be number one.  We could make 
those younger people in the United States want to come to Canada. 
We could have the younger generation of Americans say, “Would I 
ever like to live in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are putting forward.  That is why there is so 
much encouragement within the Canadian Alliance.  That 
encouragement is solely because of our policies and leadership 
and what we are able to provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear some of my colleagues from the New Democratic Party 
laughing.  I encourage them to come to British Columbia.  I will 
take them out there myself.  They can talk to British Columbians 
about the leadership the New Democratic Party has provided in 
British Columbia.  I say that in all seriousness.  It has been an 
unmitigated disaster. In any event, I am not here to talk about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a paragraph from WEFA.  The Canadian Alliance put 
its plan out very early, well in advance of an election, because 
we wanted our hon. friends from all parties to scrutinize it.  We 
also gave our solution 17 to WEFA which is one of the leading 
economic forecasting agencies in the country.  In fact Mr. Orr 
does the economic forecasting for the Minister of Finance.

Anyone watching who would like to learn more about this should

was instrumental in developing solution 17. I am going to read 
the conclusion in its entirety: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax reduction proposals...are well focused on the needs of 
Canadians today.  They expand the economy, and most powerfully: 
personal disposable income, consumption and our standard of 
living.  They create jobs.  By lowering the marginal tax rates 
they are particularly effective in stimulating work effort, and 
stemming the brain drain and other productivity enhancing 
features.  By powerfully reducing the level of personal income 
tax, particularly for Canadians of average and above average 
income, they are well directed at providing a more competitive 
tax environment in Canada relative to the U.S.  They focus 
precisely and effectively on “bracket creep”, raising the Basic 
Personal Exemption, particularly affecting the lowest income 
taxpayers, by much more than the rate of inflation:  by 
eliminating the current 26% and 29% marginal tax rates, any 
bracket creep relating to these rates is eliminated.  The issue 
of fairness is addressed, not only by the elimination of bracket 
creep, but by honouring the original policy intentions of the 5% 
“deficit reduction” surtax and reducing EI premiums to be 
consistent with EI policy...the tax reduction proposals of the 
Reform Party are affordable.  If all of the tax reduction 
proposals are introduced as a combined package, over the 2000-01 
to 2004-05 period, there would still be a fiscal surplus in each 
and every year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was done by Dale Orr and Bob Dugan from WEFA. It speaks 
volumes.  WEFA is an independent forecasting agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put in some other features in our solution 17 which I am 
very proud of.  We are the first party to actually have a plan 
for debt reduction as a line item in our budget.  We have put a 
line item in the budget because we believe there has to be a 
plan, just like the plan we all have to pay down our mortgages. 
We cannot go on year after year saying, as the current government 
does, that if there is any money left over, we may consider 
putting it on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the economy is strong, we need to pay down the debt. We 
have made a commitment to pay down $35 billion on the debt. We 
have made a commitment to narrow the surplus down to $3 billion a 
year.  That is something the government has not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call it leading from the front.  It is very important that we 
put these proposals out there.  Obviously Canadians are equally 
pleased, as the Canadian Alliance's popularity is rising every 
day in the polls while the Liberal government's popularity drops. 
Canadians want a change.  They want to fulfil their dreams.  I 
know we will be able to deliver and provide what they are looking 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at other areas.  Taxation alone is not going to 
solve the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we are debating the budget implementation act, but if we 
are going to solve future budget issues in the country we have to 
have a much more open and democratic process in the House.  There 
are 301 members here.  We have to bring in the ideas of all 
members so that when we debate the budget they can have 
meaningful participation instead of only a handful of people who 
surround the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circle of influence is so small.  I have often said that we 
live in a democracy. What is that?  We get to go to the polls 
once every four years to democratically elect a dictator. 
That is not right.  That is wrong.  We need to change that.  We 
need to extrapolate on the great ideas of members of the House 
and allow them to have meaningful participation in the debate. We 
are committed to making those changes to allow a more democratic 
process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After being in Ottawa for three years I believe one of the 
problems is that the bureaucracy feeds on itself through no fault 
of is own.  It is the fault of the government.  It grows and 
grows and grows.  The government has a system that encourages it 
to grow.  It is wildly out of control as is witnessed by the $1 
billion boondoggle.  We hear those stories daily.  I know members 
on the other side will say no, but the fact is that $1 billion 
can go out without even being accounted for.  We are told that 
the government did not even have applications for 35% of that $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the department of HRDC.  It is rampant throughout 
ministries within the government.  We heard an earlier reference 
to a grant from the Department of Canadian Heritage to write a 
book on dumb blonde jokes.  I believe there was a grant to the 
Canada Arts Council from the government to hang dead rabbits on 
trees because it was considered art.  The list goes on and on and 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are in absolute disbelief about this kind of spending. 
I appreciate it was not the ministers who actually read these 
applications and said they would be great expenditures of 
taxpayer money.  However they are accountable for this money. 
Bureaucracy has been blown completely out of control and needs to 
be brought back in line so that there is accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way that we can allow Canadians to fulfil their dreams 
and achieve their aspirations is economic growth.  We have talked 
about our tax policy at length, solution 17, but there are other 
things that are absolutely curtailing economic growth and 
frustrating people such as employment taxes.  Employment taxes 
have increased.  I know government members would say they 
recently decreased the EI contribution rates, and I say only 
minimally, but they have not told us that they have increased 
Canada pension plan premiums even more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it ironic.  We are speaking to Bill C-32, the Budget 
Implementation Act.  The Minister of Finance claims $58 billion 
in tax relief.  If we look at some of the numbers, they are 
consistent with what the government has done in the past.  How 
does it make up that $58 billion in tax relief?  This is mind 
boggling for me.  It is bringing in the $29.5 billion increased 
Canada pension plan premiums.  If we factor those into the 
additional taxes we are paying, it cuts that amount in half.  It 
did not bring that into the picture.  It cherry picked what it 
put into the $58 billion.  It does not tell us the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, the government cancelled planned tax increases in 
the years ahead, tax increases that have not yet happened. Tax 
increases that were slated for years to come have been cancelled. 
That is part of its $58 billion tax relief package.  Can we 
imagine?  Last year the government said that it would raise taxes 
by 5%, 10% and then 15% and then cancelled those tax increases 
and called it tax relief?  It is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we had change.  We seem to be going in election 
mode.  The government goodie bag is revving up its engines and 
starting to make announcements of hundreds of millions of 
dollars.  The Liberals believe they can fool the Canadian people 
and buy their way back into power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a new millennium and Canadian people will not accept 
that any longer.  They want people to lead from the front.  If we 
want to have the social programs that are so dear to us such as 
our national health care system, the only way we will be able to 
afford a sustainable health care system in the decades to come is 
through wealth created by the private sector.  The government can 
have a strong tax base and the only way that will happen is if it 
provides the right environment for the private sector to 
flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has those opportunities.  I am very proud 
to be part of this new energy in the Canadian political 
landscape.  We are seeing it in spades across the country as my 
colleagues and I have travelled and worked on the leadership race 
within the Canadian Alliance.  It is very exciting for  us. It 
will be most exciting for Canadians who will be the largest 
beneficiaries.  It is time we brought back respect to this 
institution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the current member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands spoke about British Columbia.  I grew up in 
British Columbia.  It was a beautiful province then.  It is still 
a beautiful province.  I noticed that many people in his riding 
seem to do very well living in British Columbia so the government 
cannot be all bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also not help noticing that every time members of the 
Reform get up they talk about the best and brightest leaving the 
country.  I see the member for Sydney—Victoria, the member for 
Winnipeg Centre, the member for Dartmouth, myself, even my good 
friend from Lethbridge in his own party, the other member from 
Calgary and the member from Surrey are still here.  All the best 
and brightest have not left, as he stated 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, his party is right when we talk about taxes, 
tax reform and what to do about taxes in the new millennium. 
Every time Canadian Alliance members talk about what they have 
done, what they will do and how it will be, I cannot help but 
think of their promise with regard to Stornoway.  Their leader 
said he would turn it into a bingo hall, and quickly that promise 
was broken.  I shudder to think how many other promises would be 
broken if they ever formed government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands as a former 
fisheries committee member.  He never once mentioned the dreaded 
GST which all Canadians hate.  Would he not join us in the New 
Democratic Party, not physically but in terms of policy, in 
reducing the GST?  A break on the GST would be the fairest tax 
break for every Canadian from coast to coast to coast regardless 
of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will respond to a number 
of the member's points.  He stated that the NDP could not be all 
that bad in British Columbia.  We will let the voters of British 
Columbia judge that within the next 12 months and we will see the 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the best and brightest and referred to himself 
and a number of his colleagues and even some members in my party. 
We are here representing our constituents.  There are many good 
Canadians who are very frustrated and do not want to leave the 
country but are forced to do so to seek other opportunities.  I 
have had parents of children who graduated from university come 
into my office after taking their children to the airport in 
Victoria because they had accepted jobs in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  I ask the member in the NDP to give me a 
few minutes and show the same courtesy I showed him.  These 
parents are very upset that their children are going to the 
United States where they will probably end up being involved in 
relationships and having children there.  They want their 
grandchildren in Canada.  We can change that.  We can be the 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked specifically about the GST.  Let me get to 
that.  Had we been the government of the day, I am sure that is 
not something we would have done.  It is there now and I have to 
be very honest that we in the Canadian Alliance cannot promise to 
eliminate the GST.  We will not make promises that we cannot 
keep. 
We will give sound numbers.  There is one thing the Premier of 
Ontario, Mike Harris, has done that has not been done before by 
any government.  He did what he said he would do.

not like the GST we cannot eliminate it, but we are prepared to 
look at it.  We have provided solution 17 which we believe is the 
best opportunity to get the economy going.  It would allow 
Canadians to achieve their dreams and not punish them for doing 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a mentality in the government that wants to punish 
people who are successful.  As the economy gets going and as we 
are in our second, third and fourth terms of government we will 
be looking at everything.  It is very fluid.  I emphasize that we 
will not make promises we cannot keep.  We will deliver on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands.  Once 
again the Canadian Alliance Party is back on its kick of a flat 
tax.  Everyone in the Canadian Alliance dream world believes that 
everyone will get a tax break: from the poorest to the richest 
everyone will benefit from a flat tax.  Most of us know this is 
not possible.  I do not think we can fool the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start looking at the concept of a flat tax, the reality 
is that any of the so-called people who support that philosophy 
must find other ways of reducing revenue to make it work.  Most 
of us would understand that if we are collecting <I>x</I> numbers 
of dollars in revenue and personal income taxes today, in order 
to impose a flat tax there has to be a shift between taxpayers 
from poor people to the wealthy.  In other words, wealthier 
people would be paying significantly less tax and poor people 
would be paying more.  That is the way it has to happen.  There 
is no other way for it to be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Alliance members would have us not understand that they 
would also gut a lot of other programs.  We heard the member 
allude to private health care, the CBC and other things they 
would simply gut.  That is how it works.  They would gut 
government programs that people are now receiving.  Undoubtedly 
some the people in the low tax range who would benefit in his 
wonderful dream world are the people who would miss the services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do members of the Canadian Alliance not just come clean with 
people and tell the truth?  A flat tax will be a shift in taxes 
away from the wealthy to the middle income earners.  The only way 
to give everyone a tax break in a magical world is to gut 
government programs.  Why does the member not just admit that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me tell the House what 
we would gut.  We would not spend $500,000 building a fountain in 
the Prime Minister's riding.  We would not spend $1 billion on 
unaccountable grants from political slush funds to the 
government's friends and cronies.  That is what we would gut. 
That is what we would stop.  We would stop unaccountable 
spending.  That is number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with number two.  The numbers of the Minister of 
Finance show a $95 billion to $100 billion surplus over five 
years.  That is taxpayer money.  We would not rip off taxpayers. 
We would not take the money from them.  We would respect 
taxpayers and the money we take in.  We would make sure they get 
value for their dollars.  There is lots we can do.  Our numbers 
are sound and there would be surpluses each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would increase the money going to health care.  We would not 
have people dying on waiting lists as there are with the 
government.  That is what is wrong.  There are numerous 
departments with zero accountability.  There is unaccountability 
in the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
Something like $23,000 tax free was given to every native person 
in Canada, man, woman and child.  Yet they still live in 
abhorrent conditions because there is no accountability.  Those 
systems need to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government uses money to buy votes and provide slush funds. 
One-third of all grants went to people in the Prime Minister's 
riding and those people gave money back to the Liberal Party of 
Canada.

Madam Speaker, the hon. member made some very compelling

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he did not mention the need to start paying down the 
debt which previous governments over the last 20 years have 
incurred on behalf of all Canadians.  It is close to $600

interest, which does nothing for anyone.  With the threat of 
rising interest rates we have a ticking time bomb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be so good as to articulate a plan which would

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rose to speak to the first group of amendments on Friday 
of last week I said that it was not a pleasure.  At that point in 
time we were fighting.  We watched the government invoke closure 
on the bill at second reading.  We watched the work of the 
committee.  Witnesses were brought from Cape Breton.  It was 
suggested that amendments would be forthcoming, none of which 
were accepted at committee as the bill was railroaded through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this entire debate the witnesses, members of 
parliament, particularly the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton 
and myself, who came forward kept referring to the unfairness of 
the government's offer to the coal miners who had worked 
underground for so many years.  We kept referring to section 17 
of the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act, saying that if 
members read that section they would know that it was incumbent 
upon the government to offer a fair package.  At every turn the 
Liberal government rebuffed that argument and said there was no 
merit in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday of last week, while we were debating amendments in the 
House, an arbitrator filed with the Minister of Labour a decision 
regarding the Cape Breton Development Corporation as to whether 
the government's package was fair.  Let me read from that report, 
which references section 17.  For two and a half years we have 
been arguing that section 17 should be interpreted to provide the 
communities and the miners with a better deal.  Paragraph 38 of 
the binding arbitration agreement states:  “For the purposes of 
this arbitration I accept that I should strive insofar as 
possible to decide matters....In doing so, I must bear in mind 
the unique statutory requirement embodied in section 17 of the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation Act.  Regard must be had to 
the various public and private sector comparables referred to by 
the parties.  Since Devco is a public sector comparable, 
especially in light of the statutory obligation imposed on Devco 
pursuant to section 17”—and he goes on to make an award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The award will provide pensions for everyone who has worked in 
the mine for 25 years, regardless of age, which is something that 
we have been pressing the government to do from day one.  It took 
an arbitrator and the mining communities in Cape Breton to fight 
tooth and nail to get what should have been the opening offer of 
the government when it went into Cape Breton in January. 
Instead, miners' wives and families had to form an organization 
and travel to Ottawa at their own expense, culminating in a 
strike in January of this year.  The miners went underground by 
way of an illegal strike and broke the law to show the government 
that it was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if members of the Liberal Party understand what it 
was like to be in those communities for those days in January.  I 
know and the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton knows because we 
were at Prince Mine with the miners and their families.  We 
talked to Nova Scotia Power.  We were there when the RCMP brought 
a riot squad to the community where I have lived my whole life. 
It is a peaceful community.  We were there when the women and 
children, the families of the miners, had to decide whether they 
would stand in front of the Prince Mine and stop the Nova Scotia 
Power trucks from going in.  They struggled with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a responsible way, the miners said they would come out if the 
government would simply agree to binding arbitration.  The 
government, which was pinned down under the threat of violence in 
those communities, like something out of 1930, said “All right, 
we will agree to binding arbitration”.  The arbitrator said that 
the miners were right, that the package was unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start with that premise because we were right about the 
package. 
Now let us talk about the legislation.  I think we are right on 
that too.  If we could submit the government to binding 
arbitration, I believe that an arbitrator would say that none of 
the amendments proposed by the New Democrats to make this bill a 
better bill are unreasonable.  Let me cite what we are seeking 
with this group of amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the motions calls for at least one employee 
representative to sit on the board of the directors of the new 
Devco corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is a radical idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  That is radical, as my friend says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening, for those who are not aware, is that Bill 
C-11 will create a new Cape Breton Development Corporation, the 
purpose of which essentially will be to administer pensions, to 
deal with remediation and to deal with ongoing litigation. It 
will be a company that will gradually reduce in size as the 
obligations of the government through the crown corporation 
cease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought, why not have people from the community sit on the 
board of directors?  It makes sense to me.  The government will 
say that five of the current seven directors are from Cape 
Breton.  That is fair enough, but it is not mandated in the new 
legislation.  Why not mandate it?  That is the first 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason the Liberal members on the natural resources 
committee had a problem with that.  Every Liberal voted against 
an amendment similar to that, while all members of the opposition 
parties thought it was a good idea.  It was not just those of us 
from Cape Breton, it was members of the Canadian Alliance, 
members of the Conservative Party and members of the Bloc, all of 
whom said “It makes sense to us to have local people sit on the 
board”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second radical proposal is that there be a residency 
requirement ensuring that a majority of the directors of Devco 
live on Cape Breton Island in the communities affected by the 
corporation's decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I have been lobbied by groups on this 
issue, and individuals who appeared before the committee asked 
that a member of the workers' pension association sit on the 
board or committee which will administer the pensions.  I was 
questioned by members of the Liberal Party on this issue.  They 
asked “Why would you want someone from the pensioners' 
association to sit on the board that administers the pensions?” 
As I understand it, currently that pension fund is administered 
by a brokerage house in Montreal, which turns a considerable 
profit.  I think it is something in the vicinity of $7 million or 
$8 million a year.  I explained that in Cape Breton we have the 
kind of history, the kind of culture, in which we believe in 
helping each other out.  Many members of the pensioners' 
association would like to see some of the profits which are 
earned as a result of their pension funds being invested put back 
into the communities in which they live, put back into the 
communities where their children work, put back into the 
communities where their grandchildren go to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been arguing for some time to have a say in that, to 
open the books to see what is happening with their pension fund. 
They have not been able to.  I believe there is a court action 
pending.  They said “We don't like what the government is doing 
to Devco, but if it is going to do it anyway”—and it is—“and 
if the government can open the door for at least some 
improvements, why not allow that?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have much more to say, but since I only have one minute left I 
will say that I had an opportunity to examine the speech which 
the Prime Minister gave in Berlin.  This will be the new Liberal 
platform.  They are going to run from the left again.  Let me say 
to the people who want to read this document that if they compare 
the Prime Minister's words in Berlin to the actions of the 
Minister of Natural Resources today with Bill C-11, as the 
government refuses to support communities directing their own 
future as it withdraws, they will see that the actions of the 
Liberals speak louder than words.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very glad to carry on where the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria was forced to leave off.  Both NDP members of 
parliament for Cape Breton, the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton 
and the member for Sydney—Victoria, have dedicated much of the 
time they have spent as members of parliament fighting over the 
Devco issue. 
The point we are at today represents the culmination of literally 
years of hard work on their part to try and adequately represent 
the people who are affected by the Liberal obsession with 
shutting down anything to do with publicly funded institutions 
which might benefit working Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One will note on looking at the record the very number of 
speakers from the NDP who have risen on behalf of Cape Bretoners 
and on behalf of the Devco families.  Most of us have had reason 
and have been motivated to join in this debate.  Within our party 
at least, members all across the country empathize with the 
regional problems which occur in an area like Cape Breton.  We 
can identify personally and we draw many parallels with our own 
regions.  That is why we are so motivated to speak up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member left off by pointing out some of the very 
reasonable motions the NDP members made at the committee stage, 
hoping to inject some balance and reason into the legislation. 
If the Government of Canada is so completely committed to 
shutting down Devco without consultation with the community, and 
we think without exploring other options and alternatives, if it 
is so driven, so obsessed with this idea, at least it could have 
entertained reasonable motions at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was halfway through speaking about one of those 
motions, which was for a jointly trusteed pension board which 
would look after the pension plan while Devco is being 
dismantled.  That is not exactly a radical idea.  Most employee 
benefit plans are jointly trusteed for the very reason the hon. 
member for Sydney—Victoria pointed out, that there may be 
secondary objectives that can be achieved other than simply 
getting the best return for the dollar to provide pension 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a credit to those miners that they were generous enough 
and concerned enough about their community that they would say, 
“Let us not look at pure profit as the only goal or the only 
directive that we give our money managers.  Let us look at some 
secondary objectives.  Let us look at the long term economic 
development of Cape Breton to use some of the surplus profits of 
our pension plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That thought would not come forward if there were not workers on 
the board of directors of the pension plan.  It is a reasonable 
request and it was summarily shot down at committee by the 
Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other motions which were made to ensure health 
benefits for workers and their families who may become sick, or 
have long term health repercussions from having worked 
underground all their lives.  Once their employment ceases, so 
ceases their supplementary health benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people contract silicosis, black lung, or any number of 
injuries or illnesses relating to their occupation.  One would 
think it would be callously indifferent for the employer to 
abandon any obligation to provide supplementary health care 
insurance to those people when the plant is shut down, if it is 
to be shut down.  This again was dismissed at committee stage. 
The Liberals would not entertain it whatsoever, even though the 
NDP was not alone in this request; it did have backing from other 
opposition parties on the committee to be fair to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they not institutionalize the concept of ensuring that 
some representatives on the board of directors lived in Cape 
Breton?  The argument was that there are going to be some anyway. 
Well, maybe there are now, but who is to say the board will 
always be constituted in that way?  Who is to say they do not 
parachute in some Liberal patronage appointees to take over all 
those key positions?  They would probably pay themselves very 
well on a board of directors like that.  It is not inconceivable 
that the Liberals may parachute in some patronage appointee to 
take care of the new Devco board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted it institutionalized that Cape Bretoners will be on 
the board of directors of the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation.  This is not unreasonable.  It is perfectly 
reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were not the type of motions that were designed to 
embarrass the government.  They were not the type of motions that 
were designed to be radical.  They were put forward seriously in 
the hopes that they would be seriously entertained.  They were 
dismissed out of hand without any concern whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they not agree to ensure that some of the 
representatives on the board of directors were from the Devco 
pensioners association?  Why would they not give the pensioners 
some voice on the board of directors, those who are experienced, 
those who were affected throughout their whole lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that there is no better expertise about Devco than 
from those who dedicated their lives working there and who are 
now Devco pensioners.  That is where we will find some real 
talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals voted against all of those motions at the committee 
stage. 
How did the other parties fare with regard to these motions?  At 
least they could entertain them and see the logic in these very 
reasonable proposals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find ourselves with one more opportunity to look at the 
motions in Group No. 2 at report stage.  The hon. member had just 
started to speak to Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One motion we refiled states that one director other than the 
chairperson and the president shall be an employee of the 
corporation.  That is a reasonable proposal.  Again a director 
other than the chairperson should be an employee of the 
corporation, giving workers some voice in the long term viability 
of the plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the directors shall be residents of the island 
of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.  That should be a given; it should 
be automatic.  I cannot imagine for the life of me how there 
would be any strong protest from the ruling party on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least one-third of the directors shall be members of the 
Devco pensioners association.  We talked about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the motions in Group No. 2 are structural motions that 
deal with the composition of the board of directors and its long 
term viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are dealing with now is that the rules have really 
changed since the bill even reached the committee stage because 
now there is the ruling of the arbitrator, a binding arbitration. 
As was pointed out this arbitration would not have taken place 
were it not for the courage of the Cape Breton miners who 
actually had to take justice into their own hands and break the 
law.  Sometimes civil disobedience is the only option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they were up against the wall and their livelihood and 
community were at stake, these people had the courage to take 
control of their workplace.  I have to give the people of Cape 
Breton credit because even during the course of that civil 
disobedience and illegal wildcat strike, they were willing to be 
reasonable with the government.  They were faced with what were 
really the modern day equivalent of Pinkerton goons when the riot 
squad showed up taking up arms against their own.  It is a sad 
state of affairs in Canada when the people of Canada have to face 
their own government taking up arms against them for standing up 
for what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually when they finally agreed to what they thought was the 
most reasonable solution to this seemingly untenable situation, 
that solution and their demand was to put the matter before 
binding arbitration.  They were so confident that their position 
was just and that they could defend it in front of an impartial 
third party that they were willing to lay down their case before 
an outside third party, an arbitrator, and let the case rest on 
its own merits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what happened.  The arbitrator agreed with the workers of 
the Devco coal mine of Cape Breton and in many incidences came up 
with the recommendations exactly as they were put forward by the 
advocates of the working people.  Especially in terms of pension, 
the people making the argument on behalf of the miners looked to 
other parts of the world where there were similar situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not unheard of, to be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  That is right.  There is great precedent 
in other countries.  Canada prides itself as being so fair and 
equitable with its workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Germany coal miners with 20 years service who are 50 years of 
age or older qualify for early retirement pension if they are 
laid off as a result of a mine closure.  There is far better 
plant closure legislation.  A coal company, a mining company or 
any business enterprise cannot simply announce one day that after 
30 years of showing a profit in a community, at 30 years plus one 
day it is just going to close up shop and walk away.  It simply 
cannot be done.  There is an obligation to the community which 
allowed it to prosper and make a profit every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even better in France.  It is funny how in France we often 
find inspiration when it comes to fairness toward workers. 
Pensioners laid off due to a plant closure or any mass layoff are 
eligible at age 45 with 25 years service to an early retirement 
pension equal to 80% of salary.  That means for those who knock 
themselves out and give their youth and health to an enterprise 
which takes and takes, the enterprise has a lasting long term 
obligation to the workforce that allowed it to function, even if 
the plant is now closed or it disappears.  It is a lasting 
liability that carries on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco did not offer that long term obligation.  The government, 
as the people in charge of Devco, tried to walk away from that 
duty and obligation.  Thankfully the third party arbitrator 
intervened and introduced an element of reason and fairness, 
exactly what the NDP has been saying from day one.

is essentially a social one.  It is because of its awareness of, 
and concern for, the well-being of individuals and their 
communities that the federal government is prepared to assist, on 
a massive scale, the transition of the area from dependence on a 
declining natural resource to a sound economic base.

an examination of the current corporate plan of the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation, an important element in approaching the 
problem will have been overlooked....When the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation was organized and legislated, it was a 
move from privatization to public ownership, because 
privatization was incapable of dealing with the community and 
social problems which would occur from a sudden cessation of 
production in the coal industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was looking through the large amount of documentation 
that we have on Devco, I came across another interesting comment. 
It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If elected on October 25, 1993 the Liberal Party of Canada would 
want to increase production at the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an increase in production, no downsizing would be executed. 
It was an interesting quote by a gentleman by the name of David 
Dingwall on October 7, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions in the House we have said that the one 
thing Cape Bretoners are sure of is that the Liberal government 
and the members opposite are renowned for making empty promises 
to Cape Bretoners and have done so for the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sydney—Victoria and all members of the NDP 
have tried for the last three years to show government members 
the serious implication Bill C-11 will have on Cape Bretoners but 
our concerns and the concerns of the communities continue to fall 
on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was one simple way to sum up what Cape Breton miners 
are looking for we should go to the document called “A Message 
from Cape Breton Coal Miners”.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for a handout.  We, Devco's hard-working 
employees, are asking Ottawa to give us a real chance to help 
secure a brighter future for the company and our community.  We 
can make a difference. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message from Cape Breton miners and the people on 
Cape Breton Island that unfortunately has fallen on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today, as my hon. colleagues in the New Democratic 
Party have talked about, with respect to amendments in Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people in Cape Breton who are listening, it is 
important for them to recognize that the amendments put forward 
by the members of the New Democratic Party are not amendments 
that will cost the government any money.  They are not amendments 
that will change the very essence of what the government is 
trying to do in terms of privatizing Devco.  They will allow some 
semblance of transparency as it relates to the managing of the 
pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Sydney—Victoria talked about the members 
of the pensioners association, who we have both had meetings with 
and who have a novel idea.  They know their pension fund is 
generating approximately $7 million a year.  They want that money 
to be invested in their community.  Is that not something new and 
radical?   Why do they want to invest that $7 million in their 
community?  It is because this government has failed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day we continue to hear government members talk about 
the good job they have done as it relates to Devco and that they 
have given the miners a fair package.  We just found out on 
Friday that, as we have been saying for three years, as 
delegation after delegation and as miner's wife after miner's 
wife have come to Ottawa and clearly said, an arbitrator has 
finally said that the package is inadequate.  The arbitrator has 
said that this government's package, as it relates to Cape Breton 
coal miners, is inadequate and unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues have talked to members of the government 
about the implications that the bill will have on Cape Bretoners. 
However, it continues to fall on deaf ears.  When the bill was 
before a committee, over 75% of the Liberal members were whipped 
at committee and some did not even have the decency to be there 
to listen to the witnesses who came to Ottawa. 
I am talking about witnesses such as a miner's wife who gave up a 
12 hour shift at $5.50 an hour to come here.  She is the sole 
breadwinner in her family because her husband is not working. 
Government members could not find the time to pretend that what 
these witnesses had to say was important.

Liberals will not try, why they will not do something to help 
these communities and why they will not recognize the economic 
hardship that already exists in Cape Breton, never mind the 
results from the privatization of Devco.  I finally came to the 
conclusion that they are not listening because they do not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just finished reading excerpts by other members from what I 
would like to call the old Liberal Party, the Liberal Party that 
had a heart.  They clearly indicated that Devco's abdication from 
the industry would be a social problem.  In 1967 the Liberals 
made a commitment to the community to diversify the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House a number of stories about the attempts that 
were made to diversify the economy of Cape Breton under the 
Liberal government.  One case in particular involved sheep being 
brought in from Scotland.  These sheep were quarantined for a 
year at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars and they 
eventually died.  The joke was that the Liberals were going to 
take the wool from the sheep and some of the steel from the steel 
plant and make steel wool.  The Liberal government's attempts at 
economic development and recovery in Cape Breton became a joke. 
It was not about assisting the community, it was and continues to 
be about assisting the government's friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I want to say that there is no doubt in my mind that 
Cape Bretoners will survive.  We will survive because we always 
have.  However, the one thing that the government should and will 
be able to count on is the long memory of Cape Bretoners for what 
this Liberal government has done to them, their children and 
their communities.

eloquent debate brought on by the two members from Cape Breton, 
the member for Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras 
d'Oir—Cape Breton, I wrote a quick little ditty of a poem for my 
friends in Cape Breton.  I have not finished it yet but I thought 
I should start out my debate in this fashion: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes a brave man to mine the black ore<BR> 
To go deep in the earth and far under shore<BR> 
They start as healthy men when they are young<BR> 
They prematurely grow old with coal dust in their lungs<BR> 
They fight for fair pensions and employment they demand<BR> 
To raise their families on Cape Breton Island 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a poem that I plan to send out to Cape Bretoners when I 
get it finished.  It shows the passion brought to the House of 
Commons by my two colleagues from Cape Breton when it comes to 
standing up for Cape Bretoners, not just the coal miners but for 
the steelworkers, the fishermen and everyone who lives in that 
beautiful place on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and other opposition parties always talk about 
change and that we need to have change.  I keep asking the 
government and opposition parties about the people who are on our 
streets asking for change, which is occurring more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's economic policies are dividing the rich and 
the poor even more.  The middle class is eroding and more and 
more people are relying on charities, handouts and other avenues 
for their livelihood to get by on a daily basis.

order.  There has been some eloquent poetry in the House today. 
Again I see that we do not have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I will ask the clerk to count the 
members present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what do the federal 
Liberals and the Alberta Tories have in common?  They are able to 
take large groups of workers and band them together into civil 
disobedience.  The health care workers of Alberta had to use 
civil disobedience to get a fair contract from the Alberta 
government.  The Cape Breton coal miners, who had to go 
underground in the coldest part of the year, suffered indignities 
by this government through the riot goons that it brought 
forward.  Instead of consultation, it brought pepper spraying 
RCMP officers to stamp them out.  It did not work.  With the 
courage and dignity that only Cape Bretoners have, they forced 
this government into binding arbitration.  We saw the agreement 
that was made the other day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This binding arbitration is a slap in the face to the 
government, especially to the Minister of Natural Resources who 
said that under no circumstances would this package be reopened. 
Again, he was wrong and the Liberal party was wrong.  All the 
government had to do was deal in good, open and transparent faith 
and it would never have gone this far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was politely interrupted by my colleague from Cape 
Breton, I wanted to say that the government's economic policies 
are dividing people ever so greatly.  The government looks after 
its friends in the Liberal Party.  I encourage everyone in the 
Liberal Party to take a trip to Cape Breton and see the famous 
Ding Wall.  I do not mean David Dingwall.  I mean the Ding Wall 
itself.  He spent a lot of money to build a rock wall in the 
middle of a town.  It is an absolute fiasco.  It is an 
embarrassment to all Nova Scotians that this person, who was the 
Minister of Health at that time, could advocate spending a 
million taxpayers' dollars for a rock wall in Cape Breton.  I 
know there are a lot of rocks in Cape Breton, but most of them 
were in that minister's head for that kind of expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should have happened to that money and what should happen 
to the rest of the funding is that it go toward the care and fair 
treatment of Cape Breton coal miners and their families for long 
term economic growth in that beautiful part of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government calls for change.  We all call for change. What I 
ask all members of the opposition parties and the government to 
do is to remind themselves of the people who are looking for 
small change on the streets.  There are more and more people 
doing that on a daily basis.  They are turning to charities 
looking for more and more help.  I cannot help but say how proud 
I am, as an Atlantic Canadian, that Atlantic  Canadians 
throughout the four provinces banded together and raised over 
$3.6 million for the IWK Grace Telethon, again showing the 
generosity and spirit of Atlantic Canadians when it comes to 
people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of two of the finest people I have ever met in Cape 
Breton, two miners, one former miner and a current miner, Mr. 
Jose Pimentel and Mr. Vic Tomiczek, I want to say how hard they 
have struggled to keep their families going and how hard they 
have fought for the common workers and their common man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the federal Liberals who are pounding away at 
Cape Breton coal miners, it is also what the provincial Tory 
Party is doing.  In fact in the recent Nova Scotia election, Jane 
Purves, the minister of education for Nova Scotia, had a postcard 
campaign that very wrongly suggested that because SYSCO was open, 
that hospital beds in Nova Scotia would be closed.  She very 
effectively and very meanly split and divided the mainland Nova 
Scotians with that of Cape Breton.  I found it absolutely 
despicable that a woman of her talents could use such a low ball 
and low road campaign in order to get herself elected.  I can 
assure the House that from this moment on we will be going after 
her in the next election to ensure her defeat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current minister of health for Nova Scotia also said, and I 
quote, “Possibly children with disabilities who need access to 
the IWK could rely on groups like the Lions Club or the Kiwanis 
or other service clubs to find their transportation needs to the 
Halifax Centre”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from the so-called passionate, progressive 
Conservatives.  There is nothing passionate and there is nothing 
conservative about it.  It is meanspirited to balance their books 
on the backs of the disabled and on the backs of the needy. They 
are even recommending a program where they take away formula from 
children who require a special formula in order to digest their 
food.  It is absolutely mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have done the same.  They refuse to negotiate in a 
fair, open and transparent manner with Cape Breton coal miners 
and their families or even to show respect for the two members of 
parliament from Cape Breton who stand in the House on an almost 
daily basis, who were in committee, and who brought forth very 
comparable amendments to adjust the reasonable debate that should 
be happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Airlines in its pension outfit has an employee trustee 
on the board.  All Cape Breton is asking for is that we have the 
same.  That is not a very unreasonable request.  I am very proud 
to say that the federal Conservatives, the Bloc and the Canadian 
Alliance support the New Democrats in that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only hope that backbench Liberals can put pressure on the 
Minister of Natural Resources to say that a representative from 
Cape Breton absolutely should be on the board of trustees when it 
comes to pension liabilities.  It only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distribution of the funds will be in Cape Breton.  Would it 
not make sense to have people from Cape Breton on the board 
administering the fund?  Why would we want someone from Toronto, 
Ontario, Saskatchewan or B.C., or anywhere else for that matter, 
administering a fund that is solely meant for Cape Bretoners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the pensions and the unfairness of the Liberals, Cape 
Breton miners in their heart of hearts would tell them:  “Stick 
the pensions where the sun don't shine.  Just give us work.  We 
want to work and be able to look after our families”.  Most 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast want the opportunity for 
gainful employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason in the world why there could not be gainful 
employment in Cape Breton for the miners, the SYSCO workers, and 
everyone else on that beautiful island.  On that note I encourage 
members of the Liberal Party who have never visited Cape Breton 
to do  so. If they did, their government would not be so 
meanspirited toward the pensioners, the miners and their 
families.  By the way, some of the women will be coming to Ottawa 
to demand more fairness and justice for their husbands and 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sin that I as a member from Nova Scotia and a member of 
the great NDP caucus have to stand in the House to state the 
obvious to the government.  The actions of the so-called newfound 
left leaning Liberals, as their Prime Minister is saying in 
Berlin, with their new Canadian way are talking about compassion, 
fairness, openness and transparency, speak louder than words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Natural Resources is asked a question about 
Devco he almost looks like he is bothered by the question and 
wonders what he is doing answering these pesky question from the 
NDP on Devco? looks around with absolutely no interest at all and 
thinks that the issue has already been settled.  That is a sin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should happen is exactly what happened with the pay equity 
debate.  We had a minister, Marcel Masse, who showed complete 
ignorance toward the pay equity debate.  He stood in the House 
time and time again and said that they would not deal with it. He 
was removed.  We had another minister and within two months the 
pay equity issue was settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should happen is the Minister of Natural Resources should 
step aside on the Devco issue.  We should bring in a minister who 
is at least willing to listen, at least willing to understand the 
issues of Cape Breton, at least willing to sit down and talk with 
the two federal representatives from Cape Breton, not an 
unelected Senator Boudreau or unelected other people who are 
appointed by the government.  The new minister could sit down and 
talk with the people of Cape Breton and the communities of Cape 
Breton to find out what the long term objectives should be for 
that beautiful island in the beautiful province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I only hope and pray that the Liberal government 
will listen to the amendments brought forth by the two members 
from Cape Breton and that we move forward with a very positive 
resolution for the people of Cape Breton, especially its coal 
miners.

pleased to rise again to defend the interests of the people of 
Cape Breton against the government's plans as expressed in Bill 
C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at report stage.  It is clear that the orders to 
government MPs have come down, which means no reasonable offers 
to change the bill are being accepted.  We have seen government 
MPs oppose changes proposed by the duly elected representatives 
from Cape Breton to give Islanders some control over their future 
within the draconian regime set up under Bill C-11.  Their 
reasonable offers to make the bill better have been shot down. 
This shows me that Bill C-11 is another legislative attempt, 
another piece of the Liberal government plan to dismantle the 
major institutions that build our country.  The Liberals may deny 
this, but they have to learn that their actions have 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation facing Cape Breton today has been brought about by 
some major government policy failures of the 1980s.  I would like 
to take a moment to put on record some of these failures.  Devco 
faced a number of problems in the 1980s, notably the impact of 
the 1981-82 recession and a disastrous fire that forced the 
permanent closure of No. 26 colliery in Glace Bay.  Adding to 
these events were several policy decisions that had a direct 
impact on Devco's future.  Since the 1984 loss of No. 26 Devco: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—has been living from hand to mouth without a long term plan for 
a reasonable, stable coal industry, hence the present situation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a quote by Kent in 1996.  Another quote reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with a loss of production from No. 26 Devco opted to 
develop the geologically troubled Phalen mine while leaving 
undeveloped the Donkin deposit containing an estimated 300,000 
tonnes.  With the closure of the 26-year-old Lingan Mine in 1991, 
Devco was left as a two mine operation with no plans to develop a 
third mine.  The shortsightedness of the approach was 
demonstrated when Phalen's premature shutdown precipitated the 
current crisis for Devco employees and their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, the Westray misadventure was harmful to Devco's 
future.  There is some evidence that backers within government of 
the ill-fated mine were motivated by anti-public ownership bias 
toward Devco. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a comment by Dean Jobb in his book <I>Calculated Risk: 
Greed, Politics and the Westray Tragedy</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the $100 million in federal and provincial funds 
lost on that project would have gone a considerable distance 
toward paying the cost of developing the Donkin deposit. 
Furthermore, short term arrangements between Westray mine 
operators and Nova Scotia Power had the long term effect of 
forcing Devco to supply coal to Nova Scotia Power at its Trenton 
generator at a substantially lesser price than Nova Scotia Power 
was paying at other generating plants.  All this left Devco in a 
catch 22 situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After compromising Devco's ability to achieve a viable future 
with questionable decisions during the 1980s the Conservative 
government started the new decade by ordering Devco to become 
self-sufficient.  This mandate was renewed by the Liberals after 
they took over in 1993.  Self-sufficiency was accepted by top 
management of Devco as a legitimate goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Devco never really had a chance to achieve 
self-sufficiency.  Until geological problems at Phalen caused 
losses to mount in recent years, Devco was making money on its 
coal operations, but it failed to achieve self-sufficiency 
because it was required to make larger than anticipated pension 
payouts, some $241 million over five years.  These higher payouts 
were to be completed in 1999 but then it was too late.  In May 
1996 Senator Allan J. MacEachen stated that the loss of Devco: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—would create a major catastrophe and a social disaster for 
communities and their families. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously in the year 2000 Cape Breton is in even worse shape 
than it was before.  Cape Breton is struggling with a 23% 
unemployment rate. 
Today Nova Scotia's unemployment rate has gone down to 12%.  It 
has recovered somewhat, but in Cape Breton nothing has changed. 
The unemployment rate at 20% is only slightly lower than in 1996. 
Employment and participation levels are almost identical.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the loss of Devco jobs were a major catastrophe in 1996, it 
is even more of a major catastrophe now.  The federal government 
has an historical responsibility to the coal industry in Cape 
Breton and Nova Scotia.  Over the past 15 years the federal 
government has failed in its responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton has the coal resource, a skilled workforce and a 
customer in the Nova Scotia Power Corporation.  That should have 
been a recipe for a stable and successful coal industry that 
would have allowed a slow but sure growth of alternative 
employment, but through incompetence or bad faith the federal 
government has dropped the ball.  It has been negligent and it 
should be required to pay for its negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly believes in the concept of responsible 
government, it would take responsibility for its actions over the 
past two decades.  It would work with the people of Cape Breton 
and their elected members to make Bill C-11 a better piece of 
legislation, one that would strengthen the embattled community of 
Cape Breton and not further undermine it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am honoured to speak to the motions in Group No. 2 which are 
before us.  The hon. member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and the 
hon. member for Sydney—Victoria certainly put a lot of thought 
into an issue that impacts their communities.  The whole island 
will feel the repercussions of Bill C-11.  These motions were put 
forward to correct some wrongs and oversights which occurred in 
the context of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be a challenge that at least one employee 
representative will sit on the Devco board of directors.  It is 
not an unimaginable practice in any other corporation, community 
or sector.  Providing an employee representative to sit on the 
board of directors is an honourable gesture.  Any employee who 
has served in the industry, in the company and in the community 
would have a lot to offer in the decisions to be made in the very 
short term and in the long term in dealing with the whole issue 
of Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a brief explanation of the second motion in this 
grouping.  There is a residency requirement for members of the 
board of directors.  The majority of the directors of Devco 
should live on Cape Breton Island in the communities affected by 
the corporation's decisions.  These decisions are major in impact 
and in concern, as highlighted by my hon. colleagues on this 
side.  We are trying to get government members to realize that 
these amendments could make drastic changes in how the bill 
unfolds and how the decisions in the whole industry unfold in 
Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that the majority of the directors of Devco should 
live on Cape Breton Island.  It is a small request but it is a 
major request.  We do not need to transport people from all over 
Canada to serve the best interests of an industry and community 
in that region. Cape Bretoners are very capable of handling their 
own affairs, and certainly a lot of the solutions are with Cape 
Bretoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has certainly been highlighted and recommended, dealing with 
the directors of Devco, that representatives of the employees' 
pension association ensure that one-third of the directors come 
from the employees' pension association.  The crux of this major 
debate and major concern of the employees is how their pensions 
are interpreted, administered and identified among them.  It is a 
major issue. 
If they have that much vested interest and seniority in terms of 
the years of service in this corporation and in the industry, 
they should assured of one-third of the Devco board of directors. 
This representation is a crucial part of the motion.

on the representative body should be from the pension fund

whole aspect.  All the government members should take a second

are voted on, they should vote with their conscience and vote for 
the common sense request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members sitting with the other parties on this side of 
the House have been very silent on this issue.  I challenge them 
to speak and debate these issues. These representations could 
certainly be taken by other sectors, other communities, other 
corporations, other mines in a very short while. The whole aspect 
of protecting workers' rights and views is of utmost importance 
for us, but it should be for every member of parliament.  There 
are workers in the communities of all of our constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of coal mining and the evolution of mining in 
this country and the transfer from private to public ownership 
and flipping back to private ownership is certainly a concern.  I 
have experienced certain changes in ownership from public to 
private in my neck of the woods in dealing with the forest 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forest industry in northern Saskatchewan is viewed as 
pristine.  As of late there have been huge allocations of forest 
management and harvesting.  The present forest management 
practices use mechanical harvesters.  It is not like the B.C. 
terrain where they have to climb halfway up the mountain and then 
they are limited by the elevation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boreal forest is flat.  There are no inhibitors.  The only 
things that stand in our way are the waterways and maybe the 
communities.  Certainly, we should not overlook that a community 
could be perceived to be in the way of any development. Community 
development, industrial development and social development should 
all be taken in context.  In future plans, governments of the 
world now use sustainable development as a coined phrase for 
future sustainability, the integration of social, economic and 
environmental issues. The communities are an integral part of 
this development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Devco workers are asking that they be respected as a 
community of workers, as a community in Cape Breton.  They should 
be an integral part of the development of any other industry in 
the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the forestry issue, there was an allocation of a 
major pulp mill just 18 miles from my community.  At the time it 
would have been a bleaching process and huge amounts of chemicals 
would have been poured into the Beaver River which flows into the 
Churchill River.  This was stopped.  It was stopped because of an 
election.  The government changed and a new attitude of policies 
and perceptions took place and the whole private pulp mill was 
dumped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years later it came back.  Now it is a cleaner process.  It is 
still an allocation of the forests.  It is still a private pulp 
mill that produces paper.  Who uses bleached paper?  I do not 
know for what purpose we have to have extremely white paper. Why 
we have to bleach this paper and poison ourselves is beyond me. 
We could use paper that is more natural, which would be less 
harmful in its processes on our environment and our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pulp mill was created.  Huge allocations of the boreal forest 
were made, but there are no profits. 
In our region, every year the provincial government has to 
backfill all the losses for the pulp mill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-11. 
Motions Nos. 6 to 11 and 16 increase the participation of the 
people of Cape Breton on the board of Devco either by requiring 
an employee to be a director or specifying a percentage of the 
directors who must be on the board of the Devco pensioners 
association.  This makes common sense.  It speaks to a fairer and 
more equitable way to deal with the Devco situation. This has to 
provide some level of participation at the board level for either 
employees or former employees and pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back 20 years or more with regard to labour relations, 
traditional industries have had some employee representation on 
their boards for some time.  In the automobile industry, Chrysler 
was the first company to have representation from the UAW on its 
board. I am surprised that in the original legislation this had 
not been proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party supports amendments that would provide a greater 
level of participation for employees and/or Devco pensioners. 
This would increase transparency and openness of the process and 
would ensure a fairer level of participation and representation 
for the miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues of pension and severance packages have been discussed 
at length in the House and at committee. There are some real 
inequities in the current pension structure.  Under the current 
plan workers with less than 75 pension points, a combination of 
25 years of service and 50 years of age, do not qualify.  It 
creates some bizarre situations.  Some miners with 25 years of 
pensionable earnings would not qualify for a pension because of 
the 75 pension point plan. This does not make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the federally appointed arbitrator ruled that miners 
with 25 years of mining experience would qualify for pensions 
regardless of age, but denied the same benefit for miners with 20 
years of experience on the basis that it would be too costly. 
This change would allow an additional 246 miners to qualify for 
pensions.  That is a step in the right direction.  Medical 
benefits will be extended to 640 miners which also is a step in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Group No. 3 amendments, Motions Nos. 13, 14 
and 15 would have the corporation's objectives continue to 
reflect the goal of providing increased levels of economic 
development— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. Did I hear 
the hon. member say that he was speaking to Group No. 3, because 
we are still on Group No. 2.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I apologize for having 
gotten ahead of myself with the amendments in Group No. 3.  It is 
just another case of the PC Party being ahead of its time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there are issues of fairness that have to be dealt with, 
and these amendments are a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the big picture items that have to be considered is, what 
is the plan the government has relative to future economic 
development opportunities for the people of Cape Breton?  For far 
too long Devco provided a sense of comfort in an industry which 
really did not have the long term sustainable viability that 
would provide employment and economic opportunities well into the 
next century.  Whenever there is a change of this magnitude it 
creates huge social and economic upheaval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that we would take a serious look, not just in Cape 
Breton but throughout Atlantic Canada, at some of the examples of 
other countries which have utilized various levels of tax reform 
as vehicles for economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably one of the greatest examples of innovative social 
policy combined with innovative fiscal policy to create greater 
levels of economic opportunity would be that of Ireland.  If we 
compare Ireland 10 years ago to Atlantic Canada today, we could 
see some significant areas of comparison and opportunity.  Over 
the past 10 years, because of innovative policies, Ireland has 
had 92% growth in its GDP per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia and in Atlantic Canada, 
and I think we have to get a lot more innovative about how we 
address economic development issues in Atlantic Canada and other 
regions.  I would hope that the government would work with the 
University College of Cape Breton, Jacquelyn Thayer-Scott and 
some of the other innovators in Cape Breton who are working to 
incubate some of the small IT companies in the new economy.  With 
the death of distance as a determinant in the cost of 
telecommunications, we can see a stream of world leading IT 
companies coming out of Cape Breton into the 21st century.  We 
need to work together to create an environment which will make 
that possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  It is a 
dubious pleasure to speak to Bill C-11, the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation divestiture act.  I say dubious because 
of the great hardship which the government and this bill have put 
upon the people of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from Cape Breton have dealt with the details of 
the entire bill very well in many speeches, as well as the groups 
of amendments.  Group No. 2, which we are now on, relates to 
ensuring that people from the community and pensioners are on the 
board.  This speaks very directly to a responsibility to the 
community and to a transparency and accountability which has been 
sadly lacking in the way in which the government has dealt with 
this legislation, and specifically the Minister of Natural 
Resources.  I heard someone say earlier that every time we ask a 
question about this subject, it almost seems as if he has gravel 
on his seat.  He does not seem to want to talk to it and he is 
very uncomfortable with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Liberals have dealt with this whole issue speaks 
reams to their callousness and their ability to manipulate events 
and people in the regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an astounding lack of consultation in this whole 
matter.  The benefits, when they were announced, were completely 
insufficient.  I am speaking of health, pension and economic 
development benefits.  The Devco arbitration decision, which was 
released on June 2, made it entirely clear that the package was 
inadequate, which our members, in particular our members from 
Cape Breton, have been saying all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way in which the government dealt with the legislation, 
quashing the debate at second reading, was undemocratic in the 
extreme.  It is completely uninterested in holding public 
hearings.  That should not surprise us a bit, because that is the 
way it has dealt with a whole lot of other information in the 
recent past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to concentrate on something a little different tonight, 
which also speaks to the heart of the matter in the second group 
of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may give a bit of context and background, this past weekend 
the Prime Minister of our country was in Berlin speaking to a 
group of what I consider to be largely social democratic 
governments about progressive governance.  We might question 
initially what he was doing there.  We found that it was due to 
his good friend, the president of the United States, Bill 
Clinton, that he was even invited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may also ask what Bill Clinton was doing in a meeting 
talking about social democratic governance, the third way, or as 
the Prime Minister calls it, the Canadian way.  I was reading in 
<I>The New York Review of Books</I> this past winter an article by 
an esteemed American economist, Robert M. Solow, called 
“Welfare:  The Cheapest Country”.  The cheapest country was the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ends his article by saying that what really distinguishes the 
United States is the equanimity with which the majority 
contemplates the poverty of a minority.  So one might ask what 
the president of the United States was doing in a meeting talking 
about the third way, and secondly, what he was doing inviting our 
Prime Minister to talk about the third way when clearly he does 
not know the first thing about it.  The way in which the Cape 
Breton Devco situation has been handled speaks entirely to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weekend the Prime Minister was boasting about Canada's 
“mixed economy”, the third way; not private enterprise solely, 
not development by the states solely, but a compassionate and 
intelligent mix of the two.  That is what our Prime Minister was 
talking about, but as I said, I do not really know what gives him 
the credentials to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I briefly want to give a couple of examples which really do 
relate to Cape Breton and to the Devco situation.  He says that 
the challenge is to seize opportunities, believing that private 
economic growth has to be complemented by public investment, yet 
we have a situation here where a mine which has been publicly 
owned is going to be sold off.  We do not know to whom.  We have 
no idea whether they will keep mining coal.  We have no idea who 
will be employed.  We do not even know if someone might buy this 
mine and shut it down, simply because they do not want to have 
competition from it.  This does not speak to me of a government 
which comes at a mixed economy with any integrity or knowledge 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context here is that he is lecturing governments from other 
countries of the world, like the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. 
Our Prime Minister is lecturing them about the mixed economy and 
the third way.  This might be a good standup routine for Yuk Yuks 
comedy, but it is not exactly what we would expect at a meeting 
of august members of governments from other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the Prime Minister says that Canada's 
governments make a clear commitment to preserving the Canada 
pension plan.  It was not that long ago, a couple of years back, 
when we were fighting tooth and nail to keep the government from 
downsizing the Canada pension plan.  When it got pushed to the 
wall and could do nothing else, the government did not cut it as 
badly as it was planning to.  Suddenly now it is taking credit 
for enhancing it.  That is the way it always goes with the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about a progressive income tax system.  We know from 
the last budget all about the progressive income tax system. 
Yes, it is very progressive for people who have capital gains to 
pay, for the more affluent in our society and for people who are 
dealing with stock options.  It is very progressive for them, but 
there is not very much for the rest of us. 
As our party has pointed out again and again, there is very 
little for health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He brags about the employment insurance program.  That will make 
my colleague from New Brunswick double over with humour.  We have 
had to fight the government on the employment insurance system 
tooth and nail again.  Even having done so, the benefits are much 
more difficult for people to get.  It has caused a great deal of 
hardship for people, in particular working women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  He talks about the government's support for 
students.  We know all about that support.  The government does 
admit that student debt has increased.  That is about the only 
ray of truth I see in the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He finally says that governments have to find new ways to engage 
citizens.  The government certainly has done that in Cape Breton 
with Devco.  People are engaged in anticipating their own demise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit rich when the Prime Minister of Canada goes to 
another country to, I suspect, set himself up as some wise person 
who will return home and call an election on the things he is 
talking about.  When and if he does that we will be here to 
remind him that, despite the highfalutin words, these are mainly 
false and hollow promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the couple of minutes left to me I want to refer to another 
thing which is a cruel deception being practised on the people of 
Cape Breton.  We have been told that these mines are being shut 
down.  We are not sure whether the coal which still exists in 
reserves will be mined in Cape Breton to supply coal for power 
generation in Cape Breton.  What we do know, and it is already 
happening, is that coal is being hauled from Colombia to be sold 
to Nova Scotia Power, being hauled on ships owned by the Minister 
of Finance I might add.  However, that is not my main point. 
What I want to talk about is the race to the bottom being 
perpetrated by this government on the people of Cape Breton and 
how it will impact other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mine leader from Colombia where this coal is being purchased, 
Francisco Ramirez Cuellar, was in Canada recently.  He told us 
that he feared for his health and safety when he went home 
because he was coming to Canada to speak out about what was 
happening.  We now have information from the inter-church 
committee on human rights in Latin America, dated May 29, 2000, 
concerning an urgent action about renewed threats against this 
Colombian trade unionist.  As he had suspected and feared when he 
went home, he was followed.  It says that there were at least two 
attempts when people in utility vehicles tried to pick him up. 
If they had he probably would have lost his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask myself and I ask members across the way what kind of 
development it is when we have these kinds of situations 
occurring, when people in Cape Breton are being played off 
against people in the third world.  What are they being played 
off against?  They are being played off against regimes which 
will torture and murder people who dare to unionize to improve 
the situation for their workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shameful situation.  When we look at the motions being 
put forward to improve the sad situation which this government 
has perpetrated upon the people of Cape Breton, the amendments 
that my party is putting forward are the least we could ask.  I 
humbly ask members across the way to give these motions 
consideration and to at least pass them so that we can hold our 
heads high eventually when we talk to the people of Cape Breton, 
rather than having to hang our heads in shame because of what we 
have done to them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will only take a 
few moments of the time of the House.  The government will not be 
supporting these amendments.  I will not deal with the comments 
or the content of the speeches of my friends across the way.  I 
would not have enough time to do that.  I will only comment on 
the amendments themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to suggestions, which are essentially the focus of 
these amendments, whereby the number of directors on the board 
would be either from Cape Breton or from the Devco pensioners' 
association, with no disrespect to anyone, at the present time 
five of seven board members are in fact from Cape Breton.  There 
is one vacancy, I will acknowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it necessary whatsoever to limit in legislation 
the membership of the board.  In fact, over time, as the work of 
the board reduces after the sale, the size of the board could 
conceivably decrease to one or two people.  This would only limit 
the appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that we will hopefully proceed to the third group of 
amendments.

reform alliance, who swear up and down against closure but will 
not stand in the House to force debate on this issue for Cape 
Bretoners.  Not a bit.  They are right over there with the 
Liberals.  They might as well sit in the same seats.  We have 
said all along that there is no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Cape Bretoners will now know true to heart that there is 
no difference among any of those parties.  They had a chance to 
speak out on this issue, to support Cape Bretoners, and to 
support amendments that would assist the people in that area of 
the country and they have failed to do so, there is no question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleagues, certainly from Nova Scotia, but 
from Cape Breton, who have made it very clear to us as their 
caucus colleagues the importance of this issue.  We have followed 
it with them through the numerous stages over the last number of 
months. They have raised their concerns with us almost each and 
every day over the last number of months, or even a year or so 
since this all started to transpire.  Their concerns are for the 
people of Cape Breton and what they saw the government do to the 
coal mining industry in Cape Breton. They have kept us up to date 
all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still had a shred of hope that government members would see 
the light.  But lo and behold they are buried somewhere down in 
that mine with no hope of ever coming out.  They cannot see that 
there is a need to put in some kind of progressive amendments 
that will support the people of Cape Breton, the mine workers who 
have been there for years.  I thank my colleagues for keeping us 
abreast of that over a number of months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond me why the Group No. 2 amendments cannot be 
supported by all parties in the House.  There does not appear to 
be anything dastardly that will overthrow the government.  The 
amendments call for fairness.  They talk about the reform 
alliance's favourite rout, to be at the grassroots, to keep the 
people involved.  Did they support going out to Cape Breton to 
hold meetings and have the people involved in the discussions? 
Not a chance.  Not the people in reform alliance because they 
talk one way this time of the year and another way when they 
think nobody is watching.  But that is not the case. Canadians 
will know that it is just a lot of talk and no action when it 
gets right down to it.  The bottom line is they did not support 
amendments to have mine workers or pensioners on the board.  Boy, 
that is a shocker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so far-fetched about wanting the people who put in years 
of their lives and probably their health in a good number of 
instances, to have an opportunity?  An hon. colleague from the 
Liberals said there may be a time when there are only one or two 
members on the board, that they may not need that many and they 
do not want to restrict it by having to have Cape Bretoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we took that kind of attitude in the House of Commons, where 
would we be?  Let us restrict it by not having any members from 
Ontario.  Boy, that would do it.  It is absolutely disgusting to 
even hear those kinds of statements. It makes absolute sense to 
have the people who will be most affected by this legislation and 
most affected by what happens with their pensions on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a lot of trust.  I do not have a lot of trust in 
who the Liberal government might appoint to a board that will 
look after my pension.  I would like to have some say in that. It 
is not unreasonable for Cape Bretoners and the mine workers to 
have a say in who will be looking after their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Group No. 2 amendments are pretty much all along that line. 
Motion No. 9 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-11, in Clause 8, be amended by adding after line 41 
on page 3 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(4) One director other than the Chairperson and the President 
shall be an employee of the Corporation”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That provides for at least one employee representative to sit on 
the board of the Devco board of directors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another shocker is that the government changed the Financial 
Administration Act to make sure it could sell off Devco at, let 
us say, a buck.  Let us get down to it, it changed the act so it 
could sell off Devco not even at value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will be watching just to see what happens with Devco 
because after today they will know it is an issue.  They will 
know that government patronage is probably lurking somewhere.  To 
the credit of the reform alliance members, they love digging up 
smut. I am sure when this is all done they will be able to follow 
up on who ends up buying the coal mines and Devco, if they so 
choose. We never know because they change from day to day and 
maybe they will not bother.  Let us see whether it is tied to one 
of the front seats on the other side of the House.  It will be 
very interesting and Canadians will be watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. I think you will find we do not have quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I do not see quorum. 
Call in the members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I see quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is somewhat of a 
captive audience and it is wonderful, I have to admit. 
I was making the point about the government's inability to 
recognize what is important to Canadians and its inability to 
recognize what people in certain regions of the country want to 
be a part of.  They want to have a say in what happens with their 
future.  I mentioned pensions and wanting representation on the 
board for pensions so people have control over their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look at what happened with the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development and the Royal Oak Mines in 
Yellowknife and the pensions of those workers.  What did the 
government do to those pensioners?  What did it do to those 
workers after the years they put into that mine, the taxes they 
paid for the government to flaunt around and do with what it 
will? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not provide services and health care.  It did 
not provide enough funding for education.  It did not provide 
enough funding for infrastructure.  What did the government do 
with the taxes after the hard work of the miners at Royal Oak 
Mines?  What did it do with their pensions?  The Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development signed away their rights 
for a few bucks.  There was no consideration for the work they 
put in. The government would not sign away the pensions of our 
colleagues opposite, not for a second, but for ordinary workers 
the government does not give a spit, not a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be quite apparent to the Liberals that I am very 
disappointed over this whole issue.  I am disappointed that we 
have had to force the government to be concerned about Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not okay to be flippant all the time.  We can heckle.  Our 
parties can banter back and forth, but it is not okay to be 
flippant about the lives of Canadians.  It is not okay to be 
flippant about the life of that Colombian labour leader.  It is 
his life.  I want each and every one of those government members 
when that man's death gets reported in this House like the 90 
other Colombian labour leaders' deaths, to recognize that their 
government supported that by not making sure we did the things we 
could as a good and caring socially conscious government to make 
sure that the rights of workers are respected everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, the reform alliance and the Tories 
always make sure to look after big business.  It can come up with 
legislation to protect every business, every tax break it can 
give a business and corporation, but it cannot come up with 
anything as simple as protecting the rights of ordinary workers 
and the leaders who are out there fighting for them.  Ninety 
labour leaders are dead and our government is a cohort of that 
government in selling off jobs in our country to that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point the people across the way will have to let that 
sit on their conscience.  They will take it to bed at night and 
will take it with them when they leave this place.  That is what 
it is all about. It is not the flippant attitude that they do not 
know the person so they do not care.  That is the impression that 
is being given to people around the world, except for business, 
and it is not acceptable.

about.  The Devco bill would have been over and done with because 
they are not speaking for Canadians either.  They are there right 
along with the other ones.  It is only because we are here that 
they have had to recognize this issue. Most of them are hanging 
their heads in shame because they have not spoken on this issue 
to protect these workers and ensure that they have a fair say in 
their pensions and representation on the board of directors.  Not

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Madam Speaker, once again, 
I want to say that I am pleased to speak to Bill C-11.  I am 
pleased to speak to the bill but not so pleased with what may 
come of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that this is not easy for the people of Cape Breton, 
for the miners who have worked underground for some 30 years and 
for the younger ones who have not been working that long.  With 
Bill C-11, the government is trying to pass the buck on Devco. 
This is certainly not easy for the people or Cape Breton and I 
can sympathize with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy for workers in a region such as Cape Breton, 
where the unemployment rate is as high as that in the Acadian 
peninsula. 
It is not easy today for a miner 40 years old, who has been a 
miner all his life, to realize that he will one day lose his 
job.  Where will he find another job?  It is not easy today, 
with the new economy, this knowledge and high tech economy.  I 
put myself in the shoes of the miner wondering what he will do 
if and when he loses my job.  I was talking about someone 40 
years old, but there are others who are 45 years old.  That is 
still young—I am 45—but I would not be prepared to go to 
university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the prime minister saying that one has to acquire new 
skills three times in his lifetime.  My God, three times in a 
lifetime.  It costs a young person $30,000 to $40,000 to get a 
university degree.  If he has to do it three times, he will be 
in debt for the rest of his days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, with Bill C-11, the miner in Cape Breton is going to be 
left in limbo.  Is he going to have a job tomorrow, or not?  That 
is the problem.  That is what needs to be dealt with.  How can 
these people be helped? It is sad and unfortunate that the 
government has taken this position.  It is too bad that the 
government has not put into place a program saying “Some people 
will be able to retire, but we have another program that will 
help others re-enter the labour force and offer them new 
opportunities”.  Instead, they are offered nothing but 
uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it, we have here nearly 305 MPs quaking in their 
boots—or should I say their high heels, Madam Speaker—because 
they do not know if they will be re-elected in the next election. 
Everyone is worried, and there is a lot going on in ridings. 
Things are hopping because the MPs want to get re-elected; they 
are afraid of losing their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, put yourself in the shoes of the Cape Breton miner, who 
also does not know whether he is going to lose his job or not and 
who might find himself without a livelihood.  Put yourself in the 
place of this miner who is going to wake up jobless one fine 
morning.  That is no easy thing, especially for a person with a 
family, with children who go to school or university.  It 
definitely is not easy.

the workers, sit down with them and listen to their concerns. We 
did not get the support of this House.  I want to tell the people 
of Cape Breton today that the NDP supported them from start to 
finish. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the people of Cape Breton are listening on CPAC to the 
debate in the House of Commons tonight.  They will see that the 
only ones who are getting up in the House of Commons, one after 
the other, are members of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fighting for the people of Cape Breton, fighting for the 
working people of Cape Breton, fighting for the miners who are 
facing the possibility of losing their jobs.  It is not the 
Liberals.  They do not have any alternative for those people.  I 
am telling the Liberals on the other side of the House that it is 
not easy for working people who worked in the mines all their 
lives driving scoop trains or being miners to find a job today in 
this country at the age of 40 or 45. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked 15 years in the mines.  I know what a mine is.  High 
technology is not what one finds down in the mines.  When one 
leaves mining it is a big problem.  What are the Liberals saying 
to those people?  Are they being told to get out of Cape Breton?. 
The Prime Minister has been saying all along that if they cannot 
find jobs they should go somewhere else.  That is too easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the Atlantic provinces want to live in the 
Atlantic provinces.  We were born in the Atlantic region and we 
have the right to live in the Atlantic region as Canadians.  We 
need the government to not only support Ontario.  Are we part of 
this country?  Yes or no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a member in our region who wanted to sell out the 
Atlantic area.  His name was Doug Young and he is with the 
Canadian Alliance today.  That is where he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not helping the people of Cape Breton with 
what it is doing.  It is leaving them with no alternative, 
leaving them there in the cold.  It is not helping those miners 
and it should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the 301 members of parliament in the House of Commons 
shake in their pants and hey shake in their dresses because they 
are worried about the upcoming election and probably losing their 
jobs.  Most of them are a bunch of lawyers.  They should not be 
worried about losing their jobs, but the people of Cape Breton 
have to worry about it because they do not have a job the next 
day.  It is not easy for working men and women who lose their 
jobs and have no alternative.  It is no fun for their families, 
living in the dark and not knowing what will happen to them the 
next day.  It is no fun for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we ask is for members of the parliamentary 
committee to fly by plane to Cape Breton.  If they are afraid of 
a plane, it is not that far.  They could meet with the people of 
Cape Breton and listen to what they have to say.  The Liberals 
did not want to go to Cape Breton.  They do not want to get up in 
the House of Commons and speak about it.  Are they shy or what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing the Liberals say is that the caucus of the 
Atlantic met and let us catch the wave.  I hope the people of 
Cape Breton tonight are listening and will let the wave go by 
because the Liberals are not there to fight for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Atlantic have served the Liberals on a silver plate 
for 100 years, and this is what we get today.  Brian Tobin, 
Premier of Newfoundland, said that the people of the Atlantic 
would never give up on the Liberals.  The Liberals gave up on the 
Atlantic.  That is what happened in the Atlantic region.  They 
gave up on the people of the Atlantic region.  They came to the 
Atlantic region and took all our resources.  They took all our 
fish.  After doing that they said they would cut their employment 
insurance and put them on welfare.  That is what they have done 
to the people of the Atlantic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, when we 
left on Friday we were dealing with Devco and here we are 48 
hours or so later entering extended hours to deal with the bill 
yet again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Acadie—Bathurst on a very 
emotional speech.  He and others in the House are saying that 
before the legislation goes forward Cape Bretoners should have 
the chance to have their say.  It is for this reason that we 
moved amendments that would allow for the Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources and Government Operations to hold hearings in 
Cape Breton before the legislation was voted on at second reading 
stage.  However, in their haste to ram the legislation through 
and shut Devco down, the Liberal majority opposite rejected that 
suggestion totally and completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs in our caucus from across the country have stood up for Cape 
Bretoners.  Over half my colleagues have spoken to second reading 
stage, led by our leader, the member for Halifax.  All New 
Democrats from coast to coast to coast recognize that if the 
government is allowed to treat Cape Breton this way, it can do 
the same in every other region of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the Liberals have quashed the debate on Devco 
at every step along the way.  They ended debate at second reading 
stage of Bill C-11.  They decided to end debate before a 
settlement had been reached on the issue of miners' pensions and 
severance packages.  Before it was announced whether the buyer of 
Devco's assets would even continue mining in Cape Breton, the 
government simply sold off the assets.  This was before any 
decision had been made about the remediation of mine sites or 
long term economic development to replace the jobs that would be 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that only eight Liberal members even bothered 
to speak to Bill C-11 at second reading.  Should Cape Bretoners 
be grateful that the Liberal government provided limited economic 
assistance after shutting Devco down?  The committee process was 
a sham.  Less than six hours were allocated to hear from 
witnesses.  The witnesses were given less than 48 hours notice to 
appear and no time to prepare.  The majority of government 
committee members were scarcely in attendance throughout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal majority voted against all the amendments put 
forward by the opposition on behalf of witnesses and the people 
of Cape Breton.  The NDP motion called for the committee to hold 
public hearings in Cape Breton among the people affected to allow 
the people hurt by the legislation an opportunity to be heard. 
The Liberals voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed a motion to ensure that health benefits for 
workers and their families who suffered from mining related 
illnesses would be allocated.  Again the Liberal majority 
government voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked that representation for workers and pensioners on the 
pension board be ensured.  This was denied.  We asked that there 
be some representatives on the board of directors who actually 
lived in Cape Breton.  This was denied once again by government 
members opposite.  We asked for assurance that some of the 
representatives on the board of directors were from the Devco 
pensioners association.  That too was rejected by the Liberal 
government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other opposition caucuses have been generally supportive of 
the bill. 
Both right wing parties have been supportive of it, but why would 
we be surprised with that?

disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Cape

</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the proposed legislation is to enable a private

occupational safety and health, and labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will propose that the bill be withdrawn and that the

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of very excellent proposals in the Group No. 
2 motions.  I appreciate the fact that we dealing with them. The 
member for Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras d'Or—Cape 
Breton suggested that at least one employee representative should 
sit on the Devco board of directors.  We also ask under Motion 
No. 7 in Group No. 2 that clause 8 be amended by adding after 
line 22 on page 3 the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(1.1) Section 4 of the Act is amended by adding the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) The majority of the directors shall be residents of the 
Island of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sydney—Victoria urged that the majority of 
the directors shall be residents of the island and that there be 
residency requirements to ensure that a majority of the directors 
live on Cape Breton Island in the communities affected by the 
corporation's decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that would be a minimum.  I am baffled to know why 
government members opposite would not be interested in having a 
minimal amount of protection and assurance that decisions taken 
in that region of the country shall be taken with the full 
knowledge and support of people who are actually resident on Cape 
Breton Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 in Group No. 2 is certainly one that I endorse. It 
ensures that one-third of the directors of Devco are 
representatives from the employees' pension association.  This is 
critically important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Acadie—Bathurst asked what would happen to 
those miners 45 or 50 years of age who have been working 
underground all their lives?  Suddenly the mine closes.  We buy 
imported coal from Colombia or wherever with miners' blood from 
that part of the world all over it.  Cape Bretoners are thrown 
out of work. Jobs are very difficult, if not impossible, to come 
by.  That is why having representation from the employees' 
pension association makes all the sense in the world.  It would 
ensure that workers and their families are treated in the very 
best way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final motion in this group, Motion No. 16, would replace

great sense that the local people would manage affairs as they 
wind down this corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I want to say that I am very pleased to have been 
part of this important piece of legislation and on the Group No. 
2 motions.   I would urge all members, not only the NDP caucus as 
we know where they will be, to support these reasonable changes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues to speak 
to the motions that fall under Group No. 2 pertaining to Bill 
C-11.  I want to raise three concerns this afternoon relating to 
those motions and Bill C-11 as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by commenting on the significant 
contribution by members of the New Democratic Party, particularly 
from Atlantic Canada, to this debate and to this very important 
question around the future of not only Cape Breton but the whole 
country.  It is a very hard act to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Acadie—Bathurst made an impassioned speech.  He 
spoke from experience as a former steel worker, as someone who 
was down under and who worked in the mines.  He brought important 
lessons to the House that ought to be listened to by everyone, 
not just members of the Liberal government but also members of 
the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become clear to me, after having listened to the debate 
today, that the Canadian Alliance is only too quick to join with 
the Liberal government on Bill C-11 and dismiss the concerns of 
those people who gave their lives and who sacrificed a great deal 
for the economy of Cape Breton.  They should not to be 
disregarded now and cast aside in the interest of expediency but 
that is characteristic of this government and the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to single out the work of the two members from Cape 
Breton, the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and the member for 
Sydney—Victoria, who have brought so much to not only this 
debate about Devco but to many other issues.  They have both been 
vigilant on this issue and others pertaining to Cape Breton.  We 
are very grateful for the valuable contribution they make to our 
caucus and to this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members have had to deal with a number of issues that have 
posed serious difficulties for their region.  Day in and day out 
they have spoken out for the people of Cape Breton, whether we 
are talking about the serious situation of Westray and the 
failure of this government to ensure that the corporation in 
question is held responsible for the deaths of these miners, 
whether we are talking about the serious situation of the tar 
ponds in Cape Breton and the years and years of inaction by this 
government to deal with that serious health problem, or whether 
we are dealing with Devco and the whole question of having an 
economic development corporation that is regulated and run 
according to the needs and aspirations of that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about any one of those issues, the impact 
by those members has been clear and their representation as 
members in the House has been noticed and has been important to 
all of us.  I want to thank them for their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a significant number of members from Halifax and 
Nova Scotia who have been very important in bringing these 
concerns to the House.  We are very honoured and pleased with 
their participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go to my three concerns.  I want to note for the 
House that we are talking about Bill C-11.  Is it not interesting 
that legislation from another jurisdiction, the province of 
Alberta, is also called bill 11?  I want to point out the 
similarities between these two pieces of legislation.  Maybe it 
is just a coincidence.  Maybe it just happens that this number 
symbolizes the callous disregard of right wing governments 
everywhere when it comes to the needs of the people. 
Let me note the similarities.  Bill 11 in Alberta really 
represents the nail in the coffin of health care, of medicare. In 
that regard, I note the failure of this government to deal for 
one second with the impact of that legislation and take seriously 
the concerns of people everywhere about how our entire hospital 
system could be opened up to private corporations.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us draw the parallels to Bill C-11 where this move to 
privatize, to deregulate, to dissolve the economic development 
corporation that has held Cape Breton in good stead over the 
years could also be the nail in the coffin for that region.  It 
perhaps could symbolize every harsh, cruel measure taken by this 
government when it comes to the region of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very important to note that in both instances, 
whether we are talking about bill 11 in Alberta or Bill C-11 here 
in Ottawa, the government in question has chosen to disregard the 
interests and concerns of the people in those jurisdictions and 
has failed to allow for a democratic process to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be clear that one of the reasons we are so concerned 
today is because of the way this government has brought down the 
heavy hand of closure yet again.  How many times is it to date? 
This government has brought in closure over 60 times in three 
years.  This is unprecedented, unheard of and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak with some authority on this question having just 
suffered through a few recent meetings at the health committee 
where the government has worked very hard to ensure that one of 
the avenues available to members to exercise their democratic 
right has been shut down and closed off.  It has tried to control 
and manipulate the agenda so that this committee is not able to 
have an input on the most important issues facing Canadians 
today, health care, the number one priority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every day we are faced with this kind of undemocratic, 
dictatorial, authoritarian measure by the Liberal government. I 
think it is something for which the Canadian Alliance members 
surely should be taking heed.  It should be enough to make them 
question why they are supporting Bill C-11 and why they are not 
standing with us on this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go to my second concern in the few minutes that I 
have left which has to do with the general trend on the part of 
the government to lead the way in terms of undemocratic 
government.  I also want to mention the path that the government 
has chosen in terms of privatization and deregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 represents one more move after a whole series of 
assaults on the Canadian fabric, on our very identity as 
Canadians, whether we are talking about CN, Air Canada, the way 
in which the government is trying to dismantle the CBC, food 
safety and the Canadian food inspection agency, Canada Post or 
Revenue Canada, we could go on for hours just talking about all 
the agencies and corporations, all the aspects of government that 
are so important for the health and well-being of Canadians, and 
how this government has chosen to offload its responsibilities 
somewhere else, on to the private sector and individual 
consumers, outside of its purview, away from the ability of the 
Government of Canada to ensure that Canadians can count on their 
government when it comes to fundamental questions of health, 
well-being, safety and when it comes to questions of economic 
security and jobs for the future.  This is the most serious issue 
that we are dealing with when it comes to the government. 
I think it is important to simply quote from today's <I>National 
Post</I>.  I do not normally quote from the <I>National Post</I> 
because obviously it poses real concerns in the way in which the 
Calgary <I>Herald</I> situation is being handled.  However this 
clipping came across our desk today because it pertains to 
Walkerton and the whole tragedy around water safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from an article by Bill Tieleman.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for a reckoning with those who would put blind faith 
in ideology and the unbridled pursuit of profit above the health 
and welfare of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So while apologists for privatization and downsizing public 
services in this paper and elsewhere seek to defend their patron 
saint—Ontario Premier Mike Harris— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Liberal government is trying equal none other than 
Mike Harris.  The article goes on to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by attacking his critics, the facts continue to mount up to an 
indictment of the Conservative government's policies. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case it was the Liberal government's 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this because this government tends not to listen to what 
we in the NDP have to say. 
It will not listen to what people in the progressive movements 
have to say.  It will not listen to social justice coalitions. 
Maybe it will listen to the likes of writers in the <I>National 
Post</I>.  Maybe it will listen to people on the progressive 
conservative end of the political spectrum who say that enough is 
enough when it comes to the government's agenda of not only an 
undemocratic, arrogant style of government, but also when it 
comes to its extreme, right wing, fervent commitment to the 
corporate agenda.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third concern has to do with the impact these policies will 
have on the health and well-being of Canadians in general.  No 
one needs to remind anyone in the House about how important 
economic security and job security are to the state of health and 
wellness in Canada today.  We know that when individuals and 
regions are hit with hardships, they are also hit with ill health 
and the spread of disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be a lesson to the government that investments today into 
such things as economic development, corporations and 
organizations that seek to preserve the dignity of Canadians will 
hold us in good stead and ensure that health care costs will come 
down in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to the Group No. 3 
motions moved by the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and by me 
with regard to Bill C-11.  A fair amount of quoting has been 
going on.  I began my debate on Group No. 2 by quoting from the 
arbitrator's decision.  Following that there was some quoting by 
the member from Bras d'Or of former Liberals, notably Prime 
Minister Pearson and Allan MacEachen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the arbitrator too quoted from the 
debates of 1967.  This is what the arbitrator had to say about 
the passage of the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act and 
specifically section 17 which, as I said earlier, is the section 
we relied on to suggest that this package was not fair from the 
beginning.  I will read what the arbitrator wrote.  This is not 
political rhetoric.  This is the actual decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 20, 1967, when the legislation was being examined in 
committee of the whole House when there were Liberals on that 
side who believed in the dignity of the working people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  When was that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  That was in 1967.  Let me go further 
because section 17 provides for the government to do whatever is 
necessary to reduce hardship.  There is some sense of history 
repeating itself because here is what the arbitrator wrote on 
June 20, 1967, and here we are on June 5, 2000.  Members of the 
New Democratic Party, in particular David Lewis, and of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, in particular Robert Muir who 
represented the community I represent today, expressed concern 
about the language of section 17 and proposed amendments which 
would have required Devco to provide alternate employment for 
employees laid off as a result of a mine closure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967, some 32 years ago, New Democrats stood in the House and 
suggested to the Liberal Party which was in power that there 
should be alternative employment for the miners in Cape Breton in 
the event of a mine closure.  Here we are 32 years later fighting 
the same fight.  Once again it is members of the New Democratic 
Party who are arguing that there should be fairer treatment of 
the miners in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the Liberal government of that day did move 
section 17.  So far we have Lester Pearson, Allan MacEachen and 
now we have Jean-Luc Pepin in 1967 talking about the need to take 
all reasonable measures to reduce as far as possible any 
unemployment or economic hardship that can be expected to result 
from the closure of any mine.  That was then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the pretender to that throne in Berlin talking 
about the Canadian way, proudly boasting that his party 
understands the need for government intervention in a mixed 
economy.  While he says that, while he speaks the words of Lester 
Pearson, Allan MacEachen and Jean-Luc Pepin, his government 
passes a bill that refuses to allow Cape Bretoners to have the 
majority of the vote on the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is covered by the group of amendments we have already dealt 
with, so let us look at this group that the government will 
oppose.  Let us read my motion and compare it to Jean-Luc Pepin's 
bill that the Liberal Party passed.  Jean-Luc Pepin said that all 
reasonable measures to reduce as far as possible any unemployment 
or economic hardship should be taken.  Let me read my motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That corporation shall adopt all reasonable measures to reduce, 
to the fullest extent possible, any economic hardship or 
unemployment that may result from the closing of any coal mine 
operated by the Corporation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of the New Democratic Party today.  Those 
were the words of the Liberals 32 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  That is a question that Cape Bretoners 
will ask.  That is a question Canadians should ask.  As the Prime 
Minister stands in Berlin and delivers his speech on the Canadian 
way, the headlines say that the Prime Minister wants to take the 
party back to its roots.  Its roots are here.  When members 
opposite vote down these amendments and vote in favour of Bill 
C-11 they will have ripped up the roots of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is not easy because I have had discussions with 
colleagues of mine on the other side.  I know that they struggle 
with it.  Some members opposite shake their heads.  When the 
member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar talked about the labour 
situation in Colombia, some of the members shook their heads.  I 
know they said he was not being relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House what will happen with the passage of the 
bill.  The number one asset of the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation is the contract to sell coal to Nova Scotia Power. It 
is worth millions.  The proposed buyer for the assets of the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation will be an American multinational 
that will ship coal.  It is already coming in.  It is already 
feeding Nova Scotia Power.  It is turning a profit for Colombian 
mine owners who murder trade unionists in their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill passes there is no guarantee that Cape Breton coal 
will be mined.  There is no guarantee that Cape Breton coal 
miners will have work.  The government cannot guarantee that.  We 
asked it that at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to ask the minister in their caucus meeting 
whether Cape Breton coal will feed Nova Scotia Power.  Will it 
feed that asset?  The minister should be honest with his own 
caucus.  Members will have an opportunity to find out at the 
caucus meeting.  I urge members of the Liberal Party who believe 
in the vision of Pearson, Pepin and MacEachen to ask the minister 
in caucus whether there a guarantee that Cape Breton coal will 
feed the Nova Scotia Power contract. 
If he says yes, with some guarantees, I think they can vote in 
conscience on Bill C-11, but I do not think he can give them that 
guarantee.  I know he cannot give them that guarantee.

the miners.  We asked the minister when he came.  We asked Nova 
Scotia Power who it would buy coal from.  It said whoever could 
produce quality coal at the cheapest price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a year, when Colombian coal is coming into Sydney harbour, if 
it comes and it will, it will be on their shoulders and the 
responsibility of members of the Liberal Party.  They cannot say 
they were not told.  I have told them.  They cannot say they were 
not warned.  They have been warned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow night we will see how they will vote.  I should say for 
the record what is going on here tonight.  This is one of the 
last debates on the amendments to the bill.  We are having the 
debate tonight in extended hours because government members, 
again in an effort to push the legislation through the House, 
moved a motion that we would have extended hours.  We have 
extended hours and there has only been passion in this debate by 
members of the New Democratic Party.

members of the fourth party in the House who have led the fight 
with my colleague and myself to try to bring forward some 
justice.  It has only been us.  We have been alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by talking about what a miner's wife said to me 
who came to testify before the committee.  I ask Liberal members 
to listen.  I will admit that after she testified we went out for 
a beer.  There were two young former Liberals there.  We went 
down to D'Arcy McGee's for a beer and surprise, surprise, there 
was a Cape Breton band playing.  The bar was packed as they 
played Celtic music.  This woman looked at me and said “Peter, I 
do not understand it.  They like our music.  They like our 
culture.  Why do they hate us so much?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is the second time in three 
hours I have had the opportunity to rise in defence of Cape 
Breton miners.  Mind you, my hon. colleagues from Bras d'Or—Cape 
Breton and Sydney—Victoria seem to do an extremely good job on 
their own in defending the interests of Canada and workers within 
the Cape Breton area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My number one concern is that the member of the New Democratic 
Party from Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar understands the situation 
completely and wholeheartedly but the Minister of Natural 
Resources who comes from Saskatchewan does not even have a clue 
as to what is going on.  Why is that?  Why is it that the 
minister displays such arrogance toward Cape Breton people that 
it permeates throughout the entire Liberal caucus and over to 
members of the Canadian Alliance, the Bloc and the Conservative 
Party who have been very silent on this serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One story I have not yet told in the House is that my father 
worked in the coal mines of Holland.  After the war he was an 
electrician and worked in the coal mines in the south of Holland 
in the territory of Limburg. In the late 1950s and early 1960s 
Holland decided to shut down the coal mines.  The answer at that 
time was outmigration.  For thousands of people, including my 
mother, father and six of us, and I was just eight months old, 
the only answer was to leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father was a POW during the war. Holland was liberated by the 
Canadians.  The 55th anniversary of the liberation of Holland is 
this year and there will be a big celebration in Halifax from 
June 10 to 14.  That was a little plug for my veteran friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father always said that with a military like that, imagine 
what kind of country it is.  In 1956 we came to Canada.  During 
the 1950s, 1960s and 1980s we prospered and did very well as a 
large family.  If my father were alive today, he would hang his 
head in shame over what the Liberals are doing to the people and 
the miners of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments the two members from Cape Breton have put forward 
are very simple and reasonable.  They are almost identical to 
amendments Jean-Luc Pepin proposed in 1967, as we heard the hon. 
member for Sydney—Victoria say.  They are almost word for word 
what one of the famous Liberals said back in the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the Liberals of the year 2000 say?  There is complete 
silence. They obey like lapdogs and sheep.  I know most of them 
are not.   I know most Liberals personally and they are very 
independent thinkers and fight for their constituents as well. 
But when it comes to legislation like this, they become lapdogs 
and sheep in the hands of one individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That individual is the Minister of Natural Resources. 
He has displayed his arrogance on every single question when it 
comes to Devco.  His attitude is one of resistance, not one of 
help, understanding or anything else.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria has stated very clearly, 
the Liberals have a very simple task to do.  Ask the minister 
tomorrow or whenever they get the opportunity, will Cape Breton 
coal be used in Nova Scotia power?  It is a very simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have economic opportunities.  The people of Cape 
Breton have a right to economic opportunities, as do all 
Canadians from coast to coast coast.  As the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria pointed out, it may very well be imported coal 
that fuels the power for Nova Scotia.  That does not make any 
sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar pointed out that 
in Berlin the Prime Minister was talking about the Canadian way 
and how we have a public pension and everything else but he 
forgot to mention that it was the Liberal government through 
forced legislation with closure that took the $30 billion surplus 
from the superannuation fund.  That superannuation money belonged 
to all current and retired members of the public service.  That 
$30 billion was taken in a flash.  The money belonged to retired 
judges, military personnel, RCMP, public service workers and 
anyone who has ever worked for the public service.  The money was 
taken by the Liberals to use at their bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very similar to what the Liberals did with the EI 
legislation which also hurt the people of Cape Breton.  They took 
that money in a huge surplus.  Of course, the Canadian Alliance's 
position in its 1997 document was to give it back to the 
employers, forget the workers and just give it back to the 
employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is here to ensure that all parties, 
especially the government, do not ignore the workers and the 
plight of the families of Cape Breton.  I can tell anyone 
listening out there and our fans in the gallery here that if the 
government can do it to Cape Breton, it can do it to any other 
spot across the country.  Why?  The precedent will have already 
been set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the government that the people do not want its 
pensions.  They do not want a handout.  They do not want buyout 
packages.  They do not want to sit around.  They want to be able 
to work, just like every other Canadian across the country.  All 
they are asking the centrally based and centrally thinking 
government to do is to get out of the Windsor to Quebec City 
corridor and send a committee down to Cape Breton to listen to 
the stories and the truth.  It would hear about the impact of the 
government's decisions on Cape Breton's people, families who have 
been there for generations and generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the New Democratic Party's critic for fisheries and oceans. 
I have seen what former Conservative and current Liberal policies 
have done when the enactment of DFO policies hit the inshore 
fishermen of Nova Scotia, and all of Atlantic Canada for that 
matter.  It was absolutely devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the 1992 cod collapse when 40,000 Atlantic 
Canadians were forced onto the welfare and assistance rolls and 
their livelihoods were taken away.  What was the answer? 
Corporatization of a public resource, the fish stocks, and the 
system of ITQs, individual transferable quotas, given away to 
corporations, many of them large financial contributors to the 
Liberal Party over the years.  If we connect the dots and follow 
the money, we will see exactly why the decisions of the Liberal 
Party have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the life of me, I cannot understand for one second why a 
backbench Liberal would not accept the rational amendments in 
Groups Nos. 2 and 3 in order to have Cape Breton representation 
in the bill.  That is all we are asking for, for them to have 
representation when decisions are made.  They do not like 
decisions being made in Ottawa.  They want decisions that are 
made for the people of Cape Breton by the people of Cape Breton. 
That is common sense and, I would say to the Prime Minister who 
is now in Windsor, it is the real Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that the Prime Minister, the Leader of the 
Official Opposition, the leader of the Bloc, and Mr. Joe Clark of 
the Conservative Party collectively did not have the backbone and 
spine of our leader the hon. member for Halifax.  If they did, 
they would understand exactly what is going on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Winnipeg North Centre said about the tragedy 
of what is happening to health care in this country, the only 
solution for the Liberals, the Canadian Alliance and the 
Conservative Party is to privatize it, just like they did to the 
fish stocks.  Again when the dots are connected it will end up in 
their corporate friends' hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say it is unfortunate that the Atlantic caucus of the 
Liberal Party came up with something called “Catch the Wave”. 
In it was a shipbuilding policy.  They have been snooping in on 
NDP caucus meetings again because we have been fighting for that 
as well. It is another example of how the Liberal Party again has 
constantly ignored the issues which affect Atlantic Canada, my 
new home province of Nova Scotia and the beautiful island of Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a gentleman here before, a 17 year member of the 
Liberal Party, named David Dingwall.  Where is David right now? 
Whoops, he lost.  There was another member, and I am sure a lot 
of Liberals are very appreciative of the fact that Mr. Doug Young 
is now gone.  When we speak to a lot of the Liberals, they are 
very pleased that man is gone, along with his arrogance which he 
displayed to the Canadian people and Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have one minute left but I just want to say this one last 
time and I say it practically on bended knee.  I cannot get down 
because I will be ruled out of order.  To my friends in the 
Liberal Party and to members on this side of the House, 
especially to my friends in the Canadian Alliance, the Bloc and 
the Conservative Party, please have a good night's sleep tonight. 
I ask them to look into their hearts and support the amendments 
brought forward by our two Cape Breton representatives.  I assure 
everyone that things will go much smoother in Cape Breton if such 
a thing is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have appreciated the opportunity to speak once again on behalf 
of the wonderful people of Cape Breton. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I listen to my colleagues from the New Democratic 
Party caucus speak passionately tonight about a part of the 
country that I love so dearly, I remember being a young child 
living in Glace Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that I am a daughter of a coal miner.  My 
grandfather was in the coal mine when he was 11 years of age.  I 
remember my first day at school.  The teacher went around and 
asked us about our heritage, whether we were Irish or Scottish. 
I went home and asked my grandfather what my heritage was.  He 
stood and adamantly said to me, “You are a Canadian and you 
should forever be proud of being a Canadian, because we live in 
such a wonderful democratic country”.  Unfortunately it is fair 
to say that my grandfather is probably turning over in his grave 
right now because I do not feel much like a good Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the amendments in Group No. 3, as we have heard 
from all of my colleagues, the amendments are not tying the hands 
of the government.  Motion No. 14 says that “the corporation, in 
conjunction with the Government of Canada or of Nova Scotia or 
any agency of either of those governments, shall adopt and 
continue all reasonable measures deemed necessary to reduce as 
far as possible the unemployment or economic hardship that is 
expected to result from the closing, privatization or reduction 
in the production of coal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would argue that members of the government do not want to 
support that amendment because they themselves are not really 
sure of the economic or social impact, but that is not true.  The 
government's own document commissioned by the Prime Minister in 
1995 told the government of the social and economic impact of 
privatizing Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, a study that the government commissions, especially 
when it is with respect to a strategy to allow foreign 
investment, is a very detailed document which talks about the 
loss of tax revenue both provincially and federally. 
It talks about the service sector and by what percentage it will 
be cut in Cape Breton.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that, unfortunately, the government did know 
what Bill C-11 would do to Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was taught that government works by people making their case, 
by people making their argument.  We tried that at committee. 
Unfortunately, there were less than six hours of hearings.  I 
talked to some of my colleagues who have been here a lot longer 
than I.  They have never seen a piece of legislation at any other 
committee dealt with the way Bill C-11 was.  There was no 
steering committee set up to discuss how long we would hold 
hearings, how many witnesses we would hear, or whether the 
committee would travel.  None of that was done with Bill C-11.  I 
cannot help but ask myself why.  Is it because the government 
could not?  Is it because the government would not? Or, is it 
because the government did not want to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a number of phone calls from miners, their wives 
and their children who are watching tonight, listening to the 
only people in the House of Commons who are talking about what is 
important to them, the members of the New Democratic Party.  That 
is not new to us in the New Democratic Party.  We have always 
been and will continue to be committed to workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues made reference to a number of, shall 
we say, Liberals with a heart from years ago.  I came across an 
interesting quote:  “Business has a responsibility to eliminate 
the human deficit of unemployment.  Canada must work not just for 
the powerful and the privileged, but for ordinary Canadians”.  I 
think it is pretty safe to say that is what we are saying in the 
NDP caucus.  That is the job and the responsibility of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the quote I just read was made by the 
Prime Minister on February 27, 1996.  Clearly, once again what we 
have seen is nothing but empty words and empty promises from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another quote:  “No one in the Chrétien government 
approves of the kind of corporate downsizing that is going on 
without having regard to the long term effect on communities in 
terms of the people”.  Who was that infamous individual?  None 
other than the finance minister, who was quoted in Regina on 
March 6, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have had nothing in Cape Breton but broken 
promises from the Liberal government.  Have Cape Bretoners asked 
for something they are not entitled to?  I do not think so.  All 
they have asked for is support from their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago I heard a government member heckle “You do 
not want them to continue to be dependent”.  Who created the 
dependency?  Why was the dependency created?  Some would say it 
was created because once the government has a dependency then it 
has control.  To a degree that was correct.  The Liberal 
government did have control of Cape Breton until 1997.  It did 
have control of Nova Scotia until 1997.  It does not have it any 
more, because Cape Bretoners have now recognized what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard about a miner's wife who received a letter from the 
Prime Minister.  In the middle of the provincial election 
campaign, all of a sudden a letter came from the Prime Minister 
saying “Don't worry.  Be happy.  We will look into it.  We will 
look after the miners”. 
That letter was worth about as much as the words that I just read 
from the Prime Minister.  I have to ask myself why.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone to schools and I have talked to kids about how 
important it is for them to have principles and integrity.  One 
of the most difficult questions I have had asked of me in the 
three years since I became a member of parliament was when I 
recently went to my daughter's grade five class.  The kids were 
wonderful.  They wanted to know about parliament, what we do here 
and how we do it.  A little hand rose up in the back of the 
classroom and a girl said to me “Miss Dockrill, may I ask you a 
question?”  I said “Yes, dear”.   She said “My dad is a miner 
and my dad is not going to have a job any more.  The next time 
you go to Ottawa can you ask the Prime Minister why I am not 
important to him?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave that question with the few Liberal members that we 
have in the House tonight to see if they can find an answer to 
that question, because I do not have an answer for that little 
girl.  I do not know why she is not important to this government. 
Maybe it is as my colleague said, she is not from Ontario.  I 
hope I am wrong, but unfortunately, with what we continue to see 
from this government, it is no wonder we have 10 year old 
children in Cape Breton saying “Why don't we count?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, recently, this week and last week, there has been a 
great deal of discussion on the Hill about the consequences of 
the Westray disaster.  There has been a motion already before the 
House and now there is a bill before the House from the hon. 
member for Halifax having to do with finding a way through the 
criminal code to deal with the contempt that mine owners 
sometimes show for the lives of their workers by virtue of 
negligence with respect to safety in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way to show contempt for the lives of miners 
and workers.  We can show contempt for them by the way we 
dispose, in this case, of the property, of the place where they 
have made a lifetime vocational commitment.  I am talking about 
the coal miners of Cape Breton, many of whom have worked for 
Devco for literally decades, some of them 30 years, 40 years; 
many 25 years, 20 years.  We see the government moving to 
privatize Devco.  I am against privatization in any event.  I 
have seen the effect of other privatizations.  It is an 
ideological fixation that I once associated with the Tories and I 
used to find surprising on the part of the Liberals, but now they 
have actually become even bigger and better privatizers than the 
Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just privatization in principle; it is also what is 
going on in particular with respect to Devco.  What is happening, 
and this is what the government is not willing to do anything 
about or to fess up about, is that really what it is selling is 
not Devco.  It is not a mine that someone else will take over and 
run to produce coal and sell coal to Nova Scotia Power or to 
other markets.  What it is selling is a franchise to sell coal to 
Nova Scotia Power, which is a significant user of coal. 
The fear of my colleagues from Cape Breton, miners in Cape Breton 
and the people in those communities is that the real agenda is 
not to transfer ownership; it is really just a way of selling 
this contract to sell coal to Nova Scotia Power.  The mine 
itself, the machinery and all of the other things, including the 
employees, are a disposable part of the deal.  The real heart of 
the deal, the real kernel, is the franchise to sell coal to Nova 
Scotia Power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not be surprised if whoever buys Devco is not just 
someone who wants to go into the coal mining business, but rather 
someone who is already in the business of mining and selling coal 
from somewhere else.  They do not have to take over Devco in the 
real sense of the word.  They do not have to produce coal in Cape 
Breton.  All they have to do is buy Devco to get the franchise or 
contract to sell coal to Nova Scotia Power, and they have a 
ticket to great wealth from here on in, courtesy of the Liberal 
government and the Liberal backbenchers who have their hands over 
their eyes when it comes to seeing what is really going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  Has the NDP taken over? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I hear the hon. member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam making his usual incoherent 
noises, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that it is the people of Cape Breton and the miners 
who have worked all these years for Devco who have been put 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might say that we stand here very much in the tradition of 
former members of parliament from Cape Breton, New Democrat and 
CCF members.  There were members such as Clarence Gillis and Andy 
Hogan, with whom I had the opportunity to serve in this place for 
a brief period of time.  This same great tradition has been 
served ably and well by the hon. member for Bras d'Or—Cape 
Breton and the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All through the years we have been arguing for the welfare of 
the miners, and even when it came to this bill we realized that 
the government had the ability to get its way.  It has the 
numbers.  It used them tonight, in co-operation with other 
parties I might add, to impose a form of closure on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really galling is that it has not been willing to accept 
even the slightest amendment to its bill.  We have seen this 
before.  It is an unfortunate trend.  There was a time in the 
House of Commons when members of the opposition knew they could 
not get amendments accepted which changed the basic intent of the 
bill or which significantly altered the consequences of the bill, 
but they could impose upon the conscience of government members 
to accept amendments which would make the transition a little 
easier, which would provide for a context after the 
implementation of the legislation, or which would ameliorate some 
of the possible consequences of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what our members from Cape Breton have been trying to do 
and in every way they have been met by a kind of intransigence, 
which I know has frustrated them in their efforts and has 
frustrated us.  Let us look at some of the amendments they wanted 
to move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to provide for at least one employee representative 
to sit on the Devco board of directors.  That is radical.  One 
employee representative to sit on the Devco board of directors.  I 
am sure the Prime Minister, when he was over giving his third way 
speech, which really should have been called the zero way speech, 
was probably talking about involving workers and all kinds of 
flowery stuff.  Here the Liberal government had an opportunity to 
include one employee representative on the Devco board of 
directors, and what do we get?  Zilch.  Nothing.  Diddly-squat. 
Intransigence.  Resistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just an insult to the members who move these 
amendments; it is an insult to the people of Cape Breton.  They 
must be asking themselves what kind of attitude the Liberal 
government has toward them that it would not trust them to have 
one employee representative sit on the Devco board, or a 
residency requirement ensuring that a majority of the directors 
of Devco live on Cape Breton Island in the communities affected 
by the corporation's decisions.  If the government were really 
concerned about the consequences of this privatization for the 
community, would it not want to see members of the community on 
the successor board to make sure the new corporation had some 
sensitivity? 
If the government thought that a majority of the directors is too 
much for it to live with, it could have reduced it and provided 
some other number.

Devco are representatives of the employees' pension association. 
There are a lot of pensioners after a lot of privatization who 
have been absolutely beat up and mugged by the consequences of 
privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of two in particular.  When a previous government 
privatized CN Express is a good example.  The people who took it 
over had no regard for the well-being of workers or pensioners 
and a long struggle ensued.  There are all kinds of reasons to be 
concerned about privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some privatizations have gone reasonably well and there has not 
been anything to worry about.  One of the ways to make sure we do 
not have anything to worry about is to have people on the board 
whose first loyalty is to pensioners and to the workers.  Is 
there any progress on that?  Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on and it is why we have chosen this evening to 
raise this matter and to speak, one New Democrat after the other, 
in order to make the point one final time that what the 
government is doing is wrong.  This debate over the Devco 
legislation has been going on for some time now, not just in the 
House but in committee.  It is wrong for the people of Cape 
Breton.  It is wrong for the miners.  It is wrong for the 
communities.  It is a violation of everything that a number of 
former Liberal members of parliament and Liberal cabinet 
ministers used to stand up for.  It is a sign of just how 
depraved and deprived the Liberal Party has become that it would 
even consider doing what it is doing here tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the third group of motions, Motions 
Nos. 13, 14 and 15. I am going to continue the speech I started 
earlier to some extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A look at the history of Devco reveals that coal has been mined 
on Cape Breton Island for 300 years.  At its peak, the Cape 
Breton coal industry employed over 17,000 individuals.  During 
the first and second world wars, Cape Breton's coal and steel 
were vital to the Allied war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the second world war, the coal and steel industry 
declined significantly. In 1965, only 6,500 miners were left, and 
the remaining mines had to close.  The Cape Breton Development 
Corporation was established under an act of parliament in 1967 as 
a crown corporation in order to acquire and streamline the Cape 
Breton coal mining industry and to create alternate jobs, through 
the government and the development of industry.  Devco was to 
take stock and gradually cut out coal mining while creating new 
jobs through local economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government decided to begin developing new 
mines in order to meet energy needs following the OPEC crisis and 
with the rise in the price of oil in the early 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, the number of jobs dropped to 4,300 miners and the 
number has continued to drop since then, because of developments 
in technology.  Since 1992, only two mines have been in 
operation, the Prince and the Phalen mines.  In January 1999, the 
federal government announced it was withdrawing from the coal 
industry and that is would close the Phalen mine by the end of 
2000, would begin the process of selling the Prince mine and 
would dismantle the crown corporation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of a 300 year case history like this one, I 
really want to explain what a miner is. The Liberal member said 
“We are sending money and we have to pay for them. It is time to 
put a stop to that. These people must be able to fend for 
themselves”. That is almost the message they sent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be honest, I was insulted by that comment. As a former miner, 
I know what kind of work is involved. I worked underground. I 
know what miners did at Geco, in Manitouwadge, and I know what 
they do in Sudbury. I met these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked at Geco. I also worked at the Brunswick mine for 15 
years. When I was working there and representing the unions, I 
had the opportunity to visit other mines. I went to Tucson, 
Arizona, where miners work underground. I am familiar with the 
work that these people perform. It is not easy work. A miner gets 
up at about 6 a.m. and begins his shift around 8 a.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell a little story. Teachers from a nearby village came 
to visit our mine. They said “Miners are lucky, they are 
well-paid, perhaps too well”. That was the comment made by 
visitors before going down in the mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these people put on miners' gear, heavy miners' safety 
boots, with battery-operated head lamps, shovels, coveralls, and 
protective helmets and went underground and walked on the rock 
face, and finished a four hour shift, what was their reaction? 
That miners were not paid enough.  Four hours earlier, these same 
people were saying that miners were paid too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a shop steward in the Brunswick mine, a foreman told 
us that we were not working in K-Mart.  I agreed with him.  It is 
true that they are not working in K-Mart.  They are not working 
with Smarties and candies.  They are working with rocks, and 
rocks can kill.  Smarties do not kill people.  It is perhaps not 
healthy to eat too much chocolate, but it does not kill people. 
It does not fall on their head and kill them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miners have to go underground, dig tunnels, blow up rock, and 
dig.  They must prepare the ground.  In the Brunswick mine, we 
buried six of our fellow workers in 18 months in 1976. That is 
not easy.  In the Westray mine, they lost 26 of their co-workers 
underground;  11 of them are still buried there.  That is not 
easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 300 years, the people of Cape Breton have mined coal, and we 
see what they get today—uncertainty.  They do not know what 
awaits them tomorrow.  They do not know what awaits them in six 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am perhaps repeating what I said earlier, but it is important 
to tell Canadians over and over what the Liberals are doing to 
Cape Breton right now.  The members for Sydney—Victoria and Bras 
D'Or—Cape Breton have explained to the House since the beginning 
how important it was for Cape Breton to try to save the jobs in 
the mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw the women of Cape Breton when they came here to meet with 
us.  They had tears running down their cheeks because they did 
not know what would happen to their husbands should Bill C-11 be 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure hon. members that a miner who works underground all 
day is dirtier than we are by the end of the day.  It is not 
easy to be a miner.  He has spent his day digging and setting 
explosive charges to get the mineral out of the ground.  It is 
even worse for coal miners; they come out as black as coal. 
Imagine, if their bodies are that black, what about their lungs?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, it is not true that a miner 40 or 45 years 
old can easily find a job elsewhere.  Coal mines are not all 
over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working in a coal mine is different from working in a zinc, 
copper or gold mine.  The difference is between what is called 
hard rock mining and soft mining.  They are not in the least the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that a miner who leaves Cape Breton to try to 
find a job in another mine is going to find one overnight. 
It is not true that there will be work the day after, because the 
Caribou mine in New Brunswick is closed, the Heath-Steele mine is 
closed and all the miners are out looking for work. There are no 
jobs today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are our people.  The people of Bathurst, New Brunswick, 
Newcastle, Chatham, Petit-Rocher, Beresford, Caraquet, Tracadie, 
Shippagan, Saint-Isidore, Allardville, Saint-Sauveur and 
Robertville are still looking for work.  Are the people of Cape 
Breton going to find it?  This will be another surplus of 
unemployed miners.  Mines do not open at the drop of a hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the Liberals are saying “Let's catch 
the wave in the Atlantic.  We have to garner votes.  We lost all 
the seats in the Atlantic provinces”. If they want to gain the 
upper hand, it is time they looked after these miners, they 
provided something definite for them and they relieved them of 
the fear of having no money the next day to put food on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Welfare is not the answer for miners who have served their 
country all their life, who have worked for years and years in 
coal mines in order to provide energy for Nova Scotia and part of 
our country.  Treating them this way is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are saying to the government that it should be 
ashamed for refusing to send a parliamentary committee to meet 
these people and face the music. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that these points have been made, members must not forget 
who has spoken in the House this evening.  The Liberals are 
certainly not trying to save the miners' jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Despite the fact that close to a third of the New 
Democratic caucus is here, I do not think we have a quorum in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I do not see a

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I>

<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>   Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the third group of motions on Bill C-11, the 
bill to divest the government of Cape Breton coal mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this evening on the second group of motions I spoke 
about federal government policy mistakes in the 1980s that have 
left Devco in the state it is in today.  First, there was the 
decision not to develop the Donkin mine.  Some 300,000 tonnes of 
coal which would have allowed for a healthy transition to a 
diverse economy were not mined.  Federal and provincial 
government money instead went into the development of Westray, 
which we now know was a colossal disaster for many people in Nova 
Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mine is not viable now because of short-sighted government 
decisions.  Even though the coal is there, the markets are there 
and the miners are there, the government is divesting itself of 
Cape Breton coal mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will that leave the people of Cape Breton?  I have some 
thoughts on that.  Many members who have spoken very eloquently 
today have other thoughts on that. 
I want to look at the areas of poverty, out-migration, 
employment, education and housing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1945"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will talk about poverty.  As would be expected in an 
area of high unemployment, the Cape Breton region has the worst 
poverty in Nova Scotia.  Three of Nova Scotia's four poorest 
counties, as measured by the economic dependency ratio, are in 
the Cape Breton region, Cape Breton county, where the Phalen and 
Prince mines are located.  Cape Breton county, with 13% of Nova 
Scotia's population in 1997, had 26% of social assistance 
recipients and 30% of workmen's compensation claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about out-migration.  To the extent that former 
Devco employees are able to relocate, they will add to Cape 
Breton's chronic population decline.  The population decline is 
not uniform across age groups.  Between 1993 and 1998, the Cape 
Breton region had a net out-migration of minus 5,632.  Cape 
Breton county bore the brunt of this population loss with 4,517. 
Of these, over 2,000 were in the age group of 18 to 24, all of 
our young people.  Over 1,000 were in the age group of 25 to 44. 
Many in this latter group migrated with their children, 
accounting for a loss through migration of 665 in the under 17 
age group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the impact of all this economic devastation on 
education?  There was a sharp decline in school enrolment, down 
21% in Cape Breton and Victoria counties between 1985 and 1999, 
with a province wide decrease of only 7%.  With provincial school 
funding based on a per student formula, this has made it 
difficult for Cape Breton schools to provide needed programming. 
Significant out-migration of former Devco employees and their 
families will aggravate this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about housing?  Another impact of the declining population 
is on housing sales and prices.  The great majority of Cape 
Bretoners own their own homes.  Houses are hard to sell in Cape 
Breton.  It will likely be very difficult to relocate Devco 
employees and to help them sell their houses.  Cape Breton is in 
a crisis and the Devco closure will make it even worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is in Europe right now talking about the 
Canadian way.  I want to send the government a simple message 
about Canada.  We are a country which has always believed that 
the Canadian way involves responsible government.  When one shuts 
down the mines and sits idly by as the provinces shut down the 
Cape Breton steel industry, the community is devastated.  That is 
not responsible government.  That is simply cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton will not be the same with the closure of the mine. 
The infrastructure will be gone and it will not be rebuilt by the 
private sector.  What is being done by the bill will not be 
undone.  Having short term and stop gap solutions which are 
cleverly labelled transition funds gives no hope to communities 
like Sydney, Glace Bay, New Waterford, Dominion and many others. 
These communities have had their futures sold and the obvious 
response of the government is that it does not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members opposite force Bill C-11 into law then they 
obviously do not understand the consequences of their actions or 
they do not care about the future of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Bretoners are not looking for handouts.  They want to work. 
They want to have a future for their families on the island. They 
want to control their own future, as we all do, and they want the 
major collective instrument which all Canadians have available to 
them, and that is our government, to act as a partner for their 
future not as an enemy who will deprive them of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the people who founded this country, Cape Bretoners want a 
responsible government, one which listens, one which they feel 
will be there when they need it and one which will be willing to 
support them if that means helping all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, with Bill C-11 we are seeing that none of these glorious 
goals our country was built on are reflected or supported, only 
dismantled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise again in this debate, but 
on a new group of motions, and speak to Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the specifics of those motions, it is obvious 
to anyone watching that we in the NDP caucus feel passionately 
about what is happening in Cape Breton.  It is for that reason 
that we are speaking in this debate in relatively large numbers, 
since we have a small caucus.  Most of our caucus members have 
been here either this afternoon or this evening talking on the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP felt that before the legislation went forward, and 
this goes back a bit in time, that Cape Bretoners should have had 
a chance to have a say about what was happening.  That was one of 
the reasons we and they felt aggrieved in this process and why we 
have stood here this afternoon and this evening.  It is also why 
the NDP proposed amendments that would have allowed the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations to hold 
hearings in Cape Breton before the legislation was voted on at 
second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its haste to ram the legislation to close Devco through 
parliament, the government rejected that legislation, and not 
only that, rammed it through in a way that really limited the 
debate.  We were opposed to that in other cases and in this case 
we are opposed to it even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things that the government did not do 
right by the people of Cape Breton.  As I said, it squashed the 
debate on second reading of the bill, which was not right in this 
place and not right for the people in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also decided to end debate before a settlement 
had been reached on the issue of miners' pensions and severance. 
As many other people in our caucus have mentioned today, the 
arbitrator slapped the government on the wrist over that.  If it 
is not feeling embarrassed, it well should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was pushed through before any decision was made 
about the remediation of mines sites or long term economic 
development to replace the jobs that would be lost.  In question 
period earlier today, one of my colleagues asked the Minister for 
Natural Resources if the money for severance would come out of 
the existing package for economic development or would it be new 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many ways there are to evade answers but that 
is just what the minister did.  We still do not know this evening 
whether the extra amount of money that will come for pensions 
will actually be new money, which is as it should be, or whether 
it will be skimmed from the existing package that has been put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think of some similarities between what is 
happening in Cape Breton and what has happened in my own area of 
the country, in western Canada, in the way in which the 
government has dealt with getting its way on some major things, 
with a great relevance to the economy of the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill it is the Devco mine which is a fixture in Cape 
Breton and terribly important to the economy and to the lives of 
individuals in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada, to take one example, we had the Crow's Nest 
Pass freight rates on moving prairie grain.  I will not go into 
all the details of how and why western Canadians were able to 
negotiate that in confederation, but it essentially relates to 
the fact that we are a large landlocked area and there was no 
competition in the moving of grain over large distances from farm 
to port.  I might also add that over time the railroads have been 
given immense subsidies in land, money, and other things that 
accrued to them for building the railroads.  We thought we had 
this benefit, one of the few benefits to our farm community, 
forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government began a move to get rid of it.  The ways in which 
it did that bears some resemblance to the ways in which it has 
operated here.  It made its plans in the dark of night and behind 
closed doors.  It was only when it had something to announce that 
it told people and then it would announce it in such a way that 
it was very difficult for the community to mobilize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a long and sad story short, the Crow rate was taken away 
from us by the Liberal government in the 1990s.  It said it would 
tide the farmers over by giving them a payment.  The one time 
payment was made but it was kind of like buying people with their 
own money. 
The one time payment was made and then along came this government 
which got rid of the Crow benefit.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we seen happen?  We have now seen freight rates for 
moving western grain move up, depending where the benchmark is 
set, from three to six times.  Now when farmers get a green slip, 
as they do when they send grain out, they find that between 30% 
and 40% of that gross amount goes to freight rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The similarity I see here is that we have people saying, “This 
will be better for you in the long run”.  Is it not interesting 
how the people who think something will be better for us in the 
long run, short term pain for long term gain, are seldom people 
who are suffering from short term pain.  They always think it 
will be better for us but they do not mind the very difficult 
transition period that is necessary which can break communities, 
families and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the NDP caucus, especially the members from 
Cape Breton, have moved a number of amendments.  Regarding this 
third group, I would like to describe them as amendments that 
would really soften what seems to be the inevitable, the 
privatization of this company.  By and large these amendments 
want changes, if changes are being made, to be made in a way that 
will guard and take into consideration the needs for employment 
in the region.  We are not at all convinced by what we have seen 
that the privatization of this company will put any priority on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments in Group No. 3 really speak to what we believe 
may or may not be the government's intentions as to what it is 
doing.  We believe and know that the corporation is for sale.  We 
do not know to whom.  We do not know under what conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coal has been mined in Cape Breton for decades and decades but 
we do not know if a new buyer will mine coal there anymore.  A 
new buyer might simply be buying what one of my colleagues 
described as a franchise, the right to supply coal for Nova 
Scotia Power and others, but will it put any priority on 
employment?  We do not know that and that is the reason we are 
standing here and the reason we are prolonging this debate to the 
extent that we are.  We do not know if we are getting, as we used 
to say in farm country, a pig in a poke.  We do not know if the 
new buyer will continue mining.  We do not know what will happen 
to people's jobs.  We know that people will get laid off but we 
do not know what the conditions will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous group of motions we wanted to ensure that at 
least some of the people involved in the boards of directors 
would have some sensitivity to the local community.  We had the 
audacity to suggest that people on the board of directors for 
Devco, which is important to Cape Breton and has been over all 
these years, would actually be from the community and represent 
the community's best interests.  We do not have any such 
guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense we might say there are privatizations and there are 
privatizations.  None of us in this caucus are arguing that 
everything always has to remain the way it has been, but there 
are ways in which one can deal with people and then there are 
other ways in which one can deal with people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned in this case that the government is taking 
privatization to mean something much different than what we in 
this caucus and members of the community would consider it to be. 
That is the reason that we feel so passionately about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's record on privatization is anything but 
reassuring.  I think of CN rail.  It used to be a national 
company.  It has long since ceased to be a company that takes the 
needs of its customers much less their communities into account. 
There are two things we can now say about the new CN rail. First, 
it has had a record profit, and second, it has been gobbled up by 
an American conglomerate.  We are afraid that will happen here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other examples we could give.  I could give the 
example of Air Canada which is a raw nerve for many of us.  What 
has happened to Air Canada?  What has happened to its social 
responsibility, its knowledge that it was performing a national 
function?  That is out the window.  All it talks about now is 
shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this group of motions put forward by my NDP caucus 
colleagues want to ensure that if there is going to be a 
privatization, that there is a priority put upon employment of 
the people who are affected by this in Cape Breton.  We will not 
rest until that happens.

motions.  This is another attempt by the New Democratic Party 
caucus to convince the Liberal government to hear the concerns of 
Canadians, particularly the people of Cape Breton who have felt

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people will notice that if it were not for the NDP 
caucus here in parliament this evening, there would be no debate 
and an issue of grave significance for a large region of the 
country would be virtually ignored.  We may be only 20 members in 
a House of 301, but we will do our utmost to make the voices of 
Canadians heard, voices which otherwise would not be heard in 
this place. As we said when we were elected, we will do whatever 
we can to wake up the Liberals and shake up Ottawa. I see that 
some of the Liberals are awake tonight. I hope they will hear the 
message we bring to them through this group of motions which are 
very constructive propositions that should be seriously 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I tried to wake up the Liberals to what they are 
doing by drawing parallels between Bill C-11 and Ralph Klein's 
bill 11.  It would be worthwhile to go over the similarities one 
more time in the interests of making a difference this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of bill 11 in Alberta is to privatize health care. 
It is the first time in the history of this country that the 
possibility of private hospitals in our otherwise universally 
accessible, publicly administered health care system is real. 
Compare that to Bill C-11 brought to Canadians by the Liberals 
and note that it is about the privatization of the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation.  It is the dissolution of an economic 
development corporation that has been a part of the history of 
Cape Breton for many years.  There is privatization on the one 
hand with Ralph Klein and health care, and on the other hand 
there is privatization with the federal Liberals when it comes to 
economic development in the region of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second similarity is on democracy and the opportunity for 
people to be heard, to make a difference and to have their 
concerns taken into account.  When it comes to bill 11 in 
Alberta, thousands and thousands of Albertans demanded to be 
heard.  Ralph Klein decided that the views of those thousands of 
Albertans and Canadians everywhere were not important enough to 
be considered and arbitrarily proceeded with the bill.  Of course 
we know the outcome today.  Just a few days ago bill 11 received 
royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the whole process of democracy when it comes to 
the government's Bill C-11 and the essence of why we are here 
today.  The government refused to allow open public hearings 
before proceeding down the path of the dissolution of Cape Breton 
Development Corporation.  We are here today because the 
government has denied any opportunity for the people most 
affected to have their voices heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases the pattern is the same.  They are autocratic, 
undemocratic, heavy handed approaches to decision making.  As my 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre said, at least the Liberals are 
consistent.  Absolutely.  Day in and day out there are nothing 
but examples from the government of this kind of heavy handed, 
undemocratic approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the next similarity between Bill C-11 put 
forward by the Liberals and bill 11 put forward by the 
Conservatives or the reformers in Alberta.  It is a question of 
who is supporting the bill.  Let us look at what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the wishes of most Canadians, the Liberals are lined 
up with Canadian Alliance members, Conservatives and the old 
reformers.  Together in one voice they are supporting these two 
initiatives. On the one hand there was passive acceptance by the 
Liberal government when it came to bill 11 in Alberta and today 
with Bill C-11 there is proactive, initiated privatization on the 
part of the Liberal government. It is all the same whether we sit 
by and let it happen or we actually make it happen.  It is the 
same outcome for Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of these two bills is very similar.  When it comes 
to bill 11 in Alberta we know what will happen if the bill is 
allowed to be proclaimed.  It will mean for the first time in the 
history of medicare the possibility of hospital services being 
delivered by private for profit corporations.  There is a hope, a 
possibility that it can be stopped, that the dangerous path 
embarked upon can be halted by some decisive moves on the part of 
the federal Liberals.  We will continue to pressure the health 
minister and his colleagues to do just that before it is too 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the outcome of Bill C-11 brought to us by the 
federal Liberals.  Again we are dealing with a survival of the 
fittest scenario.  Those who can somehow eke out an existence 
without the support of the Cape Breton Development Corporation, 
those miners who can find other gainful employment or some 
security in their older years will survive.  The rest will fall 
by the way, thanks to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The similarities are absolute.  It may be a coincidence that we 
are dealing with two bills numbered 11, but the outcome and 
realities are the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on a couple of other points. One is that the 
government suggests time and time again that we on this side of 
the House should get with it, that with the new global economy we 
should change our ways, recognize that things like the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation are no longer feasible in this day 
and age and we have to tighten our belts and learn to accept 
these new realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way other than the callous approach by the 
Liberal government.  In mentioning that, I also want to point out 
the hypocrisy, if that is permissible in parliamentary terms, the 
double message of the Liberal government. The Prime Minister goes 
outside the country and delivers a speech on the Canadian way and 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success we have achieved as a nation has come not only from 
strong growth but from an abiding commitment to strong values, 
caring and compassion, an insistence that there be an equitable 
sharing of the benefits of economic growth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am struck with the difference between those words and the 
reality. It leaves us all to ask the question is this kind of 
initiative, is Bill C-11 the Canadian way?  Is that what the 
Prime Minister meant?  Is that where the Liberals are taking us 
in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody on this side of the House is suggesting that there are 
not changes to which we have to adapt and that global forces are 
at hand, but there is a difference in how we approach our 
responsibilities given those global trends, given technology and 
so on.  We may not be able to deny globalization. We cannot 
always turn back the clock, but that does not mean we stop 
exercising democratic means to shape the nature of the global 
economy.  It does not mean we leave to chance the kind of society 
in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization does not have to mean helplessness.  It does not 
have to mean an ever widening gap between the privileged few and 
the rest of us.  It does not have to mean a generation of young 
people living in idleness. It does not have to mean leaving our 
senior citizens who have built this country to fend for 
themselves and survive by the seats of their pants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for all of us is how can we channel trends like 
globalization into things that work for people?  We have to take 
on the challenges but we have to do it based on the values the 
Prime Minister talked about but which clearly do not serve to 
guide him or his government in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end by simply saying that while we are not afraid of 
something new, we also know we do not discard something just 
because it is old.  There are ideas and institutions which have 
outlived their usefulness and ought to be discarded, but in our 
eagerness to discard what is redundant and irrelevant, we must 
take care not to throw overboard the moral and social values 
without which human society would become a ruthless jungle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very glad to take over the debate, to receive the baton passed 
by my very capable colleague, the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre who was making some excellent points when her time 
unfortunately ran out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this late hour of the night it is significant to note that it 
is only the NDP that is standing up in defence of the people of 
Cape Breton.  Speaker after speaker after speaker from the New 
Democratic Party caucus has tried to drive home the point that we 
are trying to emphasize the fact that the people of Cape Breton 
are not being well served by Bill C-11.  In fact, Bill C-11 is so 
fundamentally flawed that it needs and deserves the attention of 
the nation and it deserves the attention of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My seatmate here in the House of Commons, who is in fact my 
roommate as well as we share an apartment in Ottawa, is the 
member for Sydney—Victoria.  We have become close friends.  He 
and I have visited each other in our ridings.  The member for 
Sydney—Victoria has visited me in the riding of Winnipeg Centre 
and I in turn have visited Cape Breton, the riding of 
Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that struck us, even in the early part of our 
relationship, was the similarities that exist for those of us who 
live in regions outside central Canada.  It is glaring and 
obvious to anybody who does not live within the great heartland 
where I suppose the power exists in central Canada just how our 
issues are not reaching the national forefront.  Our issues are 
not being given the attention they deserve in terms of the 
direction in which the country is going. This leads to a 
resentment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not any mystery why people resent central Canada. Frankly, 
it is because people in regions outside central Canada feel 
abandoned.  They feel cut off.  They feel adrift.  Even if there 
was once a pact that sought to bring us all together in a 
national vision, that accord has been broken and shattered in 
recent years. It has been destroyed by the government. Ironically 
it was the Liberal Party in earlier years that created that 
accord, people with better vision than those in the present 
government.  Notwithstanding the fact they may have been in rural 
governments in a past era, the deal has been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers have pointed out that our Prime Minister has 
been making speeches recently about the importance of making 
globalization work for all people.  He is speaking in global 
terms.  What he has not been talking about is making Canada work 
for all regions.  That seems to be an obsolete concept.  That 
seems to be a concept that was embraced by previous Liberal 
governments and it has been abandoned by the present Liberal 
government.  Bill C-11 is the manifestation and personification 
of that abandonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to the Group No. 3 motions to amend Bill C-11. 
We cannot really do that until we go through a bit of the history 
of why it is necessary that we have these motions at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the reason we are debating this issue 
tonight is that the Liberal government refused to bring the 
debate to where it belongs, which is to the island of Cape Breton 
to talk to the families of the Cape Breton miners and the people 
who are directly affected by Devco. It was cowardly of the 
government to introduce Bill C-11 and to close Devco without 
consulting the people there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the Liberals really afraid of?  Were they afraid that 
the wives and families of Cape Breton miners would come to them 
at a public hearing and voice their concerns?  Is that so 
threatening?  Is it so damaging that people might have an 
alternate opinion about what we should do about the dissolution 
of the Cape Breton Development Corporation?  Cowardly is the only 
word that comes to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are here so late at night discussing this, 
trying to keep the House going so we can have this proper debate 
only indicates we should have had this debate much earlier when 
we had the opportunity. The government refused to go to Cape 
Breton to consult.  It left the miners of Cape Breton with no 
alternative.  Sometimes when the mechanism we put in place to 
give ourselves satisfaction in terms of having our voices heard 
collapses and falls apart, Canadians are left with no alternative 
but civil disobedience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to say it but it is true, the miners of Cape Breton took 
things into their own hands. We would not even be here today with 
the small bit of satisfaction that Cape Breton miners will get 
out of this dissolution if it were not for the courage of Cape 
Breton miners to take over their mine by civil disobedience, to 
strike illegally and to occupy the mine. 
That took courage.  That took strength.  That indicates to me 
that the government refused to listen to them and refused them 
access to legitimate means of satisfaction, which should have 
been available to them and this House of Commons through 
legitimate debate, and should have been available to them at the 
committee stage, when the committee could have actually toured 
Cape Breton and listened to the concerns of Cape Breton miners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that at the committee stage our party at least put 
forward meaningful amendments.  Some of those amendments now 
stand before the House under Group No. 3, but they were raised at 
committee first.  We made legitimate, honest attempts to change 
Bill C-11 to make it more fair, more just, more equitable, and 
they were refused.  They were just cast out.  They were 
categorically denied by the Liberal majority on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those amendments were as reasonable as things like 
guaranteeing that the people of Cape Breton would be represented 
on any Devco board of directors in the future.  How could anyone 
think it would be in any way wrong for the people who are 
directly affected to have representation?  Honestly, it is 
enormously frustrating for those of us who are still trying to 
get some satisfaction out of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really no surprise that there are no Liberal 
representatives from Cape Breton.  I would say that Cape 
Bretoners have lost any confidence in the Liberal government to 
represent them adequately.  There are only two members of 
parliament from Cape Breton.  They are both from the New 
Democratic Party.  I guess that explains partly why we are still 
here standing for Cape Bretoners and trying to represent their 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes to mind that there are no Liberal members of parliament 
from all of Nova Scotia.  That perhaps is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on Devco was quashed by the Liberal government.  The 
Liberal government has tried its best to deny voice to the people 
of Cape Breton by ramming Bill C-11 through the House of Commons, 
knowing full well that there are reasonable arguments to be made 
to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the things brought forth by the member for 
Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton two 
and a half years ago now find themselves in the arbitration 
award, the ruling that came down which resolved the illegal 
walkout and the occupation of the Prince Mine.  Yes, the people 
of Cape Breton took the action of an illegal strike and an 
occupation of the mine, but to their very great credit they were 
reasonable enough to say that they would end the occupation if 
the government put the matter to binding arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were confident that their argument had enough merit that an 
objective outside third party would see the merit in their 
arguments, would agree and would rule with them.  It takes great 
courage for people to throw their future into the laps of an 
outside third party, which they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to say that in very recent days this arbitration 
ruling came down.  I believe it was on Friday, June 2. 
Ironically, that was the third anniversary of the election which 
saw every Liberal member of parliament summarily kicked out of 
Nova Scotia due to gross dissatisfaction.  The ruling came down 
with almost word for word what the Cape Breton miners had asked 
for originally and what the members from Cape Breton have been 
saying would be a fair and just award in terms of pension 
settlement, in terms of long term support for those who will be 
displaced, in terms of representation on boards of directors for 
any institution that might replace the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some satisfaction in that, but there is still a huge 
sadness and a huge disappointment for the people of Cape Breton 
that it took civil disobedience and direct action to get this 
satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It speaks to the absolute arrogance and almost punitive kind of 
indifference, almost a malice toward the people of Cape Breton, 
that the government made them go to those degrees, to take those 
steps, to go to those measures to get what should have been 
theirs to begin with.  Even still the arbitration award does not 
adequately speak to the whole philosophical shift on behalf of 
the Liberal Party, that Liberal members no longer feel any 
responsibility toward any region outside central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not come here to fight about western alienation, but the 
longer I am here I certainly sense how alienated I am as a 
westerner.  I can only sympathize with my colleagues from Cape 
Breton, Nova Scotia or any region outside the golden triangle who 
may feel that the Liberal government has abandoned them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
sorry that I am here to speak to this issue, but glad that I have 
the opportunity to speak for another 10 minutes.  There was a lot 
that I did not have the chance to say about the previous 
amendments and I will make a point of emphasizing those points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now dealing with the amendments in Group No. 3.  They 
have been brought forward by my colleagues, and obviously none of 
my colleagues from the other parties, not the reform alliance nor 
the Bloc.  Maybe one member of the Conservative Party had a 
little meek voice at one point.  There has been nothing from 
government members, not a thing.  Once again it emphasizes that 
they are all on the same wave length, that they are all in bed 
together, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really disappointed in my colleagues from the Bloc.  As 
much as I know they are here strictly for Quebec, usually they 
have more of a social conscience than some of the other parties. 
Quite frankly, that they would not even stand to speak for 
workers in Cape Breton is a disappointment.  I expected more of a 
principled approach.  Those members are there to support workers. 
The workers are fighting for what is important to them, ensuring 
that they have a decent pension and an opportunity to have a say 
over what happens to their pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as my NDP colleagues have mentioned, there are some 
really way out amendments being asked for.  The other parties are 
quite bothered over having to stay these extra hours to discuss 
these amendments.  It is important for people to know that the 
hours have been extended.  The NDP has forced the hours to be 
extended.  The government wants to get on with other issues, so 
it wants to extend the hours to get this over and done with. Let 
us wipe those Cape Bretoners out of the House.  Let us get them 
off the Hill as quickly as possible and move this issue out of 
the way, so we can deal with other things and go home for the 
summer recess.  Everybody here is mumbling because they have to 
stay late tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are mumbling because they have to stay late 
tonight, as they are really feeling put out, they should think of 
each and every one of those miners in Cape Breton.  They should 
think of each and every one of the families in Cape Breton, those 
small and medium size businesses and all those people who will be 
directly affected by what is happening here today.  As they are 
feeling bothered, instead of hemming and hawing and cursing, they 
should take a moment to think about those families in Cape Breton 
who will lose out because the government did not have the will to 
start working on this issue five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite apparent that it planned this five years ago. 
Instead of getting on with things and ensuring that there was 
training in place and opportunities in place, the government is 
fighting, saying that it does not want to put any more money into 
that black hole.  The reform alliance members are saying no more 
money into that black hole and asking where else would pensioners 
get any money at 25 years or whatever.  They are moaning about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that those miners in Cape Breton do not want 
a government handout.  They never did.  They want to work.  As 
rotten as the coal mining industry can be, as dirty, wretched and 
unhealthy as it can be, those miners want to work, just like the 
miners at Westray wanted to work.  They want to put food on their 
tables, a roof over their head, and clothes on the backs of their 
families.  That is what they want.  They do not want a government 
handout.  The government had this plan in the works. Did it do 
anything for the last five years?  No, nothing.  All of a sudden 
it comes down with this policy of “We are not going to give them 
anything.  We are going to get out of this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said when I spoke to the amendments in Group No. 2, we will 
watch to see what happens with coal mining in Cape Breton.  If 
Devco is sold off for a little buck and a patronage investment is 
made, or if we see Canadian dollars being invested in Colombia, 
we will remind the government each and every day and we will 
remind Canadians each and every day that that was what it was 
about.  It was a cheap investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We maintained all along that the government never really cared 
about decent labour standards, work standards or any of those 
conditions.  It will take us right to the bottom.  It will wipe 
out the coal mining industry in Canada, but invest in that same 
industry somewhere else with Canadian taxpayer dollars, the same 
dollars that those miners in Cape Breton put into the economy in 
their communities and throughout Canada through their taxes, 
their EI payments and their investments in the local economies.

Islands.  The cannot afford to run a flagship under another 
country.  They are not investing in Colombia; they are investing 
in Canada.  That is more than this government is making sure is 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment in Group No. 3 asks for: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“good mine safety, to provide permanent, full-time employment to 
the residents of the Island of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and to 
conduct its operations in a manner that benefits the economy of 
the Island of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty far out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Good safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Yes, good safety.  I can see why the 
government would shy away from that, good safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole horrendous issue could have been avoided had the 
government started dealing with it a number of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wants to see a situation where taxpayer dollars are 
invested and nothing really comes out of it.  No one wants to see 
that.  Neither do the miners of Cape Breton.  This could have 
been avoided had there been some planning and work done over the 
last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that those miners had to fight just to 
get a decent pension.  My colleague mentioned the miners having 
to engage in civil disobedience, closing down the mine for a few 
days in order to get the government to at least come up with a 
decent pension.  Canadians should be getting used to this now 
with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The women of the federal civil service had to fight for pay 
equity for 15 years.  They had to literally pull the government, 
kicking and screaming, into the new millennium.  It took that 
long to get the government to pay what was owed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merchant marines had to fight for their pension.  How long 
did it take?  It has taken the three years I have been here just 
to have the government give them a decent pension, after all 
those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It stole the surplus out of EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Absolutely.  How long did the hep C 
victims have to fight to see some kind of settlement?  We still 
have some who are not covered.  We will keep at it because we 
know that little by little maybe somebody on the other side will 
listen.  Perhaps there will be enough voices raised in Canada to 
get those Liberals onside, to say nothing of my hon. colleagues 
on the other side who are busy mumbling because they have to 
stay late.  Perhaps we will get something done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have got on with it and had things 
working.  It should have made plans, rather than wasting the last 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the same thing with the recent airline crisis.  The 
government could have done something about it.  We did not have 
to be in this situation with a monopoly carrier.  However, for 
the sake of deregulation and privatization, we had to make sure 
we did not have any of that because it was really bad.  We needed 
a competitive industry.  We really got the depth of a competitive 
industry in Canada, did we not?   We have a monopoly carrier and 
numerous problems to go with it, all because the government did 
not act a number of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are arguing over the high price of air fares and the 
treatment we are getting from Air Canada.  The employees are 
taking the brunt of it.  They are the ones who are at the 
counters with lineups two miles long.  They are the ones who are 
taking the flack from the passengers, not the Prime Minister, not 
the Minister of Transport, not the Minister of Industry.  Not 
them at all.  Not the president and CEO of Air Canada.  The 
workers are taking the flack, the ones who cannot afford to 
invest in the Cayman Islands.  The workers are always taking the 
brunt of the policies and decisions of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the government does not look as though 
it will do anything about the amendments to this bill.  It is 
shameful.  It is very shameful.  There is no question that none 
of the other parties will do anything.  They have other things 
which they think are more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canadian Alliance members who are all rushing off to 
make phone calls to get someone to vote for Preston or Stockwell 
or Tom.  I am surprised they did not send someone out to get Joe 
onside because pretty soon we will see the rest of them moving 
over there too.  Then they will just move in with the government, 
because there is really no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing that none of those hon. members are here 
speaking out for ordinary workers and for the miners of Cape 
Breton.  It is extremely disappointing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess 
they must have come out of the mine.  I am pleased to rise on to 
speak to the Group No. 3 motions.  I want to address myself to 
the contents of the bill again and to indicate the support I have 
for the two members from Cape Breton and from Sydney—Victoria. 
Motion No. 13 in Group No. 3 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-11, in Clause 12, be amended by replacing line 35 on 
page 4 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“good mine safety, to provide permanent, full-time employment to 
the residents of the Island of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and to 
conduct its operations in a manner that benefits the economy of 
the Island of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion involves broadening the good mine safety terms and 
includes an employment requirement on behalf of Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who would vote against that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  I have no idea why anyone would vote 
against good mine safety and an employment requirement on behalf 
of the development corporation.  Motion No. 14 in Group No. 3 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-11 in Clause 12, be amended by adding after line 10 
on page 5 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“17.  The Corporation, in conjunction with the Government of 
Canada or of Nova Scotia or any agency of either of these 
governments, shall adopt and continue all reasonable measures 
deemed necessary to reduce as far as possible the unemployment or 
economic hardship that is expected to result from the closing, 
privatization or reduction in the production of coal”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would reinstate the requirement for the development 
corporation and both the federal and the provincial governments 
to take all necessary steps and precautions to reduce the 
negative impact of the privatization or cessation of activities 
of the development corporation.  Motion No. 15 in Group No. 3 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-11, in Clause 12, be amended by adding after line 10 
on page 5 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“17.  The Corporation shall adopt all reasonable measures to 
reduce, to the fullest extent possible, any economic hardship or 
unemployment that may result from the closing of any coal mine 
operated by the Corporation”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we support this initiative because it reinstates the 
requirement for the corporation to take all necessary steps to 
reduce the negative impact of the privatization or cessation of 
activities of Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions categorized in Group No. 3 are very important to 
what we are trying to develop not only in Cape Breton but in 
terms of what we want to see carried out from coast to coast to 
coast with regard to proper occupational health and safety for 
mine workers in particular and an employment requirement on 
behalf of Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the notion that the corporation should adopt all 
reasonable measures to reduce to the fullest extent possible any 
economic hardship, obviously there is coal in the ground in Nova 
Scotia.  The mine nevertheless will be closed. 
We will be buying coal offshore.  Some of us are very concerned 
from where the coal will be delivered to Nova Scotia.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the miners have worked for 25 years or thereabouts.  It 
is tough to retrain those people after a lifetime of working 
underground.  They will not come up and suddenly qualify for the 
new emerging technology, the infotech the other buzzwords that 
are so prevalent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about Silicon Valley? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  They will not come out of mine valley 
and work in Silicon Valley.  This is the essence of what my 
colleagues in the House have been trying to convey to the 
government and to members of other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are striving to make sure that these workers, these employees 
and their families are treated as humanely and fairly as they 
possibly can be.  It is important not to lose sight of that 
aspect of it.  That is why we are holding up this bill.  That is 
why we are fighting for these changes.  We think that what has 
been offered so far falls short of what is fair and just to these 
folks.  They have been dealt a very bitter blow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an absolute lack of public hearings. I know the 
Minister of Natural Resources was there, but all attempts to have 
meetings in Cape Breton to debate and discuss this issue have 
been brushed aside in a classic father knows best approach that 
they do not need to hear from the local people, that those in the 
Department of Natural Resources have all the answers and do not 
have to bother with hearing from the folks who are most closely 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton deserve a lot more than what they have 
been offered by the government in this bill.  Again that is why 
we are so supportive of the important motions of the member for 
Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and the member for Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the issue of the representation.  We want 
to ensure that the proper associations are represented so that 
they can sit down with management and discuss the issues that can 
help the employees and their families to reach a proper, just and 
fair settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be the last time I will have an opportunity to speak 
to the three groups of report stage motions.  We discussed some 
of them at some length on Friday and adjourned the debate at 1.30 
p.m. We have been dealing today with Groups Nos. 2 and 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good mine safety is obviously an important issue.  These motions 
would reinstate the requirement for the corporation and the 
federal and provincial governments to take all necessary steps to 
reduce the negative impact of the privatization or secession of 
activities by Devco and would reinstate the requirement for the 
corporation to take all necessary steps to reduce the negative 
impact of the privatization or secession of activities by Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pleased to participate in the third reading of this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-11 deals with an issue concerning the Cape Breton region. 
Why did the government not allow any consultation to take place? 
Why could the committee not travel to Cape Breton and speak to 
the community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not like we are dealing with all coal mines in Canada.  We 
are dealing with one mine in one location, in one city, in one 
region, in one part of our country.  This is why this debate is 
happening.  My hon. colleagues have stood time and time again to 
bring forward the concern that the community is not being 
listened to.  The community could best represent itself if the 
bill and its amendments were debated and discussed at the 
community level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions before us touch on health and safety and 
jurisdiction.  The economic impact of the bill should be designed 
to be a positive one for the region and the community.  Any 
dismantling of the Devco mine or any rearranging either by 
private initiative or closure of the mine should be looked at as 
a positive step out of a very negative move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today challenges members on the government side to 
realize that our common goal as parliamentarians is to make the 
communities in our regions as well as our economic and industrial 
sectors better places.  Closing down the mine or possibly selling 
it to private interests is a major transition for Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reach this point has taken decades of evolution.  To abandon 
Cape Bretoners without their having a solid grasp on the details 
or on the implications is not acceptable.  It is fine to draft 
procedures in a bill, but if we predict the impact it will have 
on the community that is where the concerns start to overflow 
into the House.  The concerns at the community level far outweigh 
the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community has stated its concerns through its duly elected 
members of parliament.  We are calling on all members of 
parliament to respect those views.  They have been formulated 
into amendments to create an act that better represents and 
better serves the community.  These amendments are what we are 
debating tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want Liberal members to take a second look at the amendments 
and to vote in favour of getting community representation on the 
Devco board.  We want the pensioners' association, the people who 
have amassed huge pension funds and huge seniority credits over 
the years of serving in this company, to have a say in the 
dissolution of the mine.  They should have a vested interest as 
they know what is best.  They risked their lives.  This is no 
ordinary mine by any stretch of the imagination.  The health and 
safety of the miners were in peril in the mines every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good friend of mine, Mr. Matt Minglewood, sings a classic song 
called <I>Working Man</I>.   He is an excellent blues performer 
from Cape Breton.  He sings this song with his heart and soul, 
just as Rita MacNeil would sing it.  It deals with the life of a 
coal miner and the lost ones who did not make it home.  This song 
hits hard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the concerns of the constituents, the miners and the 
families and from which the amendments have been formulated.  It 
is detrimental.  In my back yard there are uranium mines.  There 
will be a delayed impact on those mine workers.  We might be 
concerned about our miners in about 20 or 30 years when the 
impact starts to show up. The respiratory and safety issues for 
coal miners from being underground with unstable minerals, 
unstable walls and ceilings in some cases are much more 
immediate.  The gases that emanate from this fossil fuel are 
detrimental constantly. That is the view with which we bring our 
passionate debate; it is from caring for our workers. We should 
duly respect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have taken the committee hearings right into that 
community because it concerns their mine and their immediate 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at the third group of our amendments.  I want to crawl 
into the conscience of the members who are listening, who are 
present in the House or who are watching the debate on television 
in their offices.  This will come to a vote.  We ask government 
members to seriously look at these amendments that strengthen the 
arguments and concerns that constituents have in Cape Breton, and 
those of the workers and pensioners in terms of losing a 
livelihood and the opportunity to raise their children as they 
have been doing for so many generations in that neck of the 
woods.  That is the way I look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That part of Canada has contributed to all of the economy of 
Canada.  The steel that came from Cape Breton built a lot of our 
railroads and industries in the industrial age.  Let us give 
those people thanks.  Let us not disrespect them in a way such as 
this.  Coal energized, heated and electrically lit many of these 
buildings during much of the electrical revolution which took 
place.  This country was founded on many of the developments from 
coal that was mined in that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us give those people due respect.  They gave us a fighting 
chance to have an economic stronghold in Toronto.  Toronto should 
say thanks.  Montreal should say thanks.  Vancouver should say 
thanks.  All the people we represent in the House should make a 
conscious effort to thank that region which is hard hit 
economically, environmentally and healthwise. Some things will be 
genetically passed on to their offspring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the legacy of the tar ponds, pollution which is being 
left right in the middle of their community. We have to take 
responsibility as a nation.  We represent the nation of Canada. 
Bill C-11 attempts to devolve an industry that may be justified. 
The question of whether it is justified was tossed around.  If it 
is, let us do it in an honourable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The honourable process is to debate it correctly and thoroughly. 
It should be listened to and heeded.  If common sense approaches 
are given by our colleagues in their representations of their 
constituents and communities, they should be taken seriously by 
the government. The senior officials of the government should 
mentor their voters and tell them to vote with their consciences, 
to vote in the right way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the Devco issue has certainly come to a head on 
making a decision on the future of a community and the livelihood 
and careers of many families.  Let us give it due respect.  Let 
us give that because of what those people have done for the 
economy of the country and what they have done in trying to 
represent themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments try to allow workers to sit on the board 
of directors and to allow pensioners to sit at their association 
tables.  It is so they can make crucial decisions as opposed to 
parachuting in someone or in the worst case, putting someone in 
these positions for partisan reasons because of their political 
stripe or because of the card they carry.  Let us respect the 
community for what it is trying to achieve in its people 
representing themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An honourable way to end the debate is to vote in favour of the 
amendments that my hon. colleagues have brought forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and 
I suppose I would have to say to make one further plea to members 
present and those members presumably representing their caucuses 
to take seriously what it is we are involved in tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague from Churchill River say that some of us 
are trying to get inside the heads of our colleagues opposite to 
understand what they are really thinking about the impact of the 
legislation before us on the lives of miners who have devoted 
literally their working years to the coal mining of Cape Breton 
and the impact on the whole communities in which those people 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose for members opposite it may seem we are just here to 
wrap up a bit of unfinished business, that we are just taking 
care of what is left over after the miners of Cape Breton have 
been employed for a period of time by Devco.  Now progress has to 
go forward and since privatization is the mantra of the 
government on many fronts these days, it is just more of the same 
and we are just of wrapping up the assets and putting them to 
bed, washing our hands of it and everything is taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to take stock of exactly what has 
gone on here and what it is we are really engaged in, in dealing 
with this stage of debate on Bill C-11. We need to think about 
the backdrop for what is going on here.  What is the context in 
which this discussion is taking place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleagues, particularly the two members who so 
ably represent the people of Cape Breton Island, the member for 
Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, have 
worked very hard to put forward the concerns of their 
constituents, not just of the coal miners, but of their families, 
their extended families and their entire communities, really the 
entire economy of Cape Breton. They have tried to make members, 
particularly on the government benches, understand the extent to 
which Devco has been a positive economic development tool for all 
of Cape Breton Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy of Cape Breton Island is an exceedingly important 
part of the economy of the province of Nova Scotia. That is why 
members from all of Nova Scotia are very much engaged in this 
debate.  But it goes beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What all of the members of the NDP caucus understand, and it 
does not appear as though there are many others in the House who 
understand, is that if the government of the day gets away with 
doing to the people of Cape Breton Island and to the generations 
of coal miners of that community, what it is apparently hell-bent 
on doing, then it could do the same to any other community in 
Canada.  That is why the New Democratic Party has been absolutely 
steadfast and persistent in standing against what the government 
is doing here in dismantling Devco and basically saying it will 
just wash its hands of the future of the coal mining industry in 
Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will do the trendy thing.  It will lay it open 
and invite the privatizers to come in.  It will turn it over to 
private industry.  Anybody who thinks that is a welcome 
initiative to the people of Nova Scotia, particularly the people 
of Cape Breton, does not know the history of coal mining in Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not understand what went on in the lives of miners who 
were employed by those private corporations. 
It was hell.  It was a very unhappy era in the history of Nova 
Scotia's economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is too much to ask government members to go back and look 
at what happened in the province of Nova Scotia when coal mining 
was in the hands of the private sector, maybe some of the members 
opposite could take a moment to think about what went on in the 
hands of a private corporation in Nova Scotia more recently. 
There is no one opposite, particularly this week, who can pretend 
they do not know the history of what happened under the private 
corporation, the Westray mine, Curragh Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that in my 20 years in politics, without a doubt, 
the most horrifying experience that I have ever endured was to 
spend an evening, as I recall of four or five hours, with the 
coal miners who had survived the Westray disaster and with the 
widows and families of the victims of the Westray disaster a day 
or two after the lives of those 26 miners were lost.  If there 
was one thing that became clear to me, it was the difference it 
made to coal mining in Cape Breton and in fact much more 
dangerous coal mining taking place in Cape Breton.  Let us be 
clear that it was much more challenging, with very deep mines way 
out under the ocean floor.  There is no question that it was very 
dangerous work and very vulnerable to any number of horrifying 
kinds of disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone know what the difference was?  There was a genuine 
sense that the public interest had to be protected, that the 
lives and the livelihoods of the miners had to be protected and 
that this was a resource, this was an asset to the whole of the 
Cape Breton and Nova Scotia economy.  What a contrast between the 
experience of workers employed by Devco, a crown corporation in 
Nova Scotia over the last several decades, and the horrors of 
what happened under the private coal mining company of Curragh 
Resources at Westray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I contemplate the kind of private industry start-up that 
apparently the government is very enthusiastic about, at least in 
concept, I do not think we are fully convinced that the 
government is serious about coal mining continuing under private 
auspices.  In fact there is every reason to be suspicious that 
this really is the government saying “Let us wrap up the coal 
mining in Cape Breton and let us just move on”.  There is every 
reason to be concerned about what this is really about.  Even if 
we took the government at its word and it was enthusiastic about 
coal mining under private auspices, we have to wonder if it has 
really learned anything from the lesson of Westray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was any member opposite who did not fully understand 
what that lesson was before last week, there is no excuse now for 
saying that they do not understand it.  The United Steelworkers 
of America that represent the surviving miners from Westray have 
been here on the Hill for the last eight days to make sure that 
there is no person in this Chamber, no one representing workers 
anywhere in the 301 ridings in the country who does not 
understand what it meant for coal mining to take place under the 
auspices of a private company and where there was no assurance 
whatsoever of there being a union. That is the other part of it, 
the health and safety laws of this country mean nothing in the 
context of a union free mine setting. 
I have to say in conclusion that the backdrop for this is very 
alarming, as is the failure of the government to learn the 
lessons of history.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the backdrop that I think is highly relevant is 
the general assembly meetings of the OAS that are taking place in 
Canada, for the first time since Canada joined the OAS 10 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the spectacle happening right now before our eyes.  It 
is not something that people are talking about as a possible 
future development but of coal being imported from Colombia, one 
of the worst countries in the world in terms of labour standards, 
environmental standards, health and safety, and human rights. 
That coal will be imported from Colombia to be burned in Nova 
Scotia because the government has pulled the plug on Devco 
mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that has no interest in either the current 
lives and the future of coal miners in that community and the 
broader impact, or in a serious commitment to ensure the 
continuation of coal mining in Cape Breton.  In view of the 
developments that are about to unfold and in view of what is 
already happening as a result of the government basically pulling 
the plug on coal mining in Cape Breton, it is amazing that we 
have had almost no participation of government members in the 
debate around such important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This a very sad day, not just for the miners in Cape Breton who 
in many cases have given their health or sacrificed their lives 
to provide coal that has been so important to economy of the 
country.  It is also a sad day to think that the government could 
turn its back on the regional economy.  This country is made up 
of regional economies.  I think it is fair to say that this is a 
lesson that will not be missed by the people of Nova Scotia or 
others across the country who care a great deal more for their 
communities and the regional economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The government earlier moved to extend hours because it 
wanted to have as much debate as possible.  I wonder if the House 
would give its unanimous consent so that the hon. member for 
Halifax could continue her remarks.  I am sure she has more to 
say on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent for the hon. member to continue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will resist the 
temptation to respond to each and every of the many, shall I be 
generous, questionable points raised by my hon. friends across 
the way, except maybe to point out a particularly important point 
that much was made of, the reference to the very tragic incident 
at Westray.  I want to underline it was the unions that insisted
