long fight against cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of his family, I would like to remind my colleagues

</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period volunteers will be knocking at your doors 
collecting contributions for the fight against cancer.  I 
encourage you all to be generous with your donations. Help us to 
win the battle against this killer disease, which last year alone 
took more than 65,000 members of our big Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also invite all colleagues to place a donation in the 
boxes in the two lobbies.  All the funds collected will be added 
up and sent directly to the Cancer Society at the end of the 
month.

Mr. Speaker, better highways rank fourth in my riding's 
federal concerns, right after the big three of health care, lower 
taxes and paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently drove the Trans-Canada Highway from my British 
Columbia home to Ottawa.  I have seen better back roads in our 
major trading partner, the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1800s Ottawa had a vision to link our huge country by 
building a railroad.  Today the government supports the 
information highway but virtually ignores highway infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essential goods and services do not move on the Internet. 
Students may visit virtual museums via the Internet but it is 
impossible for the tourism industry to provide hotel rooms or 
meals to electronic tourists.  Accidents on unforgiving roads 
impose needless suffering and overload our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not connect Canadians with modern highways following the 
same federal-provincial model used for health care and education? 
During the present review of the Canada Transportation Act, I 
call on the government to fix our highways now.

National Cancer Institute of Canada.

Post</I> applauds President Bush for ending the American Bar 
Association's role in vetting judicial appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> says that this is a good thing because 
the American Bar Association has become overly political. 
America's top lawyers, according to the <I>National Post</I>, have 
committed the deadly sins of endorsing employment initiatives for 
minorities, of endorsing a woman's right to choose an abortion, 
terrible, according to the <I>National Post</I>, of endorsing 
federal funding for the arts and of backing Clinton's failed 
attempt to bring in public health care; dreadful ideas, according 
to the <I>National Post</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And if that is not enough, the American Bar Association is 
further to be condemned for failing to support minimum mandatory 
sentences and capital punishment.

compiles dozens of verified eyewitness accounts from different 
parts of the Ottoman Empire and sheds light on the Armenian 
genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Sarafian is one of the founding directors of the Gomidas

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday all members from the 
Liberal Party turned their backs on Canadian farm families when 
they voted against increased emergency help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that the cabinet intends to ignore the farm 
income crisis, the disaster continues.  Just yesterday there was 
a tragic story from Manitoba.  The Farm Credit Corporation held a 
forced sale of a family farm.  More than 1,000 acres of land, 
several farm buildings and a residence were put up for auction. 
Not one single bid was made for this farm.  There is simply not 
enough money in farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This farmer was driven to bankruptcy by a government that 
ignored the natural disaster caused by excessive flooding in 1999 
and turned a blind eye to disastrously low commodity prices. 
This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Because of the Liberal 
indifference, we see many forced auctions this year and see that 
many farmers will lose their life's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has left many Canadian farmers with no 
hope this spring.

social housing is, first and foremost, housing belonging to the 
community as a whole and intended primarily to provide decent 
affordable accommodation. But Statistics Canada informs us that 
just over two of every five tenant households are spending more 
than 30% of their income on accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been six years since the federal government invested 
in any new social housing. Groups throughout Canada are asking 
the federal government to double funding for housing assistance, 
not for so-called affordable housing, which will serve private 
interests, but for housing which will rent at below-market rates, 
and which will provide a better quality of life and access to 
various services and mutual assistance.

Mr. Speaker, earlier this year I received letters from grade 6 
students in the classroom of Miss Bender at St. Volodymyr school 
in Saskatoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, a significant number of them asked that 
parliament lower the price of gasoline by reducing the taxes on 
gas.  Some students cited environmental concerns.  Others asked 
that we do something to help farmers who these children see 
protesting in the news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though they are just children, they understand that their 
parents would have more money to spend on their own families if 
the government would lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to each and every member of parliament in the House of 
Commons that it is not just the children at St. Volodymyr school 
who are concerned about such issues, but indeed children across 
our entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past practice of exploiting society's wealth and leaving the 
next generation to pay is unfair.  The result is a $565 billion 
national debt.  This represents a mortgage on future generations 
of Canadians.  Therefore, we have a duty to our children to pay 
the debt off.  Doing so would make our country a stronger place 
in which to live and prosper.

the softwood lumber issue is coming to a head as we speak and

of the industry and call a meeting of the industry leaders now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Watergate tapes had 18 missing 
minutes.  The Shawinigan papers have six missing years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, the Prime Minister said that the ethics counsellor 
would release all documents.  On Tuesday, the ethics counsellor 
admitted that he had not released all the documents.  We want to 
see the documents that show who owned the shares between 1996 and 
1999, the years the Prime Minister was shovelling all that 
government money into the hotel next door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he release those documents that show who owned the shares 
between 1996 and 1999? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, anyone who can read, can read the documents.  It is very 
clear that the shares were not mine since November 1, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat that I have complied with the wishes of the 
opposition.  On March 15, the member for Edmonton North said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister could get over this in a heartbeat by just 
tabling his bill of sale for those shares in 1993. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was done by the ethics counsellor yesterday morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, he keeps talking about one of the 
documents we wanted on the table.  We also want the ones that are 
under the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jonas Prince changed his story in 1999 under pressure from the 
Prime Minister's lawyers.  The former owner said that he had made 
a payment of $40,000 and optioned to get himself out of the 
agreement.  He said that he did not have any more ownership in 
the Grand-Mère.  That was said by Mr. Prince.  However, the 
ethics counsellor did not release those documents related to that 
transaction in November 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister table the documents that reflect on that 
transaction in November 1997, the transaction that Mr. Prince 
said brought him out of the shares and left them with the Prime 
Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the ethics counsellor has said, at least 10 times in 
front of committee or in the press, that the shares had been 
transferred, that he was satisfied and that there was no conflict 
of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the only thing under the table is the payback that the 
Reform Party got from the law firm.  It changed the books of the 
law firm.  The first cheque was signed by the firm and after that 
it was an individual who so generously paid $70,000 to the party 
after the firm gained $400,000 of legal fees.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there are more holes in the Prime Minister's 
version than there are in the whole Grand-Mère golf course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has released a few selected documents.  But 
there is a period of six years between 1993 and 1999.

<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I said it before and will say it again, I tabled the documents

they would ask no further questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a colleague who was in the House for two terms, Jim Hart, 
was promised $50,000 if he would resign his seat.  He has told 
some of my colleagues that it was easy to talk to Liberal members 
but the Leader of the Opposition never returns his phone calls 
because he does not want to pay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian

Prime Minister would sell one of his most treasured assets by 
writing out an agreement in longhand, without witnesses and 
without a deposit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for us to believe that it took two years for the 
Prime Minister to realize that Jonas Prince had neglected to pay 
him $150,000.  It appears to us that the Prime Minister never 
intended to get paid for the shares, that he intended to take 
them back after he retired from politics.

<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all these matters have been dealt with properly by all 
the proper authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was listening to the Leader of the Opposition, I was 
reminded that I am somewhat of an expert on endangered species, 
and there is no doubt that what this leader and a turbot have in 
common is that they are both hanging on by their fingernails. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, investors were not rushing 
out to buy the shares in this golf course.  It took the Prime 
Minister six years to find somebody to pay him for his shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the Auberge Grand-Mère gone bankrupt nobody, not even his 
partners, would have been prepared to further invest in the golf 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was not the real reason why the Prime Minister took such a 
personal interest in the hotel to keep it afloat, that he was 
protecting his assets? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians would do well to remember that members 
opposite initially asked for an ethics counsellor investigation. 
They got it. The leader of the Conservative Party demanded that 
the RCMP investigate the matter.  They did, and they closed the 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Conservative Party, an expert 
investigator, a private eye, then asked if the they had asked all 
the right questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They then asked for the bill of sale.  They got the bill of 
sale.  Yesterday they were complaining there were not 300 
original bills of sale.

the Prime Minister admitted to the House that the purpose of the 
September 1999 agreement released yesterday was to end his 
involvement in the Grand-Mère golf club.  The Prime Minister said 
that its purpose was to “wrap up matters as clearly as 
possible”.  Those were his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If matters were still ongoing, this would mean that the Prime 
Minister still had financial interests in the Grand-Mère golf 
club when he tried to obtain financial assistance for the 
Auberge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that the agreement, like his own 
statements, shows that he was in complete conflict of interest 
when he intervened in the Auberge affair?

it is a sure bet they did not talk about the Prime Minister's 
integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister tells us that releasing the record of 
sale should put an end to it, it is because they thought that 
that would clear his name but, in fact, everything that has been

</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the Prime Minister to table the documents concerning 
the golf issue, so that he could restore his integrity. Not only 
do the documents tabled yesterday prove that he was in a

</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this personal stake, he personally intervened in at

<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 48(2), I 
rise on a question of privilege arising from comments made 
yesterday by the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a question he had asked the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the hon. member said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he is at it, the minister referred to a group of members of 
parliament who travelled to Sudan.  How does the minister feel 
about the fact that the tickets for that trip were paid for by 
Talisman Energy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister feel it is appropriate that two Liberal 
colleagues and one Alliance member, one of the Liberals being the 
vice-chair of the foreign affairs committee, should be travelling 
to Sudan, paid for by Talisman Energy?  Is that acceptable to the 
minister? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas has deliberately misled the 
House.  I have a letter from the Canada Arab Council which I 
would like to table in the House today which states unequivocally 
that it was the Canada Arab Council that paid for those tickets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could read from that letter, dated March 28, 2001, it 
responds to your request, Mr. Speaker.  I made a request in 
response to the allegations by the hon. member just to reconfirm 
what I had known prior to this trip.  The letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to your request for confirmation of the funding 
arrangements covering airfare and accommodation of the recent 
Nile River Valley familiarization trip to Egypt and central 
Sudan, March 9-10 to 20, 2001 by three federal MPs and a Quebec 
MNA, I wish to confirm: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The trip was organized and sponsored, including airfare, by 
the National Council on Canada Arab Relations in accordance with 
its public education mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. More specifically The National Council on Canada Arab 
Relations purchased the air tickets with funds from its general 
account. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will table the letter in the House today.  I am demanding that 
the hon. member apologize to myself for impugning my reputation 
and not dealing with the larger issue of a country that is racked 
by civil war and for that member to put his skills toward 
advocating a peace plan that will hold the government of Sudan, 
the FPLA and Talisman Energy's feet to the fire to develop peace 
in that country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am not sure what the point was of the point of privilege.  I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to be very clear on precisely 
what has taken place in this very sad affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I trust I will be given 
the same courtesy as the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier today, at a 
press conference held by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton and 
the hon. member from Mississauga, the vice-chair of the foreign 
affairs committee, those two members confirmed that the travel 
within Sudan by the delegation that included the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca was paid for by an oil consortium which 
included Talisman Energy. That was confirmed directly by those 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, with respect to the travel and the cost of travel 
of the three members from Canada to Sudan, the fact is that 
Talisman Energy contributed significant funds to the National 
Council on Canada Arab Relations, which in turn were used to fund 
the travel of the three members who went to Sudan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talisman Energy funded the National Council on Canada Arab 
Relations with respect to this matter.  Talisman Energy funded 
the travel within Sudan.  Frankly, it is appalling that hon. 
members of this place would accept a trip funded by Talisman 
Energy, which has been complicit in some of the most egregious human 
rights violations in Sudan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think it is clear that there is a 
disagreement as to facts in this case.  Unless the hon. member 
has something that is quite new to introduce into the matter, I 
would caution him.  I do not want to protract the debate, because 
I think that is what we are into here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas does not get it.  He is impugning, as he said in 
the House of Commons yesterday, that we knowingly went on this 
trip paid for by Talisman oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked prior to the trip who was paying for it, and it was the 
Canada Arab Council.  After the trip I asked whether Talisman had 
paid for it.  I received a document, which I will table in the 
House, that clearly states it was the Canada Arab Council and not 
Talisman oil that paid for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I demand that the member for Burnaby—Douglas stop misleading 
the House and apologize to me and my colleagues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member wants to seek leave 
of the House to table his letter, he may do so, but I think we 
ought to leave the matter there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears there is a disagreement and I do not think it is one 
the Chair will be able to resolve.  The members have different 
views of the facts of the case as is apparent from the 
submissions we have heard.  If we go on further, we will hear a 
lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member wish to seek consent of the House to table 
those documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca have unanimous consent of the House to table this letter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Will the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas be 
adding anything new to this question of privilege?  I do not 
really want to hear more on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fundamental question 
is: Talisman Energy paid the national council to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is a continuing dispute.  The hon. 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw my point 
of order.  I think the member for Surrey Central has the same 
point of order.

Mr. Speaker, during question period when I was asking a question

Heritage very clearly and loudly said “What would you know about 
Christians?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we are dealing with racial slurs and now we are dealing

treat all religions equally and respectfully.  I am offended by

comments and apologize to the House.

talking about a pattern we have seen in her behaviour over the 
years about Kamloops cross burnings and about behaviour and cross 
burnings in Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said across the aisle not to forget about their attacks on 
Christians during the campaign, a particularly ugly scene that I 
am sure she is ashamed of.  That spurred the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage to hoot across the aisle: what do I know about 
Christians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I know something because I am a Christian.  I am 
certainly not perfect.  I would be the first to admit it.  It is 
a pattern of this minister and it is shameful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ) </B>moved for leave to introduce 
Bill C-314, an act to provide for the tabling of treaties in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I presented all of the five bills during 
my first intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that Canadian practices in the negotiation, signing 
and ratification of treaties date from another time.  In 1931, 
under the Statute of Westminster, Canada obtained the right and 
power to sign its own treaties.  Unfortunately, parliament did 
not inherit this power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my intent with this bill to change the situation so that 
parliament has the right it should have had since then.

ended with a vote, the result of which was a disappointment to 
us. I am daring to try again. I am convinced that many 
members on both sides of the House will agree that parliament 
must decide the content of a treaty before it is signed. Prior 
to that the public should be consulted through a committee to 
be determined by the House.

organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that genetic engineering of food plants and 
animals is now expanding at an extraordinary rate.  It now 
involves the genetic engineering of the most basic building 
blocks of life.  The long term effects of genetic engineering on 
human health and the global ecosystem are completely unknown. 
Canadian consumers have a right to know whether foods and seeds

for an immediate establishment of long term safety testing of all

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-4, in Clause 10, be amended by replacing line 22 on page 6 
with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“viour for terms that do not exceed five years and that are 
staggered so that not more than four terms will expire in 
any year.” 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-4, 
in Clause 10, be amended by replacing lines 34 and 35 on 
page 6 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“for one term not exceeding five years.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 3 is an amendment to clause 10 
which amends the terms held by the directors of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the legislation exists now, directors are appointed to terms 
of five years.  The motion would ensure that terms are staggered 
in such a way that there would be a turnover of directors to 
bring in new ideas and prevent stagnation at the director level. 
In short, directors would serve staggered terms so we could bring 
in new directors.  The directors would appoint new directors.  We 
would continually bring in new ideas from professionals, 
university professors and many different segments in Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we would state that no more than four terms 
would expire in any year.  That would mean continuity and that 
directors would never be left completely in a void.  They would 
have some institutional memory of the board and would understand 
and have some knowledge of the history of the board.  If we did 
not do that there would be a risk that they would lose that 
institutional memory.  That is the reason for this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the House and the members of the Liberal 
caucus and the government would support that amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak once again to Bill C-4 and to 
speak to Motions Nos. 3 and 4.  I will start by repeating my 
position that the bill has real merit.  If the government sees 
fit to support my amendment in Group No. 3, we may yet have a 
chance as a party to support the bill at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 3 and 4 are a credible effort by the member for 
South Shore to tighten up the bill, at least to some degree. 
Even if he were to achieve what he is suggesting in the motions, 
the bill would still leave a lot to be desired, but at least it 
would be a step in the right direction.  We would be willing to 
support those two motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole bill has been created like a sieve, and I suspect that 
was deliberate on the part of the minister and the government. 
When the minister was before committee he suggested that some of 
the vagueness and loose wording in the bill was put there to 
allow maximum flexibility in the application of the principles of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was admirable, but I think it is incumbent upon us, as an 
opposition to the government and in representing the concerns of 
Canadians, to demand some checks and balances in the bill that 
would protect value for money when we are spending taxpayer 
dollars.  The issue of this particular group around the 
membership of the foundation and the directors of the foundation 
is one of the areas of concern.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refers to reasonable expenses and reasonable 
costs.  To some degree it addresses the issue of remuneration for 
directors.  It specifically leaves out any mention of 
remuneration for the chairman who is appointed by the governor in 
council or by the Prime Minister.  This is reason to be 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we last visited the bill some days ago some members 
presented a number of examples of extravagant or ridiculous use 
of taxpayer dollars in government operations, boards, foundations 
and departments.  Some of those examples were a bit extreme but 
they did point out why we should be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I would use concerns Mr. Ted Weatherill who was a 
government bureaucrat.  He was under the same guidelines of 
reasonable expenses and reasonable remuneration.  He turned in a 
bill to taxpayers for $21,000 in three years for his travel 
expenses.  These things actually happen.  It is not a figment of 
anybody's imagination.  The concern is legitimate when we are 
dealing with this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could fix the bill.  We could make it a bill that we could 
support in the interests of cleaner air and a cleaner 
environment.  However we cannot support it because it is custom 
made for the abuse of tax dollars.  It would not take an awful 
lot to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were last debating the bill the minister said that the 
criteria and the funding agreement would be tabled in due course 
and that if we or other members of the House had a problem with 
it we would have an opportunity to bring it forward and discuss 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite true, but if there is one thing I have learned in 
the seven years I have been here, it is that a member can bring 
things to the House and discuss them until he suffers from 
premature failure of his vocal chords and nothing will happen. 
The fact that we can discuss issues in the House does not mean 
that the concerns are ever addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be much more prudent to fix the bill before we passed 
it and to address our concerns so that we could then support the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this group of motions.  They are well intended and 
move in the right direction, although they fall far short of 
fixing the bill. At least it is an honest effort in the right 
direction.  When it comes time to vote we will be supporting the 
motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the motions in Group No. 2. I spoke last week to 
Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 2 includes Motions Nos. 3 and 4.  I will say 
the Bloc Quebecois will support these two motions.  Despite what 
they say, they concern a foundation that already 
exists in Quebec along the lines of what the federal government 
wants to duplicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that with the attitude it displayed earlier this 
government is not in any way prepared to have an open mind with 
respect to constructive ideas put forward by the opposition, be 
it the Alliance, the Bloc, the Conservatives or the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it last week and I reiterate it today: this government is 
arrogant and self-important.  It suffers from self-importance 
because it thinks it has a monopoly on the truth.  When people 
think they have a monopoly on the truth, that is when they lose 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, instead of totally recreating what is already 
working in the provinces, this government ought to be taking 
steps to give back the money it has taken away.  Do hon. 
members realize where the budget surplus came from?  The 
government took it out of the pockets of ordinary people, people 
earning less than $50,000.  As well, it has cut transfer 
payments to the provinces for health, education and social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures in these areas are provincial.  This government should 
return the money to the provinces, which have good systems 
already, so that they may improve them.  What does it do 
instead?  It duplicates what is already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone duplicates what others have already done it is 
called plagiarism.  It is duplicating at the expense of others, 
in order to gain visibility by putting up a little flag.  That 
is not the reason Canadians and Quebecers elected these people. 
They elected them to administer public funds that 
do not belong to them.  This is money that belongs to all 
Canadians and all Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, with the election the government wanted to pull one 
over on the Canadian Alliance, which was not caught unprepared 
last November.  Let us face facts. This government no longer 
listens to anyone.  It is deaf, dumb and blind.  It will only go 
where it wants to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what Canadians and Quebecers expect of the 
government.  Until further notice, it is Canadians and Quebecers 
who provide the government with the money so that it may 
administer and pass legislation that will improve their 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development is extremely important.  We know how 
this government toots its horn when it provides any funding for 
the environment and sustainable development.  I note that 
is not what it is attempting to do with this bill.  It wants to 
ease its conscience and interfere in the jurisdiction of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the government's approach very offensive.  Under the 
proposed amendments all appointees would not have to leave at 
the end of their terms. They would not all leave at once.  These 
departures would be spread out over a period of four years to 
allow some people to remain on the board of directors so that 
the foundation can continue to function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under Motion No. 4 members of the board of 
directors would be eligible to be reappointed only once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough of appointing one's friends for life.  That is not what 
Canadians want.  They want more transparency, more availability. 
They want the people representing them to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House represent many Quebecers and 
Canadians.  The government thinks that it has a monopoly on the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day they begin to understand they 
should be listening to Canadians and Quebecers, we will no 
longer have to go through what we have been going through in the 
last little while in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just take the example of the young offenders bill.  This 
is a matter of great interest to Quebecers.  It is an area which 
works tremendously well in Quebec.  All Quebecers are opposed to 
the Minister of Justice's bill. 
And, what does this government do?  It turns a deaf ear and plows 
ahead.  That is precisely what the Minister of Natural Resources 
is doing.  He is looking out for no one and he is forging ahead. 
One fine day he will meet up with the train, and 
trains go fast and stop for no one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad the House is once again considering Bill C-4 
at report stage.  A number of amendments were suggested 
subsequent to the work on the bill in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with motions that the Chair has designated as 
Group No. 2, specifically Motions Nos. 3 and 4 moved by the 
member for South Shore, in an effort to provide more restrictions 
in the bill to the terms of office of the directors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with those specific points in just a moment, but I 
wish to make a couple of observations in response to the hon. 
member from the Bloc who has just spoken.  Her criticisms of Bill 
C-4 were not in terms of what the bill is trying to achieve with 
respect to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understood them, they were twofold: first, there had not 
been ample consultation with all other players and stakeholders, 
particularly the provinces and, second, the foundation being 
proposed in some way duplicates that which is already in place in 
some provinces, most especially the province of Quebec.  With the 
greatest of respect, neither of those criticisms is valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this for these reasons.  First, Bill C-4 and all other 
measures included in Government of Canada action plan 2000 and 
identified in the budget of February 2000 with respect to climate 
change flow from over two years of the most comprehensive, open, 
transparent and inclusive consultation there has ever been on an 
environmental and developmental topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the Kyoto conference occurred in 
December 1997.  In a meeting with the Prime Minister not more 
than 48 hours after the conclusion of the Kyoto protocol, the 
provinces insisted that there be a very thorough process of 
consultation.  It would specifically include the provinces, the 
private sector, non-governmental organizations, the scientific 
community, the municipalities, and virtually all Canadians to 
fully scope out what the climate change issue was and what the 
implications of the Kyoto accord would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada agreed with that initiative and in the 
spring 1998 the consultation process began.  It involved at least 
16 different issue tables.  It involved over 400 Canadians from 
every province and territory.  It involved all municipalities 
that wanted to be involved, as well as scientific and 
non-governmental organizations.  It included every dimension of 
Canadian life from coast to coast to coast.  It was open, 
transparent, inclusive and comprehensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea for the sustainable development technology fund flowed 
from that process, which went on for the better part of two 
years.  It cannot be said that there was not ample consultation. 
There was fulsome and very strong consultation which most 
definitely included the Government of Quebec and a whole range of 
non-governmental interest in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed sustainable development technology foundation does 
not duplicate work that is already being undertaken by somebody 
else in some other jurisdiction.  We have been very careful in 
defining the role of the new foundation.  It is filling a gap in 
the innovation chain.  It is not duplicating or overlapping with 
something that is already there.  It is filling a gap that is 
problematic at the present time.  There is common agreement among 
our private sector stakeholders that the gap needs to be filled 
and the foundation is the preferred method of filling that gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have continuity from the very early stages of abstract and 
pure science through all the intermediate stages where that 
science becomes more defined and more applied, to the final end 
of the process where it is commercialized and put to work in the 
economy. 
This new fund and the new foundation will not cause an overlap or 
a duplication with something that somebody else is already doing 
in some other jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it does is that it adds new funding to help us all meet the 
challenge of sustainable development.  All federal, provincial 
and territorial ministers of energy and the environment, all 
those in the private sector that we consulted, the environmental 
organizations and the scientific community, would all agree that 
if there is one thing we need from all sources, federal, 
provincial and territorial with the private sector, is more money 
into the equation to help us find those sustainable development 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not overlapping.  We are not duplicating.  We are acting 
on the basis of ample consultation, bringing another $100 million 
to the equation to help solve the challenges of sustainable 
development for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have an absolute shortage of funding, adding another 
$100 million to the overall pot does not constitute overlap or 
duplication.  It represents a very solid investment toward a 
larger solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically on the points raised by the member for South Shore 
in Motions Nos. 3 and 4, Motion No. 3 is essentially aimed at 
staggering terms of office and Motion No. 4 is aimed at limiting 
the time in office that any particular director can serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I recognize what the hon. gentleman is trying to 
accomplish, I respectfully suggest that the language already in 
Bill C-4 provides flexibility for the ongoing board of directors 
to function in a most appropriate way and that the restrictions 
and the meaning proposed by the member for South Shore would 
really be counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot determine the value of directors in advance by 
arbitrarily saying that they will only have good ideas, that they 
will only serve in a proper fashion for one term and that then 
they will be burned out and we should cast them aside and get 
somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is desirable to have turnover, new blood and new ideas 
brought into the equation, it is better to leave Bill C-4 in the 
form as it presently stands, which provides flexibility in 
dealing with the terms of directors rather than trying to 
precisely describe when a particular director must leave office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Directors who serve well, that bring energy, ideas, vitality and 
enthusiasm to their task, ought to continue, and perhaps 
indefinitely.  They do not run out of ideas because they serve a 
certain number of terms or reach a certain age.  These people may 
want to leave after one term.  They may want to continue for 
three or four.  We need to retain the flexibility to capture 
their maximum vitality rather than try to prescribe and limit in 
advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply do not accept the notion that we necessarily have to 
say in the legislation that they should be turfed out at a 
certain point.  The legislation provides flexibility.  It 
provides for appointment and then the possibility of 
reappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously at the time of reappointment an assessment would be 
made as to whether the person wants to continue and whether in 
the view of the responsible government of the day the person is 
making a valuable contribution that ought to be continued.  It is 
proper to leave it flexible on that basis so that there can be 
rejuvenation from time to time and that those who are making 
valuable contributions can continue for the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the point about staggering, I certainly agree with the 
objective that we do not want all the directors coming and going 
at the same time.  Obviously we would have to reinvent the wheel 
with each new board of directors every time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a reasonable proposition.  My only comment would be that 
the staggering of terms is already possible under Bill C-4 as it 
is currently drafted.  Therefore specifically Motion No. 3 is 
unnecessary because the foundation already has the flexibility 
that is required to stagger the terms.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order arising from question 
period.  In the course of rather heated debate, the member for 
Edmonton North passed a comment on the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism in which she accused her of attacking 
Christians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereupon I responded by saying what would she know about 
Christians, in reference specifically to the very important 
Christian value of forgiveness.  I am sorry that members opposite 
have tried to construe these comments as being something that 
they utterly were not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we appreciate what the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
said but she also uttered the same comments when I was asking a 
question.  It was after three other questions were asked in 
between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am offended too.  I believe the Chamber should respect all 
religions equally.  I am not a Christian. I am a non-Christian. I 
am a Sikh.  I expect the hon. minister to address the issue with 
respect to when she spoke during my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is precisely why I 
came forward and make no mistake about it.  The comment was in 
direct response to the member for Edmonton North who stated that 
the secretary of state was attacking Christians.  I passed the 
comment directly to the member for Edmonton North.  She is 
obviously aware of the context, the context of which was that one 
of the basic tenets of Christianity is forgiveness.  That was the 
context of the comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Obviously we have a disagreement and, as I 
said earlier, I urge all hon. members to be very respectful to 
each other at all times.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is the time to move on.  The people of 
Surrey Central are pleased to have me participate in the report 
stage debate on Motions Nos. 3 and 4 in Group No. 2 concerning 
the establishment of a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has earmarked $100 million as the amount of 
initial funding to be doled out.  The sustainable development 
technology foundation is to operate at arm's length from the 
government, or at least it is supposed to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House want to support Bill C-4.  However 
we want to see some more amendments in the bill.  We had 
suggestions for the Liberals concerning the bill.  Our 
suggestions do not have anything to do with the sustainable 
development aspects of the bill.  The amendments needed do not 
have anything to do with the projects related to greenhouse gas 
reductions and improving air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments have to do with Liberal Party arrogance.  The 
Liberals are proposing to turn the sustainable development 
foundation into a Liberal patronage pork barrel.  That is what we 
are up against.  The Liberals are trying to make it so that the 
chairperson along with a minority number of directors and members 
are appointed by governor in council, which then appoints the 
remaining members to complete the 15 person board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read for the Liberals a simple paragraph from the 
Canadian Alliance policy which is dictated by grassroots members. 
It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a non-partisan civil service, and independent 
judiciary and competent leadership of government agencies, boards 
and commissions are vital in a democracy.  We will therefore 
ensure appointments to these positions are made through an open 
and accountable process based on merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government stop implementing its system of 
disenfranchisement?  The patronage practices of the government 
are virtually fascist by strict political definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could there be this foundation at arm's length from the 
government while the weak Liberal government appoints its board 
directly and indirectly?  The Canadian Alliance will put a stop 
to this sort of thing when we form the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two motions in Group No. 2, Motions Nos. 3 and 4.  I 
will not read the motions, but we would like to support them 
because both of them aim to limit the terms of appointment of the 
chairperson and the board of directors appointed by the governor 
in council and the staggering of appointments to ensure 
continuity on the board.  The amendments may not accomplish 
exactly what the official opposition wants the government to do, 
but it is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments moved by the hon. member for South Shore will 
tighten the bill and limit the number of terms of the board of 
directors.  It is a step in the right direction.  On behalf of my 
constituents and my colleagues I will be willing to support the 
two motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
once again to take part in the debate on Bill C-4, which was of 
course Bill C-46 in the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the objectives of the bill, which 
establishes a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology, are noble. They are very noble indeed. Sustainable 
development is very much a concern among the public. Today, at 
noon, I was watching a television program and the topic happened 
to be the environment. 
People are very concerned about the environment, sustainable 
development and the reduction of greenhouse gases. They are also 
concerned about air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's program also dealt with other environmental issues, but 
we know them. We can identify them because they are a permanent 
concern among the public. The objectives of the foundation 
are noble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, and this should be kept under wrap, I have my pink side, 
with a dash of blue, which pleases my spouse and my children. 
I also have a considerable green side, though.  The environment 
is one of my major concerns.  In the case of the foundation for 
sustainable technology, however, one cannot help but draw a 
parallel with the millennium scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were already policies in place in Quebec and this was an 
area under Quebec jurisdiction.  Still, they doggedly insisted on 
creating a federal level foundation.  The same thing goes for 
this one, the foundation in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is considerable expertise in Quebec, yet in the same 
broadcast today at noon it was said that Quebec has half the 
greenhouse gas emissions most of the others have. 
There is therefore expertise 
in Quebec.  There are technicians.  Technology is being 
developed. As the minister has said, he considers this new 
foundation a kind of fund.  He also said that everyone expressed 
a need for more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the foundation could to all intents and purposes exist 
with its most noble objectives. After the consultation, which 
dealt mainly with the technical aspects of sustainable 
development, everyone was in agreement.  When the time came to 
talk money, however, Quebec wanted the funding to be 
transferred so that it could carry out implementation or 
expansion of the foundation already in place in Quebec, which 
moreover constitutes a fund of some $45 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec had its fair share, it could advance still further in 
the area of technological development and make of itself an 
international showcase of cutting edge technologies, therefore 
stepping up its promotion of technology for sustainable 
development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the group we are currently studying, Group No. 2, there are 
two motions the Bloc Quebecois will support.  If we 
look at the bill, it provides at subclause 10(4): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) A director is eligible to be reappointed for one or more 
terms not exceeding five years each. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all intents and purposes this could go past the time limit 
for senators.  This is another place the Prime Minister and his 
group will appoint a chairperson and members, who will then 
appoint other members.  It is also up to the Prime Minister to 
choose to revoke certain positions.  There may be lifetime 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk of new technologies for the environment. They are 
running the risk that some who are there just about forever will 
lose the spark of the imagination and that the spark of renewal 
may not exist as long as one might like in these technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, in view of the Liberal majority, the government will 
proceed with this bill.  I am convinced of that.  We cannot say 
enough that there is overlap again.  The bill still gives the 
appearance of giving people, friends, contributors, positions 
that may last their lifetime.  We will therefore support the two 
motions in Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not let a motion provided for periodic 
change go unmentioned.  The bill would have done well to provide 
for a change of members on a rotational basis in order to ensure 
continuous renewal. Thus, limiting a term to five years is a good 
thing. If at some point some do not suit the other levels, they 
may be removed.  At that point they will be in the middle or at 
the end of a term, even at the start of it.  Motions provided 
that, in addition, at the end of a term, a person could remain 
another five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, because the foundation will be created and will 
duplicate what the provinces, including Quebec, are doing and 
because we will have to endure that, such an amendment is very 
relevant.  The Bloc Quebecois will support them, but we will 
never lose sight of the fact that we will always oppose the bill 
so long as it cannot be improved throughout.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to explain what Motion No. 8 standing in my 
name is all about with respect to Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a consequential and technical amendment.  The clause was 
amended when the bill was before committee.  The clause allows 
members of the foundation to select an auditor at the annual 
meeting of the members, thereby alleviating the need to hold a 
separate meeting to appoint the auditor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new language of clause 26(1), as amended in committee, is as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first meeting of the members, and in any subsequent fiscal 
year at the annual meeting, the members shall appoint an auditor 
for. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon reviewing the bill and after the committee had finished its 
work, it became apparent that a consequential amendment was 
required in subclause 26(3) to make subclause 26(3) consistent 
with the change made in committee to subclause 26(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly Motion No. 8 now before the House dealing with 
subclause 26(3) is that consequential amendment to make sure 
subclause 26(3) at report stage is consistent with the change 
made during committee hearings to subclause 26(1).  It is not a 
substantive amendment but obviously the two subclauses have to be 
consistent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree 
with the minister's amendment.  It is an amendment that we intend 
to support.  However I would say that it is a bit more 
substantive and important than maybe the minister would like to 
think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem with the legislation is the fact that some 
very important issues and a number of smaller amendments like 
this one have been overlooked in the drafting of the bill. 
Somehow this was overlooked when we were dealing with it at 
clause by clause consideration in committee.  It is a 
housekeeping article but it is a very important housekeeping 
article. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the amendment to clause 26 would effect is the appointment 
of an auditor by the members of the foundation.  Under the 
legislation as it currently reads, if an auditor is not appointed 
at the first meeting of the members in a fiscal year the previous 
auditor continues in that role.  The amendment would change the 
clause so that the auditor would be appointed at an annual 
general meeting in the fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an issue that was discussed in committee.  It was 
suggested that having the auditor appointed at the first meeting 
in a fiscal year could delay the actual appointment of that 
auditor.  With the amendment the auditor is appointed at the 
annual general meeting and would be in place to audit the books 
for the forthcoming year, which is very typical of most 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an amendment that the PC Party supports since it improves 
the accountability of the foundation, something that we have 
tried to do with previous amendments to the bill.  We will be 
supporting the amendment and I congratulate the minister in 
bringing it forward at report stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to Group No. 3 at report stage.  The 
Canadian Alliance supports the minister's amendment.  I share the 
opinion of my colleague from South Shore who just spoke.  It is 
reasonable that the minister would make the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the sixth amendment the minister has made to the bill and 
it has not even passed report stage yet.  It is one more 
indication of how sloppily the bill was drafted.  The wording 
should be right before it is brought before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 3 contains my amendment, the only amendment that the 
Canadian Alliance is suggesting for the bill.  It is an 
amendment, if accepted by the government, that would allow us to 
support the bill because my amendment would allow access to the 
foundation by the Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the issue in committee where we had some discussion. 
The minister suggested that what I was asking was unnecessary 
because the foundation under the bill has a responsibility to 
appoint its own internal auditor to do the auditing of the 
foundation's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His suggestion that it was adequate to provide value for money 
by the foundation was ludicrous because the internal auditor has 
the responsibility spelled out in his job description.  The 
auditor's responsibility is to audit the figures of the 
foundation, to see that the columns of figures add up properly 
and that the figures presented by the foundation reasonably 
reflect the business of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The internal auditor in no way has any authority to look at the 
appointments of the foundation members, the board members or the 
chairman of the foundation, to see if those people chosen by the 
government have the qualifications to sit on the foundation or 
the board of directors.  The internal auditor would have no way 
of passing judgment on whether or not groups of people or 
projects applying for funding under the foundation met the 
criteria for that funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be some check or balance.  The auditor general could 
provide that because we do not want a repeat of what we saw in 
the billion dollar boondoggle of the human resources department 
where taxpayer money was shovelled out to ministers' ridings and 
to friends of the government who did not meet the criteria laid 
out in the bill.  That could happen here again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if a business acquaintance of the minister or the 
Prime Minister, and we have just seen it with the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, applies under this foundation for 
funding for a project and does not meet the criteria laid out in 
the bill?  The minister then suggests to the appointed chairman 
of the board that he would surely love to see this person's 
project qualified.  Suddenly there is a change of heart and the 
project is qualified and away it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fundamentally wrong.  It is unethical and it has happened. 
I have used two example of how it has happened within the last 
couple of years with the government.  There is no guard against 
that same thing happening with this foundation.  That is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to hear the minister defend how that would be 
prevented in the bill.  It is a good initiative and we want to 
support it.  I was sorry to listen to the Bloc Quebecois in 
debate going off on a tangent congratulating the new premier, 
most of his cabinet and all the rest of it, and talking about 
$100 million not being enough money to do what the foundation 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea has merit.  Even the flexibility built into the bill 
allows the government to take $100 million and leverage that many 
times over through the private sector to do some real good 
things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is simply used to reward friends of the Liberal Party 
through misuse of the criteria and guidelines, and to shovel 
taxpayer  money on to those who donate to or support the Liberal 
Party, that is unacceptable.  We cannot accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance are just as concerned about global 
warming and climate change.  We want to do as much about it as we 
can.  We support the idea of developing technologies that have 
the potential to reduce fossil fuel emissions and make the world 
a better place for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have a responsibility to use taxpayer 
dollars in a proper, ethical and legal way.  I cannot help but 
conclude that the bill is deliberately drafted as loosely as 
possible to allow the abuses to continue.  It is such a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members in committee suggested that somehow we were 
straying from our fundamental philosophy of smaller and less 
intrusive government.  When I suggested I would rather see the 
initiative stay in the Department of Natural Resources than be 
hived off to a foundation at arm's length from the government and 
out of reach of the auditor general, the member suggested that 
was somehow a breach of our basic philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see how whether the foundation is within the department 
or at arm's length from it would affect the size of government in 
any way, except to make government bigger and make eight more 
patronage appointments available to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much is wrong with the bill.  The safeguards required against 
the squandering of taxpayer dollars could be put in the bill by 
giving the auditor general access.  I have not yet heard, either 
in committee or from the minister in the number of times he has 
addressed it, why that cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard him defend the bill loudly last Friday when someone 
referred to the foundation as a crown corporation.  He was quite 
adamant that it was not.  Why, then, does he not allow the 
auditor general access to it so he can judge whether taxpayers 
are getting value for their dollars and whether it is achieving 
the wonderful things the minister suggests it can achieve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in the government's own interest to allow that to 
happen.  It could then hold it up as such a shining example of an 
initiative toward cleaner air and the Kyoto commitment.  It 
appears it will be much like everything else the government has 
said about the climate change initiative in the Kyoto accord. The 
government is forever talking about it and essentially doing very 
little about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister referred just minutes ago to his implementation 
plan to meet the commitment under the Kyoto accord.  That too is 
quite ridiculous.  If every objective including this one under 
action plan 2000 was met, it would take us only one-third of the 
way to meeting the government's commitment under the Kyoto 
accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly disappointed that the government has not been more 
responsive to my suggestion.  If it would accept it and allow us 
to go forward we would love to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I will give the floor briefly to the 
member for South Shore under the auspices of a point of order.  I 
will let him make a request and then I will take the matter up 
with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  When I replied to the minister's comments it had slipped 
my mind that we were in Group No. 3 and that the motion of the 
hon. member for Athabasca is included in that grouping as well. 
It was my intent to reply to both motions.  I replied to the 
minister's motion.  I should have waited until the minister and 
the member for Athabasca both had a chance to have their say and 
then I could have raised it and had my say.  I would ask the 
House to allow me a few minutes to sum up the member's statement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly thank my colleagues in the House.  I will try to be 
fairly brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 by the member for Athabasca on the sustainable 
development technology act is extremely relevant, important and 
substantive to this piece of legislation.  The amendment would 
allow the auditor general to review the accounts and financial 
transactions of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the realm of the House, the bounds and confines of 
parliament and what we strive to do as parliamentarians, surely 
that would be second nature to all of us.  We should expect the 
auditor general to be able to review the account of any 
organization, especially one set up with government funds.  The 
amendment would improve the accountability of the foundation and 
it is certainly one the PC Party supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the foundation will be established with 
$100 million of taxpayer money and may at any time be allotted 
more money by the federal government.  I support the amendment so 
that the auditor general may oversee the use of this public money 
and ensure it is used in a way that promotes air quality and 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment was very similar to an amendment I put forward. It 
was discussed at committee and had a lot of to and fro from the 
government side and the opposition side.  Those types of 
amendments are necessary because they are an opportunity for the 
foundation not only to review how the funds are spent but to 
review the projects themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with $100 million of public money and the 
possibility of hundreds of millions more being added to the 
account, it is only fair that the auditor general be involved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise again on behalf of the people of Surrey 
Central to participate in the report stage debate on Group No. 3 
concerning the establishment of a foundation to fund sustainable 
development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 3 includes two motions, Motion No. 8 and Motion No. 9. 
Motion No. 8 is simply a housekeeping motion.  The motion was 
moved by the Minister of Natural Resources to change his own 
bill.  We have seen in the House that many bills tabled by the 
government are poorly worded, poorly drafted and very sloppy. 
Many times they are not clear, concise, comprehensive or 
transparent.  Many times what we see is one or two ideas and then 
a huge paper load of regulations following the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the hon. minister has recognized that his bill is 
sloppy.  He had to amend it six times.  This amendment just deals 
with translation and is of a housekeeping nature, so we will 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would ask ministers when they table bills in the House to 
look at them carefully.  Bills should be properly drafted with 
contents where there is some vision of the government's direction 
on the issues.  We do not want the government to govern the 
country through the back door, through the regulations.  Let it 
govern by the bills which are debated in the House.  The 
regulations are not debated in the House, so I call them 
governance through the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 also deals with the auditor general's staff.  This 
is a new clause moved by my hon. colleague from Athabasca, who is 
the Canadian Alliance chief critic for natural resources.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the hon. member's motion, we are adding two 
clauses.  They are: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accounts and financial transactions of the Foundation shall 
be audited by the Auditor General of Canada at such time as the 
Auditor General considers appropriate, and a report of the audit 
shall be laid before Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a beautiful addition.  The second clause is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General of Canada has, in connection with any audit 
made under subsection (1), all the powers that the Auditor 
General has under the Auditor General Act in connection with the 
examination of the accounts of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very attractive amendments.  I will give a little 
background on the necessity of these amendments moved by the hon. 
member for Athabasca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the foundation provides an annual report each year to 
parliament, the foundation appoints its own auditor and has final 
approval of its reports before they are made public.  While the 
legislation sets out rules as to who is eligible to be auditor, 
the government refuses to allow the Auditor General of Canada 
access to the foundation's books.  That is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the government does not want the Office of the 
Auditor General of Canada involved.  We have seen many scathing 
reports, one after another, criticizing the government very 
badly. The Liberals have had a difficult ride from the outgoing 
auditor general.  His recent report was probably his most 
scathing indictment yet of the government.  Each auditor 
general's report on the mismanagement of the Liberal government 
is worse than the previous one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition wants these issues, the questions of who 
will audit the foundation and how appointments will be made to 
it, to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an initial contribution of $100 million. 
Let us look at the multiplier effect when the private sector is 
involved.  We are talking about a significant contribution of 
taxpayer money.  We will not allow those two concerns to be swept 
under the carpet by the Liberals.  That is why we have moved the 
two amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as I said, is well intended.  We would support the 
bill if this amendment were accepted by the government.  However 
the current bill seems deliberately vague, perhaps to allow 
patronage, nepotism and misspending of taxpayer dollars to creep 
into the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By bringing in the Auditor General of Canada to examine the 
foundation's books, taxpayers would have greater protection 
against unchecked Liberal spending.  I would therefore be very 
pleased to support Motion No. 9 because it attempts to restore 
accountability and transparency to the whole fund.  It would 
protect the interests of Canadians and not just friends of the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before calling for a resumption of 
the debate, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. member for St. 
John's West, Fisheries; the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands, Agriculture; the hon. member for 
Terrebonne—Blainville, Social Housing; the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, Fisheries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the third 
group, Motion No. 8 deals with a technicality. However, Motion 
No. 9, presented by the hon. member for Athabasca, is essential. 
It is truly essential and fundamental in the context of the 
creation of a foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, this government has made a habit of creating 
organizations, foundations and agencies to ensure that the 
auditor general cannot, for all intents and purposes, take a 
close look at these institutions or organizations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all familiar with the work of the auditor general, which 
involves evaluating the objectives, the actions, the money spent 
and even the administrators. In some cases he did evaluate the 
performance of administrators and the appointment process of 
these same administrators since that process often seems to 
have more to do with rewarding an individual than determining 
his or her qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the government is to ensure that the 
auditor general does not have the opportunity to take a close 
look at the foundations as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the auditor general had the opportunity to take an indepth 
look at the results, as they relate to the budgets or the 
objectives—the objectives are always laudable, but sometimes the 
means used to achieve them are not the best ones—he could 
evaluate the means used by the foundation to achieve its 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the auditor general could audit the foundation, it would 
alleviate the main concerns of the Bloc Quebecois regarding the 
establishment of that foundation. There are six such concerns 
and I will mention them briefly. 
The division of jurisdictions is one concern of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  The fact that Quebec already has a fund is another 
concern, as is the fact that there is a concentration of powers 
within the foundation.  The fact that the bill's definitions are 
risky, and even imprecise, is another concern.  The inequality 
between the recommendations of the issues table and the bill, or 
the foundation, also concerns the Bloc Quebecois.  Another 
concern, obviously, is the amounts allotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, any future audit of this foundation would examine the 
various points I have just enumerated, almost certainly 
justifying Bloc Quebecois concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back briefly to the division of jurisdictions. 
It would seem obvious that this is just an underhanded way for 
the federal government to intrude once again in the 
jurisdictions of the provinces and of Quebec.  Unfortunately, 
the bill has a very broad scope, leaving the door open to 
investing in an area of jurisdiction belonging to a province or 
to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an auditor general had an opportunity to audit the entire 
foundation, he could also comment on this aspect of 
jurisdiction, as it relates to objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, we know that problems often arise, that they are 
identified during audits, and that they justify the concerns of 
the opposition and of the Bloc Quebecois.  Why not take 
pre-emptive action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we asked that the auditor general be invited to 
appear before the committee, but this did not happen. 
Imagine how beneficial his presence would have been for the 
members of the committee who basically want the bill to be as 
effective as possible.  The auditor general could have given his 
views before the fact because he would have been able to examine 
the bill and knowledgeably anticipate potential obvious 
problems.  Unfortunately this did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, the bill ensures that the auditor general will never 
be allowed to comment on the foundation.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to that will be that there is an internal auditor.  I 
have been involved in company auditing.  My mandate was to 
balance the books, to see whether money had been spent in the 
right place, if everything balanced, if everything was okay. This 
is fundamental, because without the praiseworthy objectives 
relating to the environment this foundation would not exist. 
Are the financial actions that will be carried out by this 
foundation really in line with its objectives, or do they have 
some other aim in mind, one I shall leave to our imagination? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point on which the auditor general might voice an 
opinion when he audits the foundation is its very pertinence, 
compared to what is in place elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, Quebec already has a fund.  The creation of this 
foundation is surprising, given that Quebec already has its $45 
million Fonds d'action pour le développement durable.  This 
foundation divides its budgetary envelope four ways.  I will 
spare you the list, but I will point out that the first one is 
again subdivided into three areas of concern.  One of these is 
atmospheric issues in connection with sustainable 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating a foundation such as this, the federal 
government ought to simply transfer the funds to provincial 
bodies, including the Quebec foundation, that are already active 
in the area set out by the issue table and possess excellent 
expertise in this area.  This would make it possible for use of 
the funding to be tailored to the financial means and priorities 
of the provinces and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all intents and purposes, this would be one of the auditor's 
mandates if he were able to audit the foundation.  He could say 
that the best way of attaining the foundation's objective would, 
in a number of cases, be to hand the money over to the 
provinces, Quebec included, given their existing expertise and 
the fact that they are in some cases far better equipped in 
terms of human resources and potential technological resources 
for sustainable development.  In Quebec this technology has 
already been showcased internationally in connection with 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general could also offer an opinion on the 
concentration of powers.  The foundation members are nearly all 
appointed by the governor in council. 
The bill provides that the governor in council on the 
recommendation of the minister will appoint seven of the 15 
directors of the foundation.  However, the other eight directors 
will be appointed by the directors who were appointed by the 
governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the chairperson and all the directors may be removed 
for cause by the governor in council.  This type of appointment 
seems to be a twisted way to allow the federal government to 
oversee matters in a field that is the jurisdiction of the 
provinces, or Quebec, and to keep control over a body that is 
not accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the relevance of the work of the auditor general in 
evaluating the reason for the appointments and the ability and 
relevance of some directors who, for all intents and purposes, 
are appointed for life, unless the Prime Minister 
decides to remove some of them whom he may find unsuitable in 
certain instances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it would have been very relevant to have the auditor 
general testify before the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources, so that before the fait accompli he could speak on 
the fact that he was not invited to audit the foundation and the 
fact that there are innumerable problems.  In some instances 
we are totally in the dark.

Bill C-18, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when I concluded on this very issue a week or so ago, I 
was talking about the equalization formula as it applied to 
Alberta a number of years ago and, specifically, the revenues 
that were generated by resources in the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some concern in Atlantic Canada that these are being 
clawed back to the tune of about 80%, which prohibits the growth 
of regional economies when the government is basically taking 
money away from equalization simply because we are making more 
money on our minerals, oil resources and natural gas.  I took 
exception to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concluded my remarks, just to remind the House and the viewing 
public, by stating that from 1957 to 1965 Alberta received 
equalization from Ottawa.  The energy industry there was in its 
early years, just as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the other 
Atlantic provinces, including Newfoundland are today.  The major 
difference was at that time Alberta received 100 cents of every 
royalty dollar.  Ottawa did not clawback the money through other 
programs like equalization which the government is doing today, 
which is patently unfair. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It allowed the Government of Alberta to build on success.  That 
is the only way we will move the poorer provinces along the road 
to economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to outline what equalization is supposed to do.  The 
Constitution Act, 1982, commits the Government of Canada and the 
governments of the provinces to promote equal opportunities and 
economic development and to provide reasonably comparable levels 
of public service across the country with comparable levels of 
taxation.  That is the basic principle behind equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the clawback issue, which is a serious issue in 
terms of restricting the growth of poorer provinces, the 
government has what it calls a capping provision.  It caps the 
benefits to the provinces or caps the growth in equalization 
payments.  The cap was a sore point back in 1982 when the 
government brought it in.  The cap creates a ceiling so that 
equalization payments are restricted from growing faster than the 
national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been a bone of contention going back to 1982.  It 
restricts the growth or the development of provinces when things 
are going well.  It is a reverse attitude in terms of what is 
being attempted with equalization.  The idea is more or less that 
they are poor, that they will stay poor, and that we will not do 
anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an Atlantic Canada perspective, and I can speak with some 
authority to the other provinces as well, it is not any different 
in Saskatchewan or Manitoba, two provinces that are concerned 
about the equalization formula.  I will stick to my notes because 
they are fairly technical and I do not want to be misinterpreted 
in what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imposing a ceiling or a cap on equalization payments interferes 
with the ability of the formula to equalize fiscal capacity to 
the level of the program's standard and further hampers the 
ability of the program to meet its constitutional commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government told us that it would lift the ceiling.  It was 
announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.  The 
Minister of Finance put out a press release on this very subject 
matter in terms of lifting the ceiling on equalization on March 
15, and we appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifting of the ceiling for one year only, which the 
government has done, will provide only a temporary solution to 
the problem.  In order to allow the formula to work effectively 
the ceiling must be eliminated, not just for one year but in 
perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of the Canadian economy combined with the design of 
the current ceiling provision has put the ceiling in danger of 
being breached in the year 2000-01 and in future years.  This 
would result in the federal government withholding future 
equalization transfers to compensate provinces even though these 
revenues would be needed in future years when economic growth may 
not be as strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, it is an ad hoc approach to a problem.  It has to be 
long term thinking on the part of the federal government if 
equalization and the strengthening of the economic position of 
the provinces are to be improved.  It cannot be done on an ad hoc 
basis year by year.  We could legitimately accuse the federal 
government of doing it on an ad hoc basis.  It makes it up as it 
goes along but has no long term plan.  It has the same approach 
on so many other issues.  It is a trademark of the government. It 
works through the problem but does not plan for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was glad to hear the member make reference to the importance of 
equalization payments to provinces such as Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Manitoba, where I come from.  I was glad to hear 
the tone of his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share the same view in a way, that our equalization system is 
probably the single greatest achievement of Canadian federalism. 
It does more to inspire the idea of a strong central government 
that moves forward together, instead of leaving certain pockets 
or certain segments of the country lagging or languishing in a 
lack of economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member limited his remarks to the ceiling that is being 
lifted by mutual agreement.  The removal of the cap is something 
we all welcome.  I have heard from ministers of finance of 
certain provinces who feel they have being misled somewhat. They 
feel that the arrangement being announced now, the removal of the 
cap and the reinstatement of the cap in one year. will be at a 
level lower than they thought they had agreed to on September 11, 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment on that?  Has he heard, as I have, 
from provincial finance ministers that what they thought they had 
agreed to on September 11 and what is being announced today are 
two different things and that there is a dissatisfaction with the 
announced arrangement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is truly what has 
happened.  The formula itself is very complicated.  If there were 
three economists in the same room they would come out with at 
least five or six different points of view because they would 
disagree with themselves after examining the documents.  What 
they sometimes agree to in a meeting with first ministers or 
finance ministers is not always the fact after the case has been 
examined.  That has been obvious in some of these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba, New Brunswick and all others provinces are getting 
less than what they thought they would be getting.  They are 
being penalized for some economic revival within their respective 
provinces and that is wrong.  We have to build on success, not 
discourage success, which is exactly what the formula does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opening remarks a couple of weeks ago I talked about the 
difference between Canada and other nations.  Canada is a very 
generous country.  It is recognized as the best country by the 
United Nations.  We developed that strength or recognition 
because of the generosity we have exhibited or have created over 
the years, a recognition that when areas of the country need help 
we help them.  We have always done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not discount the government in that regard.  Over the 
years the record was not too bad on equalization, but the fact is 
that they were falling far short of the mark as of 1993.  Lester 
Pearson and Pierre Trudeau would be ashamed of what the Liberals 
are doing to the poorer provinces in this fiscal arrangement they 
have designed themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to go back to the old days prior to equalization 
because it has always been sensitive.  This is what we do and it 
has been the right thing to do.  An example of a country gone off 
the rails in terms of a person either doing it himself or it does 
not get done would be the United States.  They have poor states 
by definition, such as Maine, Mississippi and New Hampshire. 
Mississippi has problems with its educational and hospital 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any country could benefit from a system like ours.  We have to 
build on the strengths of that system.  We cannot be 
meanspirited, as the federal government presently is, in terms of 
equalization.  We have to build on our strengths and the 
generosity we have exhibited in Canada for generations. We can 
only build on that.  We do not want to see it destroyed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to say a few words on the equalization bill 
before the House at report stage.  It is actually a very brief 
bill.  It removes the $10 billion cap for one year on 
equalization to the poorer provinces and allows the cap to go up 
by several hundred million dollars.  However, after that one 
year, it restores the original cap of $10 billion and allows 
equalization to increase by the rate of the GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some controversy in this regard.  The understanding of 
some provincial governments was that the cap would be higher than 
it would be in future years but that it would go back to what the 
original cap was.  That is not good enough because of all the 
government cutbacks to transfers to the provinces in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is perhaps one of the shining symbols of success of 
our federation.  In 1980-81 I remember Prime Minister Pierre 
Trudeau deciding to patriate the constitution.  One of the things 
that our party pushed for was to enshrine equalization into the 
constitution of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that we are probably the only country in 
the world that has equalization payments as part of its 
constitution.  Other countries have ways of trying to equalize 
the wealth and potential in their countries through various 
government programs.  Canada is probably the only country that 
has it as a constitutional right for provinces having difficulty 
or that fall on very difficult economic times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very proud when that happened.  I was on the special joint 
committee of the Senate and House of Commons in 1980-81 as the 
NDP constitutional spokesperson.  We talked a lot about the 
question of equalization and the need to have it enshrined in the 
constitution: to share the wealth, to be part of the vision that 
being Canadian meant those provinces that were better off and 
those people who were better off would share some of that wealth 
with the poorer provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Saskatchewan which usually is a recipient province 
in terms of equalization.  There have been times when we have not 
been a recipient province of equalization.  We will be once again 
in the position of not receiving equalization payments in terms 
of the economic potential of our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula is a very complex formula based on the taxing 
potential of each of the provinces.  The reason my province is 
getting closer to not qualifying for equalization is the 
increasing revenues from oil and gas, potash and uranium that are 
coming in to the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a person from Saskatchewan, if what happened a number of 
years ago happens again, I am proud of the fact that we would no 
longer receive equalization.  I am equally proud of the fact that 
we would be participants in terms of the government as a whole in 
providing equalization to other provinces in an attempt to make 
sure that their services are equal to the services in 
Saskatchewan and other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way the equalization formula is calculated is by looking at 
taxation potential.  It is done by eliminating in the formula the 
four Atlantic provinces of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and Alberta, which is the province 
that has the most potential to raise revenues because of the gas 
and oil industry.  The other five provinces are used to average 
out the potential and the revenues they can collect in trying to 
bring the provinces that are not part of that five, excluding 
Alberta, up to a national standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National standards are also extremely important in terms of 
equalizing opportunities for education, health and social 
services.  It is the Canadian way and the Canadian spirit that if 
we live in Newfoundland our opportunities should be as great as 
if we live in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a new trend in the country which disturbs me a bit. 
We have heard about it from Alliance members who have asked in 
debate why we should be paying all this equalization.  We have 
heard complaints from the Alliance that it is a socialistic 
program.  We have also seen as part of that tendency a move in 
the country in the last few years to greater decentralization, a 
lessening of the role of the federal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this in Alberta with Ralph Klein.  We see it now in 
Ontario with Mike Harris.   Of course we see it in spades in 
Quebec with the new premier, Bernard Landry.  The provincial 
Liberal Party in British Columbia is talking about a looser 
federation.  If that were to happen, we would have four large 
provinces talking about more provincial rights and we would have 
a looser federation and a weaker federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a great believer in a diverse country with a lot of 
diversity and flexibility, but I am also a great believer in a 
strong federal government that has the resources and the taxation 
base to make sure we have national standards in education, in 
health and in social programs for each and every single Canadian. 
That is part of the Canadian way of life.  We will be involved in 
a real debate in the next few years about the vision of 
federalism or fiscal federalism as we look at this new movement 
in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia and the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed in Ontario in particular.  Over the sweep of 
our history as a country Ontario has really led the way in terms 
of being a very staunch supporter of a strong central government 
in Ottawa.  I think of the great contributions of Premier Robarts 
and Bill Davis and other Conservative premiers in that province. 
There has been a shift in Ontario in the last three or four years 
with Mike Harris and that shift coincides with what is happening 
in the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be a great debate in the country.  It  will 
unfortunately pit the larger, more populous provinces against the 
smaller, weaker provinces in terms of population and economics. 
That is a debate we will all have to engage in.  I think the 
Alliance Party, along with the Bloc Quebecois, will espouse that 
vision of a looser, more decentralized Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are still majorities in the House on the Liberal 
side, the New Democrat side and in the Conservative Party that 
want to make sure we maintain a very strong federal government to 
work on behalf of each and every Canadian.  That is part of our 
way of life.  That is part of this federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember the great debates over the patriation of the 
constitution and the tremendous fights at that time about making 
sure that equalization was part of our constitution.  We must 
have that balance in our federation.  Too, I remember at the same 
time when the original package came down that there was nothing 
in it reinforcing resource revenues and resource rights for the 
provinces.  The government House leader was in the Ontario 
legislature at the time, I think, but he of course remembers the 
stories, the struggles and the great divisions in the House among 
all political parties about the patriation of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our party we used what leverage we had to make sure the 
provinces did have rights guarantees in terms of resource revenue 
and natural resources, because we also believe that in a 
federation provinces must have strong and protected rights and a 
very strong role to play.  At the same time we need to have a 
strong federal government which also has an extremely important 
role to play in the governing of Canada.  That is part of the 
debate today and it will probably be part of the confederation 
debate for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of 1968 and 1978 and the election of Pierre 
Trudeau.  Ed Broadbent said at the time that probably the most 
fundamental thing Trudeau did in his first term was to initiate a 
department of regional economic expansion, the old DREE 
department, in terms of more aid, assistance and development to 
many of the provinces like Quebec and Atlantic Canada, northern 
Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba.  That is part of fiscal 
federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some of those programs diminish over the last few 
years, so it is important that we talk about equalization, that 
we talk not about rolling back the cap to where it was a year or two 
ago but about increasing the cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I will make is that in 1995 when the federal 
government decided on a lot of cutbacks because of the large 
problem in the debt and deficit area, it cut back radically on 
the transfers to the provinces.  There were radical cuts.  I know 
there are a lot of Liberals across the way that are embarrassed 
by that slash and burn policy of the Minister of Finance and the 
Prime Minister.  I suppose some even hang their heads in shame. 
The government House leader is signalling that his head is in a 
noose on this one and he is probably right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never in our history have we have seen larger cutbacks by a 
federal government.  In the fiscal sense the government across 
the way—and you, Mr. Speaker, were elected as a Liberal in 
northern Ontario—is the most conservative government in Canada's 
history.  I am speaking here of conservative politics in terms of 
the massive cutbacks in government transfers to the provinces in 
education, health and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Crippling cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  They were crippling cutbacks, as my 
friend from Winnipeg says.  They were major cutbacks.  They hurt 
most not in Ontario and Alberta but in New Brunswick, 
Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Manitoba, the poorer provinces of 
the country.  The larger provinces with stronger economies could 
afford to put more of their own money into social services, 
education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House the example of my own province of 
Saskatchewan, where there are slightly over one million people. 
In the early nineties it was staggering with tremendous debt and 
deficit.  Saskatchewan had a deficit that was the largest in the 
country next to that of the province of Newfoundland.  The 
deficit was run up by a premier named Grant Devine who was 
probably more right wing than many of the reformers who are in 
the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the huge debt and deficit, the Romanow government 
decided to backfill every single dollar into the health care 
budget that the federal government had cut out.  That was 
extremely difficult for a province with a huge debt. Fortunately, 
Saskatchewan's economy was not doing too badly.  The farm economy 
was relatively okay compared to now.  However, the government had 
to introduce taxes right across the board.  Income tax went up 
and the sales tax went up by 2%.  A deficit repayment tax was 
implemented in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial officials did that to maintain services.  Despite 
that, right across the board many rural hospitals had to be 
closed because of those tremendous cutbacks that hit 
Saskatchewan. I am sure the same was true in the provinces of New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia where hospitals were also closed 
largely because of federal cutbacks to the EPF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These items are all part of the debate.  The government has done 
a tremendous amount of cutting which has really hurt the cause of 
co-operative federalism in Canada.  It has really hurt the cause 
of having a strong central federal government whose purpose is to 
create equality of conditions.  It has hurt the cause of the 
vision I believed in so strongly when I was in university.  It is 
the vision of a Lester Pearson or a Tommy Douglas or a Bob 
Stanfield, the vision of a co-operative federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may remember the vision of co-operative federalism of 
Douglas, Pearson and Stanfield back in the sixties and seventies. 
That vision was to make sure everybody was brought up rather than 
brought down.  That was the vision of co-operative federalism, 
with sharing, flexibility, strong provinces and a lot of 
diversity.  It was a vision with the uniqueness of Quebec, two 
languages and many cultures, but a strong central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been sliding away from that vision over the last number 
of years.  The bill is another small example of that.  Sure the 
cap goes up this year, but the cap will suddenly be gone and will 
go back to what it was for the years that lie ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is not as strong as it was a few months ago, but it 
will likely rebound starting in the last part of this year.  With 
the fiscal surplus we have today, I appeal to the government to 
spend more of that money on programs like equalization and 
transfers to the provinces for education, health and social 
services so we invest in the human infrastructure of Canada and 
create a country with genuine equality of conditions regardless 
of whether one lives in Fogo Island, Newfoundland, downtown 
Edmonton or Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.  That has to be the vision 
of our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, coming 
from Saint John, New Brunswick, I have watched what the 
government has done to the largest city in the province of New 
Brunswick and it tugs at my heart. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to close St. Joseph's Hospital in Saint John.  It was our 
first hospital, the religious hospital.  We had to close it 
because of the government.  On top of that, schools have had to 
close.  This is a city that is the second largest city in square 
mileage in Canada, 126 square miles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Saint John were leaders of the way.  We built the frigates 
for the military.  Look at us today.  We do not have a shipyard 
open.  The shipyard has a lock and bolt on it.  Look at our VIA 
Rail.  We had rail passenger service until this Liberal 
government came to power.  We no longer have rail passenger 
service, and a brand new train station had been built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this comes from the economy.  It comes down to transfer 
payments for education and social programs.  The hon. member did 
not mention the homeless.  However, I want to tell him that I had 
the homeless and their representatives in to see me just last 
week.  Because of the cutbacks, we have people living on the 
streets.  Never before did we have that, not until this Liberal 
government came into power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say we have to increase the equalization payments.  We have to 
make everyone equal across this country.  I ask the hon. member 
if he agrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly do.  The 
fundamental thing about being a social democrat is that one 
believes in the equality condition, in sharing, in co-operation, 
in fairness and in justice.  One role for the government of the 
country is to be the instrument of public policy that tries to 
equalize conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the homeless situation is one of the consequences of 
the cutbacks in terms of transfers to the provinces in social 
programs, in housing and in education.  I also think of social 
housing, which has had massive cutbacks in the last number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a real shift in the way the government has gone. 
If I can risk being political for a moment, I think the member 
for Saint John might agree with me that the Reform Party has had 
a tremendous impact on the government's agenda, driving it and 
dragging it by the nose, as my friend from Winnipeg said, into a 
very conservative position of slash, burn and cut back and damn 
the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the old Liberal Party of Lester Pearson, Allan 
MacEachen, Walter Gordon, Pierre Trudeau, Jean Marchand and 
Gérard Pelletier?  Where is that old Liberal Party that was 
progressive and innovative and tried to equalize conditions in 
this country?  Now it is terrified of the Reform Party and the 
shadows of the Leader of the Opposition and his predecessor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member.  We talk about 
equalization and CHST payments, particularly in relation to 
health care and post-secondary education.  One of the main 
resources we have in the country is our young people.  As we see 
declining payments to the provinces, we see the costs of 
education becoming a greater burden to students and their 
families.  In the areas where we have failures in the fishery and 
failures in relation to shipyards et cetera, the people cannot 
afford to pay for the education of the students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member think about this lack of investment in 
our young people and where is this country going if we do not 
invest in our most precious resource? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the tragedies of 
the cutbacks in transfers to the provinces for health and 
education is that they have made education less accessible for 
our young people.  The future is our young people.  Power and 
prosperity in the future is based around knowledge and the 
knowledge economy and good education and training.  We are really 
falling back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just today I was talking to somebody in the lobby of the House 
of Commons who said that tuition fees in American universities 
were $40,000 U.S. 
If we keep going down this road we will be heading in that 
direction.  I am sure that you, Mr. Speaker, sitting in the 
chair, would not want to see that happen to our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK254">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of 
this House, the government should ask the Council of 
Ministers of Education in Canada to perform a feasibility 
study on the negotiation of a national standardization of 
education in Canada that may also be applied to recognize 
foreign academic credentials, degrees, diplomas and 
professional standing of new immigrants and Canadians in 
order to enhance the mobility of individuals between 
provinces and territories and contribute to economic, 
social and professional progress in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity for 
the House to debate my private member's Motion No. 232.  My 
motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should ask the 
Council of Ministers of Education in Canada to perform a 
feasibility study on the negotiation of a national 
standardization of education in Canada that may also be applied 
to recognize foreign academic credentials, degrees, diplomas and 
professional standing of new immigrants and Canadians in order to 
enhance the mobility of individuals between provinces and 
territories and contribute to economic, social and professional 
progress in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is one of the most important issues on the minds of 
Canadians, yet is it not covered under the federal jurisdiction 
in Canada.  Due to $22.5 million cuts in social transfer payments 
to the provinces by the Liberal government since 1993, health and 
education have been most critically hurt.  The effect in quality 
of health care services is quite evident, but the effect in 
education services is serious yet latent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we suffer from the effect of brain drain, it is essential 
that we make the best use of brain gain.  Enhancing the mobility 
of people by eliminating educational barriers and recognizing 
credentials of foreign expatriates could do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would not lower Canadian standards in assessing 
foreign credentials, nor does it challenge provincial licensing 
bodies.  Rather it would provide fair and transparent access to 
the professional job market and assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine difficulties faced by new immigrants in settling.  They 
have to deal with new housing, family care, schooling, the 
household, employment, and they have to adjust to a new 
environment.  The problems are further complicated with 
inaccurate expectations by new immigrants, illegal work or 
practices in unregulated professions that cause risks to 
Canadians.  It is also complicated by increased pressure to 
licence or certify people in human resource shortages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been talking about this since I came to Canada and, like 
everyone else, experienced firsthand the red tape and 
bureaucratic nonsense in having my MBA recognized.  There was no 
reason for that hassle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked the ears off of every possible person, including 
the cabinet ministers.  Finally I saw the single sentence in the 
throne speech which addressed only part of the concern.  I have 
raised this issue time and again at public gatherings.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tabled a similar private member's motion, Motion No. 618 in 
the 36th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to make the system accessible and streamlined. 
There is a need for co-ordination of different levels of 
government, regulatory bodies, employers and community 
organizations.  There is a need to reduce or eliminate those 
barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House passes this motion, it would help in many ways. 
Canada would realize the best use of its labour force, 
professional skills, knowledge and ability to support its growing 
economy.  Canadians would be treated more equally and some 
disparities between new and old Canadians would be bridged.  The 
country's shortage of doctors, nurses and software engineers, for 
example, could be alleviated with increased global competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would provide fair and transparent access to the professional 
job market and assessment process.  Rather than allowing new 
immigrants and those migrating from province to province to be 
underemployed for too much of their lives, these people would be 
able to make immediate contributions to the community.  This 
would give Canada a competitive advantage in the global market 
for meeting manpower needs and enhance the quality of human 
resources.  It would help in the settlement and integration of 
new immigrants in our society.  It would help to remove a burden 
from our social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had six people in my constituency office who had Ph.D.s. They 
were underemployed and doing menial jobs.  I remember one person 
in particular who had two doctorate degrees in environmental 
sciences, one from Germany and the other from India.  He had over 
20 years experience as a professor and a scientist.  He had 
written 43 research papers in reputable international journals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He attended promotional seminars by CIC/HRDC in India to lure 
professionals would like to come to Canada.  He applied under the 
independent category.  His degrees fetched him the required 
points and he was granted immigration very quickly.  He resigned 
from his prestigious job as a professor and scientist.  However, 
once he arrived in Canada he felt like he had been duped of his 
degrees which had been recognized by Immigration Canada but were 
not recognized by Canadian departments like HRDC, Agriculture 
Canada, Health Canada or Environment Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was almost going crazy while he pumped gas at a gas station 
to support his family.  Imagine a person with double Ph.D.s 
working in a gas station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other frustrated professionals have also told me similar 
stories.  Some were driving cabs, others were working clerical 
jobs or even janitorial jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about lowering standards.  I am talking about 
common sense.  Why would a degree in science not be recognized 
all over the world, for example an M.Sc. in computer science or 
math?  Two plus two always remains four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wherever possible, arrangements should be made for upgrading 
degrees or letting the prospective immigrants know in advance of 
immigration to Canada of deficiencies in their degrees or courses 
required before their credentials would be accepted.  My motion 
is aimed at pursuing the government on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-ordination with the provinces and territories and 
interprovincial co-ordination and standardization of education is 
also very important.  The development of national standards in 
education is desperately needed, not only to allow easy mobility 
of people but also to co-op up with globalization and competitive 
international job market needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief commissioner of the B.C. human rights commission in a 
letter written to me said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the whole process of recognizing the skills and 
qualifications of new immigrants needs to be reviewed from a 
nation-wide rather than piece-meal perspective and the resultant 
standards have to be consistently applied for the result to make 
a sensible difference. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Council of Professional Engineers, CCPE, 
recommended that the selection criteria for immigration of 
skilled workers be linked to an assessment of the Canadian 
equivalency of the applicant's education and a requirement to 
seek an assessment from an appropriate Canadian regulatory body 
rather than from one of the network of provincial credential 
agencies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial multicultural immigration minister cited the 
Association of Professional Engineers and Geo Scientists of B.C. 
for progressiveness and innovation and said its recognition of 
foreign credentials was another key reason for the profession's 
involvement in a pilot project to help foreign trained engineers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the minister knows the pilot project does not 
lower Canada's standards in assessing foreign credentials to 
challenge provincial licensing bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The membership of the Coalition of Regulatory-Related Agencies, 
CORRA, has said it has no role in managing Canada's supply of 
professionals.  Indeed, CORRA is unanimous in its condemnation of 
measures that exclude individuals on the basis of measures other 
than qualification and ability.  It says ignoring occupation as a 
factor in selecting immigrants may unintentionally shut off the 
flow of information to prospective immigrants regarding Canada's 
standards for professional certification, licensing and practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CORRA recommends that the government recognize the established 
expertise, experience and statutory authority of existing 
regulatory and licensing bodies to evaluate the professional 
qualifications and credentials of all who seek to be admitted 
into Canada's professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CORRA maintains that it wants immigrants with professional 
qualifications to settle successfully in Canada.  As Canada's 
regulatory body, it looks forward to playing an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada maintains 
that Canada has not yet developed a government-wide approach to 
international education.  It says no clear government champion 
has yet emerged to move the issue forward.  That is a very 
important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the Clinton administration issued a 
memorandum in support of an international educational strategy to 
attract more international students by addressing barriers to 
entry such as visa policies, procedures and regulations.  Clearly 
our government should ensure that Canada is not left behind and 
does not suffer from advances made by the U.S. in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Council of Professional Engineers, commonly called 
CCPE, is looking for ways to streamline existing provincial and 
national credential assessment processes for foreign applicants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the increasing mobility of the labour force and 
the need to make educational qualifications portable across 
provincial and international borders are factors contributing to 
a widespread concern about the procedures for assessing 
educational and occupational credentials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that provincial governments have jurisdiction over 
education.  Post-secondary institutions are autonomous with 
respect to admissions criteria.  Provinces also establish the 
regulations of some professional trades.  Provincial institutions 
have the power to determine licensing and certification 
requirements, grant recognition of credentials, and set standards 
and qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain national associations have certification requirements as 
well.  However the point is that these bodies follow separate 
procedures for assessing credentials in separate provinces.  In 
Canada there is no central or national agency responsible for 
credential assessment.  The portability and recognition of skills 
and credentials are issues being addressed on a global basis. The 
governments of European states are already introducing mechanisms 
to make it easier for professionals to move from one country to 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government should take this work seriously and 
assume leadership in this important area.  It should keep up with 
the rest of the world so that we are not left behind.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This starting point includes the input of all concerned.  It 
asks the Council of Ministers of Education in Canada, as my 
motion states, to perform a feasibility study on the negotiation 
of a national standardization of education in Canada that may 
also be applied to foreign academic credentials.

<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way is raising real concerns relating 
to the recognition of new immigrants credentials and feels 
their mobility within the Canadian labour market needs to be 
enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government shares those concerns and I must assure the hon. 
member that we are taking the matter very seriously.  I am 
pleased, therefore, to have this opportunity to bring the hon. 
member up to speed on what we have done so far to remedy this 
sort of problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that the government clearly accepts the 
importance of facilitating the labour mobility of all Canadians 
in general and of easing the integration of new immigrants into 
Canada's labour market in particular.  I remind the House of the 
words of the throne speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government—will work in co-operation with the provinces and 
territories to secure better recognition of the foreign 
credentials of new Canadians and their more rapid integration 
into society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note the words of the Prime Minister in his response to 
the Speech from the Throne.  He urged provincial governments to 
work on their policies with respect to the recognition of foreign 
credentials of new Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that in my home province of Quebec there is 
a component of the immigration department with the sole 
responsibility of assessing the credentials of new immigrants to 
Quebec and to Canada in order to determine Canadian 
equivalencies.  This service is well known and sets an example 
for other similar departments across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has been involved for some time in 
improving labour mobility in Canada.  The goal of these efforts 
has been to ensure that any professional qualifications accepted 
in one province or territory will be accepted everywhere else. 
We want a labour market in which all Canadians, including new 
Canadians, can work and contribute to the development of 
Canadian society in the province or territory where they 
have chosen to live and work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member opposite that the government fully 
agrees that we must create new opportunities and increase the 
mobility of Canadians who have professional qualifications and 
diplomas, including credentials, so that they can travel and 
work freely anywhere in Canada. The fact is that we are already 
working hard to achieve these important objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development and her officials, 
as well as those of other relevant federal ministries, have been 
working for some time with their provincial and territorial 
counterparts and with professional regulatory bodies.  Their goal 
is to ensure that any Canadian qualified to work in an occupation 
in one province or territory will have access to employment 
opportunities in any other Canadian province or territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to allow any Canadian, including new Canadians who 
have skills and certification, to move and have their 
qualifications accepted throughout the country.  I say to the 
House that the government has already gone beyond studying the 
matter as the motion proposes.  We are already hard at work on 
moving ahead.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A major part of that work is done under the internal trade 
agreement among federal, provincial and territorial 
governments to remove barriers to interprovincial trade and 
ensure the free movement of goods, services, manpower and 
capital in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 7 of that agreement concerns manpower mobility. 
It deals with the fact that the professional credentials of many 
Canadians, particularly those whose profession or trade is 
regulated, are not recognized in the other provinces or 
territories because professional regulations vary from one 
province or territory to the next, and because it is sometimes 
difficult for an individual to have his or her qualifications 
recognized and to move from one province to another. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under chapter 7 all parties to the agreement on internal trade, 
that is all provincial and territorial governments along with the 
federal government, are committed to working with regulatory 
bodies to eliminate these kinds of barriers to interprovincial 
mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have the agreement in place we are making progress 
in using it to eliminate jurisdictional barriers to labour 
mobility within Canada.  In fact, Canada's social union framework 
agreement set a deadline of July 1, 2001, for parties to be in 
compliance with the labour provisions of the agreement on 
internal trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are co-operating with the provinces and territories through 
the forum of labour market ministers to ensure that the 
provisions included in Chapter 7 are implemented quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member opposite that the government 
understands the legitimate concerns that he has raised. In fact 
the government is already working hard to appease these 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also provides that the government should ask the 
Council of Ministers of Education to perform a feasibility study 
on the negotiation of a national standardization of education in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this part of the motion I simply remind the House that under 
our constitution education is a provincial responsibility.  In my 
opinion it is unlikely that a federally initiated study on 
national standards of education, as the motion proposes, would be 
welcomed by the provinces or territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, while it is true that the Council of Ministers of 
Education has been formed to bring a co-ordinated national 
perspective to educational issues, it is equally true that the 
federal government holds no sway over that body.  The council is 
made up of provincial and territorial representatives and has a 
secretariat in Toronto. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is not officially part of that 
organization and cannot run its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the government is already doing everything it can to 
deal with the concerns raised by the hon. member, and since I do 
not see the need for such a motion I cannot support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is often said that what is clearly thought out is 
clearly expressed.  I will say clearly that the Bloc Quebecois 
opposes the motion by the member for Surrey—Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion concerns jurisdiction that, as the member for Laval 
West mentioned, is strictly provincial.  It is of no concern to 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact of discussing in this House 
an area that is not a matter of federal jurisdiction would 
usually lead to the dismissal of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather odd to see a party such as the Canadian Alliance, 
which claims to advocate decentralization, especially when it is 
in Quebec and is campaigning there or presenting its 
politics, come here and present such a motion before the House. 
This goes to show that unfortunately what is said is not 
always honoured.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand very well that the motion is not intended to give 
power as such to the government, but at the same time the 
wording of it implies an intent to give the federal government a 
role in an area that is absolutely not in its jurisdiction, 
which all governments of Quebec, regardless of their colour, 
political opinion or tendency, sovereignist or federalist, have 
defended tooth and nail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the government of Quebec has always 
objected to the Council of Ministers of Education contributing 
in any way at all to unifying or standardizing education in 
Canada.  This has been a constant for years, indeed decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position is part of the Quebec government's perception of 
the Council of Ministers of Education in Canada, as 
simply a consultative body and nothing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of example, the government of Quebec did not take part in 
the consortium project of the Council of Ministers of Education 
intended to establish a common framework for the development of 
school curriculum in science.  Likewise, it does not take part 
in the council's consortium on expectations of post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the member for Surrey—Centre has a number of 
aspects to it.  It deals with the mobility of students linked to 
recognition of professional titles, the qualifications of new 
immigrants and Canadian citizens and of the worth of diplomas, if we can put 
it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is necessary to point out that the recognition of 
academic credentials and of the requirements for obtaining them 
comes under the authority not of Quebec's department of 
education but of the Office des professions et des ordres 
professionnels.  Members will therefore agree that this makes 
the issue rather difficult to examine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for student mobility, the government of Quebec is more than 
favourable to this principle.  Indeed it has made a substantial 
effort to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in 1995 Quebec's department of education reached 
an agreement with its Canadian colleagues with respect to a 
pan-Canadian protocol on the transferability of university 
credits. 
As members know, the purpose of this initiative was to encourage 
the recognition by post-secondary educational institutions of 
first and second year university courses taken in other 
institutions in Canada.  This also includes the second year of 
pre-university college studies in Quebec, also known as CEGEP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois therefore finds it impossible to support the 
motion moved by the member for Surrey Central, essentially for 
the reasons having to do with federal interference in one of the 
key areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, in my view and that of the Bloc Quebecois, it is 
exceedingly regrettable that the member for Surrey Central is 
giving such strong thought to introducing pan-Canadian standards 
in this area of jurisdiction which in our opinion should 
reflect the reality of the various provinces, including the 
distinctive nature of the Quebec people.

Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on such a very 
important subject.  I commend the member for Surrey Central for 
bringing the matter to the attention of parliament and for 
proposing a constructive solution to a longstanding problem that 
has been festering in communities right across the country for 
many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue about fundamental rights and liberties and 
about how we view our immigration and refugee policies.  I think 
the motion has been put forward in that context.  It is not about 
jurisdiction or accumulating more power in terms of the federal 
government. It is a positive solution for co-ordinating efforts 
around this matter and ensuring a measure of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem that all of us have had to deal with time and 
again in our respective constituencies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who among us has not experienced having to come face to face 
with an individual who is trained in a particular profession such 
as the medical profession, has a commitment to serve people in a 
particular area and has been denied totally the opportunity to 
practise, to give of one's talents in that area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey Central is not exaggerating when he talks 
about individuals who are trained as doctors, nurses or engineers 
ending up having to eke out a living by driving a taxi or 
delivering pizza.  That problem has been identified by all of us 
through our personal experiences.  It is a problem that has been 
identified by reputable organizations that work in the field of 
immigration and refugee policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the Caledon Institute May 2000 
newsletter entitled “The new immigration act: more questions 
than answers”.  The institute makes some very important 
observations.  The first one states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of problems arising from short-sighted 
immigration policies.  One of the most frustrating for many 
skilled immigrants now living in this country is the disconnect 
between the Canada presented to them while still overseas and the 
reality they face upon arrival.  In trying to attract immigrants, 
Canada actively seeks people with higher education and who are 
qualified to practise particular trades and professions.  Once 
these immigrants arrive, however, many discover that the very 
degrees and training that helped them qualify for immigration to 
Canada are nearly worthless in the labour market here.  Doctors 
end up driving taxis, engineers delivering pizzas. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very real problem that we deal with on a regular 
basis, and it is at the heart of the motion.  It is about how we, 
as a country that has a tradition of welcoming people from around 
the world and encouraging people to settle here justify policies 
and practices that exclude people from practising their chosen 
career and engaging in a profession for which they have deep 
commitment and actual training and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us offers a way to co-ordinate efforts 
nationally to ensure that we address that problem.  It is not 
about denying or not recognizing the fact that provinces have 
jurisdiction in terms of setting credentials and governing 
professions.  It is about trying to pool our resources, our 
knowledge and expertise, and coming to grips with a very 
significant problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has time and time again said it has done 
all it can do.  It has said it is primarily a provincial 
responsibility.  It is not that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The call today is for the federal government to take up the 
challenge and to offer some leadership on this front.  A crying 
need has been identified by provincial governments to participate 
in such a process.  Coming from the province of Manitoba where 
the problem is very much recognized, attempts have been made to 
review the whole system of recognition of foreign credentials. We 
would very much appreciate participating on a more collaborative 
basis with other provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we leave it as the government would have it with the 
provincial governments and offering very little federal 
leadership, we would not only do a great disservice to our proud 
tradition in terms of immigration and refugee policies, but we as 
a country would fail to address some critical shortages in many 
professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot leave the debate without referencing the very 
significant shortages that exist now and are being projected for 
the future in terms of doctors and nurses.  It would be remiss of 
us if we did not recognize the need to pool together our 
resources and our efforts to deal with that shortage.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make any sense for us to operate as 13 separate 
entities raiding one another to acquire the necessary 
professions.  It does not do anyone a service.  It would make 
more sense if we collaborated and found one way to deal with the 
shortage that would include recognition of credentials acquired 
in other countries around which there seem to be many barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not do that we will not only continue a shortage in the 
health care field, which will have dire consequences for 
Canadians, but we will also fail to be competitive 
internationally in terms of immigration.  As it is, we are 
already losing out in terms of a very competitive situation 
around the world for immigrants.  We are not able to compete 
because we have policies like the one we are dealing with today 
which sends a signal to some countries that their citizens are 
not welcome and that their dreams and aspirations will not be 
attainable in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to be competitive in terms of seeking and encouraging 
immigrants and refugees to come to the country, we have to do our 
part.  One of the ways we can do that is by reviewing how we 
handle recognition of foreign credentials.  Is there a bias in 
our system?  Do we apply a double standard?  Is there a failure 
to recognize that sometimes through additional training and 
education we can actually find a way for people to practise in 
their chosen profession? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not done a complete job.  The suggestion today is a good 
one.  Other countries have taken action and the member for Surrey 
Central has referenced activities in Europe.  For the record, we 
met recently with a delegation from Denmark.  That country has 
put in place a new institution for evaluation of foreign 
educational qualifications.  That is a positive step because it 
recognized a problem and did something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do the same in our country.  It is not good enough to 
say that we cannot because it is provincial jurisdiction.  We 
have to avoid getting into the sort of jurisdictional dispute 
over something as fundamental as ensuring that the country 
continues to be a welcoming place for people from all over the 
world.  That means we have to work very hard at improving 
recognition of foreign credentials.  There is no other 
alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we also have to do other things.  We are addressing some 
of these issues in the debate on Bill C-11 pertaining to 
immigration and refugee policies.  We have to look at the whole 
issue of family reunification because we can be sure that if 
individuals come to our country and cannot work in their chosen 
profession immediately, it does not help the matter if they 
cannot even have family around them or participate fully in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other solutions to the problem.  The contribution 
today is an important one and we should take it seriously.  I 
offer my support in that regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
too support the motion put forth by the member for Surrey 
Central.  The Bloc spokesperson expressed the concern that we 
were intruding into provincial jurisdiction.  We all know that 
education is a provincial responsibility.  That does not mean the 
federal government should not have a major concern about what is 
happening in the country.  The provinces know that very well 
because, after all, the federal government funds a tremendous 
amount of educational costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say we should intrude and interfere.  The 
resolution is not saying that we should intrude and interfere. 
The resolution is asking the House to suggest to the Council of 
Canadian Ministers of Education that it initiate the feasibility 
study into standardization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress standardization for the right reasons, so that within 
the country we have free movement and recognition of the 
certificates or degrees individuals hold.  Years ago when we 
graduated from university we could pick any job at all within our 
own province. 
Then it got to the point where we moved to a neighbouring 
province.  Now not only are we moving throughout the country, we 
are moving around the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really inhibits this movement of educated people is the 
fact that many of these certificates or degrees we hold are 
questioned as we move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  It is 
bad enough when we move to another continent or another country, 
but when we move to a neighbouring province and our credentials 
are questioned, then there are some real concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Council of Ministers of Education would be an excellent 
agency to have studying the feasibility of standardization, not 
only within the country but also as it relates to the standards 
of other educational institutions, universities, et cetera, 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of that association for a four year period when I 
was Minister of Education in Newfoundland.  I had the opportunity 
not only to attend all their meetings but to represent the 
association and the country at two world conferences, one in 
Geneva, the UNESCO conference, where we discussed Canada's 
educational programs in front of nations from all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also represented the agency and the country at the meeting of 
the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization, of which 
Canada is an honorary member.  This association has tentacles all 
over the world.  The secretariat of that association is top-notch. 
The association is well aware of the standards of universities 
throughout the world.  If, and I said if, there are universities 
turning out people who are not up to acceptable Canadian 
standards it is known beforehand.  We should not have to wait 
months, or years in some cases, for clarification as to whether 
an MBA or Ph.D. or BA is acceptable and equivalent to what we 
would get in any of our Canadian universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association has the power and the professionalism to be able 
to recommend a general standardization policy, which would 
certainly expedite, if not solve, some of the problems we face 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no need for a student coming out of Memorial 
University in Newfoundland to be questioned in British Columbia 
or vice versa.  There is absolutely no need for a student coming 
out of McGill to be questioned by some other university.  We 
should be well aware of the standards.  In most cases that is not 
a problem.  There is a fair amount of recognition of credits. 
However, we still have problems within the country.  Some years 
ago it was a major problem.  In my own case, I attended a couple 
of universities and had some trouble getting credits recognized 
from one to the other.  It takes some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who come into the country are facing a severe 
disadvantage.  Professional people come to Canada, many of whom 
we seek out, many of whom we beg to come in, especially when we 
have shortages.  I am thinking in particular of the medical 
field, of doctors, nurses and other professional people, where 
there is a major shortage.  We beg them to come here and when 
they do we complicate their lives by saying we first have to 
check their credentials.  It takes weeks and months and sometimes 
even longer to get clarification and acceptance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been personally involved in a few cases where the 
professionals involved were completely and utterly frustrated. 
These people come to this new country which is supposed to be one 
that opens its arms and welcomes people from all over the world 
and treats them royally.  In most cases we do and we are proud of 
that, but we also have a habit of over-complicating things, and 
this is certainly one area where we do that.  Doctors have come 
to Canada, and to our province in particular, and have waited for 
months to get acceptance of their credentials.

professionals coming here and unfortunate for the people in the 
areas who are waiting for these professionals, especially medical 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also unfortunate because, as I think the member from the 
NDP said, it gives the country a bad name in the sense of not 
being accommodating to professionals coming here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have absolutely no problem in supporting the suggestion, which 
is all it is, that the House ask the Council of Ministers of 
Education to look at doing a feasibility study into the 
standardization of education, not only as it applies to the 
movement from province to province but as it applies to 
professional people who come into the country.  That is all the 
motion does.  It is an extremely good motion.  It is a timely 
motion.  Our party certainly supports it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will leave some time for my 
colleague from Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by commending my colleague because, as other 
members have mentioned, this is a very important issue.  Those 
who come to this country, whether they have been here for some 
time or are new to this country, are burdened with pressures in 
regard to what they thought they could do here and the reality of 
what they are faced with when it comes to dealing with this issue 
of credentials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there are real consequences for people's lives. 
They have hopes and dreams that are dashed because of the result 
of false promises in regard to facing the immigration system 
prior to making plans to come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the issue very quickly.  Like the Bloc 
mentioned earlier, I too am very committed to the issue of 
respecting provincial jurisdiction.  I have been speaking about 
it in the House since I came here, but I also believe there are 
times when we have to bind together to some extent to deal with 
very real problems that the provinces in their jurisdictional 
roles cannot deal with on a larger scale.  This is definitely one 
of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think it is so important to do what the member for 
Surrey Central has suggested, to go ahead with a feasibility 
study.  It does not necessarily encroach on any provincial 
jurisdiction.  It puts all the facts on the table about how we 
could solve the problems and give people the credentials they 
deserve when they come to the country so they could become 
productive in society, which I think is in the best interests of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with members just a couple of key examples of 
people in my riding who we dealt with over the course of the last 
number of years.  One example in particular that comes to mind is 
the Aziz couple from Egypt.  He is a civil engineer and she is a 
medical doctor.  They had no problem obtaining the right to 
immigrate to Canada but when they arrived they found out the hard 
way that they could not get jobs.  He was working as a security 
guard and she was working in a day care.  They were very 
discouraged.  They had been informed before they received their 
permanent visas that they would be able to find work here in 
Canada.  It was such a waste of talent.  These were two people 
who could have lived up to their potential in what they were 
trained to do but unfortunately had to take substandard jobs. 
Some of my colleagues have identified similar situations.  We 
need to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few key things we need to focus on in engaging in 
this debate:  improved response times for licence or 
certification applications from individuals educated abroad; 
better pre-immigration information systems; more transparent and 
accessible admissions information and processes; and methods of 
evaluation for individuals educated abroad that are fair, 
appropriate and equivalent to those required of applicants 
educated in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another case we need to talk about with respect to the 
issue of credentials.  It is simply the way we can streamline the 
immigration system.  This is definitely something that we can 
raise in this debate 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that it gives us a chance not only to talk 
about standardizing the education and credential system in a way 
that is positive for all Canadians, but also how we can 
streamline the immigration process so that people coming to the 
country can get the visas they are hoping to get in a shorter 
period of time, that they can be processed in a way that is 
efficient, and that they are not left waiting for years upon 
years with nothing to do because they are not getting the proper 
documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was helping two other people in my riding, a couple from South 
Africa.  Their names were Charl and Johanna du Toit.  Charl was a 
computer expert who got a work permit to work for Saddle Systems, 
a computer company in my riding.  They applied for landed status

</I></B></P><P align=left>They initiated the application in the spring of 1997.  By April 
1998 they still did not have their papers.  The big problem was 
that Johanna was not allowed to work.  It was driving her spouse 
crazy and they almost feared that she would have to go back to 
South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of evaluating the credentials of foreign people 
coming to Canada with whatever degrees they may have not only 
causes stress when they have to deal with the waiting process, 
but in my experience I have seen that at times it also causes 
disunity in families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have also been cases of brothers, sisters and other family 
members waiting for their relatives who have already been 
accredited and come here to find meaningful work.  Because of the 
problems they have once they come here, their family members are 
left lingering in their own countries wondering when they will 
get permission.  They are left on waiting lists here for long 
periods before they can become meaningful parts of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave one key point in the minds of all my colleagues.  I 
know members from other parties have commended the member for 
Surrey Central on his initiative.  It is important that we do 
something in this place to initiate a process so we can evaluate 
the credentials, foreign degrees, or whatever they might be, so 
that people can become productive parts of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do a study to enhance that idea and push it forward, I 
think all Canadians would be better for it.  New Canadians coming 
to the country would feel especially welcome.  This is something 
that all members of the House would like to see happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is an important issue.  It has been one of the top 
issues in national polls for quite some time.  It is a 
non-partisan issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately in Canada we allow brain drain, but when it comes 
to brain gain we are weak.  We do not take advantage of talent 
and human resources.  We do not let our human resources be 
productive the way they can be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact I will go a step further.  When new immigrants arrive 
here, their education and credentials are not recognized.  It 
becomes torture for most immigrants to be underproductive or 
underemployed in their lives.  It is a punishment for them to 
come to this country and remain underemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the whole situation, it is a 911 call to address 
the issue.  The House has the responsibility to address this 
issue even though some members mentioned that it is a provincial 
issue.  We are not stepping on any provincial toes on the issue. 
I would not mind if, in due course, we made some constitutional 
changes to address this serious issue so that we could make 
better use of our human resources and develop our human capital. 
We may have to make some constitutional changes because of a 
changing world, changes in globalization and in the international 
development of standards, particularly in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have to do that one day, but today I am not stepping on 
any toes.  I am simply asking the Council of Ministers of 
Education, Canada to conduct a feasibility study for negotiating 
a national standardization of education and to recognize foreign 
degrees.  We are not talking about lowering standards or about 
giving up anything.  We are talking raising the standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The developed countries of the world are talking about 
international standards, whereas we do not even have national 
standards in education.  The government has a confrontational 
strategy with the provinces, which is why we have the 
interprovincial trade barriers.  This is the time to move 
forward.  It is the time to have national standards.  It is the 
time to eliminate those barriers which restrict our progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to many people on this issue.  The intelligentsia, 
the think tanks, the regulatory bodies, the professional 
non-government organizations and academia all support the motion. 
The human rights commissioners even say that we should have 
national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote one of my friends who said “I am a proud Canadian, 
but it hurts me the most when my qualifications have different 
values or recognition in different provinces or different parts 
of the country.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In sharing the responsibility dispute, we are losing the 
opportunity to make the best use of our human resources.  I would 
urge all members of the House to help streamline and co-ordinate 
education and recognize degrees and credentials.  In that spirit, 
I will ask the hon. members to give unanimous consent to make 
this motion votable.

I have to say how much I appreciate being allowed to speak in the 
House today, because the problem of social housing is especially 
important to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in the red book written for last November's election 
campaign the Liberal Party promised Canadian taxpayers the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new Liberal government will work with our provincial partners 
to create the Affordable Rental Program (ARP), a cost-shared 
capital grants program to help stimulate the creation of more 
affordable rental housing, both private and non-profit. Under 
this initiative, we expect to see the construction of 60,000 to 
120,000 new rental units over four years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government provided for an investment of 
$680 million in this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By including the notion of affordable housing rather than 
social housing the government is hinting at the worst case 
scenarios.  We suspect the government of wanting primarily to 
finance private companies so they would build new housing not 
reserved for people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the government's intentions are laudable, but 
its actions dubious.  Social housing has been completely ignored 
since 1994. 
This is one of the main reasons for the disastrous state of 
social housing right now. Because it is not interested in the 
representations made by citizens, organizations and associations 
helping those who need adequate housing, the Liberal government 
is contributing to the rising poverty rate and to the 
helplessness of couples and single people for whom adequate 
housing is a real financial burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister realizes that the proportion of tenant 
households that spend at least half their income on rent has 
increased by 43% in Canada. There are currently 833,000 people 
in that group. In Quebec the number has increased by 41% to 
reach 274,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study was done by FRAPRU in preparation for the World March 
of Women. That study showed that poverty is a tragic social 
problem that is increasingly affecting women. 
In Quebec over one-quarter of tenant households in which a 
woman is the main wage earner spend more than half of their 
income on rent. It is extremely difficult for them to balance 
their budget, particularly if these women have young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 27, I asked the minister if he was going to change 
the commitments made during the election campaign to ensure 
that the federal government really does its share in the area of 
social housing, as it is being asked by women's groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the minister did not answer my question. Second, his 
reply was ambiguous. The minister talks about affordable 
housing, rental housing and housing for the needy, but I wonder 
if he knows what social housing is all about. I would appreciate 
an answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, helps address the housing needs of all Canadians, 
including women.  Let me highlight some of those initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, the Government of Canada currently spends 
approximately $1.9 billion annually to address the housing needs 
of low income Canadians.  This includes ongoing support for some 
640,000 lower income households that receive assistance to reduce 
their housing costs or improve their housing conditions.  Many of 
the residents of this housing are women led in lone parent 
families and older women.  As well, this funding is used to 
provide housing on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1999, the Government of Canada announced $753 
million for its strategy to address homelessness.  As part of the 
strategy, CMHC will spend an additional $268 million on programs 
designed to repair, improve and expand the supply of housing for 
low income people, including those at risk of homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, an additional $43 million was allocated to the shelter 
enhancement program which provides emergency shelter for women 
and children and youth who are victims of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal budget, a number of new housing measures 
were announced by the government.  Affordable housing is an 
eligible investment under the $2.05 billion municipal 
infrastructure program, and the GST rebate was introduced for 
newly constructed programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues.  I thank the member for her 
question and would like to reaffirm to her that the Government of 
Canada continues to work in the best interests of all Canadians 
to ensure affordable housing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on March 2 I questioned the 
government's ability to provide agriculture solutions for 
Canadian farmers, and that question remains unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we learned that the government had no solution for 
short term farm aid when it refused to vote for additional 
funding.  Over the years we have seen a lack of coherent 
agriculture policy, which has culminated in the AIDA program, a 
program that is complicated.  It has taken accountants and AIDA 
employees many hours to put the program together and we still 
have a lack of ability to deal with the program and to understand 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA is a program that has been slow.  People have waited up to 
18 months for their payment.  It is a program that has been 
inefficient.  I had an accountant tell me that he thought the 
government was probably throwing the applications down a set of 
stairs and picking one or two out of the pile.  That was as much 
sense as he could make out of the government's response to the 
applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA has also been bureaucratic to the nth degree:  new 
employees, revisiting files, combining files without consultation 
with producers, and demanding clawbacks from farmers up to 18 
months later.  AIDA has not been a long term solution for farm 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned that the government is not ready to deal 
with or provide a solution to another problem, and that is the 
threat of foot and mouth disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has grave concerns about the government's 
ability to react. This is a viral disease that spreads rapidly 
and is highly contagious.  It is a viral disease.  We know it can 
survive and can be transported on clothing.  It is deadly to the 
cattle industry wherever it has shown up.  We must prevent the 
disease from coming to Canada.  I would like to suggest some ways 
of doing that and suggest some things on which the government 
could improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the government immediately initiate an 
education program.  Travellers who are coming to and from Canada 
must have information about the disease.  The Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency and its employees need to have information on 
the disease.  People who are working at airports need to 
understand the importance of dealing with it. The general public 
are calling us constantly and they also need to be educated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and ranchers also need to be educated.  They need to 
understand that they can be part of the solution by being careful 
as to who has access to their places and to their herds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Texas agriculture commissioner, Jim Hightower, said 
at one time that “there ain't nothing in the middle of the road 
but yellow stripes and dead armadillos”.  The government needs 
to get going.  It cannot sit in the middle of the road on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the inspection issue.  Does the government have 
enough staff and field personnel in both the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency and the customs agency to deal with the 
problem?  The government must increase the number of personnel if 
they are needed.  Do we have enough sniffer dogs?  When we talk 
to field people, they say no.  We saw a news report this 
afternoon with some vets who have been in Britain and they also 
say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of ensuring that the disease is stamped out is far less 
than dealing with it once it gets here.  Is the government ready 
to act effectively?  It is important that it begin to move on 
this.  It cannot blame the opposition.  It needs to make the 
right responses.  If it makes inadequate or wrong decisions on 
this matter, it will cost billions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government if it has a solution for young people 
trying to do the right thing.  A number of school groups are 
cancelling their trips and are facing a loss of their deposits. 
I call on the government to treat these young people properly. 
What will it do to provide these young people with a solution to 
this problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government prepared to provide a solution for families 
and for young people with regard to the foot and mouth disease 
crisis?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to provide some more information on the main estimates to my 
colleague from the great riding of Cypress Hills—Grasslands and 
a colleague who is a very valuable member of our all party 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am new at being a parliamentary secretary, but it is very 
human that we would make some changes on the road.  However, my 
colleague tabled his question and then things changed.  However, 
I know my colleague is very interested in the main estimates 
because that is what he questioned the minister on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has said on several occasions since the main 
estimates were tabled, the budget allocated to farm income has 
not been reduced for 2001-02. 
On the contrary, we have increased our funding commitments to 
farmers.  Over the next three years we committed to inject up to 
$3.3 billion into farm safety net systems.  As well, on March 1 
the minister announced additional funding of $500 million, a half 
a billion dollars more, which brings the total federal commitment 
to $3.8 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 was a transition year.  The 2000-01 main estimates 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada had to account for both AIDA 
and our new program CFIP.  This was done in accordance with the 
Government of Canada's accounting practices which required 
departments to recognize liabilities in the year the decision was 
made to incur them.  Since CFIP started in the 2000 tax year, the 
budget allocated to that year of the program was recorded in the 
2000-2001 main estimates.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question earlier was for the minister in relation to a request 
from Quebec for an allocation of 6,000 metric tonnes of shrimp. I 
asked the minister at the time to reject the request in light of 
the implications.  The answer I was given by the parliamentary 
secretary, who will undoubtedly re-answer my question this 
evening, was that they would look at it in light of their usual 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That scares me because when I asked the same minister a question 
last spring about whether or not he planned to give an allocation 
of shrimp to P.E.I., he gave me the same type of answer.  The 
next day he gave an allocation of 1,500 metric tonnes to Prince 
Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have absolutely no problem with giving shrimp to Quebec if 
there were extra shrimp to give away.  I would not mind giving it 
shrimp if it gave us some of their power.  I would not mind 
giving it shrimp if it gave us back some of our power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the beneficiaries of any resource, especially the 
fishery, should be those closest to it and that is the people 
adjacent to it.  That is why we talk about the principle of 
adjacency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case there are the fish plants.  Let us forget about the 
buildings.  There are workers in the riding that the 
parliamentary secretary represents who, since the collapse of the 
ground fishery in our province, have been existing on meagre 
resources.  Shrimp could enhance their employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are participants in the fishery already.  The larger boats 
that involved and that started the shrimp fishery in our 
province, perhaps the most viable and profitable way of 
harvesting shrimp in certain areas, could certainly use more of 
the resource to make their efforts viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 65 and under fleet will tell us it is not getting enough 
quotas to make it worthwhile gearing up to prosecute the fishery. 
We have a number of small plants throughout the province that, 
through the moratorium crisis, kept their doors open without one 
cent from government.  They were the only ones who received no 
benefit from NCARP and TAGS.  These private operators 
stayed, along with 
small co-operatives, and kept their operations going on 
their own backs.  These people have been looking for quotas and 
have been rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many needs around the province adjacent to the 
resource and if there are extra resources that is where they should 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the shrimp stocks are supposedly in good shape.  We know 
that next year or the year after there will be undoubtedly an 
increased quotas.  If that is the case it should go to those who 
are already involved to make their operations viable, and then to 
the others who are adjacent to the resource and who will benefit 
more from it.  If there is more above and beyond that then we 
have no problems with sharing.  However we have to look after 
ourselves first, especially in light of what we have gone through 
in my province over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member when he stands to answer the question will 
recognize that the minister has already made a commitment. 
The minister had made a commitment to the union, to the minister 
of fisheries in Newfoundland and to the Fisheries Association of 
Newfoundland and Labrador that we will not see any new entrants 
into the industry until his present policy review has taken 
place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
raised a question about requests from the province of Quebec for 
additional access to northern shrimp, particularly an allocation 
of 6,000 tonnes in this year's fishery.  He raised his question 
against the backdrop of last year's debate over the decision to 
provide access to northern shrimp to fisheries interests from 
P.E.I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allocation of a valuable, abundant common property resource 
is always controversial.  The issue is likely to be controversial 
again in 2001.  However in making a decision for 2001 the 
minister will be guided, as he was last year, first by science 
and second by input from stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific advice last year for northern shrimp stock off 
the east coast of Newfoundland and Labrador was very clear.  It 
indicated that the stock was in good shape with a very high and 
stable abundance of shrimp.  This advice was considered by 
fisheries managers, industry stakeholders and provincial 
representatives at the annual northern shrimp advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful consideration of all views and consistent with the 
scientific advice, the minister concluded that a quota of 3,000 
tonnes was warranted.  This enabled harvesters to take advantage 
of the high abundance while it was available.  He also concluded 
that assignment of some of the increase to non-adjacent fisheries 
was warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I say to the hon. member that the minister will 
await the recommendations of the report of an independent panel 
examining access criteria.  That report is expected in June.  As 
always, consideration for the well-being of the fishery resource, 
the need for a sustainable fishery and the principle of fairness 
and adjacency will be considered.

1999 Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last week of February the federal government bought 
approximately four crab fishing boats in the area of the Acadian

these boats and threatened approximately some 35 jobs in fish 
processing plants for each boat sold.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am troubled by the hon. member's misunderstanding 
of the situation. The situation is very clearly a voluntary 
program where people have the right to sell something that they 
own to the government for the purposes that he described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be most unfortunate if he wishes to give the 
impression that his party would prevent a voluntary sale by a 
willing seller to a willing buyer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a response from a minister is incredible.  If anyone has 
misunderstood, it is the Liberals across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable to come to the Acadian peninsula to sort out 
a problem with the aboriginal peoples, because of the 
Marshall decision; to want to buy boats at prices of upward of 
$2 million; to lay off dockhands, with the result that plant 
employees are in danger of losing their jobs; and not to take that 
into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with a man who telephoned me one evening.  He had 
already been holed up in his house for two days. He was 
crying like a baby because he had lost his job after 28 years of 
service for an employer, a fisher, a boat captain.  The 
fellow did not know how to read or write.  He told me that he 
was going to lose his house and his car, everything.  That is 
the problem.  The government did not take this into account 
when buying up crab fishing licences.  It is unacceptable and 
inhuman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems of one people cannot be settled by creating a 
problem for another people.  That is not the way to do things. 
The result will be divisions between peoples, quarrels and

unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling upon the government to shoulder its 
responsibilities for the good of the people in the region I 
represent, for the fishers and the plant workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Buying a boat or something else on a voluntary basis is 
acceptable, but when the government uses the taxpayers' money to 
make purchases like this one, putting people out, then I 
say the way it was done is unacceptable.  No program was put in 
place to look after these families who are now suffering because 
of the federal government.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, therefore, I call upon the government to assume its 
responsibilities. 
I wrote the minister of fisheries on February 28, and here we are 
at March 28 and still no answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our area the people live in fear of what is going to happen, 
fear for their future.  The newspapers reflect that fear every 
day.  People are meeting but no solutions are being found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on this point.  I am anxious to hear the 
parliamentary secretary's response.  I am anxious to see what 
the Liberal government will have to say about the mess it has 
created in our area and the other mess it is in the process of 
stirring up between peoples, between the aboriginal people and 
the people of the Acadian peninsula.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has 
raised a question concerning licence requirements under the 
Marshall process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the response to the Marshall decision in the Supreme 
Court of Canada, the government entered into a fisheries access 
program on the recommendations of the standing committee and at 
the request of the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program involves the voluntary retirement of existing 
commercial fishing licences and/or vessels and gear.  The program 
facilitates the voluntary retirement of commercial licences and 
the issuance of licences to eligible aboriginal groups in a 
manner that does not add to the existing fishing effort on the 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently announced longer term Marshall process has as one 
of its components a continuation of the licence retirement 
program.  The member has expressed concern over lost jobs for 
deckhands and fish plant workers who were displaced when licence 
holders retired their licences under the Marshall program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is fully aware of these concerns.  Unemployment 
is not just an economic issue.  It also has very real emotional 
impacts for individual people and the communities they live in. 
The federal and provincial governments of Canada understand the 
implications of losing jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say before my time expires that the important point is 
that in addition to working with other departments, particularly 
HRDC, the minister spoke to his counterpart in the New Brunswick 
government, the Hon. Paul Robichaud, on the issue of crab and 
lobster crew members displaced as a result of licence retirement 
under the Marshall program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the federal-provincial committee on snow crab crew 
members has been established.  The committee will meet for the 
first time on March 20.

have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
