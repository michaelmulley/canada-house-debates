<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the bill relates to something that is at the forefront 
of a number of people's minds.  It deals with the legalization of 
marijuana for medicinal purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically there are a number of people in our country who are 
suffering from debilitating diseases or are in the process of 
dying who need hospice care and therapeutics to relieve their 
suffering.  In some cases we have been unable to prevent the 
suffering they endure in their dying moments or in their time of 
need and some of those people have turned toward smoking 
marijuana to relieve that suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know if the effects of marijuana consumed under those 
conditions are due to a medical or therapeutic effect due to the 
intrinsic pharmaceutical property of marijuana or whether this is 
a placebo effect.  As a physician, I personally do not care.  In 
my view, if somebody is dying they should be able to participate 
in whatever it takes to relieve their suffering as long as it 
does not hurt anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no interest in legalizing marijuana or any other 
currently illegal drug for general consumption.  Some would 
disagree, but the reason for this is that there is an 
overwhelming body of evidence to show that marijuana is a harmful 
drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 200 substances within marijuana.  Some of those 
substances do have a detrimental effect to a person's functioning 
in the short term and in the long term.  This is particularly 
profound among children who sustain cognitive disabilities as a 
result of the chronic consumption of marijuana. We have no 
interest whatsoever in furthering that.  In fact, we would like 
to prevent it. 
The bill deals with the medical use of marijuana. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to work with the medical community and 
stakeholders to ensure there is a well defined group of people 
allowed to use marijuana under certain conditions.  We do not 
want this to become a loophole whereby people can say they have a 
headache and need to take marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of Health for asking the Department 
of Health to undertake studies on the medical effects of 
marijuana under these circumstances.  We would like to do our 
best to ensure people are taking substances based on good medical 
science and not for other reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem in our country is how we are dealing with the 
overall drug consumption.  We tend to try to manage these 
problems rather than to prevent them.  I have spent quite a bit 
of time working in drug rehabilitation and detox centres. What we 
are doing right now by and large simply does not work.  Our 
response to the terrible problems that drugs are inflicting on 
our society is to try to prevent this when teenagers are doing it 
or when adults are doing it.  We try to deal with the management 
of the problem rather than dealing with children very early on in 
trying to prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, along with other countries, invest a lot of money 
internationally trying to deal with the countries that are 
producing it.  We try to deal with the peasants in Columbia and 
in southeast Asia who are producing and growing poppies in order 
to get money to put bread on their tables.  Who can argue with 
these very poor people who want to be able to grow these drugs in 
order to survive?  I would argue that most people in similar 
circumstances, being faced with abject poverty and an inability 
to care for themselves and their families, would do whatever it 
took to ensure that occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To invest money on that side is a losing proposition and we have 
been unsuccessful.  We spend a lot of money dealing with the 
producers of drugs rather than dealing with the demand. We and 
other countries must focus more on preventing the consumption 
within our own countries of illegal substances such as pot, 
heroin, cocaine, Ritalin, T's and R's and a kaleidoscope of 
illegal drugs used by many people.  If we put more money into 
prevention to deal with the demand within our own country the 
supply would have to dry up.  If nobody would want to consume the 
substances production would have to stop.  Rather than investing 
huge amounts of money in drug interdiction in other countries 
like Columbia, Burma and others, we need to look closer to home 
and try to deal with our consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found out that if we start dealing with children very early 
on when they are eight to ten years of age, we will get the best 
bang for our buck.  Dealing with children early on will have the 
most profound effect on our future ability to prevent children 
and therefore adults from consuming drugs.  The head start 
program has had a profound effect in parts of our country, in 
particular in Moncton, New Brunswick, and in other parts of the 
world such as Ypsilanti, Michigan and Hawaii. The Minister of 
Labour has been a leader in pursuing this as has the secretary of 
state for youth who has taken a very big interest in this issue 
and has pursued it with great vigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we all get behind the concept of a national head start 
program that uses existing resources, we can start dealing with 
children in the first eight years of life.  We will deal not only 
with consumptive practices in teenagers and adults, but we will 
also try to address the very important issue of fetal alcohol 
syndrome, fetal alcohol effects and the effect of drug 
consumption while a woman is pregnant. This is no small problem. 
The leading cause of preventable brain damage in our country is 
fetal alcohol syndrome.  It is epidemic. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems for people suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome 
cannot be understated.  These people have an average IQ of 68. 
They have physical deformities.  They have a number of other 
problems such as cognitive deficiencies.  When children who have 
FAS of FAE go to school, their ability to interact with their 
peers, to study in school and to concentrate is marred forever. 
They have irreversible brain damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the child tries to interact at school teachers are often 
ill equipped and under tasked to deal with them.  The child 
becomes marginalized.  The child does not get the help the little 
one needs and progressively becomes more isolated.  Developmental 
and behavioural problems occur which can manifest themselves not 
only in behavioural problems at school but also tragically can 
lead to drug consumption and criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a terrible vicious cycle which is very difficult to break. 
Imagine if that cycle could be broken and the child's brain had 
never been damaged by being subjected to alcohol and drugs in 
utero.  The child would have a fighting chance and could 
potentially be on a much more level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to look at the national head start 
program.  Look at what the Minister of Labour has done.  Look at 
what the Secretary of State for Children and Youth is doing on 
this issue. Work with members across party lines to prevent 
social problems rather than to manage them.  The benefits of 
doing this are dramatic on a number of levels.  They found a 50% 
reduction in youth crime and a 40% reduction in teen pregnancies 
which is a one-way route for poverty usually for both the mom and 
the child.  They found a massive decrease in welfare. Children 
stayed in school longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the head start program dealing with existing 
resources, strengthening the parent-child bond, teaching parents 
how to be good parents, learning the importance of play, 
discipline, setting boundaries, ensuring that children's basic 
needs are met, the importance of nutrition for a growing child 
all sound basic, but members would be surprised how many 
communities across the country lack them.  We have to address 
this now.  The longer we do not deal with the preventative 
aspects for children in the first eight years of life, the longer 
we will have the tragic situations we see in so many communities 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the motion is a good one.  It needs to be applied to 
the medicinal use of marijuana.  We would like to see medical 
studies to substantiate this.  We would also like to ensure that 
this is not going to be a route to legalizing marijuana which we 
are opposed to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the 
control of marijuana today from the legislative standpoint and 
legal obligation.  The legislative challenges are imposing but 
the government is committed to meeting them. The focus of my 
debate today will be exclusively on the use of marijuana for 
medical purposes and on the legislative and international 
commitments to which Canada is deeply committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medicinal use of marijuana is not only a complicated medical 
and legal issue, it is a complicated legislative issue.  Any move 
to relax controls over cannabis brings into play domestic laws 
and international treaties, violations of which bring very 
serious consequences.  The legal realities cannot be ignored. 
That is why I am speaking to the subamendment that has been 
proposed. It is troublesome from the obligations and legal 
realities especially of international treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should marijuana be used for medical purposes it must be done 
without undermining domestic efforts to control the illicit 
marijuana market.  Canada cannot contravene important 
international agreements that combat the global trade of illicit 
drugs. 
In view of this commitment as well as many other concerns, the 
government is now preparing a plan specifically intended to help 
Canadians who are suffering facilitate access to marijuana for 
medical purposes only.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to outline these legal obligations and how our agenda 
for research will address them in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cannabis is controlled under the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
Act and the narcotics control regulations. The CDSA has a clear 
purpose to control substances that can alter mental processes. 
These are substances that can harm the mental health of 
individuals in society if used and distributed without 
appropriate supervision.  The CDSA therefore prohibits the 
production, importation, exportation, distribution, sale and 
possession of marijuana in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The narcotics control regulations meanwhile permit exceptions to 
the control of substances if certain conditions are met.  The 
regulations authorize the granting of licences to permit the 
manufacture, import, transport and distribution of narcotics, 
including marijuana, for medical and scientific purposes. The 
current regulations therefore permit the use of marijuana for 
medical and medicinal purposes.  The narcotics control 
regulations contain mechanisms to grant appropriate licences and 
so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the use of marijuana for medical purposes is already 
possible, provided the product is of good quality and originates 
from a licit, that is a legal, licensed supplier and is 
distributed and used in a proper scientific or medical context. 
That is where we run into the complexity of this issue. We face 
many difficulties relating to the securing of safe, legal, that 
is licit, and reliable sources of marijuana for medicinal 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must comply with international obligations under a series 
of treaties designed to control drugs worldwide.  I will expand 
on this very briefly.  For cannabis to be used in therapeutic 
situations it must originate from a legal source and be of 
medicinal quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cares and has compassion for Canadians who are 
suffering from serious illnesses.  For this reason our plan will 
include access to a safe quality supply of marijuana.  We do not 
want Canadians to gamble with their health in using drugs of 
unknown quality and drugs which may in fact do more harm. As 
well, its distribution would need to comply with the requirements 
of the food and drugs act and regulations to ensure product 
safety, efficacy and quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is exploring avenues to provide Canadians with 
access to medicinal marijuana in a controlled medical setting. In 
fact Health Canada has already taken the initiative of exploring 
and possibly securing legal, licit, quality sources of marijuana 
for medicinal use for the vital research we want to conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few countries, the United States and others, where 
marijuana is being legally cultivated in limited quantity under 
strict government control specifically for its use in research. 
Researchers can obtain marijuana from those sources.  The 
domestic supply here in Canada is also being explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cultivation of marijuana in Canada however involves more 
than domestic health and safety issues.  International 
obligations must be met.  Marijuana is controlled primarily by 
the 1961 United Nations single convention on narcotic drugs. 
Canada is a signator and we have ratified that convention.  Under 
this and other conventions, Canada is obliged to exercise control 
over production and distribution of narcotics and psychotropic 
substances. We must combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking and 
report our activities to international bodies.  These are our 
treaty obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I would point out that at the present time there is no 
scientific evidence on marijuana's medicinal values and the 
safety or efficacy of marijuana.  This has not been established 
in any country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to enabling scientific research into 
the potential benefits and hazards of marijuana.  We want to 
compile the needed evidence to meet our legislative challenges, 
and they are many as I have outlined, but more important to help 
Canadians who are suffering and those who are terminally ill and 
who feel medicinal marijuana might be of benefit to them.  We 
want to help. It must however be done without compromising 
Canadian standards for health, safety and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure hon. members would agree that this is a prudent yet 
compassionate and carefully considered plan of action.

Health to work expeditiously in this matter. The federation's 
decision was unanimous, that is 18 members of its 18 member 
board of directors espoused the cause, while noting that they 
did not encourage the use of drugs either natural or synthetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that the federation represents nearly 275,000 
seniors in Quebec and that its outgoing president, Philippe 
Lapointe, a very lively 85-year old, is from my riding of 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we note that seniors are speaking out more and 
more. They are defending their ideas and their rights. This 
year, 1999, has been declared the International Year of Older 
Persons, and this week is seniors' week. I would also like to 
mention that the fourth World Conference on Aging will be held 
at the Montreal Convention Centre from September 5 to 9, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate my request to the public at large, so we may obtain 
as many signatures as possible on the postcards the Bloc 
Quebecois sent out to make people aware of this issue. In fact, 
the Bloc Quebecois send out over 10,000 postcards, and the 
response has been positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People cannot be insensitive to the suffering of thousands of 
people in ill health. Many patients who might use this 
medication are currently forced to take many pills a day and are 
at risk of becoming sick to their stomach. 
In a 1997 CTV-Angus Reid poll of 1,500 adults, 83% of Quebecers 
and Canadians were in favour of legalizing the use of marijuana 
for health purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Pensioners and Senior Citizens Federation, the 
Canadian AIDS Society, the Canadian Hemophilia Society, the 
Coalition québécoise des organismes communautaires de lutte 
contre le sida, and the dailies <I>Le Soleil</I>, <I>Le Devoir</I>, <I>Le Droit</I>, 
The <I>Globe and Mail</I> and The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> all support this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of compassion. The chairwoman of the board of 
the Vancouver Compassion Club, an organization with a membership 
of over 700 individuals, also supported the motion. 
She signed the postcard sent to federal parliamentarians, asking 
them to support the motion to legalize the use of marijuana for 
medical purposes. The club is a non-profit organization which has 
been providing safe and high quality marijuana since 1996 to 
seriously ill individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I addressed this issue on December 9, 1997, before the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Health. At the time, I asked the 
Deputy Minister of Health to provide clarifications on the use 
of marijuana for health purposes in the fight against AIDS, to 
alleviate the suffering of AIDS victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this issue following representations made by 
Jean-Charles Pariseau, of Hull, who regained some strength after 
inhaling marijuana. Mr. Pariseau is a terminally ill AIDS 
patient. He uses marijuana to relieve nausea and stimulate his 
appetite. 
His attending physician, Dr. Donald Kilby, from the University 
of Ottawa's health services, supported his representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Jean-Paul Pariseau will be protesting in front of 
Parliament, here in Ottawa, and I want to salute him and 
reiterate my support for his cause.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, there are some judges who are showing some 
compassion.  The Ontario court has already found part of the 
Narcotics Act to be unconstitutional, particularly where the use 
of marijuana for health purposes is concerned.  Another Ontario 
judge has recognized the right of a Toronto man, Terry Parker, 
to grow and smoke marijuana for his own medical use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to call upon judges to make a decision on a societal 
debate.  It is unacceptable for a chronically ill person to be 
liable for six months in prison, in addition to a $1,000 fine, 
for using medication that may have been recommended to him by 
his physician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my first speech in this House on the legalization 
of marijuana for health and medical purposes, there have been a 
number of changes in federal policy on drugs in Canada.  The 
first federal legislative measure in this area, in fact, dates 
back to 1908 and was particularly aimed at those who smoked 
opium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health needs to do more than mandate federal 
public servants to submit a plan including the holding of 
clinical trials.  He seems incapable of setting any real and 
reasonable deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I must again point out that this is a matter of 
compassion.  I am proud that the Bloc Quebecois has raised this 
matter for the first time with Motion No. 381 by my colleague from 
Rosemont, and I strongly encourage all hon. members to support 
this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party to thank the member for Rosemont for bringing 
the motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear the government side speak about the 
fact that we must concentrate on health care and health care 
matters when it was the Liberal government that took $21 billion 
out of health care spending and replaced only $11.5 billion after 
five years.  In many ways I wish the government would back up its 
statements and arguments with the resources that are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also ironic the Minister of Health recently said that 
there would be studies and clinical tests on the medical use of 
marijuana for those who have serious illnesses.  It is just being 
done now.  Marijuana has been around for thousands and thousands 
of years and in 1999 the federal government is to conduct studies 
and clinical tests on the use of marijuana for medicinal 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any one in the House could actually dictate to 
people who are seriously ill, who have AIDS and other ailments of 
that nature, what they should and should not do to feel better. 
Yes, we have to put precautions in place.  Yes, we have to make 
sure that the safeguard of all Canadians, especially when it 
comes to their health, is paramount in any decisions that the 
House makes or in any recommendations from individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to take ourselves out of our suits once in a 
while and place ourselves in the position of those people who are 
severely disabled through various diseases, especially, for 
example, when it comes to the issue of AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States 36 states out of the union have passed 
legislation endorsing the medical use of marijuana despite a 
federal U.S. ban.  I am sure that ban is in place as the member 
from the Liberal Party indicated.  There are cross-country 
obligations and international treaty organizations which have to 
be adhered to in the legal matter.  If the Canadian government 
really wished to and if the people of Canada were really behind 
it, ways could be found to speed track the issue forward so that 
relief could be found for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the father of two young girls there is no question I am very 
concerned about the future of Canada, what substances will be 
adhered to, what will be in the schools and playgrounds and 
everywhere else.  The relaxation of any concern when it comes to 
their health is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should try to assist people who are seriously ill and have 
relied on alternate means of remedies to achieve relief from 
their pain and suffering. 
This is one reason the motion brought forward by the member for 
Rosemont is very appropriate at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly encourage the government to go forth with its 
studies in terms of the medicinal use of marijuana.   I encourage 
the member for Rosemont to continue the debate to bring this very 
serious issue to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues which a lot of people do not like to talk about 
because they give the perception of being seedy subjects. People 
think we should not be talking about issues of this nature.  The 
House of Commons is exactly where issues of this nature should be 
discussed and where regulations and legislation should be passed. 
This is where people on all sides of the debate should have an 
opportunity to discuss such an important subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust we will have a pleasant time in the House for the next 
four weeks as we debate this issue and many other important 
issues brought before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Nova Scotia for the 
brevity of his remarks so that I might participate.  I say at the 
outset that the Progressive Conservative Party agrees with 
comments which have been made with respect to Motion No. 381 put 
forward by the member for Rosemont.  This is an issue of 
compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important comment was made by a previous speaker 
regarding the government's tendency to borrow opposition motions 
and previous governments' initiatives.  Although no one has a 
patent on good ideas, Canadians have witnessed a government that 
has established a record of policy plagiarism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rosemont brought forward a motion which 
calls upon the government to bring about change in our health 
care system, our medical practice, that would allow for the 
medical prescription of marijuana in pain control.  The most 
important point to keep in mind about the issue is that the 
motion is aimed at those who are affected and are currently 
suffering from very serious illnesses such as AIDS, cancer, MS 
and glaucoma.  These individuals are suffering every day and it 
appears very little can be done with current medical procedures 
to ease the pain and ease the mind, particularly knowing that 
many of these diseases are fatal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forcing people to acquire a painkiller like the currently 
illegal marijuana certainly adds to the mental anguish.  We are 
on the horns of a classic dilemma.  We have a legally restricted 
activity, a social wrong that was created by law, yet a humane 
need to ease suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear.  My position or that of the Conservative 
Party should not be mistaken as advocating drug use for any 
non-medical purpose.  In fact it is quite the contrary.  We are 
advocating a shift in the approach taken to the enforcement of 
drug use, particularly marijuana that is used for a very limited 
purpose, that being the medical tranquillity of suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key words here are health and medical purposes.  We are 
talking about the compassionate use of a substance which is 
presently illegal in all circumstances.  A number of substances 
are currently being used in the practice of medicine which are 
prescribed by doctors quite often to control pain, substances 
such as codeine, morphine and heroin which are perfect examples 
of drugs that in other circumstances would certainly be deemed 
illegal.  Heroin, for example, has been used with a doctor's 
prescription since 1985 to ease the pain and suffering of 
Canadians fighting side effects of illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can separate crime from medicine with very definitive, 
decisive laws.  Further research may lead to a chemical 
production of a byproduct of marijuana which might be taken in a 
different form, that is taken orally through a pill.  The use of 
a drug to relieve pain in those suffering from terminal 
illnesses, not for recreational use, is the aim of this motion. 
Delay in bringing this about will cause further pain and 
suffering for those afflicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 6 Jim Wakeford, a Toronto man suffering from advanced 
AIDS, applied for and finally received permission from Health 
Canada to use marijuana after fighting in the courts for years. 
Courts have recognized the humane need.  Legislators like the 
Parliament of Canada should lead, not follow, on an issue such as 
this one.  We cannot make criminals out of those needing our 
compassion or those who are trying to ease suffering.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Compassion Club of Vancouver, also mentioned in the debate, 
supplies marijuana at no cost, free, solely to ease the pain of 
sick people on the lower mainland.  This club is illegal but 
receives referrals from agencies of individuals suffering from 
AIDS or multiple sclerosis.  It is a secure environment with a 
very good quality of marijuana, unlike that often found on the 
streets which might be laced with another substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister promised in March that he would take steps 
toward helping seriously ill Canadians who require medical access 
to marijuana.  The guidance document makes no reference to the 
severity of illness.  It does not distinguish between terminal 
and non-terminal cases.  There is a number of ambiguities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister is simply taking too long.  Hilary Black, 
the Compassion Club founder, has stated that the slow speed of 
the minister's initiative means that more people will have to 
come into her clinic.  Those individuals will continue to suffer 
until legislation is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fast response and a strict guide or criteria are needed, as is 
a clear definition that doctors' prescriptions will be granted 
therefore avoiding litigation, confusion and further delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of facts about marijuana have been touched upon 
already.  One matter to keep in mind is that when it comes to 
glaucoma it reduces eye pressure, which reduces pain.  It reduces 
spasms in victims who are suffering from multiple sclerosis.  It 
reduces nausea in the treatment of cancer patients.  It helps 
alleviate depression and regain appetite in those suffering from 
AIDS.  There are no real side effects, aside from some dulling of 
the senses.  As we know, some of the side effects from the 
horrific treatments which are undergone, in particular I am 
thinking of radiation, are sometimes worse than the actual 
symptoms of the illness the patient is suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association since 1981 has advocated the 
decriminalization of the possession of marijuana.  It is 
encouraging to see that we in this place and in other parts of 
the country are finally catching up.  The Canadian Police 
Association has taken a very positive view of this step. There 
are certainly noble reasons to permit the medical use of 
marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association however recommends that the 
federal government, with respect to the jurisdictional aspect, 
move toward changes in our Narcotics Control Act and our Food and 
Drugs Act to keep up with this current trend.  This position 
raises concerns about the herbal medicine aspect and the fact 
that it cannot be patented.  The association states that there is 
a possibility that there will be exploitation of research if 
guidelines are not put in place.  The government can address 
these problems and make changes to other legislation which will 
have to be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also concern, I might add, on a number of levels, one 
being the chemical content that may come into play.  These plants 
vary from plant to plant with respect to dosage.  There is also 
concern about the standardization and the reproductability of 
clinical trials which will be problematic when it comes to 
putting the medical use forward.  It would be almost impossible 
to conduct blind trials without having some consistency in the 
approach.  There is also concern about the delivery of the drug 
and it not being reliable from patient to patient as the dose 
depends on the delivery technique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are obviously scientific matters that will have to be 
addressed in order for there to be consistency and in order for 
there to be safety, one of the underlying elements which always 
has to be kept in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is concern as well about research in this area.  Quality 
research, random control trials and a guide to decision making 
are very appropriate when it comes to the needed standardized 
approach.  There is no consistency in terms of the product 
available at this time.  The dosage, the length of use and the 
possibility of addiction are areas that will have to be further 
researched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different drugs will have a different effect on individuals. 
There is also the aspect of the synergistic effect that marijuana 
might have when taken in conjunction with other chemicals and in 
consideration of a person's bodily make-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The patient's perspective is something that has to be 
emphasized.  A person who requires marijuana and feels the 
physical need to use it to reduce suffering even with the mental 
effect it has certainly legitimizes the efforts to move toward 
the decriminalization of marijuana for this very limited purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot ignore that drugs are a consistent problem in today's 
society, but this is not a step toward legalizing marijuana in 
its entirety.  I do not advocate that position at all.  With the 
checks and balances that are needed there seems to be an 
opportunity before us.  If the government is diligent and forward 
looking in its approach I am sure we can move this matter 
forward.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK19">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister 
responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-78, an 
act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to 
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-78 is a necessary piece of 
legislation which makes major changes to public sector pension 
plans.  This bill substantially alters our pension plans as we 
know them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by addressing the beneficiaries of those 
plans, who may have heard, among the various arguments advanced 
in recent weeks, a number of falsehoods surrounding the 
amendments the government is planning to make.  Please allow me 
to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our employees must know that all the benefits for which 
they have paid throughout their careers will be fully guaranteed 
and maintained.  There will even be certain improvements under 
the new legislation, which will result in better benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, the government decided to act, its 
primary interest being to safeguard and improve the financial 
future of these pension plans.  Our employees and those who have 
retired from the federal public service can thus be assured of 
the future of their pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that our current public sector 
pension plans must be brought in line with the new realities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been and always will be concerned about fairness both 
toward our current and past employees and toward taxpayers. 
Historically, under the Public Service Superannuation Act, the 
government and its employees have shared the cost of the pension 
plan according to a 60:40 ratio.  The increase in CPP 
contributions has gradually changed this ratio which is now 70:30 
and which would have reached 80:20 in 2003 if the government had 
not decided to act now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government really wants to ensure the long term viability of 
these pension funds and to improve their financial management. 
The government also wants to ensure a more balanced relationship 
between employees' contributions to these funds and those put in 
by the government as the employer.  This is a question of justice 
and equity for employees and for Canadian taxpayers, which is the 
very reason behind Bill C-78. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three current pieces of legislation that govern public 
sector pension plans impose limitations that other governments 
and certain private sector firms have already eliminated.  We 
are a government that is respectful of the individual and, as 
such, we must be fair and equitable with all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to justify that government employees are 
sheltered from increases to CPP while other citizens are not. 
It is also difficult to justify that Canadian taxpayers must 
continue to pay a larger and larger share of the pension plans 
of government employees as well as finance any possible deficits 
in those plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also unfair that taxpayers should be paying more and more 
to provide for their own retirements while public servants are 
paying less and less.  The principle of fairness must be the 
same for our employees as it is for Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the pension plans of the public service, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Forces have 
accumulated a surplus of approximately $30 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it before and I will say it again:  this surplus 
belongs to the taxpayers of Canada since they have covered and 
absorbed all the deficits incurred by the pension funds of 
government employees.  They have assumed all the risks. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will thus make it possible to take into account both 
surpluses and deficits and will establish mechanisms for 
disposing of future surpluses.  Existing surpluses will gradually 
be reduced to an acceptable level over a period of up to 15 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen in future if surpluses were to accumulate?  It 
would be the Treasury Board's responsibility to determine how 
those surpluses would be used; for example, by a reduction of 
contribution rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, if there were to be a mutual agreement to share the 
risks with employees, I am certain we could establish a 
co-management arrangement to share any potential surpluses in the 
future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will also ensure the long-term financial viability of 
our employees' pension funds by establishing a public sector 
pension investment board, which will be charged with investing 
future employer and employee contributions in the financial 
markets.  Investing contributions in diversified portfolios will 
yield a better rate of return, thus guaranteeing a better future 
and controlling increasing costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new board will be completely independent of the government 
and the participants in these plans.  It will thus be entirely 
free in its investment decisions.  Other public sector pension 
plans in Canada have already been investing contributions in the 
financial markets.  This board will be of benefit to our 
employees. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our employees have nothing to lose and everything to gain with 
this new organization.  If the performance of the investments I 
have just spoken of fail to meet expectations, I can assure 
employees that they would receive the same pension as that 
provided for under the plan to which they have contributed during 
their careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government guarantees the integrity of the benefits provided 
through its employees' pension funds.  Bill C-78 re-establishes 
equity between taxpayers and government employees in terms of the 
funding of these pension plans.  It strengthens the long term 
viability of the plans and will endeavour to reduce the costs for 
all contributing members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71, the Budget Implementation Act, also proposes 
improvements to the Public Service Superannuation Act, the 
Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future pension benefits will be computed on the basis of 
the average annual salary for the five best consecutive years 
covered, compared to six years under the current plan.  In simple 
terms this means better benefits for our employees. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 sets out a series of technical amendments, which will 
enhance the benefits associated with the pension plans of 
federal employees.  It will also reduce the contribution rate 
for the supplementary death benefit plan and the employees' 
group insurance plan and will increase benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will also grant survivor benefits to same sex partners. 
The Government of Canada would thus be making the provisions of 
these pension plans similar to those of several public and 
private sector plans.  For example, I am thinking of the Ontario 
municipal pension employees retirement plan, or similar plans 
which have been modified in New Brunswick or in Saskatchewan. 
I can even think of private companies like Sears, Dow Chemical 
or Shell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I would note that the approach adopted in Bill C-78 
is supported by the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in M

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it rather strange 
that the President of the Treasury Board would stand and tell us 
how virtually all the civil servants are behind Bill C-78 and 
that it is going to be a wonderful thing for the civil servants, 
the employees of the government, to find out that their employer 
is going to take $30 billion out of their pension plan.  He says 
they feel good about it.  I wonder who he has been talking to.  I 
do not think that very many civil servants are enthused about the 
idea of the government raiding the pension plan to the tune of 
$30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about the fair and equitable contents of 
this bill.  I draw the attention of members to an article which 
appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today on page 2.  The 
headline reads “Old RCMP pension plan leaves widows stranded”. 
It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-nine days after Eva Fisk's husband died in 1991, she 
received a letter from the RCMP.  The letter said her husband 
Albert, a Mountie for 22 years, had not left her a pension.  The 
letter also said she was no longer covered under the federal 
health-care plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It was horrible, so I threw it out”, said Ms. Fisk, now in 
her late 70s and living in Victoria.  “I was cut off”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is so concerned about fairness and equity, I 
would have thought that he would have provided some redress for 
this particular situation where widows of RCMP officers are left 
high and dry with absolutely nothing.  Based on the rules of the 
pension plan in the past they are left with nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP pension plan was amended in 1949 to improve survivor 
benefits, but participation came with a price for 
non-commissioned officers and constables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower-ranking Mounties were required to cash out their principal 
payments and give up the accrued interest they earned in order to 
join the new plan.  Mounties promoted to commissioned-officer 
ranks were entitled to keep their benefits under the old plan 
without cashing out their principal payments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have very clear discrimination between commissioned officers 
in the RCMP and non-commissioned officers and constables who were 
left high and dry and who were forced to cash out their pension 
plans, give up all the interest they had earned, while the 
commissioned officers were able to keep all their money plus the 
government interest and roll it into the new plan.  Has Bill C-78 
provided redress for this issue?  Absolutely not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the minister would use such words as fair 
and equitable when talking about this legislation.  When their 
husbands die, widows of members of the most respected police 
force in the world, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, are left 
high and dry with nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked with the department involved and it said they opted out 
of the pension plan.  They did not want to provide for their 
widows and orphans.  They made that election. If they were single 
and subsequently got married, they were again given the offer. It 
is rather strange that we would have the situation where people 
could leave their family members high and dry and the government 
would agree to it.  It cannot be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the department to assure me that members were given the 
option to opt in to the widows and orphans section of the pension 
plan when they married. It said absolutely. Back in those days a 
person had to ask his employer, the RCMP, for permission to get 
married.  He could not go to the local church and get married 
without getting permission from his employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way. People no longer ask for their 
employer's permission to get married.  Common law situations are 
recognized. Bill C-78 now extends that to same sex relationships. 
It goes beyond that to basically any relationship of any kind is 
going to qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking to a person this morning who asked about the 
situation of two people sharing an apartment, that one could 
claim to be the survivor of the other.  I said yes but the person 
could dispute that.  We are talking here about survivor benefits. 
When a civil servant dies and is in the graveyard, his companion 
or roommate, even though there was no conjugal relationship, 
could claim survivor benefits and nobody could dispute it. As I 
have said before, the lawyer before the committee indicated they 
were going to take the person's word for it. Therefore, even if 
there was no conjugal relationship, we are going to have to pay 
benefits in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the government wants to have its cake and eat it 
too when it comes to same sex benefits.  It wants to have any 
relationship whatsoever qualify for survivor benefits, but at the 
same time it has narrowed it down by defining it as conjugal and 
cohabitation.  How it intends to police that, it really has no 
idea.  It intends to leave it up to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the M. v H. decision that came down last week. It 
concerned the Family Law Act of Ontario and dealt with the 
definition of spouse.  The definition as far as I understand it 
in section 29 of the Family Law Act is either people who are 
married or a man and a woman living in a conjugal relationship 
for three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 deals with pension plans and defines a relationship as 
conjugal and cohabitation for one year.  I understand there are 
some circumstances where cohabitation for six months qualifies as 
a common law relationship.  I am wondering how soon it will be 
that after a one night fling one's pension will be at risk.  I am 
sure that would take some of the enthusiasm out of one night 
stands.  The point is we have to look to where we are going as 
far as these issues are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1949 if a person wanted to get married he had to ask his 
employer for permission. 
That went by the wayside.  Then people did not bother to get 
married.  Then it did not matter that it was the opposite sex. 
Then it did not matter how long the relationship lasted and now 
it is down perhaps to as low as six months.  Goodness knows where 
it is going to end up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue we see on the slippery slope where Bill C-78 
is not fair and equitable.  It wants to hand out money anywhere 
and everywhere on relationships that cannot be defined, that 
cannot be policed, if I may use that terminology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at a loss.  It is very disappointing.  We as 
parliamentarians are in the House debating a new law of the land. 
I expect it will become the law of the land because the 
government is going to ram this bill through later today. 
Regardless of what we say in the House and regardless of the fact 
that about eight members on the government side voted against 
this bill, it is going to get rammed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I was reading the M. v H. decision the supreme 
court brought down last Thursday.  It referred on several 
occasions to parliament's wishes and that parliament knew what it 
was doing when it passed the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here parliament is expressing its serious opposition to this 
bill that was drafted by the bureaucrats, 200 pages of technical, 
detailed, complex legislation.  The bill would have been passed 
through committee in 15 minutes had there been the chance but I 
was able to slow it down to four hours. This is not parliament 
expressing its will.  This is parliament being railroaded into 
rubber stamping what the government wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that is on the record because if, as and when this 
is ever challenged in court, I would never want the courts to say 
that parliament freely expressed its wishes and opinion on this 
particular issue, because its opinion is irrelevant.  It is being 
railroaded into approving something that has not been analysed, 
debated or thought through. We have not examined the 
ramifications of where it is leading us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to find Bill C-78 finished and voted on in the 
House of Commons tonight.  The government has organized it by 
cracking the whip and saying “You will be here to vote for the 
bill”.  For those who would like to do otherwise, I understand 
there are all kinds of incentives to be in other places.  We will 
find out whether they have accepted these invitations later on 
this evening. What can I say, Mr. Speaker?  It is a travesty that 
the House which should approve the legislation is being forced to 
endorse the government's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $30 billion is another issue which I find rather 
contemptuous.  There is a $30 billion actuarial surplus in the 
plan today because of a fortunate coincidence that has brought 
several factors together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inflation has come down quite dramatically yet because the money 
is invested in 20 year bonds the return on the plan is still very 
high. Because there was a six year wage freeze the cost of 
pensions has been reduced. Salaries were not so much reduced, but 
their growth was less than anticipated through the wage freeze. 
Therefore, pensions are less than anticipated, hence the cost of 
pension payouts are less than anticipated. Because inflation is 
down, the cost of pension payments in future years will be 
reduced.  This is the largest fully indexed pension plan existing 
in the country today.  If inflation is down, the cost of these 
pension payments over the next number of years is going to be 
reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not because of overcontribution by the government.  It is 
not because of overcontribution by the employees either. 
It is just that these fortunate circumstances have come together 
to create an actuarial assessment which leaves more money in the 
plan than otherwise required.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to take that money.  It wants to take the 
money that was contributed by itself and the employees.  It is 
very distasteful that it would help itself to money put into the 
plan by its very own employees. In the private sector it is 
totally illegal.  It would not be allowed under any 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 that was passed by the House a year or two ago laid out 
specific rules for taking out a surplus from a plan if there was 
such a surplus.  There had to be a vote by the membership.  A 50% 
vote by members was required to remove the money under certain 
circumstances.  In other circumstances it required a two-thirds 
majority of the members before the employer was allowed to take 
the money out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board has told us that many of the 
members support this.  Why did he not put this to a vote?  The 
government imposed that restriction on employers and refuses to 
apply it to itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again register my opposition to the government's taking $30 
billion out of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other major fundamental issues in the bill.  One 
is to split the payment of CPP and pension contributions into two 
payments rather than one.  Until now civil servants have 
contributed 7.5% of their salaries as a combined payment to CPP 
and the pension plan.  The government has introduced very 
dramatic increases in the CPP contributions over the next number 
of years, increases as large as 73%.  If the CPP contributions 
were to go up, by obvious correlation the contributions to the 
pension plan would go down. The government says it cannot have 
that.  It wants to put them on the same footing as all other 
Canadians where they have to pay the CPP contributions and the 
pension plan as two separate payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have any problem with that, but we do have a problem 
with the fact that it will now increase the civil service 
employees' contributions to the pension plan from about 30% to 
40%.  The minister tells us the employees are not accepting any 
of the risk of the plan yet they will pay a whole bunch more into 
the plan.  The government by definition will pay a whole bunch 
less into the plan.  And the government says it is carrying the 
risk.  It cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other one is the privatization of the plan. The money will 
be invested in the private capital market rather than in 
government bonds.  Perhaps that is not a bad situation.  We do 
not dispute that there is an opportunity to make more in the 
private sector but we do know that sometimes less can be made in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the plan makes less and the employees are contributing to the 
plan, they are sharing in the risk.  They share in the risk if 
the return is lower.  The value of the plan may not be as high as 
it should be or could be. Therefore they have to cover their 
60:40 split of contributions to the plan to ensure it is a viable 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lots of arguments can be made for the employees sharing in the 
risk in the plan yet the government would say there is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government is being honest and forthright. It 
is certainly not allowing enough debate on this bill.  It is 200 
pages of complex legislation.  It went through committee in less 
than four hours.  Closure has been introduced twice on this bill. 
What can I say?  I call it the great run at the brick wall where 
the government feels that because it wants to do something the 
House has to endorse its position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
add my applause for the member who just made a well reasoned 
argument regarding Bill C-78.  He pointed out some very 
significant shortcomings in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to build on some of the points he made this 
morning.  For those listening and those in the House, let us be 
clear on what we will be voting on later today.  The bill talks 
about changes to who will manage and oversee the pension funds 
for federal government employees, what will happen to surpluses 
that may accrue to the fund, and who will be eligible for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-78 the government will appoint a board which will 
be removed from the auditor general's oversight and no longer 
subject to access to information legislation.  Bill C-78 will 
allow the federal government access to any surpluses in the 
pension plan provided the federal government, that is the 
taxpayer, commits to making up the shortfall in the pension plan 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In brief, Bill C-78 proposes to remove the funds from public 
accountability and let the federal government spend the surplus 
today with the taxpayer guaranteeing to make up future shortfalls 
in the fund.  These are not false accusations.  It is the truth. 
Every Liberal will probably dutifully do as they are told and 
vote for it.  Constituents will not know the reasons and will not 
understand all the nuances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address another aspect of the bill before us which 
deals with expanding the benefits.  It is on this aspect that I 
will direct the remainder of my time for it is here the 
government has grossly misrepresented its intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a contributor to a pension plan dies the benefits go to his 
or her surviving husband or wife.  The bill proposes to maintain 
this provision, which is good, but it will extend the benefits 
beyond this point in a new way.  The government has said its 
intent is to extend the benefits to same sex relationships as 
well.  This is not what it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many types of same gender relationships: siblings, 
friends, roommates, partners, et cetera, but the only 
relationship the government wants to include is when two people 
of the same gender are involved in private sexual activity or 
what is more commonly known as homosexuality.  No sex, no 
benefits, even if everything else is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, Bill C-78 benefits will be extended to any 
person who has had, as the bill says, “a relationship of a 
conjugal nature with a contributor” regardless of sex, male or 
female, two males or two females.  The bill refers to the phrase 
“a relationship of a conjugal nature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to <I>Black's Law Dictionary</I> conjugal means sexual 
activity.  That is how every major Canadian dictionary defines 
it, but the bill does not define it in any way.  It has added a 
new legal expression, a relationship of a conjugal nature with 
absolutely no definition of what it means.  We are left with 
assuming it means what the Canadians dictionaries mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems determined to make private sexual activity 
between anyone the primary condition for benefits.  This is the 
focus of the substantive section of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further illustrate the point, it was interesting to note that 
during the debates on the bill the Liberal member for Scarborough 
Southwest realized that the changes to the bill were specifically 
designed to extend benefits based on the sexual activity between 
two men or two women.  The bill also excludes those without 
sexual activity but who may still be dependent on each other.  He 
proposed an alternative.  The amendment was intended to leave 
sexual activity out of the benefits equation altogether. 
Benefits, according to his amendment, would be extended based on 
dependency relationships and sexual activity would not be a 
criteria for benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's government ruled his amendment out of order and 
struck it down, effectively insisting that the expanded benefits 
had to be based on homosexual activity in order to qualify.  This 
is not a same sex benefit bill; it is a sexual activity bill. The 
new part of the bill extends benefits only when there is sexual 
activity between two people of the same sex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my riding an elderly gentleman who has a friend who 
was down on his luck, a senior who was living on a very meagre 
pension.  The wealthier person took in his friend.  They have 
been sharing accommodation for years.  They basically share 
everything in that household.  They have a very deep friendship, 
but it has never even crossed their minds to have any kind of 
physical intimacy in a sexual way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill totally excludes that kind of relationship.  The only 
way for the survivor benefit to be extended to the person who 
otherwise might be dependent on the public purse is for them to 
enter into some sort of physical intimacy which they do not want 
to entertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment by the member for Scarborough Southwest would have 
taken sex out of it and based it on dependency, he said.  The 
Liberal government said no.  It ruled effectively that private 
sexual activity between people of the same gender is now the 
requirement for new benefits within Bill C-78.  This is from the 
same government that said it would not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reference some comments made by various cabinet ministers 
in the government across the way over the past few years.  I will 
start with one from the current justice minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 24, 1998 in a letter to a constituent she said that she 
continued to believe it was not necessary to change well 
understood concepts of spouse and marriage to deal with any 
fairness consideration the courts and tribunals may find.  Yet 
they have proposed legislation that has removed every reference 
to spouse, wife, widow, and has gone to new terminology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current health minister when he was the justice minister 
spoke in the House.  He said that notwithstanding sexual 
orientation was a ground within section 15 of the charter on 
which discrimination was prohibited the benefits did not 
automatically follow.  That was the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 21, 1999 the Prime Minister said in an editorial in 
the Lethbridge <I>Herald</I> that it was not on the agenda of the 
government at the time when he was asked about spousal benefits 
to same sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked about extending these benefits the member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River was not convinced that there was either 
broad based political support or legal justification for major 
changes in the current paradigm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say one thing and yet we are faced with legislation today 
which seems to contradict exactly what they told the public and 
what they stated in response to questions on this topic.  This is 
the same government which is now bestowing benefits based on 
sexual activity between two people of the same gender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am attempting not to purposely overstate this and not to be 
sensational.  I am reporting simply on the effects of the change 
in Bill C-78.  If Canadians do not believe me they can contact me 
and discuss it with me.  What I am saying is clear in the 
legislation and in the actions of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Liberal government will probably vote later 
tonight in favour of sexual activity benefits and not same sex 
benefits. 
Is this how we serve our constituents?  Does this serve the best 
interest of those who have put us here?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the invasion of privacy concerns, I have some personal 
concerns about how the bill violates those who are sent here to 
serve.  Some may not like what I have to say but I think it is 
the truth.  If we cannot state the truth in the House, I do not 
know where we can do so anywhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well documented that physical sexual intimacies between 
persons of the same gender result in much higher rates of serious 
illness, particularly when two males are involved.  Statistics 
show that people involved in this kind of activity have a life 
span just slightly over half a normal life span.  From a study 
out of the United States it has been shown that suicide rates are 
25 times higher than the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really care about people, why are we requiring people in 
the same gender relationships to be engaged in sexual activities 
to qualify for benefits?  Why are we making benefits contingent 
upon behaviours that generally speaking have been shown to work 
against the personal health and best interest of those involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I questioned the treasury board minister in committee.  He 
responded that the courts made him do it and lawyers wrote it 
this way.  Does the government serves the people by letting the 
courts set policy and lawyers draft the legislation? In the whole 
process people are left out.  Is that what members opposite will 
vote for tonight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in busy times.  The bill will be voted on tonight under 
the cover of the war in Kosovo, Y2K, tax issues and bank mergers. 
An ever increasing number of issues overwhelm the daily lives of 
those who are trying to pay the bills, raise the kids and get 
some R&R.  They will not notice all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote today will very likely go unnoticed.  The significance 
of Bill C-78 will be lost in the flurry of activity of life in 
the information overload age.  The bill will likely go unnoticed 
by those who put us here to serve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite and all other members in the House of 
something I saw in the Speaker's chambers.  I know that every 
word spoken in the House is recorded and bound in volumes which 
are kept there.  Everything we say and every vote are recorded. 
In a sense it is our accountability.  In a sense we might say it 
is the legacy we leave to families or those who follow who may 
want to reference what we said and where we stood on issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to consider their votes tonight on Bill C-78. 
Surely we can do better than Bill C-78.  The bill needs to be 
sent back for a redraft which puts the needs of all people first 
and includes respect for the personal privacies of people and 
their tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is intent on drafting legislation to allow 
benefits to flow to relationships between two people of the same 
gender, to make benefits contingent upon their having some sort 
of sexual relationship, it is in my view inappropriate.  Is it 
not more reasonable to focus on demonstrated interdependencies 
and the social contribution of the relationship when considering 
benefits rather than the private physical intimacies of the 
persons being considered?  I encourage all members of the House 
to send Bill C-78 back for an improved redraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the bill has three key strikes against it. First, it 
removes the management of public pension plans from public 
accountability with an appointed pension board, no auditor 
general review and no access to information.  Second, it allows 
the federal government to access any surpluses in the fund with 
the guarantee that taxpayers will make up the difference if there 
is a shortfall in the future.  Third, it extends survivor 
benefits outside marriage dependent on private sexuality 
regardless of gender.

improved version, an improved version that makes some sense and 
actually serves the people who worked so hard to put us here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me to 
start my presentation as I did all my speeches on this topic, 
two weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is remarkable with this government and with the bill before 
us is how the government ended up imposing its view on this 
issue. We are increasingly wondering about the type of democracy 
that prevails in the House of Commons. I am primarily alluding 
to the government's way of doing things by always silencing the 
opposition through closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day, Reform Party members told us that the government 
used closure 53 times. I imagine this figure applies to the past 
two parliaments. 
Based on the figures that we have, from 1997 until now, closure 
was used 24 times regarding bills reviewed in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder. Does this House truly have the opportunity to 
do an in-depth review of the bills? It seems that when the 
government has a priority, it just wants to pass the related 
legislation. When the government is faced with some opposition, 
it resorts to closure, to a time allocation motion, and tells us 
“Unfortunately for you, it is over. This is how we want to 
proceed. If you are not happy, discuss the issue during the few 
additional hours that we are giving you and then it will be over 
and we will vote on the legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I call the tyranny of the majority. Unfortunately, 
this tyranny does not exist only in the House. We regularly 
experience it in the committees as well. 
I am a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development and I note that, in committee, when the 
government wants to pass a bill and seems to consider that 
enough is enough, the majority automatically steps in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against the majority, because I think that 
democracy must function with a majority, but excessive 
imposition of closure on the opposition makes me think that 
democracy is sometimes in doubt. In fact I would say that it is 
definitely in doubt. Two weeks ago, in debates, they did this on 
a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it important to begin my speech today by saying that, 
with this bill, closure was once again imposed at second 
reading, at report stage and is now being imposed at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of this evening, the members of the government and 
ourselves will decide the fate of $30 billion, which should 
belong to the employees. 
The government imposed closure and is now going to tell us that 
it is going to take this $30 billion. I find that absolutely 
deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to speak of the government's arrogance. When the 
bill was introduced, the government House leader was all smiles, 
not only at imposing closure on the opposition, but also at 
continuing the tradition of imposition in Ottawa, with these 
employees, in these terms “We are taking over the $30 billion, 
we are not negotiating with you, we are the ones deciding. The 
people elected us, and we are deciding that there is a $30 
billion surplus in this fund. There will be no discussion with 
you of sharing. We are taking it and we will see about it 
afterwards”. Not only is the government using closure to excess, 
but it does so with considerable arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I look at the way it is done in the case of other pension 
funds, it is clear that, when a government that is both judge 
and jury—the government is the legislator and the employer—decides 
that there is too much of a surplus or that it wants to change 
employee contributions, the situation is very delicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to say that, in Quebec, we are better than 
elsewhere, but the tradition in Quebec is one of negotiation, 
which is not the case in Ottawa. While negotiations may be long 
at times, they may be difficult, pressure may be exerted, a 
negotiated solution is still better than an imposed one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I read through a study in which the government was 
trying to find out why public servants are so dissatisfied and 
no longer motivated at work. If one looks at the government's 
behaviour over the last few years, or even the last few decades, 
one can see that it very seldom negotiates with its employees. 
It lets collective agreements drag on even after they have 
expired, adds 1 or 2% and finally imposes a settlement. On top 
of that, it limits job action even though it is allowed under 
the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job action is allowed in a democracy. When workers are 
dissatisfied, there are legal means of expressing their 
dissatisfaction. These are provided for in the Canada Labour 
Code. Striking is one of them, and job action is another. But 
this government does not give people the opportunity to use those 
means. Moreover, as I said earlier, it is both employer and 
legislator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its strategy is very simple. By blocking negotiations or 
delaying them it forces workers to take some kind of job action. 
Then it brings in special legislation—like the one passed the 
other day—to impose a settlement, arguing that employees are 
holding the state hostage, which, by the way, is absolutely 
false. The government does not give people the opportunity to 
carry through the bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come back to the infamous special legislation brought in 
by the government no too long ago, when we spent the night here 
so the government could force public servants back to work. 
I give this example because it is particularly outrageous. 
Personally I found that the President of the Treasury Board was 
adding insult to injury when, at two in the morning, he came and 
told us that an agreement in principle had been reached with 
government employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of letting the process run its course and saying “We 
have done our part; it is now up to the workers to approve the 
agreement in general assemblies”, the government added insult to 
injury by allowing debate to continue all night and forcing the 
employees back to work anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That goes to show the government's attitude, which is to 
continually impose its views not only on its employees but also 
on the opposition, always using drastic means like legislation 
to force public service employees back to work and closure to 
gag the opposition. 
That is totally unacceptable and that shows arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board, who is the sponsor of the 
bill, just spoke in support of his bill. I would say he hardly 
spoke more than 10 minutes. Of course, hon. members have limited 
time to speak, but anyone who does not have much to say and 
wants to slip a bill through discreetly and rapidly does not 
spend much time talking about its legal and moral implications. 
The present government has no moral values and that is why the 
President of the Treasury Board talked only ten minutes about 
his bill at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a statement made by the President of the 
Treasury Board not so long ago. 
In 1996, he asked for consultations on the pension plan. He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations could lead to a partnership that would establish 
in the public service the concept of a management committee at 
arm's length with the government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what did the President of the Treasury Board do? Exactly the 
opposite of what he said in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, it was announced in a press release by the Treasury 
Board Secretariat that the government had agreed to a number of 
recommendations made by the advisory committee in a report that 
was the result of four years of painstaking work by union 
representatives, retirees and government officials. That is what 
was said in the press release of the Treasury Board Secretariat 
in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, through the President of the Treasury Board, the government 
has done exactly the opposite of what it said it would do. When 
a government sets up an advisory committee, one really has to 
wonder. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has said to its employees: “A small surplus seems to be 
building up, and maybe we should sit down and discuss this”. 
What did the government do, in the end? Through the bill before 
us, it is grabbing whatever it feels like. The government is 
making off with $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to talk about the government's management 
practices. What kind of management has the Liberal government 
been practising since it came to power in 1993 and since it was 
re-elected in 1997? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the finance minister. Like I said, <I>Star 
Wars</I> is now very popular, and we have long waiting lines outside 
movie theatres. 
I feel that the finance minister is the Darth Vader of this 
House. I will explain why later. His shadow can be seen 
everywhere he tries to put his hand on surpluses. Whenever funds 
generate surpluses, the government cannot wait to get its hands 
on them, and the Minister of Finance always has a say in the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at how the government has been managing things these 
last few years. First, it said “We have agreed on a certain 
proportion of transfers to the provinces”. The province of 
Quebec, for instance, has lost some $2.5 billion in just a few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government simply decided to cut transfers to the provinces. 
That created a huge problem for the provincial governments in 
their own areas of jurisdiction, that is to say anything having 
to do with health, education and, as far as we are concerned, 
welfare. 
That is what they called the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agreed to transfer some funds to the provinces to 
help them solve these problems. What happened was highly 
predictable. When the provincial governments, including Quebec, 
received less than they expected, problems started to emerge: 
crowded emergency wards, lack of equipment, personnel cuts, 
budget cuts for health institutions and education. Welfare 
programs were also affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces were crippled by the government's decision to cut 
transfers. The federal government was able to start reducing the 
deficit. They kept bragging, saying “This is remarkable. See how 
well we can manage public affairs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Darth Vader himself, the Minister of Finance, came to tell the 
House “See how we are putting the economy back on its 
feet—extraordinary”.  Transfer payments were the first step: less 
money transferred to the provinces means more money for the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question that can be raised concerning this 
government's management style relates to the employment insurance 
fund.  A huge reform has taken place.  Before, when people lost 
their jobs, seven out of ten of them qualified for employment 
insurance.  Now that number is 3.5, or nearly 4. Half of those 
who used to be eligible no longer are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this fund is increasing by $6 billion or $7 billion 
every year.  Perhaps $25 billion have gone into the government's 
pockets in recent years. 
That same reform also resulted in people having to pay into 
employment insurance regardless of how many hours they work.  In 
the past some were excluded, for instance students with weekend 
jobs.  Now students and others with weekend jobs have to pay 
starting with the first cent they earn.  They have to pay, but 
what is shocking is that they will never be able to qualify for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund is continuing to grow and the Darth Vader of this 
House continues to say that he is managing public funds very 
well.  Several billions are not being transferred to the 
provinces and end up in the kitty, the EI fund.  The government 
continues to pocket between $6 billion and $7 billion every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question on the way the government is managing things, 
getting back to the matter of its employees once again, is the 
whole business of pay equity. 
The President of the Treasury Board performed intellectual 
gymnastics with this. It is incredible how flexible he can be in 
the stances he takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals initially acknowledged the problem a little bit. 
Then they were told “You have to pay these people”. During 
negotiations, the people said that the government probably owed 
them between $2 billion and $7 billion, because the women in the 
federal public service are paid less well than in other sectors 
of employment. This has been proven. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board kept trying to push back the 
deadline. He began by saying that he would wait for the 
decisions on this issue for other sectors of the economy, which 
would certainly have an effect on the government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions were made public a long time ago. There is the 
problem of pay equity. It has been corrected elsewhere, but it 
has yet to be corrected by this government. The House's Darth 
Vader continues to say “The way I manage this economy and the 
public finances of this government is phenomenal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just been talking about several billion dollars in the 
employment insurance fund because the government does not pay 
fairly women working in the federal public service. The latest 
discovery of the President of the Treasury Board, surely on the 
advice of the forces of evil, the shadow in this House, is the 
$30 billion surplus in the fund belonging to the employees of 
the federal public service. Thirty billion dollars is not 
peanuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a surplus of $14.9 billion for the public 
service, $2.4 billion for the RCMP and $12.9 billion for the 
Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is wondering. Earlier I was saying that they want 
to do psychological studies to find out why the employees of the 
federal public service are dissatisfied and are not working up 
to par. 
There were also reports explaining why Canadian forces members 
had so little motivation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the attitude of the President of the Treasury Board 
and his government, it is easy to understand why federal public 
servants, like members of the Canadian armed forces, are often 
unmotivated. They do not have a say in anything. Again, as I 
said earlier, this is the tyranny of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government imposes taxes, dips into funds, does as it 
pleases, continues to gag the opposition and keeps imposing 
working conditions on the whole public service. All this is very 
hard to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might understand if the government targeted people who enjoy 
a gold plated pension, but we are talking about public servants 
who, as retirees, have annual incomes of $9,400. 
Who did the government decide to target? It is these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had other options. It could have negotiated with 
its public service. It could have said “We realize that there 
are surpluses. Perhaps we could try to improve the plan. Instead 
of paying you $9,400, we may be able to give you up to $12,000”. 
The government could also have said to participants “There are 
surpluses. Therefore, we will give you a contribution holiday 
and you will not have to make contributions for a few years, so 
as to use up some of the surpluses. Afterwards, we will use the 
same contribution rates but, for a few years, you will not have 
to contribute”. However, this is not what the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It runs away with the $30 billion pot and then says “Now, we 
will put in place certain provisions, so that if this situation 
occurs again, we will be able to react more quickly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen when the $30 billion are gone and the federal 
public sector realizes, perhaps a few years from now—I hope not, 
but it could happen—that there is not enough in the plan to pay 
employees retiring in one, two or ten years?  The government 
will probably tell contributors that it is sorry but that its 
actuarial forecasts oblige it to take action, as it did with the 
CPP, where premiums were increased.  The same thing may well 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the government gets its hands on the surplus, contributors 
will probably be told that there are problems and that premiums 
are being increased. It is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of terms have been used in the House and I want to 
mention them again.  They are parliamentary. 
Everyone has avoided using unparliamentary language.  In my 
view, the parliamentary terms used so far are quite significant. 
They include making off with, siphoning off, raiding, 
controling, and swindling.  I think that they are all 
descriptive of this government's attitude towards its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to look at what this will mean.  Some of my 
constituents are listening today.  There is a military base in 
my riding with a large population of Canadian forces members. 
Members of the RCMP also live there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most retired members of these three groups receive an average 
pension of $9,400 a year.  It might be different for members of 
the RCMP because they earn a little more and therefore receive 
slighter higher pensions, but Canadian forces members are not 
extremely well paid and public sector blue collar workers in 
Saint-Jean are earning perhaps $30,000 or $32,000 a year and will 
receive a pension of $9,400 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about regional economy.  What will someone 
receiving $9,400 a year going to do with that amount? Spend it. 
There is no question of looking into investments, buying mutual 
funds and playing the stock market on an annual income of $9,400. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people spend their money in their own ridings, for 
housing, for clothing, for food and sometimes for a little 
outing. This is about all they can afford with $9,400. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, imagine what would happen if the government decided to 
upgrade pensions. These people could afford better housing and 
clothing, higher quality leisure activities, more travel. All 
that would strengthen the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in the case of the employment insurance fund I talked about 
earlier, the $6 billion to $7 billion stolen each year from the 
unemployed represent $21 million for the riding of Saint-Jean. 
This is not peanuts. Further more, if women had pay equity, they 
could spend more in their riding, and this would be over and 
above the $21 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people cannot increase their annual income with their 
retirement fund, this represents another loss for regional 
economies. The government is siphoning off money not only from 
the public service but also from the economy of the riding of 
Saint-Jean and other ridings in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was important to share these facts with the House. 
People often believe that the government is doing the right 
thing and taxpayers ask: “Will that affect me? Will Bill C-78 
affect me? NO, this will not affect me, but it will affect 
employees of the federal public service”. For instance, people 
who have a business, who sell houses or condos or have a grocery 
store should understand that the less money there is in ridings, 
the slower the economy will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, we raised questions about the government's management 
practices. 
There are even more questions when it comes to such matters as 
R&D and the procurement of goods and services.  This is one more 
thing that affects Quebec directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec contributes about 24% of the tax base, but when it comes 
to categories of expenditures that are important to Quebec, 
whether R&D or the procurement of goods and services, there is 
no more equity.  To give an example relating to R&D, in the 
Ottawa-Hull region, there are 43 research centres.  Of that 
number, 42 are in Ottawa, and 1 in Hull.  That strikes me as a 
pretty flagrant lack of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research centres are real generators of truly high-paying jobs. 
This is also true for the procurement of goods and services. 
The government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in 
Canada, which it would have to be, considering the size of its 
budget, but instead of encouraging the regional economy, there 
is a shortfall of several hundred million dollars in Quebec. 
That is a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that the rate of unemployment in Quebec is higher. 
What if the government decided to be fair where the procurement 
of goods and services are concerned?  It would buy more in 
Quebec and this would generate more employment.  But it has not 
done so.  It is penalizing Quebec as far as procurement of goods 
and services, and research and development, are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it is pocketing money from all the sources I have 
already referred to: transfer payments to the provinces, the 
employment insurance fund, pay equity, and its latest discovery, 
the public service pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to speak a bit about same sex spouses.  As I said two 
weeks ago, I think the government is treading on eggshells 
somewhat with this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the series of amendments concerning same sex partners, the 
government has decided to hold a free vote. I wonder if the 
government will hold a free vote this evening or whether it will 
oblige Liberal members who were not in agreement with this 
clause to vote in favour of it this evening. Some members have 
expressed very interesting points of view. I had mine, I 
expressed it and I put it into practice when I voted on the 
amendment as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is deplorable with this approach, these specificities and 
the provisions of the bill is that the government is going to 
force people to perhaps vote against their conscience. 
In my opinion, the government should have introduced a specific 
bill on same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec City, the government introduced a sort of omnibus 
bill, which will really allow, once and for all, a clean-up of 
regulations and laws in Quebec, because the courts are according 
more and more rights to same sex partners. We saw this again 
last week. Decisions are recognizing these people increasingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the problem here is that the government is resolving things 
piecemeal. This is not the first matter resolved in such a 
fashion. The other day I gave the example of native women who 
have no protection on an Indian reserve when a household is 
being broken up. 
Instead of settling the heart of the issue, the government 
introduces bills concerning natives, and women's lobbies want to 
introduce amendments to each of these bills to take into account 
the fact that these women are not protected on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is happening here. The government lacks courage. 
Instead of settling the heart of the problem, it is introducing 
legislation piecemeal. It just did so in Bill C-78, with all its 
attendant problems. Some people may agree with taking money from 
the funds, but they do not agree with there being same sex 
partners and vice versa. Some people may oppose the bill, but be 
in favour of measures for same sex partners. They are going to 
have to make a choice this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have resolved the fundamental issue, since 
this would have saved time for parliament. Indeed, every time a 
bill on economic matters comes before the House, some will say 
“We want same sex spouses to be specifically recognized in this 
bill”. The government is taking a piecemeal approach, instead of 
resolving the fundamental issue. I realize that this approach 
could take more time, because it is a moral issue. There could 
even be a free vote on this specific bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the time being, the government has decided not to 
use that approach. It is taking a piecemeal approach. There are 
members from both sides of the House who have spoken freely on 
the impact of the fact that, from now on, same sex spouses will 
be entitled to their deceased spouse's government pension. 
However, it may well be that, next year if not in a month or 
two, the government will introduce another bill dealing with 
economic matters, and lobbies for same sex spouses will come 
back and say “We want amendments on this”. We will once again be 
forced to have a debate on specific provisions, because the 
issue will not have been dealt with globally in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise another point. Recently, the government has been 
telling us “You know, we contribute 70% of the public service 
employees pension fund”. Obviously, one can use statistics to 
support any position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that, in the past two, three or four years, the 
government did contribute 70% of the money paid into the fund. 
However, if we look back further, we realize that, from 1924 to 
1998, the government's contribution to the employees' fund only 
amounted to 48% of the total. 
It wants to make off with 100% of the surplus, and that is what 
is particularly scandalous.  I think the government could have 
been more flexible with its unions and negotiated something more 
acceptable and equitable, instead of what it finally did. 
Having contributed 48% for 74 years, it decided to make off 
with, help itself to, siphon off 100% of the surplus.  It is an 
utter disgrace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I would like to turn to the example the government is 
setting for the private sector.  Last time, I mentioned 
internationally renowned financiers, now dead.  There was Robert 
Maxwell, a press baron in England.  He sailed the seven seas in 
a yacht financed by his own employees' pension plan.  It was 
scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people were all denounced by workers, those who know the 
value of the $15 or $20 dollars a week they hand over to the 
government or their employer to pay for a decent retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People know what it means to take $20 of what they earn every 
week and hand it over to the government.  They also know what it 
means when the government says it is going to help itself to the 
surplus.  They know that it is utterly unfair.  The government 
is setting a precedent.  It is going to send a message to 
employers, particularly those in the private sector.  They will 
be able to say that, if there are any surpluses in their funds, 
they will be entitled to help themselves because the money 
belongs to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how this government, which makes laws and employs 
people, thinks.  It tells itself that, since it administers the 
plan, it will help itself to any surpluses.  The House should 
consider what this will mean in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last time, I spoke about who this attitude hurt most and I am 
going to do so again, because it is completely unfair.  I am 
referring to Singer employees. 
A few years ago, the Bloc Quebecois began to ask questions on 
this issue. This case was widely publicised. Many people believe 
that the issue has been settled, that the Singer employees won a 
victory and that $1.7 billion was shared between survivors. 
Almost half of the employees are now dead and their average age 
is 84. Yet people believe that the issue has been settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they do not know, and I want to repeat this today, is that 
between 1942 and 1967, the federal government was responsible, 
through government annuities, for the Singer employees' fund. 
The government, which was the watchdog of the retirement fund of 
the Singer employees, allowed that company to dip into the 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967, some $400,000 should have been paid back to employees 
as a bonus. The government decided otherwise. 
It allowed Singer to dip in the surplus. An amount of $400,000, 
in 1967 dollars, would be the equivalent of $6 million to $7 
million today, an amount which should belong to employees of 
Singer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what I am talking about, because my father worked for 
Singer for 45 years. He is now retired and gets government 
annuities, an astronomical $20 a month. All this because the 
government allowed a company to walk away with the jackpot under 
the cover of a holiday on premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we understand, with Bill C-78, why the government of the 
day acted that way. Three different human resources development 
ministers told us “This is not our fault, we deny any 
responsibility and we do not want to pay.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994-1995, the Bloc started asking questions about Singer. 
What was happening at the time? The federal public service 
pension funds were starting to generate a surplus. There were 
surely some mean-spirited people in the government who decided 
that they were not about to recognize their responsibility and 
reimburse former Singer employees. “Because we allowed Singer to 
stop paying premiums, we cannot do that. If the surplus in our 
own pension plan, in the federal public service pension plan, 
continues to grow, we will have to get our hands on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, realize that the first victims were 
the Singer workers. But they were only the first victims, 
because there will be many more to come. The government is 
paving the way for all private employers, by sending them the 
message that they will be able to get their hands on any 
surpluses they have. 
You have to agree that this sets a precedent. Of course, we are 
also talking about federally regulated funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I took part in a show about Bill C-78. People told me 
that, under the provincial legislation, provincially regulated 
employers acting this way would probably go to jail or pay huge 
fines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers who have some kind of link with the federal government 
will feel they no longer have their hands tied. 
Who will benefit from this bill, the employers or the workers? 
Who gives money to this irresponsible and arrogant government? 
Is it the low income workers or retirees who receive $9,000 a 
year? No. It is the large corporations, the big banks, the large 
insurance companies, the huge multinationals, those who refuse 
contributions when we ask for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tell them, “The Bloc Quebecois needs money, but you have to 
give us a personal cheque”. That does not work. People from Bell 
Canada tell me, “Look, Mr. Bachand, every time you organize a 
cocktail party, we have a cheque for you”. But it is a cheque 
from Bell, and we can only accept personal cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks tell me the same thing. 
Whose interests is this government defending? I think it is 
defending the interests of the banks, of insurance companies, of 
Bell. In the report of the chief electoral officer, I see that 
Bell Canada gives $50,000 or $60,000 to the Liberal Party, and 
the same goes for Nortel. The Bloc Quebecois gets absolutely 
nothing. Who is the government favouring with a bill such as the 
one before us today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To whom is the government saying that, from now on, they will be 
able to use any surplus in their pension plan? To the big banks 
whose profits already total $6 or $7 billion a year, to the big 
multinationals such as Bell Canada, which will probably have a 
surplus of $1 billion this year, after having just laid off 
about a thousand employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers and the retirees are beginning to understand who 
really defends their interests in the Parliament of Canada. It 
is the members of the Bloc Quebecois and those who will oppose 
this bill today. 
Those who will agree with this bill are government members, and 
those who will congratulate the government are big banks, 
insurance companies and multinationals. They can at last see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those corporate interests, billions of dollars in profit 
each year are never quite enough. If there are a few extra 
billions to be made at the expense of workers or retirees, they 
will not say no. They are quite willing to grab their employees' 
pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of terrible precedent the government is 
setting. I hope the workers and the retirees will understand 
that the $20 they have contributed every week for years will not 
be used to help them in their retirement, but for something 
else. 
I hope people will remember this when the time comes to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to the financing of political parties. 
For the Bloc Quebecois, money should not be a factor in a 
democracy, and we should abide by the principle of one person, 
one vote. I once told big companies like Bell they could keep 
the $500 cheque they were handing to me. I will never have my 
hands tied by big multinationals. Those who vote for the Bloc 
Quebecois are workers, retirees who have a hard time making ends 
meet, people in trouble and people who are persecuted by the 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a very good position, because we will never want to 
become cabinet ministers. The Bloc Quebecois will never want to 
become the government. I think voters do understand who is in a 
better position to speak on their behalf. 
Is it the government party, which accepts cheques from major 
corporations, or is it the small parties, the ones sensitive to 
workers? These parties will collect $5 or $10 on far flung 
concession roads or hard to reach streets.  We do not have our 
hands tied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we can say the sort of thing we are saying today. 
This is why today we can tell the government that it is 
arrogant, ill-advised, excessively appropriating money, 
incapable of managing public finances in a reasonable fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that these workers support us with their $5 and $10 
contributions allows me to say what I am saying today to this 
government. I think people will be grateful to us and, when the 
time comes to make a democratic choice, it will be one person, 
one vote, but all of these votes in Quebec will mean that the 
Bloc Quebecois will be back for the next election, should we 
decide to come back.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be very brief because the member for Winnipeg North Centre 
is very anxious to give a long speech in the House today and I 
want to share my time with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very important bill before the House today, Bill C-78, 
which deals with the pension funds and superannuation of retired 
public servants, including the RCMP and the armed forces. It has 
become a very controversial bill because the government wants to 
use the $30 billion surplus that has accumulated in those funds 
to go back into the consolidated revenue fund or to the 
Government of Canada so it can pay down the debt or use for its 
general operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that this is really theft of a lot of money that the 
federal government has collected in pensions.  It should go for 
pension purposes for retired public servants in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I hear a Liberal member on the other 
side saying nonsense.  I wish he would get up in the House and 
make a speech about this and face his constituents who are 
concerned about the government taking $30 billion of their money 
and using it for general revenue purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They cannot spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  A Liberal member is saying that they 
cannot spend it.  This is very revealing.  Maybe he should talk 
to retired public servants, retired RCMP officers and retired 
military personnel in the country.  The Liberal government is 
saying that they cannot spend it, that they have too much money 
and that they cannot have higher pensions.  The government says 
the Canada pension is better indexed.  It says retirees cannot 
spend the money so it is going to take the money from them and 
use it for other purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a Liberal member revealing in the House today that these 
retired pensioners cannot spend the money.  I hope our pensioners 
understand that the Liberals' position is that pensioners cannot 
spend the money so it will take it use it for other purposes. 
That is a very revealing statement.  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that 
you, as a very non-partisan officer of the House, would be 
scandalized to get up in your place and comment on a question 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear laughter from across the way.  The Liberals are 
embarrassed to hear this Liberal member from Hamilton saying that 
they cannot spend the money.  What has been said today is very 
revealing.  It is more revealing than when the minister got up 
and read a prepared and scripted text written by bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make three points.  The first point is that the 
government has really held the pensioners in the country in 
contempt by not having a proper public hearing on this bill 
today.  It is a very major step and a major initiative.  There 
should have been very extensive public hearings so pensioners 
could have had a say in what was happening to their money.  If we 
had a parliamentary democracy that was worth writing home about, 
the pensioners would have had a say.  However, that is not the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed an article in the paper awhile ago by a very 
distinguished journalist, Doug Fisher.  He said that the 
government was really holding the pensioners and the opposition 
parties in contempt.  He said that the government was ignoring 
the parliament of the country by bringing in closure to force the 
bill through the House of Commons.  I gather the Prime Minister 
will designate this as a confidence vote forcing Liberal 
backbenchers to vote with the government to make sure this is 
railroaded through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for serious parliamentary change so some of 
the Liberals across the way, who do have some independent, free 
thinking minds, can get up and speak their minds and their piece 
on this.  It is about time we had that kind of parliamentary 
reform and change, but that has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later today the Prime Minister will use his power and his whips 
to make sure that Liberal trained seals on the backbenches get up 
and vote yes in favour of Bill C-78.  That really is a tragedy 
and a shame in terms of our parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many Liberals across the way, like the member from 
downtown Toronto, are hanging their heads in shame because they 
cannot get up and speak their piece.  All they can do is laugh at 
the plight of the pensioners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember back in 1985 when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney tried 
to partially de-index old age pensions.  There was a huge 
demonstration on Parliament Hill and grey power across the 
country organized rapidly.  A little woman, Madam Denis, went up 
to the prime minister and said to him in French “You lied to us. 
Vous avez menti”.  The people forced the largest majority 
government in the history of this country, which I believe had 
211 seats and was sitting at over 50% in the polls, to back down. 
That government is not here today and one of the reasons is 
because of what it tried to do to seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Liberal government that if it wants to take a leaf 
out of Brian Mulroney's book it is well on its way to alienating 
a lot of Canadians, a lot of seniors in this country.  That is 
one point I wanted to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I want to make concerns the investment board 
which will be set up to invest part of the money in the fund.  We 
have discovered that there will not be any ethical screening of 
those investments.  For example, the Canada pension plan now has 
an investment board which invests about 15% of CPP funds in the 
stock market.  That investment is made in accordance with the TSE 
300 Index, which means that some of the money is going into 
Imasco which owns Imperial Tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imperial Tobacco is a company which is encouraging young people 
to smoke and become addicted to cigarettes.  I think that 
contravenes a stated public policy of the Government of Canada, 
including the Minister of Health, that we are encouraging people 
to stop smoking.  We are aiming campaigns at children to 
encourage them to stop smoking.  On the other hand the Canada 
pension plan is tying part of its future success to kids who 
smoke by buying shares in Imperial Tobacco.  I think that is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Finance is committed to look at that 
in terms of the Canada pension plan.  I wish the minister in 
charge of this bill would also take a look at whether we should 
bring in ethical screening in terms of the investments board's 
investments when it comes to the superannuation of retired public 
servants.  I do not think it is right to invest pensioners' money 
in companies like Imperial Tobacco and indeed other companies 
which pollute our atmosphere, which use child labour in different 
parts of the world and which are irresponsible socially and 
ethically.  I would urge the government to amend this bill to 
bring in ethical investment guidelines.  I would certainly 
support an amendment to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support a bill that is going to take $30 billion away 
from the pensioners of this country, but we could certainly 
improve the bill.  That is what parliamentary democracy is all 
about, suggesting ideas and policies to make legislation better. 
However, again the trained seals across the way are going to vote 
in accordance with the Prime Minister's wishes.  The member from 
the central part of Toronto, the member from Spadina, wants to be 
a cabinet minister, so he is not going to alienate the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had some serious democratic reform in the House the member 
from Spadina could propose an amendment to bring in ethical 
screening of the investments made by the investment board.  That 
is what we should be doing in this case and in other cases as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the whole question which has become 
controversial with some Liberal backbenchers, which is that the 
benefits will apply to people in conjugal relationships.  The 
issue that is raised time and again is, are the rights of gays 
and lesbians to be treated the same as people in common law 
relationships.  I certainly support that thrust of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear that we should be treating people 
equally in this country, regardless of sexual orientation or 
personal circumstances.  Therefore, I would appeal to Liberal 
members who are in opposition to that part of their own bill to 
support the thrust of the bill in terms of equality of people 
whether they are living in a common law relationship or whether 
they are gays and lesbians living in that type of relationship as 
well.  That is very important.  There was a supreme court 
decision very recently and I think we are making progress in that 
general area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say once again that I am discouraged closure was 
brought in on this bill.  I was very dismayed to hear a Liberal 
member say in the House today that seniors do not need the $30 
billion, that they could not spend it anyway.  The member from 
Hamilton said “They could not spend it anyway”. <I>Hansard</I> 
will indicate that is exactly what he said from his seat on the 
far left-hand side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe there should have been proper parliamentary 
hearings and discussions.  There should have been hearings with 
retired military personnel, retired government workers and the 
RCMP over the direction of this bill and what to do with the 
money in the fund. 
That has not happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was interested in my colleague's speech.  As usual he 
was very articulate.  We can tell who has been in the House for a 
while and who knows the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about something the member alluded to, which is 
the complicity of government members in the House.  Instead of 
holding the government to account he said that they simply act 
like trained seals, and I could not disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee this morning there were votes on estimates without 
any discussion or examination of the merits of these huge 
expenditures of money, and yet government members did not even 
want discussion.  They just said “Yes, we will pass it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this member's perspective, and I know he has been in the 
House a long time, even though he and I might not agree on some 
issues I think we both have a real concern about accountability 
and about the oversight function of members of parliament into 
the way the business of the country is run.  I would like him to 
comment further on his perspective over the years about erosion. 
Perhaps there never was an oversight function in a meaningful way 
by members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how we got so far down this road where 
essentially what we do in the House has no meaning and has almost 
no bearing on what the government does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think there has been a 
real move toward executive government in the last 20 or 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected in 1968.  Of course, I was about 12 years 
old then.  I remember the great debate in 1969 when there was a 
move to take estimates off the floor of the House of Commons. The 
argument of the opposition in those days—the opposition leader 
was Mr. Stanfield, our leader was Tommy Douglas and Réal Caouette 
was the leader for the créditiste movement—was that the 
committees of the House must be strengthened to bring 
accountability to the committees of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House sat until the end of July.  It was a debate that went 
on and on into the hot days and evenings of the summer of 1969. 
Of course that never happened.  The Trudeau government rammed 
through the legislation in the end and we have the committees as 
we know them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember 1984 when the Liberal Party came back with 40 
some members after its great defeat at the hands of Brian 
Mulroney.  In opposition those members started to talk a lot more 
about bringing in accountability.  They wanted better 
parliamentary democracy, fewer confidence votes, more free votes 
and other things about which a lot of us are concerned.  However, 
once they were elected again in 1993 they sort of forgot about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that the government across the way has had a 
majority for five years.  It received 38% of the vote in one of 
the lowest turnouts in the history of the country when 67% of the 
people in the last election voted.  When we take 38% of the 67%, 
it is sitting there with well under a third, probably a quarter 
of the Canadian people who have endorsed the government, and yet 
it has this awesome power of a majority and it cracks the whip 
all the time to make sure it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of what I mean.  The other place, which 
we call the Senate, wants an increase of $5 million in its budget 
this year.  It is, by definition, not elected, not accountable 
and not democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have checked with the procedural experts in your office, Mr. 
Speaker.  No minister is responsible for the Senate.  There is no 
one across the way who can answer on behalf of the Senate.  If no 
minister is responsible for the Senate, therefore the government 
is not responsible for the Senate and therefore if one votes 
against the estimates of the Senate it is not a motion of 
non-confidence in the government across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be having votes on the estimates, probably on June 9, 
and we will see the cracking of the whips as the Prime Minister 
deems the vote on the Senate estimates to be a matter of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest polls indicate that about 5% of Canadians support the 
existing Senate and 95% do not.  Some Canadians want the Senate 
to be abolished, some want it to be reformed.  That is not part 
of the argument.  Five per cent of the people support the 
existing Senate, and yet the Prime Minister will crack the whips 
and deem that to be a confidence vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is the best example of the need for radical 
parliamentary change to make this place democratic, meaningful 
and accountable to the Canadian people.  It is actually quite 
embarrassing to vote for $5 million to be given to an institution 
which only 5% of the Canadian people want, especially when it 
will be deemed a confidence vote by the Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-78 and to follow the words of my esteemed colleague, the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle, who has served this House and the 
Canadian public for some 28 years.  I consider it a privilege to 
work with someone with that experience, who has made an 
incredible contribution not only for his own constituents but for 
Canadians everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed, despite these 28 years of service, that my NDP 
colleague for Regina—Qu'Appelle used the word theft.  That word 
was not singled out as being unparliamentary, but I understand it 
could be borderline and it is not an appropriate word to use. 
However, I think that word, if we were able to say it out loud in 
this place, would best characterize what we are dealing with when 
it comes to Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of an issue I dealt with as a member of the 
legislative assembly of Manitoba in 1988 when we were dealing 
with serious and drastic cutbacks to our child care system 
engineered by the then Conservative government.  I had been 
working with many groups trying to deal with and stop these 
cutbacks.  My son, who is 10 years old today, was about 2 at the 
time and, having heard all of this talk from me about government 
cutbacks, proceeded to announce to the world that the 
Conservative government had come to his daycare and stolen all 
the money.  Out of the mouths of babes come words of truth and 
wisdom.  I think that is exactly what we are dealing with today. 
I wish I could say those words that would best epitomize just 
what Bill C-78 means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address a couple of points today along the lines of 
the remarks of my colleague for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  The first 
has to do with the arbitrary, undemocratic way in which the 
government is handling this piece of legislation and the way it 
has approached just about every piece of legislation in this 
entire parliamentary session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the times I have spoken in the House, and there have been 
a good number in the last couple of years, on just about every 
occasion I and my colleagues have been forced to deal with the 
issue of closure.  Whenever a bill is presented to this House, 
debate starts to take off and the public starts to get 
interested, what does the government do?  The government brings 
down the heavy instrument of closure, time allocation.  I know my 
colleague from the Reform Party touched on this in her question 
about what has changed in our democracy and what has gone wrong. 
I think the trend is clear and worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand from some reports that closure was a very rarely 
used tool.  Between Confederation and 1956 it was only used half 
a dozen times.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare that to how many times the government has brought 
in closure in the last two years.  If my count is up to date, 
time allocation has been brought in 12 to 14 times in the space 
of two years.  This is an incredible development, an incredible 
attack on our rights in the Chamber and on the whole notion of 
democracy.  Is it any wonder Canadians are cynical and skeptical 
about politicians and about our democratic institutions when this 
kind of process is allowed to take place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those sentiments are best described in a letter that was 
sent to the Kitchener-Waterloo <I>Record</I> by David Crow, a 
retired airline pilot: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is nothing more than autocracy masquerading as democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians now live in what can only be described as a benign 
dictatorship where policy decisions concerning their future are 
made behind closed doors.  Amid the pomp and tradition of 
parliament lies a system which has become fractious, insensitive, 
remote and elitist.  The antiquated system no longer has the 
support of most Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope we would hear those words and understand and 
appreciate that if we are to renew people's faith in democracy, 
in parliament and in participatory democracy, surely we have to 
address what is happening in the Chamber and the shocking way in 
which the government has been so arbitrary and dictatorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will remember the kind of anger the present 
House leader of the Liberal government displayed when the 
Conservatives brought in closure in their time in government.  He 
went on a rampage about this tactic and actually said  “Shame on 
those Tories across the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the situation is much more serious.  We say to the House 
leader and to all other members of the Liberal government, shame 
on them for bringing in closure so many times whenever there is 
an important issue before the House and whenever we need to hear 
from Canadians and value their input in order to put before the 
public the very best possible legislation.  It is with regret 
that once more we are dealing with that issue and we will 
continue to speak out on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point I want to make is on the problems we have with 
the legislation on a substantive basis.  I do not need to repeat 
all the arguments we have heard from the NDP on this issue time 
and time again.  We are absolutely opposed to the bill which 
grabs $30 billion in pension surplus to be used at the discretion 
of the government, whether that be in general revenue or any 
other expenditure it chooses.  We have registered time and time 
again our concern with that arbitrary move on the part of the 
government and with its failure to reach some sort of agreement 
with all the different organizations involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said time and time again how important it is to 
honour and respect the contribution senior citizens have given to 
the country.  The bill does the opposite.  As my colleague from 
Regina said, it is holding pensioners in contempt by not 
recognizing their contribution and working out an arrangement to 
ensure the surplus is put to the best possible use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have commented on how it is so ironic that the bill is 
before the House at the same time as the government is 
participating in this year's UN's international year of the older 
person, a year intended to mark the contributions of our senior 
citizens, to recognize their achievements and to create 
intergenerational respect and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not ironic that we are dealing with a bill which does the 
opposite?  At the same time we are trying to celebrate the 
international year of older persons which has been called 
“Canada:  A Society for All Ages”.  That is the height of 
hypocrisy which must be clearly noted in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues asked whether in looking for a reasonable 
approach to pension surplus the actual level of poverty among 
some of our senior citizens was considered and in particular the 
fact that older women were among the poorest of all poor.  It was 
pointed out in earlier debate that a woman who served in the 
civil service for 20 years ended up with about $9,600 a year in 
retirement funds. 
The reallocation of this surplus toward people such as these 
women, the poorest of the poor in the country, would have made a 
big difference.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have much more I would like to say, but I urge all members of 
the House to oppose Bill C-78 which takes $30 billion out of the 
pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from Regina did, I urge members on the 
Liberal side to reconsider their opposition to the bill on the 
basis that it is supporting a recognition of rights for people 
regardless of sexual orientation.  We certainly support that 
provision but seriously and strongly oppose Bill C-78. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is ironic to watch the NDP and the 
Reform Party being on the same side of issue after issue.  They 
pretend they are far away but whenever it gets to extremes we can 
see how they are closely tied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again it is ironic to see that the NDP supports many parts 
of the bill yet is voting against issues for which it has fought 
for many years.  The Reform Party's whole existence is about 
pension reform, the economy and money to taxpayers.  All of a 
sudden there is $30 billion that belongs to the taxpayers and it 
is voting against the bill.  It is amazing to watch the two join 
hands in the true western approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Of course it does.  I was talking about 
the member from Regina who is always talking about amalgamating 
with the Reform and uniting the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Give me one quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Oh, come on.  You guys are on the same 
side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  There they go, Mr. Speaker.  Is it not 
something really funny when we see the Reform and the NDP joining 
hands?  I think it is the most comical of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP, after working for so many years on some of the issues 
we have put forward, says that it wants public debate.  When we 
were doing it in committee there was the CLC convention in 
Toronto so NDP members had to go there.  However to pensioners 
and the union it says it is concerned about this issue and about 
the money.  Where were the NDP when we were listening to the 
concerns of people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the concern is so great in the NDP, why was it not there when 
those people were present to state their case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me respond to 
the hon. member's initial comment about inconsistencies in the 
NDP and the fact that on some occasions there seems to be some 
unity on the opposition benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should realize that when that unity happens, 
when we speak with one voice, it is always when the government 
presents us with the most arbitrary, underhanded, undemocratic 
process imaginable.  That is what unites us, because we are all 
here banding for a parliament that is in touch with the wishes of 
Canadians and operates on a democratic basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing inconsistent about the NDP's position.  We have 
said from day one that we must always look for co-operative 
solutions to any problem before us.  On the issue of pension 
surplus we have always said there was a process in place.  It was 
working.  It could have been carried to its logical conclusion. 
The government did not have to be so precipitous, bring in Bill 
C-78 and just take that $30 billion to use according to its own 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always stood in this place and have spoken out against 
abuse of power.  That is what we are doing today.  It happens 
that other members on the opposition benches share that concern 
because it is so fundamental to democracy.  We have always been 
there to participate every step of the way.

for any kind of extended committee hearings across the country so 
that Canadians everywhere would have a chance to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the member look in the mirror and see how his 
government could have improved the process so that all Canadians 
could have participated on a meaningful basis.

rise today to pay tribute to Hugh Hanrahan, former MP for 
Edmonton—Strathcona who served here from 1993 to 1997.  He 
passed away in Edmonton on Wednesday, May 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh grew up in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, one of five boys in the

education degree from Saint Francis Xavier University and his 
master's in education from the University of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He moved to Calgary for his first teaching job but settled in 
Edmonton soon after.  He taught with Edmonton Catholic schools 
for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was awarded a teacher of the year award for his devotion to 
increasing high school students' knowledge of economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Hugh's health prevented him from running for a second 
term in office so he returned to teaching, what he was most 
comfortable with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh also had a great pride in his Irish and Scottish roots.  He 
especially enjoyed spending summers in Nova Scotia with his 
family because he loved the seaside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugh is survived by his wife Dianne, daughter Margaret Anne and 
four brothers.  We would like the family to know that all of us 
are thinking of them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Four out of five missing children are runaways.  Most are 
running away from abusive situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has abandoned these children.  They have 
abandoned social housing and cut funding for youth drop-in centres 
and shelters for abused children. Programs like these identify 
and help troubled youth.  Their loss leaves youth with nowhere to 
turn.  It is no wonder so many are ending up on the streets.  The 
lucky ones might end up begging for change or squeegeeing car 
windows.  The unlucky ones fall victim to drugs or prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the House unanimously approved an NDP motion calling on 
the federal government to eliminate child poverty by the year 
2000.  The Liberal government voted in favour of this motion 
while in opposition, but in government the Liberals have made the 
problem worse.  Children are their helpless victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP is working hard to find missing children but it is up 
to the federal government to attack the problem at its source. 
It is time for a government that cares about children.

This collective effort is proof that there are undeniable 
economic, political and cultural ties with Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The collaboration of the federal government ought to have been a

We would have preferred not to have had to read an editorial in 
the major Mexican newspaper <I>Universal</I> that the Prime Minister of 
Canada had been wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This episode has done nothing to prevent the trade mission from 
paving the way to a new and unprecedented openness between

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should not have pursued a disengagement policy.  Canada

taking a leadership role, Canada can help soothe the relationship

otherwise the situation is a conflict in waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other countries, including the U.S., China and France have 
talked with India and Pakistan, but not Canada.  By not sitting

<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is another Liberal link in the tainted blood scandal.  The 
finance minister was a director of a crown corporation, Canada 
Development Corporation, from 1981 to 1986.  During that time one 
of CDC's companies, Connaught Laboratories, imported tainted 
blood from U.S. prisons in spite of warnings from the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. The finance minister should have been 
aware of these dealings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister release any minutes or documents from 
relevant board meetings of Connaught and CDC and if not, why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, this is the very first question 
we have had.  I would ask all hon. members to keep in mind that 
whatever questions are asked in the House must go to the 
administrative responsibility of the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the Minister of Finance was a director of CDC 
until 1986 when he resigned.  I do not know if the minutes from 
this company can be made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making a statement like that, the opposition is reaching very 
far in trying to attack and punish the Minister of Finance who is 
very well known for his integrity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
all of that is absolutely true then he should have no trouble 
clearing the air on this once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister was a member of cabinet when we were 
debating compensation packages for hepatitis C victims.  This 
package happened to leave out victims of tainted blood between 
1981 and 1986.  Coincidentally, those are the very same years 
that the finance minister sat on the board of that crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the finance minister excuse himself from all cabinet 
meetings that dealt with money and compensation packages for 
hepatitis C victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Connaught Labs was the subsidiary of a subsidiary of the 
CDC.  In each case Connaught Labs, and in fact the parent 
subsidiary, had its own board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government director, who was on the CDC board and the most 
knowledgeable about this, said that this was not the kind of 
thing that would have come to the CDC board.  He also has no 
recollection of it coming to the CDC board.  I have no 
recollection of this particular matter coming to the CDC board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be delighted to have whatever papers could be made 
available to be made available. I have asked my officials to look 
at our papers but at the present time we have found nothing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure the minister realizes that he could have been in a very 
serious conflict of interest position here.  We want that cleared 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, he was a director of a crown corporation that 
was profiting from selling tainted blood to thousands of 
Canadians who were poisoned.  On the other hand, he was the 
minister holding the purse strings for the government at that 
same time when it was coming up with a compensation package for 
hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than the finance minister saying “I'm a little 
surprised” or “I'm just not sure”, if he has absolutely 
nothing to hide, when will he release every document available to 
him so he can wash his hands of this once and for all? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has indicated that if there are 
any relative papers he will be happy to make them public. He 
explained very well the link between Connaught and CDC.  CDC was 
a company of the government so the minister could not have any 
personal interest in it.  For the opposition to reach that far 
into the past to try to find something against the minister who 
was doing his job properly makes a mockery of democracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the association 
is not nearly as tenuous as the finance minister said.  CDC owned 
Connaught 100%.  It did not have a hands-off relationship with 
Connaught.  There were major significant dealings going on in 
those days.  For instance, Connaught lost the Red Cross licence 
in those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the finance minister remember that tiny little detail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the answer to the question is no.  I do not remember 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CDC director, the most knowledgeable and nominated by the 
government, has said that he had no recollection of this matter 
ever being discussed at the CDC board which was the only board on 
which I happened to sit.

representatives, with the funeral taking place 22 hours after 
his father's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was ready to answer questions from the press.  There were

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

appointed this officer to look into the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, we decided there might be some problems and we 
needed a commissioner who would report to the House of Commons 
once a year.  Each year in office he has given us the report we 
asked for.  He is making recommendations and every department 
will make sure it has been studied and the corrections made.  It 
was an initiative of this government that permitted the

Mr. Speaker, the government's approach to expropriating 
provincial land in Nanoose, B.C. resembles that of a 
dictatorship.  It is giving the appearance of negotiating in good 
faith only to use a sledgehammer to enforce its will when 
negotiations fail.  This approach can only be viewed as 
threatening to all provinces that dare oppose the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of fisheries said two weeks ago that he wanted to 
give B.C. every opportunity to reach an agreement yet two days 
later the government moved to expropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Prime Minister is what took place in those 
two days after the negotiations that caused the breakdown?  Why 
is the government exercising extreme measures in the imposition 
of its will on this matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

two years, since the British Columbia government indicated its 
concern and said that it would cancel the lease at Nanoose Bay, a 
vital defence facility.  We have been attempting to resolve this 
matter and thought we were getting close.  We were offering a lot 
more than the property was worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the 11th hour the B.C. government threw in this red

When did native rights and provincial jurisdiction become so

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is abusing its powers to expropriate B.C. 
land in Nanoose Bay so that the U.S. navy can bring nuclear 
warheads into the Strait of Georgia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

there would never be testing of nuclear weapons now or ever in 
Nanoose Bay.  That is absolutely illogical and the hon. member 
knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to nuclear weapons being aboard any of the 
U.S. vessels that come into the area, it is the policy of the 
U.S. government not to do that.  However, it is also its policy 
not to identify whether there are nuclear weapons on any 
particular ship in any particular location in the world.  It does 
that as a deterrent, as a general policy.  We have understood 
that for 34 years.  There has never been any problem and there 
will not be.

is not something that we want to do.  We did not want to do it in 
this particular case.  We only did it because the Government of 
British Columbia gave us no choice.  It would not negotiate.

carriers often earn less than the minimum wage and in working 
conditions reminiscent of another era.  Subsection 13(5) of the 
Canada Post Corporation Act prohibits RRMCs from having 
collective bargaining rights.  This denial of basic rights helps 
Canada Post keep the wages and working conditions of RRMCs at an 
unfair level and discriminates against rural workers. Therefore

<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will 
be answering Question No. 169 today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 169—<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each of the past five years: (<I>a</I>) how many gun smugglers 
and illegal gun traffickers have been (i) identified, (ii) 
prosecuted and (iii) convicted in Canada; (<I>b</I>) in each case, how 
many illegally-possessed firearms were recovered; (<I>c</I>) in each 
case, how many of these firearms were categorized as either 
prohibited, restricted or unrestricted; (<I>d</I>) in each case, how 
many of these firearms were previously registered; and (<I>e</I>) in 
each case, prior to the offence, how many of these individuals 
had ever applied for or registered a firearm? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  I am informed as 
follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Canada: Data pertaining to the number of gun smugglers 
and illegal gun traffickers who have been identified, prosecuted 
and convicted in Canada, the number and categories of recovered 
illegally-possessed firearms, as well as the registration related 
information are not available from the police and law enforcement 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, smuggling is an offence under the Customs Act.  The 
enforcement of this act and seizure of firearms pursuant to it 
falls exclusively under the jurisdiction of Revenue Canada, 
Customs and the RCMP, Customs and Excise Division.  This 
provision under the Customs Act is not specific to firearms, it 
includes all commodities.  Prior to December 1, 1998 the 
implementation date of the new Firearms Act, Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons, first session, 35th 
Parliament, the only authority under which the other police and 
law enforcement agencies could seize firearms was the Criminal 
Code offence of illegal possession.  Since that offence is all 
inclusive, the police and law enforcement communities records 
pertaining to illegal possession seizures do not specify 
smuggling or trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among various other measures, the new firearms legislation 
created new offences and strict penalties for firearms smuggling 
and trafficking, provided controls for the import and export of 
firearms and created bans on many firearms with no legitimate 
use.  The newly created offences empower the police and law 
enforcement agencies to pursue smuggling and trafficking charges 
specifically related to seized firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firearms licensing and registration system is the foundation 
for all of these enforcement and regulatory measures.  In 
addition to the licensing and registration system, there will be 
a registry maintained containing specific information pertaining 
to all firearms seized or recovered by law enforcement agencies. 
The provision in the legislation which requires police and law 
enforcement agencies to report all seized and recovered firearms 
is scheduled to come into effect in 2001.  The gathering of such 
information on a national basis will provide administrative and 
investigative assistance to the law enforcement community and 
will provide the ability to more easily extract information 
pertaining to types of offences, specifics of the firearms 
recovered or seized, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada: The Department of National Revenue has no data 
with respect to parts (a), (d) and (e) of the question.  However, 
the following chart provides data related to seizures of firearms 
categorized as either prohibited, restricted or unrestricted that 
the Department of National Revenue carried out during the years 
1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While data is provided with respect to seizures of firearms, the 
persons from whom the firearms were seized cannot be identified 
as either gun smugglers or illegal gun traffickers as these 
seizures of firearms could have been from individuals who failed 
to declare they had a firearm in their possession or in their 
vehicle when they entered Canada.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NANOOSE, BRITISH COLUMBIA 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am in receipt of a notice of motion for an 
emergency debate under Standing Order 52 from the hon. member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have his letter.  Would he care to tell us what it is all 
about precisely and in just a few words?  I ask him not to read 
the whole letter but just to tell us what it is all about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to summarize it, as we heard in Oral Question Period the federal 
government has commenced expropriation proceedings in British 
Columbia.  It claims it has been in negotiations for two years. 
This is unprecedented.  I submit it would set an extremely 
dangerous precedent in Canada to allow this without even having 
some discussion here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge none of the opposition parties received any 
information from the government.  We have no idea what 
negotiations have gone on.  This would allow us an opportunity to 
question the government and find out what has been going on. 
This would be an extremely dangerous precedent that would open 
the doors for expropriations in other parts of Canada in an area 
where we do not want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government sought ownership of this land through the Supreme 
Court of Canada in 1984.  It was rejected then.  The court ruled 
that it was under the ownership of British Columbia in the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit, given all that, that an emergency debate would 
be appropriate so we can have an opportunity to find out what in 
fact the government has been doing to avoid this expropriation 
and what discussions have gone on with the province of British 
Columbia.  To date we have had zero information from the 
government with respect to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-78, an 
act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to 
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise to speak to Bill C-78.  The government 
claims that the purpose of the legislation is to improve the 
financial management of the pension fund of federal public 
servants, the RCMP and the military.  We should be very skeptical 
when the government claims to be doing anything to improve the 
conditions of the federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has acted in an unprecedented manner in 
opposition to our public service and has created the lowest level 
of morale in the history of the public service in Canada.  There 
was the wage freeze our public servants have dealt with under the 
government. There was the back to work legislation and the 
government's refusal to utilize binding arbitration as a 
legitimate negotiating tool.  There was the incredible level of 
layoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there is the government's latest attack on the 
public service through the privatization of Revenue Canada and 
its attempts to create a new arm's length agency to administer 
the taxes of the country and take up to 40,000 public servants 
out of the public service.  It is part of a continued attack on 
the public service of our country and ultimately one that will 
imperil the public service and the quality of services received 
by Canadians from their public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not interested in improving the financial 
management of the pension funds of public servants.  The 
government is more interested in the cash windfall of $30 billion 
that it can take from the public service pension plan through the 
legislation.  The legislation provides the mechanisms through 
which the government can access that $30 billion.  The government 
is claiming that money will be used against the debt, but it is 
just a cash transfer on paper.  It is not an actual cash transfer 
in terms of money going from one program to another.  It is 
basically just a paper transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively what the government is doing, and it is quite 
cynical really, is taking this money and using a divide and 
conquer type of attack to pit federal public servants against 
Canadians at large by saying this money will go against the debts 
of Canadians at large.  It is ignoring the fact that this fund 
was created through contributions by the public service and the 
federal government into their pension plans and that this fund 
was created to protect the public servants and their pension 
plans against the risks of future deficits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT50"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT50"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly important given that part of the 
legislation will result in the pension being invested in private 
equity markets where there will be larger risks in the future. It 
is very important at this time when we are engaging in a 
potentially riskier investment strategy, which will provide a 
higher return ultimately.  With that higher risk which is 
commensurate with a higher return we need to ensure the 
appropriate surplus exists.  That $30 billion should be kept 
either within the public service pension plan or used to improve 
benefits for public servants who have had an unprecedented 
sustained attack by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is analogous to the federal government's EI fund strategy. 
The government has built a surplus since 1993 in the EI fund by 
maintaining unnecessarily high rates and at the same time 
slashing benefits.  The government has an insatiable appetite for 
cold cash and that seems to be the only explanation for the 
continued expropriation of the pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard of expropriation earlier in terms of land and the 
Nanoose Bay issue where the government has taken the same 
arrogant approach to the financial management of our country 
either with the EI fund or in this case the public service 
pension issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the EI issue, the government is maintaining an 
egregiously regressive tax on lower income Canadians.  For 
instance, a Canadian making $39,000 per year will pay the same 
amount of EI premiums in terms of total EI premiums and 
contributions as someone making $300,000.  The government is 
taking that money from lower and middle lower income Canadians 
and using it to subsidize other program spending.  It is simply 
not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the result is that through the 
government's slashing of benefits EI programs are only available 
to 30% of those who pay into them, even with the absolutely 
devastating seasonal unemployment in Atlantic Canada where the 
economy dictates that a significant part of employment is 
seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some agreement that the government has a legal right to 
the surplus.  If the government had a legal right to the surplus 
it would not need this legislation to access the surplus.  The 
government is in the position to implement legislation, to bring 
forward bills and legislation to change the rules whenever it 
wants, and that is exactly what it is doing.  The government does 
not have the ability to access the pensions of federal 
superannuates and federal public service pensions without the 
legislation.  The government is changing the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A private corporation does not have the ability to change the 
rules in this way.  In a private pension plan there are typically 
agreements between the corporation and the employees on the 
contribution rates over the period of time and on the benefits. 
If there is a surplus there is a set of guidelines which the 
corporation follows in the division of that surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that many years ago that a gentleman by the name of 
Robert Maxwell jumped off his boat or fell or something.  He 
faced an unfortunate demise off the side of his yacht.  A few 
weeks later it was public knowledge that for several years he had 
been taking from the pension plans of his employees, many of whom 
were left in tremendous financial straits due to the fact that he 
had been taking from their pension plan over a period of time. 
That is an example of what would happen if a company took this 
kind of approach to a private sector pension plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that this is a defined benefit plan, 
that the government has all the liabilities and that the people 
who pay into it do not have any of the liabilities.  As such the 
government is claiming that it would have the ability to do 
whatever it wants with it.  The government sometimes points to a 
deficit in the fund which existed in the mid-eighties and the 
fact that the government paid the deficit.  It was simply an 
accounting deficit that existed.  The government wiped it out. It 
used the offsetting interest income surplus to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit of a red herring when the government says that it 
paid off the deficit in this fund in the mid-eighties because in 
fact it used an offsetting interest income surplus to pay off 
that deficit.  What is particularly offensive is that the 
government is going against its own rules with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago that the Pension Benefits Standards 
Act, Bill S-3, was initiated in the Senate and passed by 
parliament.  It outlined the proper procedure for pension plans 
to deal with the issues of surplus in private sector pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were following these rules it would be 
behaving very differently than how it is actually behaving with 
the public service pension plan in Bill C-78.  The government has 
set a double standard.  It has one set of rules for the private 
sector and another set of rules for itself.  It is changing the 
rules as it goes to fit whatever short term or long term 
political goals it has as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could create a very dangerous precedent in that private 
sector corporations could seek to forgo the guidelines set forth 
by the government in Bill S-3 that were designed to protect both 
corporations and the people who pay into the pension plans. 
Private sector corporations could forgo the following of those 
guidelines and legitimately say that the government has broken 
its own rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, under Bill S-3, if a withdrawal takes place 
logically the plan members would expect to see a significant 
increase in benefits.  Typically it would be commensurate with 
the levels paid into the private sector pension plan based on the 
contribution rates.  For instance, if it were a 40:60 pay-in, 
with the employer paying in 60% and the employee paying in 40%, a 
withdrawal of 60% of the surplus would mean a commensurate 
increase of 40% in the benefits enjoyed by both current and 
future pension recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this is another example where the government is 
participating in an unprecedented level of hypocrisy.  It is 
asking the private sector to play by one set of rules and feels 
it can get away with playing by another set of rules which it is 
changing on an ongoing basis.  It is also a further example of 
the unadulterated attack on the public service in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has long been acknowledged that public sector workers have 
accepted in some cases below market wages in exchange for job 
security and fairly decent but well deserved pension plans.  Over 
time we have seen job security disappear from the public service. 
The wages in many cases are now far below those of the private 
sector.  One of the arguments the government uses for the 
privatization of Revenue Canada is that if Revenue Canada were 
privatized it would have the freedom to pay employees of Revenue 
Canada or the new Revenue Canada agency more competitively to 
compete with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is actually abdicating its responsibility for 
positive and constructive human resource management by saying 
that it cannot do that with the public service.  It is 
privatizing a huge arm of the government, Revenue Canada.  It 
refuses to deal with the systemic issues that are pervasive 
throughout the public service and is dealing with these issues 
with band-aid solutions that will create more problems in the 
long term.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately the morale of the public service is an issue that 
affects every Canadian.  The quality of services and the value we 
receive for our tax dollars depends largely on the quality of the 
work of our public service. The quality of the work of our public 
service depends on the morale of the public service.  There is a 
significant long term cost to Canadians whenever the government 
takes another attack on the public service.  We should take very 
seriously the long term impacts of this continued attack on the 
public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the anticipated premium increases for 
contributions to this plan which will increase from 7.5% of 
salary to as high as 11% of salary by 2010.  This means that 
public servants will be paying a higher and higher percentage of 
their salary into the plan over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the payroll deductions, or payroll taxes as some refer to 
them, continue to increase, it will become increasingly difficult 
to retain existing public servants and to attract young people, 
some of Canada's best and brightest to the public service.  They 
will be attracted to better paying jobs in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country needs a viable productive public service. Over time 
Canada has produced some exceptional accomplishments through our 
public service, as well as through the private sector.  If we 
talk to some of professors and administrators at the universities 
who teach public administration, we learn that the skills being 
taught in public administration courses are not dissimilar from 
many of the courses being taught in business schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a private sector background.  I was involved in 
small and medium size businesses.  I have an undergrad degree in 
business.  I enjoy the private sector.  I also have a public 
ethic which is why I am here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians who share the skills I have in terms of 
administrative abilities want to work within the public sector 
and have a public ethic.  They may not be as interested in the 
private sector. In a lot of cases these people study business and 
enter businesses but really they would rather work productively 
to create a better public service. We need a greater focus on 
attracting some of the best and brightest, not just to business, 
but also to a public service that Canadians and public servants 
can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has continued to reduce the quality of working 
conditions within the public service. Ultimately it will reduce 
the quality of services received by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the government is moving toward seeing 
that the funds within these pension plans will be invested in 
external financial markets.  I am concerned about some of the 
elements the government is going about doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to realize that the public service pension 
funds will represent in the not too distant future about $100 
billion.  The capitalization of the Toronto stock exchange is 
about $650 billion.  It does not take a lot of analysis to 
recognize that this potentially could have a huge impact on 
capital markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a perfect opportunity for the government to move 
in separate legislation to increase the foreign content limits 
for Canadian pension investments, not just within these types of 
public pensions but also within RRSPs.  Many people defend the 
current 20:80 rule on foreign content, that 80% of an RRSP for 
instance has to be invested domestically and only 20% can be 
invested offshore. Many proponents of that rule state it would 
have deleterious effects on the Canadian equities markets if we 
were to loosen that rule and allow Canadians to invest their own 
money offshore.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The influx of capital by the Canada pension plan and this public 
sector pension plan into Canadian equities markets represents a 
golden opportunity for the government to do what it really should 
do.  It should reduce and ultimately eliminate the foreign 
content rule.  I would suggest that up to 50% almost immediately 
should be allowed to be invested offshore so that Canadians can 
enjoy geographic diversification as part of their portfolios.  In 
this case public servants could enjoy the kind of return on 
investment that is provided by geographic diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that since 1993 the Dow Jones and other indices in 
the U.S. including Standard & Poor's, have far outstripped the 
growth in terms of equities that we have seen in the TSE.  The 
TSE has grown by about 60% since 1993.  During the same period of 
time the Dow Jones has appreciated by about 190% and the Standard 
& Poor's 500 has grown by around 180%. Wealth being a relative 
thing, Canadians are getting poorer while our neighbours to the 
south are actually getting richer. This is a brilliant 
opportunity. I hope the government moves aggressively to address 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is that the government has modelled the pension 
management board on the Canada pension plan investment board.  It 
has ignored some of the recommendations made in this House and in 
the other place.  A recommendation in the report relative to the 
Canada pension plan investment board from the banking committee 
in the other place said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Directors of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 
collectively have a broad range of experiences and expertise. 
While the benefits of appointing directors with proven financial 
ability are clear, the committee believes that a majority of the 
directors should have expertise in pension fund management and 
other relevant skills. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was very sound advice.  Pension fund management is a very 
specific art or science.  Someone who has managed a business may 
not necessarily be good at managing a pension fund.  Business 
experience is not the sole criteria by which we should judge fund 
managers.  This has been ignored by the government in this 
legislation and it continues to do its own thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not seeking constructive input from this House 
or the other place.  The government is not seeking legitimate 
public policy development.  The government is only seeking from 
this House, from parliament, a rubber stamping of the ideas and 
legislation it wants to implement.  This has to stop because the 
secular decline of the role of the parliamentarian will 
ultimately lead to the secular decline of democracy and its 
benefits to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank my colleague in the Conservative Party 
for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague how he interprets the way the finance 
minister has been able to go into the UI fund. The finance 
minister figured out that the government could go in there, and I 
know there are certain words we cannot use in this House but we 
can think about them, and find a way to use $25 billion paid by 
employers and employees.  The government did not put a cent into 
the UI fund, but it found a way to actually take it and use it 
for other things while we know that less than 40% of the 
unemployed qualify for UI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being members from the Atlantic region, we know the impact.  We 
know how many people right now are going without UI and without 
income.  Minimum wage is very low in New Brunswick.  Jobs are 
seasonal.  Unfortunately, when we have programs to help in 
developing jobs, we often get refused for government funding 
because only seasonal jobs are being created.  How can we try to 
create jobs in our region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government found a way to get $30 billion. That is $25 
billion and $30 billion which equals $55 billion that the 
government has its hands on.  It is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member is seeing what we are seeing, what the 
workers are seeing and what our brothers and sisters in the 
public service are seeing.  This money is being taken.  The 
government has found two pots. 
Let us face it.  The Minister of Finance is very creative in 
finding ways to get money that is not the government's and using 
it for its own purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also unfortunate that the President of the Treasury Board 
is refusing to recognize the inequality regarding pay equity. 
This is directly affecting the public service employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree with me that we sometimes have to 
question what the government is doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
the New Democratic Party for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that the government has taken the EI program and 
fund, which existed for the benefit of workers and employers to 
enhance labour market flexibility which benefits all Canadians 
and the economy, and has created what is really an EI tax.  Only 
30% of those who pay into the EI fund actually qualify to receive 
benefits.  As a result, 70% of that is an EI tax.  Only 30% of 
the contributions to the EI fund are actually EI premiums.  The 
government has taken an already complicated Canadian tax code and 
made it more complicated, less transparent and more confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through maintaining unnecessarily high EI premiums and slashing 
benefits at the same time, it has also created increased 
distortions.  For instance, one of the goals of tax reform should 
be to reduce the distortions taxes may have on a particular part 
of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has twice the unemployment rate of the U.S.  We should be 
seeking to reduce the cost of the labour input to encourage more 
companies to hire people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead by maintaining unnecessarily high premiums and by not 
developing more innovative programs, particularly in the areas of 
training and retraining, the government is denying labour market 
flexibility to Canadian companies and employees. That is 
absolutely unacceptable in a very competitive global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the government trend of delving into the EI fund for 
other types of spending or in terms of using the public service 
pension plan, which is what we are talking about directly with 
Bill C-78, the government is in the position where it can change 
the rules as it goes.  It can change the rules that will affect 
Canadians for decades while it is focused on its own limited 
goals which are focused on the next election. The impact of the 
next election and what the Liberals will be doing over the next 
couple of years to try to win that election could be very 
negative for Canadians for decades in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard it said that politics is the natural enemy of 
public policy.  I am afraid that in this case that is the case. 
The Liberals are changing the rules to suit their own short term 
political goals. They change the rules as they go. Unlike the 
private sector pension plans, where Bill S-3, the Pension 
Benefits Standards Act, sets out guidelines for the private 
sector by which the private sector is expected to abide, this 
government can actually change the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that there is nothing legally stopping 
it from delving into this fund.  If there is nothing stopping it, 
why does it have to introduce legislation in this House, force 
closure and deny parliamentary debate in order to implement this 
legislation so it has access?  The government knows that it 
cannot access the pension fund unless it breaks the rules so it 
is changing the rules.  Why?  Because it is the government and it 
does not respect the parliamentary process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all know 
that when the government gets its claws on this $30 billion, it 
does it, as the member has just said, because it is the 
government and it knows best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different options that could be used instead of 
this money being confiscated by the government and used for 
whatever political purposes it chooses. It could be given back to 
the people who paid the premiums in terms of refunds. 
It could be used to increase the benefits to individual members. 
It could also be used for other purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member of the Conservative Party who just spoke 
divulge to the House what his party's preferences would be on how 
this $30 billion should be used since it clearly is opposed to 
the government taking it as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a number of times during 
my speech I referred to Bill S-3, the Pension Benefits Standards 
Act, which sets out guidelines for the negotiations relative to 
pension surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are guidelines that clearly lay out the role for 
negotiations with the contributors to the pension over the period 
of time, the employees and former employees, and with the 
employers as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the government engage in that kind of 
negotiation and discussion over a longer term and work through 
that process, as any private sector corporation would, with the 
employers and the contributors to achieve an agreement as to how 
that surplus should be divided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the size of the surplus seems huge, up to 50% of that 
money will be invested in the private equities markets. It is 
very important to note how unprecedentedly high the equities 
markets are right now.  Some economists are even pointing to 
threats of potential deflation and that our equities markets may 
be overvalued.  Although some members may disagree, the price 
earnings ratios for our stocks are very high now.  I believe they 
are the highest they have been since just before the Great 
Depression in 1929. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be morbid nor do I want members to rush from 
the House to call their brokers or anything like that, but I 
would suggest that a large pension surplus is a good level of 
security against market fluctuations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do support the government moving toward investing this money 
privately in the equities markets.  In the long term, that will 
maximize the return for public servants.  However, in view of the 
increased risk and the commensurate increased returns, it would 
be prudent for the government to maintain a large surplus within 
the public service pension.  I think that would benefit not just 
the government but also the employees and contributors over the 
long term. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It my pleasure to speak today on the employee benefit 
improvements that will ensue from the legislation before us.  The 
first thing I must do is clarify that as far as retirement 
benefits are concerned, improvements are the only effects that 
will ensue from the government proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been alleged that the government proposals will somehow 
diminish the pension benefits of federal retirees and employees. 
I want to make it clear that this is absolutely false.  Public 
service pension benefits are protected and guaranteed by law. 
Nothing in the bill will or can diminish those benefits.  They 
will continue in full and be fully indexed for inflation as 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from diminishing benefits, they will actually improve the 
employee benefit package in several concrete ways. As members may 
recall, two of these improvements have already been discussed in 
the House.  They were introduced in the recent budget bill and 
will come into force on passage of that bill.  Both involve 
changing the formulas used for calculating benefits and both 
changes favour the plan member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first formula to be changed is the basic one used to 
calculate retirement benefits for the public service pension 
plan.  Up until now, that formula has been based on the plan 
member's average salary over six consecutive years of highest 
paid service.  Other public sector pension plans use five as the 
number of consecutive years in their formula.  From now on, under 
the amended legislation, so will public pension plans. 
In most cases, averaging over five years instead of six will mean 
greater benefits for plan members on retirement.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second formula relates to the integration of the public 
service pension benefits with those of the Canada and Quebec 
pension plans.  This new formula will produce a somewhat smaller 
reduction in benefits at that point.  Two small changes in 
formula amounting to two concrete improvements to benefits for 
current members of the public service pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us today further improves the pension 
benefit package for federal employees.  A proposed change will 
allow a survivor to waive entitlement to benefits after a 
member's death in specific circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change facilitating the administration of survivor 
benefit provisions will allow a survivor who cannot be located to 
be disentitled to survivor benefits.  Currently, final 
determination of the payment of survival benefits can be delayed 
indefinitely when a survivor cannot be found.  This is clearly 
unfair to those other persons whose benefits are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, for cases where two survivors are entitled to an 
annuity in respect of one plan member, the method of determining 
the percentage of the annuity payable to each survivor will be 
set out in the legislation.  Specifically, each survivor will 
receive an amount that is directly related to the length of time 
he or she contributed with the deceased contributor in relation 
to the total amount of time the deceased cohabited with both 
survivors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposes changes to the supplementary death 
benefits and term life insurance to employees and retirees 
payable under the Public Service Superannuation Act.  For 
example, the paid up benefit will be increased to $10,000 from 
the current $5,000.  This paid up benefit will also be extended 
to another group of pensioners.  Persons who retired on or after 
April 1, 1995, with an entitlement to an annual allowance payable 
within 30 days of ceasing to be employed will, if they elected to 
retain their SDB coverage, have entitlement to the paid up 
coverage at age 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change would see the coverage reduction of 10% per year 
delayed until age 66 rather than beginning at age 61.  This means 
that the basic coverage of twice the salary for employees and the 
covered pensioners under 61 is extended by five years and that 
benefit coverage would not finally reduce to either one-third of 
the salary for employees or, in the case of pensioners, to the 
basic paid up amount of zero until age 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new coverage reduction schedule would apply automatically to 
those employees and pensioners who have already reached the aged 
of 61.  However, those persons who would prefer to remain on the 
current schedule would be given the opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit improvements also include the removal of the 
provision in PSSA and Canadian forces plans whereby persons 
dismissed for misconduct could be denied access to any benefit 
other than a return of contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is to be another noteworthy improvement to 
benefits in the larger sense of the term.  It is the new cost 
sharing dental plan the government intends to establish for 
present and future public service pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not elaborate here because strictly speaking the new 
dental plan does not form part of the legislative package but 
rather will be introduced under the authority of the Treasury 
Board once consultations are complete and full details are 
finalized.  I merely mention the new dental plan in order to 
place it in a context to which it truly belongs, significant 
improvements that public service plan members can expect from 
their benefits package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public service pensioners of the present have no need to 
fear the proposed amendments to the public service pension plans. 
Their benefits are defined and guaranteed in law and will in no 
way be diminished.  Today's pensioners can rest assured that the 
usual cheques in the usual amounts will keep coming as they 
always have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for public service pensioners of the future, they too have no 
cause to worry.  The proposed amendments will leave their future 
benefits safe and intact.  Plan members will continue to receive 
on retirement all that their pension plans have promised them. In 
fact, with the improvements currently proposed they will receive 
even more.

said a number of times that civil servants did not need to worry 
because everything was in place.

great concern over the bill to members of parliament?  Why are 
they making all kinds of threats beyond that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the government has failed in either one of 
two areas.  It has either failed to actually provide fairness to 
the employees or it has failed to communicate it.  I would like 
to know which one it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
what I have outlined clearly illustrates the improvements to the 
plan.  If anyone is concerned it is probably because they have 
been listening to the fearmongering by some members on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits, as outlined extensively by members on this side of 
the House, clearly indicate that there are significant 
improvements.  There is nothing to fear because the moneys will 
be there and there by law.  I do not know what could be clearer 
than that.  The moneys are there by law. If there is a shortfall 
it will covered.  That has been the case all along and will 
continue to be so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the hon. member that the old saying “There 
is nothing to fear but fear itself”, in this case there is 
nothing to fear at all because it has been clearly outlined in 
black and white.  If the member reviews the bill again I am sure 
he will come to the same conclusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot help but comment on this last statement that the money 
will be there if there is a shortfall in the fund.  Many members 
opposite have indicated to us that the main reason the government 
wants this $30 billion is because it is the taxpayers' money and 
the government is protecting the interests of the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member just exactly which side of 
the mouth the Liberal government is speaking from?  On the one 
hand it says it is protecting the taxpayer by giving the money 
back to them and on the other hand it is saying that if there is 
a shortfall it will be taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way or another the taxpayer is going to be funding this. 
Whose money is it?  A large part of it was the taxpayers' money 
and another part was the individual beneficiary's money.  Who is 
going to get this money?  Who are the Liberals actually trying to 
protect?  It sounds to me like the only people they are really 
trying to protect are themselves and their greedy ambitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not quite understand 
the greedy ambitions.  I would point out to the hon. member that 
currently about 30% of the fund is supplied by the employees and 
the rest has been picked up obviously by the taxpayers. There is 
no question that when there was a shortfall it was covered by the 
taxpayers.  One would assume then that there is a significant 
surplus.  It has been pointed out by the actuary.  There is more 
The fact is that there is more than enough in the fund to take 
out the $30 billion and it will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In whose interest is it?  I would presume it is in the interests 
of the Canadian public, those who are contributing by way of 
being a taxpayer and those who are contributing by being a member 
of the plan.  In both cases the moneys are there.  This is 
something we accept in this society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of fairness, if one reads the legislation one would 
come to the conclusion that if the fund is covered during 
shortfall times, the moneys would come out when there is a 
surplus.

word conjugal which has been the subject of much acrimony on both 
sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will preface my remarks by saying that I have been extremely 
disappointed in my government, or the advisers to my government, 
who chose to use the word conjugal to achieve what I think was a 
correct purpose to extend survivor benefits to same sex couples. 
Unfortunately they chose to do it in entirely the wrong way and 
it has caused a division on this side and unhappiness.  I am sorry 
that has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought there would have been very grave concern on 
the other side of the House about legislation that has the 
intention of providing survivor benefits to same sex couples, but 
does no such thing.  It is that kind of ineptitude that makes me 
regret this particular aspect of what is otherwise a very good 
bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was attempted in order to extend benefits to same sex 
couples was that the bill amends existing legislation which 
defines a survivor as a person of the opposite sex.  Clause 25(4) 
of Bill C-78 redefines survivor as someone who is cohabiting in a 
relationship of a conjugal nature for a period of a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That came up during second reading and I saw the word conjugal. 
I know a little bit about words.  I knew immediately that 
conjugal in any context does not mean same sex.  It is a word 
that goes back 2,000 years, back to the early church in Rome.  It 
is from two Latin words involving togetherness and yoking 
together.  That is what it means explicitly.  The history of the 
word has to do with conjugal rights and the whole idea that in 
medieval times, in the early church and even in the later church, 
the idea was that when one got married this legally permitted one 
to have a heterosexual relationship with the woman and procreate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was how the early church regarded it, both the Catholic 
church at the beginning and later the various Protestant 
churches.  It has not changed.  Go to any dictionary including 
Black's dictionary.  One of the members mentioned Black's 
dictionary and suggested that conjugal means something other than 
a married relationship or a relationship involving sexual 
intercourse in the conventional fashion.  Everywhere you go you 
can look it up and find that, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenged the officials of the minister's department.  I said 
“Explain to me why you are using the word conjugal in order to 
provide benefits to same sex partners”.  I was led to the 1997 
Rosenberg court case.  The court was examining the Income Tax Act 
provisions with respect to benefits to same sex couples.  The 
court decided that same sex couples under the charter of rights 
should be entitled to the same benefits under the Income Tax Act 
as opposite sex couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge looked at a particular clause in the Income Tax Act 
which said in essence that a spouse is a person in an opposite 
sex relationship who is enjoying a conjugal relationship.  It 
states that a spouse at any time of a taxpayer includes the 
person of the opposite sex who cohabits at that time with the 
taxpayer in a conjugal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three ideas here:  opposite sex, cohabits and conjugal 
relationship.  The judge in the Rosenberg case ruled that in 
order to fulfil the intention of the charter we should read into 
this clause—and this is a judge creating legislation—that it 
should be a person of the opposite sex or the same sex who 
cohabits at that time with the taxpayer in a conjugal 
relationship.  The judge added words but did not change the word 
conjugal which does not mean same sex.  It does not mean that at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at that I said to the officials from the 
department “That does not prove a thing.  Show me anywhere in 
law, anywhere in legislation, where conjugal is actually defined 
as pertaining to a same sex sexual relationship”.  I looked at 
all the cases presented for me.  There were lots of analyses of 
cohabit.  There were lots of analyses of spouse, but nowhere in 
any of the things presented to me with my own research or with the 
assistance of the department could I find a definition of 
conjugal that includes same sex relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have?  Let us go back to the original clause, Clause 
25(4), and read it exactly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this Part, when a person establishes that he 
or she was cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature with 
the contributor for at least one year...then the person is 
considered to be the survivor of the contributor. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take that clause literally nothing has happened. 
In fact the clause entrenches the idea that only married couples, 
that is people in a conjugal relationship, can receive these 
benefits.  The legislation actually fails to achieve what it was 
designed to achieve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I support the bill, but I do not support the clumsiness of 
what was attempted in the bill.  Let me go on the record as 
saying I believe the government has an obligation to find a way 
in which to recognize the genuine dependency that exists between 
same sex couples.  We should enshrine that in legislation and we 
should pass laws, but we cannot let the courts do it because the 
courts are at the whim of a judge who is not concerned with 
writing legislation, who is merely concerned with expressing and 
interpreting ideas, who fails to appreciate that a word in 
existing legislation does not mean what he thinks it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the supreme court ruling in the M. v H. case in this 
past week.  The supreme court is suggesting that the Ontario 
family law should be struck down because it only pertains to 
opposite sex couples cohabiting.  In its decision it mentions 
that same sex couples can have similar relationships to opposite 
sex couples including conjugal relationships.  I submit that the 
supreme court judges have made the same error.  If they would 
only go to any dictionary, English or French, they would never 
find conjugal referring to same sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the judges and courts through, shall we say, a certain 
amount of literary ineptitude—and we should not be surprised by 
that because they are judges, not authors, not 
legislators—creating changes in the laws that are basically 
wrong.  It belongs to parliamentarians to make those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the case with respect to striking down the family 
law act, we understand that the provinces of Ontario and Alberta 
will have to redo their legislation to make sure that their 
family law legislation embraces same sex couples.  Let them do 
that, but let them, for heaven sakes, avoid the word conjugal 
because conjugal specifically means heterosexual sex and married. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason there is division on this side is not because members 
do not want to see gay couples treated like everyone else.  The 
reason there is division on this side is there is a genuine and 
honest concern about the implications of giving gay couples 
legally married status because in my view the big danger there is 
that it would give them then the right to adopt children as 
opposed to the privilege that they already now have.  The right 
to adopt children would run the danger of extinguishing the 
rights of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, while I will always try to champion the rights of 
every Canadian no matter what their differences from other 
Canadians, I have to always remember that it is not the place of 
this parliament to ever diminish or extinguish the rights of 
other Canadians, especially children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret this legislation.  It is an excellent bill but we used 
the wrong word.  If we had used the word cohabit instead of 
conjugal, I think it would have been fine.  If we had used 
dependent, I think it would have been fine.  Anything but the 
word conjugal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am overwhelmed by the approach of this member. Certainly he has 
been thoughtful and has studied the bill.  I commend him for 
that, but he leaves me with a number of unanswered questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he is correct in saying that conjugal generally refers 
to a married type relationship.  It does refer, though, to the 
sexual activity within a married relationship generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new term used in the bill which has never been used before 
by his government is that two parties be in a relationship of a 
conjugal nature in the past, that they be in a conjugal 
relationship.  They have changed it from one expression to a more 
loose definition, to a relationship of a conjugal nature.  A moot 
point, perhaps, but it suggests that there is a less onerous 
requirement for the heterosexual type sex in the way they have 
used this term.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of this particular point in the debate, we have 
pressed the President of the Treasury Board several times to 
include a definition of what is meant by a relationship of a 
conjugal nature in the act.  There is no reference to any kind of 
definition of it anywhere in the act so that the debate we are 
having today would not be necessary.  That has been not dealt 
with.  To his point I think that probably where this will end up, 
if this bill goes ahead, is in the courts.  I am as concerned as 
he is that is where this will be decided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wonder what he thinks the outcome will be in the courts. 
We had the minister tell us in the House that this was 
specifically intended to extend same sex benefits to those kinds 
of relationships.  He specifically said the courts made him do it 
and the lawyers drafted it this way.  What does the member think 
will be the outcome when this hits the courtroom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> In my view, Mr. Speaker, the government 
has said that it is being driven by the courts but I think it has 
interpreted the courts entirely incorrectly.  The courts have not 
ruled on the definition of conjugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the real answer here is for parliament and the 
government to bring in legislation that sets this matter to rest 
once and for all: define cohabitation, define spouse, define 
marriage.  We do not have to define conjugal at all because I do 
not believe we should be in the business of defining ourselves in 
terms of our sexual orientation.  If we look at the legislation, 
if we look at the court decisions, we will find that what we are 
really talking about is dependency, cohabitation, this kind of 
concept.  We can leave sex out of it entirely as far as I am 
concerned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member's erudite and thought provoking 
interventions today in the etymology of conjugal and its 
relevance to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member agrees with me that the Supreme 
Court of Canada has a very important role in interpreting the 
charter of rights, which was deliberately and politically 
developed to protect the rights of minorities; that the political 
process, particularly one driven by a populist environment, can 
be very dangerous in terms of the defence of minority rights; and 
that populism sometimes cannot be guaranteed or majority rules, 
for instance, which is the tenet of parliament, does not always 
serve the interests of minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the way parliament or the government has interpreted these 
rulings that bothers him as opposed to the supreme court making 
fairly significant and sweeping judgments in defence of minority 
rights that bothers him?  I would like him to clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say both.  I think 
it is very important that the Supreme Court and the courts 
interpret for us, but where we fail is when we fail as parliament 
to give the courts the proper tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have a case in point where the supreme court is suddenly 
defining conjugal for us.  I think it is a mistake and we have to 
get in there very quickly as parliamentarians before real damage 
is done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central, federal public 
servants, RCMP officers who are retired and currently serving, 
our military personnel, and the families of all these people to 
speak to Bill C-78, the government's proposed changes to the 
public service pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has become infamous on two counts.  On the first count 
it is because Liberals will steal a one time windfall of $30 
billion.  Second, it lets the courts decide the definition of 
marriage.  It will allow pension benefits to be delivered based 
on conjugal relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have raided the pension plan surplus federal public 
servants have amassed in their very successful pension fund.  The 
greed on the other side of the House is disgusting to watch.  The 
lack of respect shown to Canadians by putting a stop to this 
seizure of wealth and the government preventing debate on this 
matter in the House is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is allowing members of the House four hours to 
deal with this huge 200 page bill, true to the Liberal's 
democratic style.  It has used outright closure 5 times and it 
has used time allocation 47 times since 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the very same government that has taken $21 billion from 
the employment insurance fund surplus.  The $21 billion should 
have been returned to the employees and employers who could have 
created jobs with that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, through Bill C-78, which we are not allowed to debate for 
more than a few minutes, the President of the Treasury Board will 
take $14.9 billion from the public service pension fund, $2.4 
billion from the pensions of RCMP employees and $12.9 billion 
from the pensions of the Canadian armed forces, which adds up to 
$30.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition maintains that any surplus should remain 
in the pension plan to cushion taxpayers from future shortfalls. 
This would ensure the long term viability and guarantee the 
solvency of our public service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Canadian taxpayers have covered $13 billion worth of 
shortfalls in these pension plans.  Taxpayers will be on the hook 
for future deficits in these plans and we on this side of the 
House feel that Canadian taxpayers should be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals want to settle the matter of dealing with the $30 
billion surplus by passing Bill C-78 well before the next 
election in the hopes that the 645,000 pension plan members have 
short memories.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service Alliance of Canada says that the surplus 
money belongs to PSAC members and the government is stealing it. 
The word the union is using is stealing.  It is a very serious 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief reason for the surplus in the plan is that it was 
assumed salaries would grow.  The six-year wage freeze has 
reduced the liability of the plan.  These surpluses will 
eventually slow down as wages are increased and today's lower 
interest rates kick in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money the government is taking establishes a precedent and 
sends a clear message to the private sector that it can follow 
the lead of the government and help itself to surpluses in 
employee funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of government we have.  We have a finance 
minister who cooks the books.  We have a government that has no 
surplus in the Canada pension plan fund.  That plan has been so 
mismanaged for 30 years that it could crash at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the history of the $30 billion grab.  The 
President of the Treasury Board created an advisory committee on 
the Public Service Superannuation Act to look at pensions within 
the public service.  The committee carried on consultations for 
four years.  It was comprised of members of the government, 
public servants, representatives of employees and pensioner 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we know that the Liberal minister did not even recognize the 
further negotiations recommended in the committee's report.  The 
President of the Treasury Board is trampling roughshod over the 
committee's recommendations and doing what he pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 enables the government to get its hands on surpluses, 
the ownership of which, while not clearly defined, is morally the 
property of employees and ex-employees, that is, the pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will extend pension benefits to same sex couples.  It 
will allow marriage to be redefined and unfairly exclude others. 
The change in the definition of marriage should not be left up to 
the courts.  It is a decision for members of parliament to take 
right here in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granting survivor benefits should have nothing to do with sex, 
as defined by conjugal relationships.  Rather, the definition 
should be based on a relationship of dependency and 
companionship.  The latter definition would include gay or 
lesbian couples, but would also apply to a divorced daughter who 
lived with and cared for her elderly father after he retired from 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we believe that what is fair is right, then we should do what 
is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-78 contributions would be deposited in retirement 
funds and then transferred to the public sector pension 
investment board. 
Who will manage the board?  That is a big question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment process will be similar to the one used for the 
Senate.  The appointees, who will be responsible for managing and 
administering this fund, will be the friends of the government. 
The Reform Party recommends that the new public sector investment 
board be comprised of qualified individuals and be accountable 
for the board's investment decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the Prime Minister appoints his friends to the 
Senate and the superior court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will allow the government, particularly the Minister 
of Finance, to take $30 billion and say again that it has 
balanced the budget, paid down the debt and given Canadians some 
long overdue tax relief.  That is what the finance minister will 
say.  He will boast that he is a hero, but he will actually be a 
zero.  If he did all of these things he would be carrying out the 
official opposition's agenda.  Remember that in the health sector 
alone the government cut over $20 billion in transfers to the 
provinces.  Now, a few years later, it is boasting, saying that 
it will reinvest $11.5 billion of the money which it siphoned off 
earlier.  The government siphoned off more than $20 billion and 
now it is reinvesting $11 billion.  That is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition would leave the surplus in the account 
and see that it is well managed.  There would be a great deal of 
consultation between the stakeholders and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should have been enough time allocated for debate to take 
place in the House.  Shame on the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the little time I have I will quote from a letter I received 
from a constituent of Surrey.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The height of hypocrisy is to take from the working class to line 
the pockets of a politician, to make yourselves look good by 
reducing the debt by 15 billion dollars and to steal from those 
of us who contribute honestly to a pension that we have come to 
depend upon for our retirement years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter further states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the regular working Joes and Janes who contribute to this 
plan, contribute on a dollar for dollar basis and hope to receive 
back that which we have contributed plus the employer's share for 
our hard years of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you remove money from any pension fund or EI fund to reduce 
the debt you are in fact stealing from the people who have 
contributed to the funds for all these years and are defrauding 
us of our money when you expect us to pay higher premiums when 
they are in fact totally unnecessary.  Leave my pension fund 
where it is— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter concludes by stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the voice of the people in parliament, if you sit by and do 
nothing you don't deserve your position of trust and if you allow 
the deficit to be paid down by the pension contributions of a few 
you are the biggest thief on the face of the earth and you 
deserve to be arrested for embezzling my pension money. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what my constituent wrote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before we go to 
questions and comments, I want to put on the record that the use 
of the term “steal” is not something that we like to hear.  I 
want everyone to know that I am paying particular attention to 
how it is used.  If anyone uses the term “steal” in a general 
way, not referring to a specific individual, a specific ministry 
or a specific political party but to government as a whole, I 
will consider it to be broad enough to be acceptable.  If it is 
used in any other context I will not, just so everybody 
understands what the ground rules are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension plan is guaranteed.  It is a legislated plan.  It is

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the public and private sectors, generally, 60% is contributed 
by the employer and 40% by the employee.  This plan is now 70% 
employer and 30% employee.  We are still giving the opportunity 
over a four year period, starting in 2004, that if the 
government, the employer, and the people of Canada believe there 
is not enough money in the pension plan because the actuarial 
evaluator determines that more money is needed, at that point the 
maximum that the contribution from the employee can increase 
is .4% per year, and only if it is determined that it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite should understand what this legislation 
is all about.  It would be nice if he had read the legislation, 
attended some of the committee meetings and was aware of what 
this bill is all about.  I wonder if the hon. member understands 
some of the precepts in the bill, aside from just having a nice 
speech written by someone in his office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who 
asked the question showed some ignorance about how the system 
works.  That is quite evident on the other side of the House. 
That is why they are supporting this bill, although we read in 
the newspapers that there are some wise men on that side who 
oppose it.  There are a few members who understand what this bill 
is about and they know to whom this money belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I point out to the hon. member that I write my own 
speeches.  I prepare my speeches and I work hard.  I am not like 
other members who bring their papers but who speak without them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that the hon. member knows that under the CPP 
30 years ago if someone invested $1 the return should have been 
$11.  Now with that $1 investment we know they are getting 48 
cents worth of return from their pension which is managed by the 
government formed by his party and which was managed by the other 
party that ruled this country.  This money belongs to the pension 
fund of the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received many letters from my constituents who are 
worried about their pensions.  A few years ago there was a $13 
billion shortfall in the pension plan.  Who covered that 
shortfall?  The taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member believe that government can raise the premiums 
in the pension fund time and again and give a little back to the 
senior people who depend on their pension as a small contribution 
for what they did?  Is this not another tax?  Is that how the 
hon. member thinks the government should balance the budget?  It 
has already balanced the budget on the backs of the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it wants to score some brownie points during the election 
time by using the pension plan money of the employees, performing 
some tricks in the accounting of the books and taking money from 
the pockets of retired seniors to pay down some debt and give tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already cut $20 billion from health care in 
transfer payments to the provinces and then it injected $11 
billion. It brags that it is injecting $11 billion.  Does it not 
remember that it cut $20 billion in the first place?  Those are 
the mathematics the government is using. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters do not have short memories.  I am sure that the 654,000 
pension plan members will remember when it is time to vote.

pleasure to rise to speak again to Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues we have to address before we talk about the 
bill is the fact that closure has been moved and the debate has 
been limited.  When we look at some of the reasons the government 
would want to do that, we see that in its backbenches there is a 
bit of a revolt going on with a number of its members saying that 
this bill is flawed.  They do not like it and they are not going 
to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also does this to keep things moving along 
quickly, so the people across Canada do not have the chance to 
respond to their members of parliament and so we do not have a 
chance to fully debate the bill in the House.

members from gathering momentum to oppose this.  It seems that 
the Prime Minister is going to bring out the big stick and make 
sure this bill is supported by all members over there.  It should 
be interesting later on when we vote on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier that there is nothing to worry about and that 
the money will be there.  The money is there now. Why do we not 
just leave it there?  There is a $30 billion surplus in this 
account and it is to no credit of the government that it has 
accrued.  Anytime the government sees a lump of money, it wants 
to grab it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The indication is that this is going to pay the debt, but 
actually this law is so vague and silent on this that the surplus 
can be used by the President of the Treasury Board to do whatever 
he wishes.  The government is saying it could go to pay the debt, 
but it could go anywhere.  Canadians have the right to know where 
it is going to go and to what benefit to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen huge increases in CPP premiums.  They are going to 
go up a total of 73% over the next number of years. That still 
will not solidify the plan.  There is a good possibility that 
premiums will be reduced or the age limit will be raised. Besides 
that, we have seen the government take the $26 million surplus in 
the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that every time we see a couple of dollars stuck 
together here, and I realize that $26 billion and $30 billion are 
huge amounts of money, the government wants to get it and put it 
somewhere. I am not sure where it is putting it, but closer to 
the next election I imagine we will find out where it has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill allows the government to seize the public service fund 
surplus.  The three funds affected are the public service plan, 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police plan and the Canadian forces 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $30 billion has built up over the years for a number of 
reasons.  There is the fact that inflation has been low.  The 
actuaries projected that inflation would rise and the 
contributions would go up and that has not happened. There are 
three critical areas.  Salary increases have been kept low, 
interest rates on investments have been good and inflation is 
low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frozen wages for six or seven years, whatever it was, is another 
thing.  Public servants had their wages frozen.  They finally got 
a little bit of an increase and the government came right back 
and said, “Okay, there is $30 billion in your pension fund and 
we want to get our hands on it”.  This money belongs to the 
workers. It should stay where the workers can rely on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been shortfalls in the past.  There could be 
shortfalls again.  If this money is not there to pick up the 
slack, then back we go to another tax to pay for it.  That is 
what this has turned into.  They have not been pension 
contributions.  They have not been EI premiums.  If the 
government can take that money without using it for the purpose 
it was intended originally, then it is not a contribution or 
premium.  It is a tax and it should be called that.  The 
government forgets that this money belongs to the taxpayers and 
the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got into quite a debate a minute ago with a government member 
talking about conjugal relationships.  The definition of that is 
one of the issues that has really caused some concern among 
members of our party and all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts in the last little while have been creating laws. 
That is our job. That is why people voted for us.  That is why we 
are here, to legislate.  When the courts can take that away from 
us, when nine appointed judges of the supreme court can start 
making laws, then this country has a serious problem and one that 
needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we leave a clause or a word in the bill that is going 
to cause concern and that is going to have to go to lawyers and 
courts to be defined? 
The member for Calgary Centre put forward an amendment to this 
bill to take that word out and it was defeated by the government. 
The member stated that he has a problem with that word and if it 
was not there the bill would be better. Why did the government 
not support the amendment when it was put forward?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new bill survivors benefits have been expanded to 
beneficiaries. The thing that really puzzles me and many in this 
country is how we are going to decide if a relationship is 
conjugal.  If the decision is left to the courts, the whole issue 
will be gone over again and again until everybody is somewhat 
confused as to what the issue is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of this expanding into relationships of a 
conjugal nature throws a whole different slant on the bill which 
does not need to be there.  As members from all sides have said, 
we would have another look at this if that was not in there. It 
is there and this will eventually end up back in the courts where 
another decision will be made by the appointed judges.  This is 
where the problem exists.  We as legislators are not allowed to 
make the laws but instead it is the judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who came to see me from my riding who belong to this 
pension plan are very concerned. There was some representation 
from each of the affected funds. These people who are drawing 
from the pension wanted time to get together to talk to other 
members from across the country because they are concerned. 
They do not have the time because of the haste with which the 
government wants to move this bill through so it can get its 
hands on the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concern should not be there.  People who belong to this 
pension should feel very secure.  They should be able to raise 
the questions that need to be raised so we can relate to them 
what the issues are and that they do not need to worry, but we do 
not have that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if a pension plan has built up a surplus of $30 
billion we would have some degree of comfort if things changed, 
if there was a downturn in the economy, if something happened 
that the outgoing funds were higher than the incoming, we would 
have a bit of a surplus.  That is gone.  If money is not 
available to pay these people of course they are going to be 
worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compound the public service pension surplus being taken by 
the government with the concern that the CPP might not be 
available for people when they retire, it adds up.  People have a 
right to feel secure in their retirement after putting money in 
for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea that the President of the Treasury Board has the 
authority to take this surplus and use it as he wishes is not 
right.  The pensioners who are coming forward are very concerned 
with this.  They have a real point that there is no 
accountability here.  The fact that closure has been brought in 
on this bill and they have not had time to put forward all their 
concerns is not what this House is all about. That is not why we 
were elected by our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose this bill.  We feel that the money that is in the fund 
should remain right where it is.

Is miffed a parliamentary word, because I am miffed.  I am upset 
that the government is so anxious, as my colleague has just said, 
to get its claws on this money before anyone wakes up to what it 
is doing,  It will all be swept under the rug.  The government 
will get its spin doctors out there and everyone will be talking

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not even permitted to give my speech.  I have one ready but 
it looks as if I am not going to get on because the government 
has said, “We are not going to listen to any reason. We are just 
going to do what we want to do.  We are the government.  We know 
everything.  We know best”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the recipients and the people who are still 
paying into this pension are concerned.  I am very disappointed 
that the government, just because it has a slim majority, thinks 
it can jam things through. How dreadful it is that the Prime 
Minister is forcing these people to vote whether they want to or 
not in the way of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague who gave such an excellent speech on 
this topic to comment a little about the lack of parliamentary 
process in this issue as with many issues that the government 
deals with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Elk Island for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of the issue on this bill and on many other bills that 
we have dealt with in the House is the limit on debate. When the 
present government members were in opposition at any time the 
sitting government brought in closure they screamed bloody murder 
and rightfully so.  It is a breach of the trust that Canadians 
have in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I rose to speak on this bill closure had been 
voted on that day.  A number of people come to the gallery, come 
to see this place as the seat of democracy and the seat of 
government in the country.  For them to realize what was going on 
here, we were being muzzled as their representatives in a 
democracy.  We were being limited in the amount of time that we 
had to debate this bill.  I think that is atrocious.  It seems 
that every report that comes from a committee gets leaked before 
it is reported to the House. So many things go on that some days 
we wonder about the relevance of this place. We have to keep 
pinching ourselves to make sure that what we are seeing is real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to have the support and the backing of our constituents. 
To have the government bring in closure time after time stifles 
us so that we cannot perform our job in the proper way.  I find 
it very objectionable as I am sure do many others in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the same people 
say the same thing time after time.  They wanted six months to 
expand on what they have said the last few times.  It is a lot 
of—I cannot say hot air because that is unparliamentary—but it 
is interesting how incensed some of the hon. members on the other 
side portray their concern for the employees and the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that during the committee meetings not one of 
them came to show their interest, their concern or their 
questions and to be enlightened on the legislation that is before 
us, as compared to showing here for the TV cameras their great 
concern and again, I will not say the word hot air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sit on the environment 
committee.  I will put up the number of hours I was in committee 
in the last year against that member's any time.  I am here to 
represent the constituents of Lethbridge.  When they come to me 
with a problem with this bill, I come to the House to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was not at that committee, that is too bad because I was at 
another committee doing my job there.  When the environment bill, 
the CEPA bill, comes into the House, if that member wants to 
stick around and learn something about the environment, we will 
enlighten him too.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-78, an 
act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to 
amend the Public Sector Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Scarborough 
East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before the House third reading of Bill C-78, an act to 
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments touch the full range of pension 
operations, benefits, contributions and plan administration.  The 
underlying thrust of all these proposed amendments is to ensure 
the long term sustainability and stability of the Canadian public 
service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose in my comments to direct my remarks to one particular 
aspect of these amendments, and that is the proposed changes to 
employee contribution rates.  Before I discuss the proposed 
changes it is important for me to give a brief overview of the 
existing contribution rate provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of the existing legislative provisions will provide a 
rationale and context for the proposed amendments.  Under the 
existing legislative provisions employee contributions to the 
Canada pension plan, the CPP, and the public service pension 
plans are now integrated.  What does the integration mean?  It 
means the existing integration feature is such that the total 
contribution rate for an employee is 7.5% of pay composed of both 
the contributions to the CPP and the public service pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For an employee earning the average wage the contribution of the 
public service plans would be 7.5% minus the CPP contribution 
rate, currently 3.5% of pay, which then equals 4.0% of the pay. 
To the extent that the CPP contribution rates increase there is 
an equivalent decline in public service pension plan contribution 
rates to preserve the constraint that the maximum pension 
contributions equal 7.5% of pay.  In the past with periods of 
relative stability in contribution rates this integrated formula 
has served the public service pension plans well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, under the integrated contribution rate structure the 
increase in CPP contribution rates beginning in 1987 has 
distorted the distribution of employee contributions going to the 
CPP and the public service pension plans.  Under the integrated 
structure the impact of increases in CPP rates has been such that 
for employees earning the average wage contributions to the 
public service pension plans have declined from 5.7% of pay in 
1986 to 4.0% of pay in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate, over the past decade individual employee 
contribution rates for the CPP have gone up while those for the 
public service pension plans have declined.  What are the 
implications of this shift in the distribution of employee 
contributions between the CPP and the public service pension 
plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this point I have discussed only employee contribution rates. 
On the other side of the coin I will discuss a little about 
employer contributions, that is the contribution of the federal 
government in its role as employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing legislation for the public service pension plans is 
such that the employer must ensure that the various accounts for 
the public service pension plans are credited with an amount 
equal to the total cost of entitlements accrued by employees in 
that year.  In other words, the federal government is responsible 
for the total costs of the plan in a given year less the employee 
contributions, and as a consequence the declining employee 
contribution rates.  The federal government and by extension all 
taxpayers have had to shoulder an ever increasing share of the 
cost of employee pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the pension plan under the Public Service 
Superannuation Act as an example. Over the last three decades the 
financing of that plan has averaged approximately 60% employer 
funding and 40% employee funding.  More recently that 
distribution has shifted rather dramatically. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 1999 the distribution is approximately 70% employer and 30% 
employee.  Next year in the absence of any changes to the 
legislation it is projected that the distribution of the 
financing of the PSSA plan will shift to approximately 75:25, and 
by the year 2003 it will be an 80:20 split. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ongoing shift in the cost of the pension plan to the 
employer is simply not sustainable.  It clearly puts the 
sustainability of the existing plan at risk unless changes are 
made.  It is our intention to introduce the necessary changes to 
the contribution rate structure to preserve the long term 
sustainability of the public service pension plans.  With the 
amendments proposed in the bill contribution rates for the public 
service pension plans and the Canada pension plan will no longer 
be integrated.  In other words, the public service contribution 
rates will henceforth be set independently and there will be no 
overall maximum contribution rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there will be a two tier contribution rate 
structured to more directly match contribution rates with 
different benefit accruals below and above the average wage as 
defined by the CPP.  The government recognizes that there will be 
a financial impact on employees as a result of these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to facilitate the movement to a long term sustainable 
pension plan environment, the government is proposing to freeze 
employee contribution rates to public service pension plans over 
the period 2000 to 2003 inclusive.  Over this period employee 
contributions on earnings below the average wage as defined by 
the CPP will continue at the present 1999 rate of 4%. 
Contributions on earnings above that average will continue at the 
present rate of 7.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood however that even though federal employees 
will thus be spared any increases in contribution rates for their 
public service pensions from 2000 to 2003, they will nevertheless 
be subject to the Canada pension plan rate increases schedule for 
that period, the same CPP rate hike and increases to which all 
Canadians alike will be subject.  Through integration of 
contributions federal employees in effect have been sheltered 
from such increases in the past.  Now they will have to pay them 
like all the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the CPP rate is scheduled to stabilize in the year 
2004 as a result of good government planning.  What will be the 
public service plan rates then?  They will rise in 2004 after 
being frozen for four years.  Maybe not.  Maybe possibly but not 
necessarily.  That is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the year 2004 and beyond the Treasury Board will set the 
contribution rate structure with the intention of returning the 
cost sharing ratio gradually to the historic average of 
approximately 60:40 between employer and employees.  The employer 
would continue to assume the larger share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employee contribution rate increases may or may not be necessary 
from 2004 on depending on a number of variables.  However, any 
necessary increases would be gradual.  For example, members of 
the pension plan under the Public Service Superannuation Act can 
rest assured that no increases in their public service pension 
contribution rate will be greater than an additional 0.4% per 
year after 2003.  If an increase proves necessary in 2004, the 
contribution rate will still not be more than 7.9% of the 
employee's salary.  That is the previous rate of 7.5% plus the 
maximum possible increase of 0.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PSSA plan members can rest assured under the amended legislation 
that their employee's share of current service costs for their 
pension plan would never exceed 40%.  In other words their 
contribution rates will not be increased beyond the point where 
they are paying their historic average cost share of 40%.  The 
historical average therefore will also be limited under the 
amended legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for members of the other two public service plans under the 
Canadian Forces Superannuation Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Superannuation Act, it has to be noted that the cost share 
between employer and employee is not the same and that the 
employer is paying the larger percentage of the cost. 
However, the legislation will provide that the contribution rates 
of participating members to these plans will not exceed those of 
PSSA members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the contribution rate structure are one component 
of the package of changes required to ensure the long term 
sustainability of the public service pension plans.  The bill 
provides as part of the comprehensive package of amendments the 
required changes in the contribution rate structure to ensure 
that the public service pension plans will be sustained over a 
long period of time.  I think that is important to note and I 
would ask all members to vote accordingly on this very important 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have my own hoist motion in process as we speak.  I would like to 
say at the outset that I support the general principle of the 
bill.  However I would like to deal with the controversial 
section concerning survivor benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One feels a little like treading into an area where angels fear 
to tread.  It is my view that overall parliament has been silent 
too long on this issue and has by its neglect deferred to others 
in this area of intense controversy among Canadians.  The 
relevant section that is appropriate to this discussion is 29.4 
which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this Part, when a person establishes that he 
or she was cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature with 
the contributor for at least one year immediately before the 
death of the contributor, the person is considered to be the 
survivor of the contributor. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various other supporting sections which we do not need 
to go to.  The obvious issue here is whether there has been an 
extension of application of survivor benefits to same sex 
partners who are cohabiting in a conjugal relationship for at 
least one year prior to the plan member's death.  It may well be 
argued that this is simply reflective of trends in judicial 
authorities and the government is responding to those trends. 
However, I would like to speak to the issue of institutional 
competence to decide such a unique and profound issue of great 
controversy for many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leading decision in the area is Egan and Nesbit which 
challenged the spousal allowance provisions of the Old Age 
Security Act.  In May 1995 the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed 
the appeal of Egan and Nesbit by a 5:4 margin.  The court however 
was unanimous in its ruling that sexual orientation was an 
analogous ground and that it triggered a section 15 protection. A 
5:4 majority of the court also found the spousal issue 
discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore 
infringed section 15 of the charter.  However, a different 5:4 
majority found that the discrimination was justified under 
section 1 of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion appeared to be based, in part at least, on the 
view that the court should be reluctant to interfere in 
parliament's choice in respect to socioeconomic pieces of 
legislation.  In summary, unanimously it discriminates; 5:4, 
section 15 is triggered; and a different 5:4, a justified 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious there was a very divided court.  It however 
had the wisdom to offer this advice to parliament in May 1995 
when the decision was rendered: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of how the term spouse should be defined is a 
fundamental social policy issue and parliament should decide it 
and parliament should listen to and balance the competing social 
issues, the philosophical issues, the legal, moral, theological 
issues that go into this definitional process.  The court 
shouldn't be deciding it.  Parliament should be deciding it and 
the court should defer to parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is hardly enthusiasm on the part of the court to assume a 
jurisdictional area of competence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next leading case is Rosenberg which the government chose 
not to appeal.  It basically showed that the court of appeal was 
a little fed up with parliament.  It had a case before it and was 
to define or decide the issue.  In turn it found that the 
definition of a spouse could include same sex spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament does not decide these issues a fair conclusion is 
that the courts will take over.  In my view that effectively 
shuts out the voice of the people of Canada.  The chattering 
classes get to have their say on what they think is the proper 
definition of a spouse or a conjugal relationship. 
The courts can have their say as to what constitutes a conjugal 
relationships but the people of Canada and parliament do not get 
to have their say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue continues to percolate up to parliament in a variety 
of ways and the most obvious is the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-78 the issue of conjugal relationship one year prior 
to death gets defined through the back door by simply saying 
nothing.  It effectively defers to the latest decision of the 
supreme court or the court of appeal as the case may be with 
respect to what constitutes a spousal relationship.  This 
constitutes a complete abdication of our responsibility as 
parliamentarians.  It is a delegation of authority to a 
bureaucracy with no accountability and that, frankly, is not what 
I was elected to do nor, I dare say, were you, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area in which this has arisen recently is with respect 
to Bill C-63, which delegates the definition of spouse to an 
order in council.  Essentially, what that means is that instead 
of dealing with it in a straightforward manner, the minister, 
through the order in council, gets to define what a spouse is for 
the purposes of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this is back door legislation through regulation.  It 
is a delegation and an abrogation of parliament's 
responsibilities which is inappropriate and for which all 
parliamentarians should be very worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is essentially an issue of jurisdictional competency. The 
courts have clearly said that they are prepared to defer to 
parliament on what the definition is of conjugal relationship or 
the definition of spouse as the case may be providing that 
parliament makes the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the four years since Egan and Nesbit, parliament has not made 
the decision, is reluctant to make the decision and, in part, 
probably because of political correctness and pure controversy, 
but nevertheless a clear refusal to accept its role.  As a 
consequence, the Supreme Court of Canada and courts of appeal in 
other various provinces have stepped into the vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are then left with the definitions to be whatever a 
particular civil servant thinks the definition should be on a 
case by case basis.  Through a closed door framework of 
regulatory power or keeping an eye on the latest particular 
decision of any court in the land then it is an ever revolving 
decision.  Once the decision of a spouse or a conjugal 
relationship is delegated to a judicial process it will be 
forever delegated and the people of Canada will not have any say 
in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally, this is about the rule of law and the role of 
parliament in deciding the issues of our time.  This is an issue 
of significant religious, philosophical and moral consequence 
which parliament and parliament alone is unique in its ability to 
balance the competing social issues that come to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only parliament has a committee process that enables all aspects 
of these kinds of questions to be analyzed.  Only parliament can 
recognize that the implications of a definition are much broader 
than the particular individual case before it.  Only parliament 
can reflect on the wishes of its constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, this issue continues to be decided by parliament and 
needs to be decided by parliament and parliament alone.  We are a 
democratic society.  We are subject to the rule of law and we do 
have various institutions at various levels of competence to deal 
with various issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Supreme Court of Canada is quite willing to 
defer to the Parliament of Canada on these issues.  I have only 
to note that in the Lavigne decision it was a very split court. 
When the issues then cycle back up before the Supreme Court of 
Canada, which they inevitably will, they will weigh the debate. 
On the basis of where there is a rational basis of a definition, 
it must be shown that it is proportionate and not at all applied 
arbitrarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament ducks the issue then the courts are left in a void 
and they or their bureaucrats can make up a definition as they go 
along.  Just because this is a politically difficult issue does 
not mean that parliament should duck it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that there is omnibus legislation on the way.  This is 
quite curious.  At this point in time parliament has never spoken 
on the issue so the drafter of the omnibus bill will only have 
before him or her interpretations of various courts and other 
relevant issues.  It will not therefore become a big surprise 
that the proposed legislation will reflect the current state of 
the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a great mistake in my view because the drafter of 
the legislation would not then have had the benefit of 
parliamentary debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the debate should come first, the drafting of the 
bill second and the debate on the bill third.  Once that is 
completed, the various amendments applicable to Bill C-63 or Bill 
C-78, as the case may be, and various other pieces of legislation 
will be amended accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that this is a matter of process and the process 
is completely backward.  It should be a process that firstly 
debates an issue then produces an omnibus bill and then informs 
all other pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament should provide guidance to the courts but it has 
clearly shown an unwillingness to step into this void even when 
courts are willing to defer to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view on same sex benefits is quite irrelevant.  This is a

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was 
listening very carefully to what the member was saying.  It is 
rather refreshing to hear a member from the government side put 
the issues fairly straightforward on the table.  I wonder if the 
member has any idea how we can correct this abdication of 
responsibility by parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a number of occasions where private members' bills 
on this very issue have been brought forward.  Private members' 
bills are by and large called free votes and in those occurrences 
members present have voted against them fairly reflecting the 
wishes of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four or five years ago there was a private member's bill on the 
issue of benefits for same sex couples.  As I recall there were 
18 Liberals out of 177 at that time who voted for the bill and 
the rest against it.  That was democracy at work.  That was 
parliament speaking on behalf of the Canadian population, on 
behalf of the voters, saying that it was not ready for this 
because it was contrary to what many members believed and what 
constituents were saying.  It was just not going to do it. 
Members would vote against it or they would stay away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have this closure situation and whipped votes. Democracy 
is really being brushed aside while a few people with an agenda 
seem to be getting their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am putting the member on the spot but does he have any 
ideas on how we can improve how this place works and improve its 
democratic process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, my view is that it is 
irrelevant what one's view is on the issue.  There are two ways 
to get legislation into the House:  first, by means of a private 
member's bill; and second, by means of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think at this point the legislation is premature. In my view 
we debate first, draft the legislation second and then debate the 
legislation on an issue of such controversy.  Once that is done 
the government would be informed as to the proper decisions to be 
made in the drafting of the omnibus bill.  The drafting of a bill 
is a little like a tree.  Once one makes one decision then 
several other logical decisions follow.  If another decision is 
made several other logical conclusions follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put the hon. member back on the spot by saying that he 
should suggest to his leader that one of their supply days be 
used for this issue so that it can be debated then.  Presumably 
we will have the view of members on the record and those views 
would in turn inform the drafter of the bill.  The drafter of the 
bill would then present to the government and to the minister a 
bill which I would think would be a stronger bill and closer to 
some level of consensus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member's speech and his answer is a reasonable one.  I would 
like to ask a very short question.  What difference will it make 
if the vote today goes the way the government members will be 
whipped? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
presuming on the way in which the vote will go and on whether it 
is or is not a whipped vote.  Just because a vote is whipped does 
not necessarily mean that people are all subject to the views of 
the government.  That is just simply a reality of politics in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, indicate to the hon. member that in the 
absence of an amendment, the bill will in fact create something 
of a precedent and that precedent will be difficult to deal with 
ex post facto either by way of an omnibus bill or by way of 
amending legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise at third reading to speak to Bill C-78 , an 
act to establish the Public Service Pension Investment Board, to 
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the House at report stage, Bill C-78 is of 
particular interest to me. 
On many occasions I have risen in this House on behalf of the 
elderly and senior citizens organizations to defend their 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact 
that this week is dedicated to senior citizens, to the 
Fédération de l'âge d'or. As a matter of fact, I will probably 
rise in the House during Statements by Members to stress the 
contribution of seniors to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at making changes to the public sector 
pension plans, and contrary to what the President of the 
Treasury Board said, these changes are of great concern to 
federal employees and retirees. Obviously the Bloc Quebecois is 
opposed to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the life expectancy of Canadians and Quebecers reached 
unprecedented levels for both men and women. 
Life expectancy is 81.4 years for women, and 75.8 years for men. 
Canada comes fourth among countries where people live the 
longest. However, sadly, in 1997, the number of suicides in 
Quebec accounted for 37% of the total number of suicides 
registered across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years a $30 billion surplus has accumulated in 
the public service, RCMP and National Defence pension plans. The 
Bloc Quebecois cannot accept that the federal government 
unilaterally decided to make major changes to its employees' 
pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been very consistent in what it has been 
saying about pension plans. Pension plans should not be changed 
to the detriment of senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the majority of 
people over 50 would like to see some kind of legislation to 
protect senior citizens. 
A draft version of the bill had previously been introduced. 
François Legault, not the provincial minister but the current 
president of the Fédération de l'âge d'or du Québec, the FADOQ, 
is showing an interest in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a Léger & 
Léger poll conducted on behalf of the Commission des services 
juridiques, 93% of the 1,009 respondents said they were in 
favour of the urgent implementation of an act to protect the 
elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results are in stark contrast with the opinion, held until 
recently, that seniors do not want to be regulated by an act 
similar to the legislation for young people, because it might 
make them feel like children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a spokesperson for the elderly, I agree that they should be 
better protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is definitely not the first time that the 
federal government tries to reduce its debt at the expense of 
our seniors. 
The elderly have always reacted strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a similarity between the control exerted by the 
federal government on the employment insurance surplus that has 
been growing in recent years. The government claims, wrongly so, 
that this surplus belongs to it, like the surplus targeted with 
Bill C-78.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise to have joint management of public sector pension 
plans is very important to the Bloc Quebecois, and a lot of 
people are asking the government to keep its promise. There must 
be a management board made up of representatives of the 
employer, employees as well as retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said previously in this House, unfortunately, Bill C-78 does 
nothing to make that promise come true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only normal for seniors to claim their share. This 
unilateral appropriation of funds to the tune of $30 billion by 
the government is an insult. 
The surplus belongs to both the employer and the employees, not 
to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that 1999 is the International Year of the 
Elderly. Moreover, this week is Senior Citizens' Week. I would 
also like to remind members that the fourth world conference on 
ageing will be held in Montreal, at the convention centre, 
September 5 to 9, 1999. I hope I got my message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying the last time I spoke to Bill C-78 in this House, 
a stamp honouring the elderly is not enough. Let us not forget 
that, this year, the theme for International Women's Day was 
“Going Strong—Celebrating Older Women”. Retired women, who 
often form the majority, are sometimes and even often the 
poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has spoken on many occasions in the past 
against interference by the federal government. The Bloc 
Quebecois is against Bill C-78 because it allows the government 
to appropriate the $30 billion surplus in the public sector 
pension plans, just as it did, unfortunately, with the 
employment insurance surplus.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what the member had to say about 
Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point he did not address.  However, I would like 
his opinion.  Would this not be just what private businesses 
were waiting for?  Might certain companies not want to follow 
the federal government's lead and do what they liked with 
pension funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a bit like what happened in Black Lake and Thetford 
with the asbestos company, which helped itself to some of the 
surplus in the pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Laval East mentions the Singer company.  I am 
told that three quarters of the employees are now dead, or will 
not have the full benefit of their pensions. 
The company has been dragging the process out before the courts. 
Employees are being told that, if they do not see the results, 
their legal heirs will, as if that were any comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to go into greater detail on the 
example that the President of the Treasury Board is setting for 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to say to my 
colleague from Frontenac—Megantic that he is absolutely right. 
When the example comes from higher up we follow it generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has always arranged things so as to be able to 
take pension money. He gave the example of the Singer company, 
in particular. These people lost their retirement fund. It took 
a court decision to get the company to return the money to its 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, things went on so long that many of these 
employees have died over the years. I do not think there are 
many left now to recover their pension money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is absolutely right, when the example comes from up 
above, we tend to follow it. I fear that some companies will do 
as he mentioned and imitate the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I congratulate my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for his 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want primarily to make comments, and if my colleague cares to 
reply, he is welcome to do so. I agree with him that our 
government, as I was saying also, is nevertheless fairly 
creative and managed legally to take money belonging to the 
workers and employers in the employment insurance fund. The 
surplus amounted to $25 billion. This money should be used to 
help provide training and to assist those who no longer have a 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we see that fewer than 40% of the unemployed qualify for 
the employment insurance program. 
In the regions in the Atlantic provinces, including in New 
Brunswick and in my riding or elsewhere, as well as in Quebec, 
many people are suffering terribly as the result of cuts to the 
employment insurance program. It is also clear that the Liberal 
government cares little for people who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has discovered a fund with a surplus of $30 
billion. We must admit that the Minister of Finance has the 
ability to make us think that we are paying for one thing and 
then use the money for something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether my colleague agrees that, once again, this 
government has found the way to take $30 billion that does not 
belong to it but rather to workers and retired people. Does he 
not think that there is probably a good way to describe what the 
government is doing today, but which we cannot utter in the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to hear the 
comments by the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, in New 
Brunswick.  Even before she was elected an MP, I know she was 
involved in helping people.  I heard her speak often in 
connection with all sorts of activities in her area of Acadia, 
and her name was already familiar with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also say that there will be many women among the victims 
of this government's craze to get its hands on money that does 
not belong to it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to have to 
interrupt the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague, the hon. member for 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, for his fine speech on the President 
of Treasury Board's intentions to get his hands on the loot, 
somewhat in the same way as the Minister of Finance did with the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at the figures here.  Going back 20 months, the 
surplus was $30.2 billion, and if the trend continues, a quick 
calculation would indicate that it must be pretty close to $33 
billion.  It is no longer $30 billion, but close to $33 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does this surplus come from?  The public service has 
contributed $14.9 billion, the RCMP $2.4 billion, and finally 
the Canadian Armed Forces $12.9 billion.  Adding all this up, it 
comes to a surplus of $30.2 billion. 
Those were the figures as at March 31, 1998, just about 20 
months ago.  With the projection, I would suggest that the 
figure would now be $33 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of Treasury Board, before being appointed 
Ambassador to Paris, wants to make his time here in the House of 
Commons worthwhile by doing something memorable.  He is getting 
ready to deliberately get his hands on this money.  Now a 
committee is going to be struck to administer this surplus, with 
some friends of the government of course, as was done with André 
Ouellet, the former member for Papineau—Saint-Michel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He was appointed chairman of the Canada Post Corporation, with a 
salary that far exceeds what he was earning as a federal 
minister, without having to be concerned about voters but with 
trips all over the world to see how postal services operate in 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the President of the Treasury Board is about to set up a new 
committee to manage the surpluses, but that committee will 
include very few workers. The minister even neglected to consult 
the unions of the three groups to find out how these surpluses 
could be managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we learned on March 31, 1998, that $3.1 billion must be 
paid to retirees, while $1.8 billion is coming into the fund. 
One might think that if the fund must pay $3.1 billion in 
pensions while receiving only $1.8 billion in contributions, it 
will get smaller every year. Not so. A fund of that magnitude 
can easily earn in excess of 10% annually, without any risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a rate of 10%, an amount of $33 billion will earn $3.3 
billion. The current outlay is $3.1 billion. This means that the 
interest alone provides enough money to pay the pensions to 
retirees. In fact, the government could even decide right now to 
give a contribution holiday to all employees of the public 
service, RCMP and Canadian armed forces. It is worth doing the 
calculating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board, and member for Hull—Aylmer, 
is about to get his hands on $33 billion. What will he do with 
that money? Perhaps he will do like the government did with the 
employment insurance surplus. 
Sixty per cent of workers pay EI premiums but, when they apply 
for benefits, unfortunately six out of ten do not qualify.  They 
are told that they must pay premiums of $2.55 on every $100 of 
insurable earnings but that they will not qualify for benefits. 
Barely four out of ten qualify for benefits, and those benefits 
are for increasingly short periods and increasingly small 
amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the Minister of Human Resources Development, whom the 
member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouta—Les Basques 
sometimes refers to as the wise guy, led a very sheltered life. 
He has no idea what it means to earn $8 or $10 an hour.  He had 
everything handed to him and now he is after the $21 billion 
surplus built up by workers in the past four years.  It is truly 
scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to Bill C-78, I would like to tell the House about a 
very sad case.  This is something that is going on in the riding 
of my colleague, the member for Saint-Jean, with former Singer 
employees.  I am sure members will remember Singer sewing 
machines.  When I was young, my mother always had a Singer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees of this famous multinational cannot get at their 
pension fund because of the federal government's refusal to 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend, I was speaking to one of my friends, a former 
SAL employee and BC mine worker.  His name is Charles Lacroix. 
He told me he began working in the asbestos mines on November 
21, 1970, while he was still very young.  Year after year, he 
paid into the pension fund.

contributed 19 times as much as Charles. The matter of the 
employees' pension fund has not been settled yet. The 
corporation was replaced by a limited partnership called Lab 
Chrysotile. The matter of the pension fund is still before the 
courts. Workers are getting nothing from their pension fund, the 
matter has been dragging on for the past 13 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not sound like Singer, though not as bad? I am told that 
the majority of Singer's former employees are either dead or 
very old. If tomorrow morning they were given $30,000 or 
$50,000, they could not make full use of it. The ball is in the 
government's court; it is wilfully delaying any settlement. 
The matter has been before the courts for I do not know how many 
years. The member for Saint-Jean talked about this earlier this 
morning. He might do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees of the corporation, the asbestos company, of Lab 
Chrysotile, of Mazarin, which is part of this group, are having 
problems. The matter is before the courts, to the delight of the

lawyers. “You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours”. This is 
what is going on. Unfortunately, it is always the most 
vulnerable members of society who foot the bill.

Doug Young learned his lesson on June 2, 1997. He got his 
answer. I congratulate the men and women who ran for the New 
Democratic Party in New Brunswick, and defeated Dominique 
LeBlanc, who was on the same wave length as Doug Young. 
This does not mean Doug Young is unemployed. He is in cahoots 
with the local premier and he will make as much money, if not 
more, through raising a toll on highways over there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his clear presentation. It is always interesting 
to listen to him. His comments always carry a very political 
dimension. I am a great admirer of the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to the Singer workers. People think that the case of 
Singer workers was settled. It was said that Singer workers 
settled in court, that the case was closed. But there is still 
an outstanding issue. I am taking this opportunity to tell 
voters who are listening to us that, from 1942 to 1967, the 
federal government was responsible for that fund. It allowed the 
employer to stop paying contributions and, in the end, the 
employer made off with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the Bloc Quebecois began asking questions. The various 
ministers kept saying that the issue did not come under their 
responsibility. One can understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that Singer workers were the first 
victims of what is happening today? The government could see 
that the surplus was growing, but was unable to tell Singer 
workers “We recognize that we have a responsibility, we will pay 
you”. Instead, the government said “No, we do not want to pay 
you. We have no responsibility in this”. I have always thought 
the government was already thinking about getting its hands on 
the pot, as it is doing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that Singer workers are the first 
victims of what is going on today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, you were in this House. 
Going right back to October 25, 1993, the valiant member for 
Saint-Jean rose in this House every week to ask questions, of 
Doug Young in particular, and then his successor, to get him to 
settle the matter of the former Singer employees as promptly as 
possible.  Here we are in 1999, and it is still not settled.  It 
is now May 25.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what the President of Treasury Board wants?  He 
wants to set up a board with friends of the regime.  But what 
sort of board will it be?  One made up of cronies of the regime, 
of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only look at the quality and the savoir-faire of the 
Minister responsible for Francophonie last week—hon. members know 
they want to get rid of her—when she met with representatives and 
heads of state of the various francophone countries throughout 
the world in Paris, along with my good buddy Jacques Roy.  They 
want to get rid of him too, in an exchange for the President of 
Treasury Board, in a sort of musical chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the member from Acadia, who is here, has 
heard of the situation. They were talking about it this morning 
on the radio. The Minister responsible for he Francophonie—an 
insult to Acadians—did not even know the year the Acadians were 
deported. Our Minister responsible for the Francophonie 
dishonoured us in Paris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jacques Roy, fortunately, set the matter straight. In a few 
years, she will talk about a “small deportation”. What is going 
on now in Kosovo is exactly what happened in 1755 in Acadia, 
except there were no television cameras then. It is exactly the 
same thing. A people was destroyed. They tried to eradicate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said “It was some time in the 17th century”. She is 
out by a century. When you're in the 20th century and you are 
out by a century it is a 5% error. For the Minister responsible 
for the Francophonie, this in unforgivable. Fortunately, Jacques 
Roy was there to set things straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, in the period reserved for questions and comments, like 
to give my colleague, the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, the 
opportunity to add to this. She is entitled, while she questions 
me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must admit that I took the plane early this morning, and I was 
not aware that the minister did not know that the deportation 
took place in 1755. Everyone in Acadia knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this is simply more proof that a number of ministers in 
cabinet know nothing of us. It was the same thing with Doug 
Young, as my hon. colleague indicated. He did indeed get a 
one-way ticket, but it is unfortunate that he took advantage of 
people, with the help of his colleague Camille Thériault, who 
made himself many millions in New Brunswick. Perhaps we will 
resolve that on June 7 as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply suggest to the 
Prime Minister that he dismiss his Minister responsible for the 
Francophonie right away. She has done a disservice to Acadians 
and to all Francophones, especially Quebecers in Canada. She has 
not represented us well, she does not deserve her position. She 
must be dismissed immediately. Hats off to Jacques Roy, who set 
things straight. Fortunately he was there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to speak at third 
reading of Bill C-78.  This bill ensures the long term viability 
of public sector pension plans and puts them on a more solid 
footing by introducing the investment of contributions in public 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has shown that investments in the markets yield a 
better rate of return, which tends to reduce the costs of the 
plans.  Under the current legislation investment of contributions 
is limited to government bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 also establishes an investment board, independent of 
the government, that will be responsible for investing 
contributions in accordance with the interests of the 
participants in the plans.  Its obligations and authority are set 
out in the bill to ensure its independence and also its 
accountability. 
The bill also contains provisions to ensure that it is an 
effective operation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the investment board, it has been suggested that 
its directors should be appointed as the governor in council sees 
fit.  Other parties have expressed concern that these 
appointments would give the government an opportunity to practise 
patronage.  The bill provides that directors be appointed to hold 
office during good behaviour for a three year period.  Directors' 
terms of office may be renewed for one additional term.  The 
appointment process set out in the bill shows clearly that our 
intention is to ensure that directors are competent and 
independent from government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been blamed for failing to include the participants in 
these pension plans in managing the plans.  The provisions of the 
bill show us that such is not the case.  Current and retired 
employees will be represented in the management of the pension 
plans through advisory committees that will henceforth be 
mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These committees are comprised of representatives of employees 
and retired employees.  These committees will also participate in 
appointing the directors of the public sector investment board. 
They will be able to appoint a certain number of members of the 
nominating committee which recommends candidates for the 
positions of directors of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During debates in the House and in the committee we were 
reproached for failing to consult sufficiently with stakeholders. 
As we have indicated, we consulted with participants and with 
retired employees through advisory committees on the plans for a 
number of years.  The need to make changes was recognized by the 
advisory committee on the Public Service Superannuation Act in 
its 1996 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board even established an advisory 
committee to arrive at an agreement on a new framework for 
managing and financing these plans.  This committee, comprised of 
representatives of employees, associations of retired employees, 
representatives of the RCMP and the Canadian forces, met last 
year on a regular basis.  As we know, although there has been 
agreement on most of the changes proposed through this bill, 
these consultations have stumbled over the disposition of the 
actual surplus in the plans.  The government thus had to take the 
necessary decisions and move forward by proposing improvements to 
the financial management of the plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains provisions pertaining to the management 
of the plans.  It takes into account the interests of the 
participants, retired employees and the Canadian taxpayers as 
well.  It reflects most of the elements on which we had agreed in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal in the bill that pertains to the disposition of the 
current surplus has aroused strong criticism from certain 
quarters.  However, the public, and thus the Canadian taxpayer, 
supports the government's position on this question.  This 
position is supported by court decisions as well as by the 
opinions of actuaries and other pension specialists.  Many 
newspapers have also indicated their support for the government's 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been blamed for failing to make public sector 
pension plans subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act.  The 
objective of this legislation is to protect participants in 
employers' pension plans in areas of activity under federal 
jurisdiction.  The Public Service Superannuation Act already 
provides equivalent protection to the participants in these 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to this bill, it has been contended that private sector 
employers would exert pressure to obtain funds from the pension 
plans set up for their employees.  However, such cannot be the 
case.  It would be hard to imagine provincial governments, which 
are responsible for employers' pension plans in areas of activity 
under provincial jurisdiction, allowing private sector employers 
to withdraw funds from the pension accounts they administer in a 
fiduciary capacity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the plans as amended by this bill will be placed 
on a solid footing which will permit co-management once the 
participants are ready to assume their share of the management 
and risks which are a part of any pension plan.  The government 
remains open to that possibility.

public service employees this bill will be advantageous to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to have the opportunity to ask a question with respect to this 
bill.  It is one that I just cannot seem to get an answer to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people are really concerned about this bill.  Two 
very widely disparate issues are at stake here.  One is the 
definition of survivor.  The other issue is from those people who 
have paid into and are benefiting potentially from this pension 
plan. I would like to find out from anybody on the other side, 
including the member who just spoke, if their assurances that 
everything is fine are really genuine and to be believed, then 
why are so many people so deeply concerned about this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if the Liberals' position is defensible, then why 
are they not willing to debate it at length?  Why is there 
closure at every stage on a bill as important as this one? 
Clearly, if it is defensible, I would think they would want to 
have a longer time for debate so that the truth in the matter 
could come out and people could be persuaded that this is a good 
bill and deserves support.  Instead, what we have is closure and 
those people who are already receiving pension benefits and those 
who are still paying into it are worried about their future do 
not have an opportunity to mobilize, to make their phone calls 
and get their faxes and letters sent here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the member reconciles the difference. 
Why is it that if everything is okay, these people understand it 
is not okay?  There is a botch-up here somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting as I stated 
earlier today that the hon. member talks about the proposal of 
extending this debate for six months. Members talk about the 
great groundswell they believe is going to occur, but it has not 
occurred because Canadians are generally pleased with this bill. 
It is everything the unions along with the employer have sat down 
to discuss.  There was only one part where one of the unions was 
concerned about the surplus and wanted a percentage of it and all 
the rest of the items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we discussed earlier, it is a legislated plan.  The employees 
and the retirees are guaranteed their pension by this government 
and by the taxpayers, paid by taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern of the Reform Party, aside from the fact that many 
of the things were agreed on, is that we are in effect taking 
what belongs to Canadian taxpayers, which is an accounting entry, 
and reducing the debt by $30 billion over a period of time.  The 
Reform Party does not like that.  Why do they not like it? 
Because that is going to reduce the cost to Canadian taxpayers in 
interest that they pay to bondholders.  Why does the Reform Party 
not like that?  Because all of a sudden the Liberal Party is 
going to get credit for reducing the debt by $30 billion.  Why 
does the Reform Party not like that?  Because everything they 
have been talking about, everything the Reform Party is all about 
is being done by this government on the basis of good fiscal 
management.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem is that the Reform Party is not only bankrupt 
of the platform it has carried for six years but it is now trying 
to steal the Conservatives' plan by uniting the right. The hon. 
member for St. Albert realizes we are on the right track. He 
would do exactly what we are doing here because the unions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The parliamentary secretary is trying to put words in my 
mouth.  Let us remember that he is the one who is speaking and he 
is the one who is speaking for the Liberal Party, not for the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a point of 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is not much they can 
speak about.  That is what the difficulty is.  Earlier I said 
that I would not use the term hot air because that would be 
unparliamentary, but taking all of that into account, they 
complain about the lack of time but they never state anything 
new.  It is all on the record.  Their speeches are just cut and 
paste and regurgitate.  They hand them out to each other.  It is 
amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even on the first day of the debate, the hon. member for St. 
Albert, who at least is very much aware of this issue, had to 
pass his notes on to another speaker because he had another 
engagement but that is understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill the formula for calculating retirement benefits 
will be based on average salary during the best consecutive five 
years of service instead of six.  That is very positive when we 
take into account that the formula by which the plan benefits are 
integrated with the Canada pension plan or the Quebec pension 
plan benefits in the plan member's favour.  The new formula will 
mean a somewhat smaller reduction in the plan's benefits when an 
employee begins to draw CPP— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, I have 
to interrupt because we have another question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that there is no prohibition for hot 
air in this Chamber.  Were there such a prohibition it would put 
a serious impediment in the path of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we know this is a fixed benefit 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that we get up and regurgitate.  The Liberals have said 
this in every speech they have handed out to their people.  I 
want him to know that I very seldom use notes.  When I get up to 
speak I make sure my outline is in here.  I have never ever used 
a speech that someone else has written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My real question is on the pension issue.  There is a surplus. 
Quite clearly there is a $30 billion surplus.  They have 
collected $30 billion more than they need, actuarially computed 
at the present time.  It is true that the taxpayers put more 
money into that fund than was needed so the taxpayers should be 
entitled to have the money taken back and applied to the debt, no 
problem.  When he says that Reform has a problem with that, he is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the contributions made by the employees?  They have 
also been overcharged.  Are they not entitled to at least a 
proportion, an actuarially computed proportion of that 
overpayment?  The Liberals are failing to notice that they are 
overcharging them and they do not want to give the money back. 
There is a word for that which I cannot use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I notice that he should use 
notes, that he should do research, because the difficulty we have 
is that he does not understand the facts.  That is part of the 
difficulty he is facing. I wish the hon. member who uses a 
computer at his desk would put some of the research material in, 
maybe get on to the Internet and tap into the government's 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take into account that with the government an actuarial 
evaluator determines how much money is actually required on a 
year to year basis.  Even if there is a surplus the evaluator 
still determines on a year to year basis how much is required, 
not taking into account the surplus.  That is why since 1991-92 
the surplus has increased to $30 billion.  That is what brings us 
to the point of dealing with this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the auditor general has asked us to reduce the amount of 
interest we pay on that.  We have conformed with the accounting 
rules that the hon. member for St. Albert should have educated 
the other hon. members on to ensure they understood the basic 
facts we were dealing with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the hon. member does not realize we take into 
account that in most pension plans the employees contribute 40%. 
What has happened here is that the taxpayer is contributing 70%. 
In effect, that is why Canadian taxpayers year after year 
contribute more than they would in any other pension plan, even 
in the private sector.  That is what we are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take into account the way the grass is growing, I cannot 
understand why the Reform Party wants Canadian taxpayers to 
continue contributing to the point where they will contribute 
almost the total amount and the employee contributes almost zero. 
I do not understand why the Reform Party wants to take from the 
taxpayers' money to pay for the civil servants' pension.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order with regard to Bill C-78. My point of order 
challenges the procedural validity of this bill.  Bill C-78 
should not go forward because the introduction of Bill C-78 was 
not preceded by a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, a ways and means motion is 
required when there is a charge upon the people.  In Erskine 
May's 21st edition on page 726 it summarizes what is covered 
under the term “charges upon the people”.  Point five states 
that a ways and means motion is required when there are 
“provisions for the payment into the consolidated fund or the 
national loans fund of receipts, which do not arise from 
taxation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker made a similar statement on December 2, 1998 when 
ruling on Bill S-13.  You said, Mr. Speaker, that a ways and 
means motion is required “if a charge raises funds that are 
channelled to the consolidated revenue fund”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 empowers the President of the Treasury Board in three 
clauses to deposit into the consolidated revenue fund pension 
surpluses arising from contributions or investments.  Clause 96, 
subsection 44.4(2)(b) on page 80 would allow the president to do 
this in regard to the public service pension fund. Clause 152, 
subsection 55.4(2)(b) on page 134 deals with the Canadian forces 
pension fund.  Clause 199, subsection 29.4(2)(b) on pages 185 and 
186 deals with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police pension fund.  I 
quote clause 96, subsection 44.4(2)(b): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be paid out of the public service pension fund, and 
into the consolidated revenue fund, the amount, at the time and 
in the manner, that the Treasury Board determines on the 
recommendation of the Minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that the pension funds in question contain 
funds from three specific sources:  contributions by the 
government of Canada; contributions by the civil servants as a 
percentage of their pay, and we just heard the parliamentary 
secretary tell us that it was approximately 70% paid by the 
Government of Canada and 30% paid by the employees; and a return 
on the foregoing moneys which have been invested in government 
bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore plain that the money deducted from the 
paycheques of public servants will be transferred to the 
consolidated revenue fund by Bill C-78 at the time and in the 
manner that the Treasury Board determines at the recommendation 
of the minister. The measures in Bill C-78 clearly represent a 
charge upon the people as defined in Erskine May's 21st edition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public service of Canada is currently comprised of around 
300,000 employees.  Bill C-78 will affect 650,000 current and 
former employees of the public service.  However, the public 
service of Canada is open to all Canadians to apply without 
discrimination.  Bill C-78 deals with those who have worked in 
the past, those who work there at present and those who will work 
there in the future which potentially includes any Canadian 
citizen. 
It is therefore a charge upon the people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This was confirmed during hearings on Bill C-78 at the natural 
resources and government operations committee on May 3, 1999 by 
Mr. Ross Hornby, senior general counsel of the Department of 
Justice.  He said at 5.20 p.m.: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no element of contract involved in it (the public 
service pension plan) or any contractual rights that flow from 
it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from these comments that this is legislated taxation 
imposed on employees who do not even have the right to express an 
opinion on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in your ruling of December 2, 1998 you said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern legislation frequently makes provisions for the imposition 
of other types of fees or payment which, although not taxes in a 
strict sense, have enough of the characteristics of taxation to 
require to be treated as charges upon the people and therefore to 
be authorized by a ways and means resolution moved by a minister 
of the crown. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that because these plans are legislated through 
acts of parliament and could affect any Canadian citizen as a 
potential employee of the government they maintain enough 
characteristics of taxation to be treated as a charge upon the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 should not proceed any further because it has not met 
the requirements of our financial procedures.  Since Bill C-78 
was not preceded by a ways and means motion, Bill C-78 is not 
properly before this House and should be removed from the order 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore humbly request that you, Mr. Speaker, defer 
the vote on third reading of Bill C-78 until you have had time to 
research the arguments and report back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  This is a point of 
order and it is fairly serious, so we will ask the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services to reply.  This will be on 
the record and the Speaker will make a ruling. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to make 
a few points for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that there was no ways and means motion 
covering the original Public Service Superannuation Act.  That is 
because the contributions are not tax related upon the general 
population but are contributions made by a defined and limited 
group of people in return for the fund benefits.  Ways and means 
motions are required only for tax measures and are charged as a 
whole to the people, which we call taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very strange that the Reform Party would choose this 
moment, half an hour before we are to vote, to propose this.  Why 
did it not bring this up at second reading or in committee? 
Again this is a dilatory measure that the Reform Party is trying. 
I request that we proceed with the vote as scheduled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will consult with 
the clerks and will have a ruling forthwith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to 
remind you that there is an order of the House that we vote 
tonight.  I hope that is taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In response to the minister, I have put forth a point of 
order which states that the bill is not properly before the House 
and therefore— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We should not 
get into any more debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-78, but not because I like it. It is another 
attack against workers in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should remember that the federal government took over $20 
billion from the employment insurance fund, money which belonged 
to workers; this year the surplus is expected to grow by another 
$7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the bill before us today, Bill C-78, the government will 
take another $30 billion from a fund that is just as important. 
It is significant not only for the public service pension funds. 
I believe the government has the responsibility to show the way. 
What it is saying to private companies is “Look. 
You will now be able to take money from your workers' pension 
fund”. This is exactly what bill C-78 is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When workers have a collective agreement, when money is set 
aside for them, I say the federal government has no right 
stealing their money to balance its budget and have a zero 
deficit just as I said it had no right stealing workers' money 
from the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they are members of PSAC working in government offices 
or members of the RCMP, the government has been undermining 
their morale for years by denying them salary increases, and 
today by trying to lay its hands on their pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is money that was negotiated at the bargaining table and it 
is money that belongs to workers, not to the Minister of Finance 
so that he can once again tell us what a fine job he is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Liberal government is going after the workers of 
this country is unacceptable and immoral.  Whether it be EI or 
public sector pension funds, the money still comes out of 
workers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what the Liberals were saying.  I say that it is 
unacceptable and that Canadians will not stand for it.  The 
government has gone after those who have lost their jobs.  Now, 
it is going after future retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this deplorable. The government is completely in the 
wrong and Canadians will not forget it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take the five or six minutes that remain to 
make a couple of comments with respect to two aspects of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, very briefly I want to associate myself with the comments 
made by my colleague, the member for Acadie—Bathurst, who spoke 
very eloquently about why the New Democratic Party is so 
profoundly opposed to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensioners are being robbed of a $30 billion surplus.  Let us be 
clear.  There will be $15 billion taken from the public service 
pension plan, $2.4 billion from the RCMP and almost $13 billion 
from the Canadian forces.  I join with my colleagues in saying 
that the New Democratic Party strongly opposes this provision in 
the legislation which will affect something like 670,000 public 
servants, including retirees and current contributors.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to deal with another issue 
and that is the issue of same sex benefits.  I deeply regret that 
the government has chosen to include in legislation that deals 
with the pension surplus the issue of equity and justice for gay 
and lesbian people who are involved in committed, loving 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear that I and my colleagues strongly 
support this long overdue justice and equality for those who are 
involved in gay and lesbian relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who ask what this conjugal relationship is all 
about.  Is it some new and dangerous provision in the 
legislation?  Indeed, one of the Reform Party members, the hon. 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain, said that this bill would 
destroy the very moral fibre of the country.  He said it is a 
dangerous, destructive bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that this bill is simply extending not 
any kind of special rights to gay and lesbian people who are 
involved in relationships, but equal rights and equal 
responsibilities.  The Supreme Court of Canada ruled just last 
week in the case of M. v H. that gay and lesbian people are to be 
treated with equality and that includes those of us who are 
involved in committed, loving relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who say that the notion of a conjugal relationship is 
something new and undefined, I suggest that they read existing 
legislation.  For example, in the existing Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act there is a provision that on the death of 
a member or a former member extends a survivor's pension to any 
person of the opposite sex who establishes that the person was 
cohabiting in a conjugal relationship with the member or former 
member for at least one year immediately before the death of the 
member or former member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the legislation now.  For those who say this is somehow 
a great attack on the moral fibre of the country and a dangerous 
and destructive new concept, I say:  Where have they been?  It is 
already there and it has not caused any difficulty in 
interpretation whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are federal public servants who contribute to pension 
plans, whether they be members of the Canadian armed forces, 
members of the RCMP or members of the public service, who are 
involved in gay or lesbian relationships.  Why should they not be 
entitled to draw their pension as any other Canadian is entitled 
to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter recently from a woman in Vancouver who 
talked about her relationship with her partner of more than 13 
years.  She said that her partner had died of cancer.  She was 
diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  Before that she was an active, 
healthy, 48 year old woman.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shared everything as 
life partners.  We were emotionally and financially 
interdependent.  Every aspect of our lives was connected, 
inter-related.  We celebrated our lives together and were embraced 
by family, friends, and many diverse communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shared in 
the parenting of two children.  I continue to care for them and 
support them as a co-parent myself and also on behalf of their 
mother who has died. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a family.  This was a family of two lesbians who shared 
their lives.  If they contributed to a pension plan, they should 
be entitled to that benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I note that the Supreme Court of Canada in M. v H. has 
pointed out the characteristics of a conjugal relationship.  It 
stated:  “They include shared shelter, sexual and personal 
behaviour, services, social activities, economic support and 
children, as well as the societal perception of the couple”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My relationship with my partner, Max, is an important part of my 
life, just as the relationships are of other members of the House 
who are heterosexual with their spouses.  All I ask for, and all 
gay and lesbian people in this country ask for, is equality; 
nothing more and nothing less.  For that reason we support those 
provisions of the bill, but we must oppose the theft of $30 
billion in pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 6.15 p.m., 
pursuant to order made on Thursday, May 13, 1999, it is my duty 
to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the third reading stage of the bill now 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, there is an outstanding point of order 
also before the House and that point of order may be ruled upon 
at any time prior to the bill being read for the actual vote. 
The Speaker and the clerks are in consultation as we speak.

order raised by the hon. member for St. Albert concerning the 
procedural acceptability of Bill C-78, an act to establish the 
Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to amend the Public 
Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces Superannuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the 
Defence Services Pension Continuation Act, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada Post 
Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to another 
act.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member contends that Bill C-78 imposes a “charge upon 
the people” in that it proposes to make any of these pension 
plan surpluses payable to the consolidated revenue fund.  This, 
he argues, constitutes a form of tax which would require the bill 
to be preceded by a ways and means motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time available to me I have carefully reviewed the 
remarks made by the hon. member and I have noted that he makes no 
mention of the fact that any shortfalls in these plans accrue as 
a liability to the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the heading of “Matters requiring authorization by Ways 
and Means”, May in the 22nd edition at page 777 states in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If—money raised by statutory imposition—is—to be used for 
the benefit of the public at large or for purposes which might 
otherwise have required to be financed from the Consolidated 
Fund, that imposition is likely to need authorization by a Ways 
and Means resolution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the hon. Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services has pointed out, the legislation affects not the 
Canadian public in general but “a defined and limited group of 
people” who, as co-contributors, will be entitled to a defined 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently I cannot agree with the hon. member for St. Albert. 
I rule that Bill C-78 is properly before the House and we will 
proceed with the vote on third reading.

Canadian forces helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us listen to this litany of shame:  February 1993, Sea King 
ditched in Gulf of Mexico due to electrical systems failure; 
April 1994, Sea King crashed in New Brunswick killing two crew 
and injuring others; August 1994, Sea King fleet grounded 
following emergency landing; May 1995, Labrador had emergency 
landing due to mechanical problems; September 1995, Sea King had 
emergency landing due to mechanical problems; August 1996, three 
Sea Kings grounded due to cracks in tail section; January 1997, 
Labrador crashed in Georgia Strait; October 1998, Labrador crash 
killed six; February 1999, Sea King in trouble due to bad main 
rotorhead; March 1999, Labrador adrift on lake due to losing both 
engines; March 1999, Sea King had emergency landing due to 
electrical systems; May 1999, Sea King makes forced landing due 
to leak in hydraulic system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one more date of note.  On June 26, 1986 the Treasury 
Board began the process of replacing the Sea Kings.  Almost 13 
years have passed since then, 13 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government turned our forces helicopters into 
hell-copters when in June or July of 1995 the cabinet chose to 
delay the purchase of the replacement helicopters.  It was a 
cheap political decision at the time but has become costly and 
poses serious issues in terms of the safety of Canadian lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These mechanical albatrosses may have led to the unnecessary 
deaths of Canadians and continue to present safety hazards and 
risk to life.  I say unnecessary because the Liberal government 
made a very specific decision to delay the purchase of the 
helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if the minister and his government did not know of 
the problems.  Headlines have screamed out the following news to 
Canadians for some time:  Labradors unable to join rescue; 
helicopters grounded again; aging helicopters risk lives; faulty 
chopper delays recovery of 11-year old; helicopter malfunctioned 
days before crash; helicopter kills two veteran firefighters; the 
Liberals' chopper whopper; Sea Kings a threat; Sea King makes 
emergency landing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may respond with platitudes about taking time to 
make sure the right choice is made, care for fiscal 
responsibility, that plans are proceeding well and the need to 
ensure the finished product is safe.  Canadians are sick and 
tired of excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must answer three questions.  First, what 
specific short term alternatives has the government explored, 
including short term leases until the new helicopters are 
operational?  Second, what specific efforts has the government 
made to speed up the procurement process and why exactly have 
these efforts failed?  Third, what month will the replacement 
helicopters be operational? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A failure on behalf of the Liberal government to openly, 
honestly and completely answer these three questions is a gross 
betrayal not of me but of the families and communities who have 
lost loved ones, a betrayal of Canadian forces personnel who have 
no alternative but to continue to use these aging helicopters, a 
betrayal of all Canadians and a betrayal of good government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express my gratitude for all Canadian forces personnel who 
will bear the brunt of the Liberal government's mismanagement of 
the issue.  They are the heroes in this tragedy of errors wrought 
by the government.

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, maritime helicopters are 
essential to the mission of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our duty to ensure that the Canadian forces possess the 
equipment they require to accomplish their mission, both in 
Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1994 white paper, the minister made a commitment to 
replace the Sea Kings, and this is an essential project for the 
Minister of National Defence.  On numerous occasions, the 
minister has expressed his desire to implement a strategy 
involving the acquisition of maritime helicopters in the near 
future. 
In fact, the minister has said he hoped to make an announcement 
on this issue in the current year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Department officials are currently reviewing a draft of the 
requirements established for maritime helicopters. The statement 
of operational requirements, which is more or less the basis of 
the project, is undergoing several revisions and rewriting, and 
is the object of a close review at several levels within the 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on the basis of that document that we will buy several 
millions of dollars worth of very complex military equipment. 
Therefore, it is critical that we do what is necessary to ensure 
the process is implemented properly from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that the industry, Canadians and any other 
person interested in this issue can read and understand the 
statement of requirements that will be released. 
However, more importantly, the new maritime helicopter must meet 
Canadians forces' policy requirements and operational 
requirements. This is a must, and there will be no compromise on 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do our utmost to ensure the Sea Kings remain in service 
until the arrival of the new maritime helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent minor problems were dealt with, and we will do what 
it takes to make sure our aircraft are safe to fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sea Kings will be upgraded if need be, and I have no doubt 
we will be able to carry out our mission with the equipment 
currently available to the Canadian armed forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise today again on a question 
I asked regarding the exploratory seismic licences that were 
given to the company Corridor Resources from the Canada-Nova 
Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this concern because those seismic drilling exploration 
leases, which we have now found out are six months delayed so 
they could be done in the wintertime, are right in the heart of 
the lobster spawning grounds off the coast of Cape Breton, on the 
inside coast in the gulf and around P.E.I. where the member for 
Malpeque is from, as well as in the New Brunswick area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this company is allowed to have the exploratory licence to do 
its seismic drilling, it will expand the drilling throughout the 
entire gulf.  This means that the province of Quebec and the 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador will be incorporated in 
this concern as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am speaking on this today is that over 2,000 
lobster fishermen in Cape Breton, New Brunswick and P.E.I. have 
very serious concerns about their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the downturn of the groundfish fishery a lot of fishermen 
have turned to lobster or shellfish as their main livelihood in 
order to live in their coastal communities and look after their 
families.  They do not make very much money doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we allow this to go forward we are risking the possible long 
term environmental damage of a very sustainable stock.  In 
Newfoundland, in fact in all Atlantic Canada and Quebec it is an 
over half a billion dollar industry.  The government only spends 
about $330,000 a year on experiments and the science and study of 
the lobster itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government to be very cautious and prudent in 
its environmental assessment of the project to ensure that there 
will be no damage in the short term or the long term to the 
lobster stocks, scallop stocks, crab stocks or whatever shellfish 
is out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are indications that the groundfish breed out there as 
well.  We must be very cautious to protect those species so that 
in turn we can protect the livelihood of thousands of people and 
their families in coastal communities in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This begs another question.  Why did the Fisheries Resource 
Conservation Council along with the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans not immediately put a halt to this lease before all 
environmental assessments were done in the long term?  We cannot 
do a proper assessment in six months. It is 1999 and we are still 
in the embryonic stage of wondering if seismic oil and gas 
drilling definitely affects the lobsters. There are a lot of 
indications from the fishermen that indeed they do. The DFO 
spends very little money on science in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government again that the FRCC, the DFO's advisory 
board and the DFO itself, the department responsible for 
management of the habitat area and the fish stocks as well, be 
extremely prudent and cautious in their efforts in order to 
protect the livelihood of thousands of people in Atlantic Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I answered 
previously, we are pleased to see that the member opposite shares 
our concerns and the minister's concerns over fish habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned about being cautious.  If there is one thing the 
minister has clearly shown, it is that he has made some tough 
decisions in terms of protecting fish and fish habitat. He will 
continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the specifics of this case, the recent issuance of 
an exploratory licence for the Cape Breton block, it is important 
to recognize that this is not a blanket approval for future oil 
and gas activities.  The licence only confers the right to 
explore the lands covered by the licence, drill and test for 
petroleum and obtain a production licence in respect of those 
lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each exploration project proposal under this licence will have 
to undergo an environmental assessment and will have to be 
approved by the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the concerns that have been identified in the Cape Breton 
block, the board has decided to put a six months hold on any 
exploration activities so that additional discussions and 
environmental analyses can be carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strategic environmental assessment is currently being done for 
the Cape Breton block in order to identify and provide an initial 
evaluation of the issues on which future project specific 
assessments completed by the industry should focus.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise again today to raise the subject of an unsafe 
condition in Kelowna, British Columbia, identified by the 
Department of Transport over 11 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is brought on by a puzzling situation where Nav 
Canada within the last few weeks announced a $90 million 
reduction in fees voluntarily.  I do not understand why it has 
reduced its fees by $90 million and still refuses to replace the 
air traffic control tower in Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read into the record the operational condition 
report dated November 4, 1987: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the location and/or the height of the control tower a 
portion of the runway and taxiways is not visible.  A runway 
incursion going unnoticed is now a major safety concern.  The 
margin of safety has been jeopardized.  A restricted line of 
sight visibility has been identified as a major safety concern by 
the Canadian Aviation Safety Board. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report lists only two possible solutions to the problem. 
First, raise the present control tower two or three stories to a 
height that would ensure line of sight for all manoeuvring areas 
or, second, build a brand new control tower in a location which 
would ensure line of sight for all manoeuvring areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manager in reply to this report by the inspector said line 
of sight difficulties had been recognized as a problem in 
Kelowna.  The inspector identified it and the manager confirmed 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this situation be safe now and how can Nav Canada refuse 
to replace the air traffic control tower or raise the present 
one?  How can it be safe now when it was not safe in 1987?  Why 
was the tower required to be replaced in 1987 but is not required 
to be now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport 
please reply to that question and explain why Nav Canada is 
reducing its charges by $90 million and still refusing to replace 
the condemned tower in Kelowna?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to respond to the issue raised by the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester this evening on the air traffic control 
tower at Kelowna airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by assuring the member that Nav Canada applies air 
traffic control procedures to address visibility limitations such 
as those at Kelowna airport.  Transport Canada is satisfied with 
the corporation's actions to mitigate any potential safety risk 
until a more permanent solution is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that Transport Canada no longer has an operational 
role with respect to the provision of air traffic control 
services in Canada.  Nav Canada is responsible for these services 
including the operation, location and construction of air traffic 
control towers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that the airport operator is expanding the apron 
parking area and construction has already begun.  This will 
contribute to alleviating the obstruction of views caused by the 
parking of large aircraft.  In the longer term Nav Canada is 
continuing its efforts to install an effective video system and 
is commencing feasibility studies for the location of a new 
tower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, safety is Transport Canada's top priority and the 
Minister of Transport continues to be responsible for safety 
oversight.  The member may be assured that Transport Canada will continue 
to monitor the Kelowna airport as part of the department's 
ongoing airport inspection program.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
