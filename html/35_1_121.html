<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MARINETRANSPORTATIONSECURITYACT">MARINE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (for the Minister of Transport)</B> 
moved that Bill C-38, an act to provide for the security of 
marine transportation, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary toMinister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure as an Atlantic Canadian to have an 
opportunity to speak on this very important bill.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	I rise in the House in support of the Marine Transportation 
Security Act and to explain to members of this House the need 
for a single comprehensive act to prevent acts of violence which 
could be detrimental to Canada's marine interests.
<P>
	Canada is for the most part a haven from violence for many 
other parts of the world. To maintain our security we must, just 
as we admonish our children, be prepared and avoid danger. It is 
far better to prevent violence than to suffer its consequences. 
Canadians as evidenced by their abhorrence of violence and 
their support for strengthened firearms control want to end the 
needless loss and tragedy caused by preventable acts of 
violence.
<P>
	The Marine Transportation Security Act will help prevent 
needless loss to Canadians, their marine transportation system 
and its operators, users, employees and dependants. The bill we 
are debating today recognizes that Canada is not currently 
facing any dire threat. However it also acknowledges that 
threats do occur and that to minimize potential injury we must 
be ready to deal with these threats in their earliest stages.
<P>
	Security is commendable at ports under the control of Canada 
Ports Corporation particularly at the port of Vancouver where 
vessel and port operators practise co-operative security. This 
bill will ensure that Canada has an appropriate legislative 
framework which enables the implementation of basic levels of 
security wherever  required and with the flexibility to respond 
rapidly should danger increase.
<P>
	Legislation does exist which enables the Minister of 
Transport to take measures to prevent acts of violence occurring 
by air and rail transportation. However, it should be a matter of 
concern to members of this House that there is not at the present 
time any comprehensive legislation in Canada authorizing the 
government to take preventive security action to protect 
Canada's marine interests.
<P>
	Canada endorsed and promoted compliance with voluntary 
international security measures designed to protect passengers 
and crews on board ships. Use of these measures in Canada and 
other nations has however been inconsistent. Our marine 
industry and those it touches remain vulnerable.
<P>
	Security provisions in existing marine transportation 
legislation such as they are are fragmented and inadequate. 
Different legislation applies dependent on flag state, type of 
vessel, port, waterway and marine facility.
<P>
	No Canadian legislation is specifically concerned with 
preventing acts of violence. None ties together the various 
elements of the marine industry in a way that can provide the 
appropriate and timely response necessary to react to security 
threats.
<P>
	The variety of legislation that might apply to any vessel, 
facility, waterway or person depending on the location and 
segment of the marine industry involved serves to delay rather 
than expedite response to threatening situations.
<P>
	In addition to the potential for confusion, the lack of an 
appropriate legislative vehicle for marine security does not 
allow effective response. Use of different legal frameworks to 
provide for security would result in different security regimes 
with more confusion, less compliance and higher costs.
<P>
	In examining solutions to the lack of preventive security 
authority, the government considered the use of existing 
legislation and found it to be inappropriate to the task.
<P>
	The Emergencies Act for example, while allowing preventive 
regulations to be made, applies only when an emergency has 
been declared. This limits its preventive utility. Further, 
members will recall this act was not invoked even during the 
1991 Persian Gulf crisis.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7674"> 7674 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The Criminal Code and the Security Offences Act while 
providing authority to respond to security incidents do not 
sanction preventive action.
<P>
	The Canada Shipping Act is principally concerned with the 
safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment 
but it is not germane to security from acts of violence in the 
broad context of the marine industry.
<P>
	The Canada Shipping Act, the Canada Ports Corporation Act, 
the Harbour Commissions Act, the Toronto Harbour 
Commissioners Act, the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners Act, 
the Public Harbours and Ports Facilities Act and the St. 
Lawrence Seaway Authority Act, apart from their obvious 
territorial and jurisdictional limitations do not provide specific 
authority or enforcement capacity with respect to preventive 
security measures.
<P>
	Before bringing these proposals forward non-statutory 
methods of preventing acts of violence against marine targets 
were also considered. There are however a variety of problems 
with this approach. In considering self-regulations the fact that 
the seaborne element of the industry is largely under foreign flag 
would create unequal conditions between vessels and would be 
unenforceable in a similar vein.
<P>
	Canadian ports operate under mixed ownership with different 
statutes and authorities. Equality in application and 
enforcement of requirements under self-regulation would also 
be unachievable regarding such ports. It would be unrealistic to 
believe that either voluntary compliance or self-regulation 
would provide a rapid, consistent response to any threat in such 
a diverse industry.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, despite the performance of Ports 
Canada police and the North West CruiseShip Association, 
voluntary compliance with marine security measures in Canada 
and elsewhere in the world has been generally low. It is apparent 
there is little practical alternative to regulation. The high degree 
of non-compliance with voluntary security standards for 
international passenger vessels and the predominant view of 
other major commercial segments of the industry that there is no 
need due to the current lack of threat underline particularly the 
need for regulated preparation. The fact there is no threat to 
Canada at the present time should not prevent us and deter us 
from being prepared for such an eventuality.
<P>
	Options to a single, newly minted act have also been 
considered, including the retention of the current regime, 
amending existing marine transportation legislation on an act by 
act basis, and amending the various transportation legislation. 
Amending all existing marine transportation security acts by an 
omnibus bill was also considered.
<P>
	After thorough consideration of various options for achieving 
appropriate security regarding the marine transportation system 
including voluntary compliance, self-regulation and the various 
legislative alternatives, the government has concluded that the 
most reasonable, efficient and effective method is to enact a 
comprehensive Marine Transportation Security Act.
<P>
	This act has come with a good deal of consideration by the 
Department of Transport. The Marine Transportation Security 
Act is such a comprehensive act providing the requirement I 
have spoken to previously. It incorporates all appropriate 
security authorities and provisions in one document, thereby 
allowing for ease of maintenance and compliance. The bill will 
permit consistent, equitable implementation and enforcement 
and can, if need be, apply to all elements of the industry in 
Canada regardless of their location or nationality. It will ensure 
the government's ability to respond quickly and appropriately to 
changing threat conditions.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The Marine Transportation Security Act does not apply to 
vessels and facilities under the authority of the Minister of 
National Defence. Government vessels or facilities, where no 
commercial activity is involved, will not be subject to 
regulation because they are adequately provided for by the 
government's security policy and the government's ability to 
control them. Pleasure craft, fishing vessels and small 
commercial craft in ports are also not candidates for regulation 
as they do not provide the same attractiveness as terrorist targets 
as do other segments of the industry.
<P>
	The international cruise vessel industry and the ports serving 
it would be the main regulatory priority once this legislation is 
in place. Except for relatively few agencies such as the North 
West CruiseShip Association, compliance with voluntary 
international security standards by the cruise industry while in 
Canada has been inconsistent, in part no doubt because of the 
lack of a perceived threat there.
<P>
	There is no lack of perceived threat here I think.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> It's a big impression.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> This priority is in line with Canada's 
commitment to the practical standards developed by the 
international marine organization and the determination of this 
government that the history of violent acts against cruise vessel 
passengers elsewhere in the world will not be replayed here in 
Canada.
<P>
	To Atlantic Canada which is a part of the country that receives 
considerable benefits from visiting cruise ships this is very 
important. The cruise ship industry on the west and east coasts is 
very important to the country. We are proud to show the beauties 
and advantages of Canada to our visitors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7675"> 7675 </A></B>
<P>
	People the world over rely on Canada as a safe haven and a 
stable country that will provide safety and enjoyment while they 
are within our boundaries, including our offshore jurisdictions.
<P>
	I do not think we can let these people down. We have to live up 
to this standard and in doing so we have to be prepared as 
Canadians to safeguard our visitors. This major piece of 
legislation will do just that.
<P>
	Major commercial vessels, ports and other marine facilities 
which serve them are the second priority for preventive security 
regulation. Cargo vessels carrying dangerous substances, and 
ferries in ports where large numbers of people may be exposed 
should be adequately prepared to respond to security threats. 
Regulation envisioned for this segment of the marine industry is 
primarily in the domain of contingency planning.
<P>
	The best time for preventive legislation is not after a disaster, 
it is before one can occur. I urge my colleagues in the House to 
support this legislation so that a preventive security framework 
providing appropriate and timely protection for Canadians and 
Canada's marine interests can be established.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-38 is a technical bill that tightens up measures 
pertaining to marine safety on passenger ships, ferries and 
others. It is the marine equivalent to similar bills that have 
existed for some time with respect to aviation. It brings 
Canada's marine industry more in line with similar legislation 
already passed in Britain, the United States and several of the 
more sensitive Mediterranean countries.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Communications with user groups and other affected people 
produce some concerns with the bill's original wording but 
virtually all of these concerns have been addressed by 
amendments made at the committee level.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports this bill but does not intend to 
offer any further amendments or any additional speakers. It 
appears there is all-party support for the bill as amended.
<P>
	It is very ironic that we have so much time to debate bills on 
which there is no dispute when the government saw fit to invoke 
closure last spring on a number of very contentious bills. The 
dictionary defines contempt as the feeling that a person, act or 
thing is mean, low or worthless. The invoking of closure was 
something the Liberals found contemptible when they sat in 
opposition. Somehow during the walk across the floor to the 
government side of the House their perspective changed. My 
position echoes their old position. In fact, I find the invoking of 
closure to be actually beyond contempt.
<P>
	Since Bill C-38 is under the transport ministry let us look for 
a minute at other actions of this department as it is the body that 
is responsible for Bill C-38.
<P>
	During the last federal election the Liberals were looking for 
some campaign issues to raise their profile. They found one in 
Toronto with the Pearson airport contract. They stated that the 
contract was a rotten one, full of crooked dealings between the 
Tories and their friends. They stated that if they were elected 
they would investigate this contract, expose the wrongdoing and 
then cancel it.
<P>
	They left something out on the follow-up to that promise. 
They never exposed any wrongdoing. Was there any? We do not 
know, do they? There are two possibilities on this issue. One is 
that when the so-called independent review took place they 
could not find any wrongdoing. If so, they had a problem. After 
all, with all screaming about what a rotten deal the Pearson 
contract was, it would be embarrassing to admit they were 
wrong.
<P>
	The solution to this scenario was to continue the claim that the 
deal was rotten, cancel it and make sure the legislation banning 
the contract holders from going to court where they might 
expose the fact that there were no rotten deals was passed. The 
other possibility is that they did find a lot wrong with the way 
the contract was obtained, but the guilty party was the Liberal 
connected portion of the contract holders. It would not do to 
expose that in court, so we have the same solution.
<P>
	During the committee stage of Bill C-22 I offered an 
amendment that would require any settlements to flow through 
the transport standing committee. This would have kept the 
amounts of payment and the payees public. The public certainly 
had the right to know how this was being handled. Government 
members refused. I reintroduced the same amendment at third 
reading, but again the government voted it down.
<P>
	The issue at stake was not so much the Pearson contract but 
rather the basic rights of Canadians, whether they were 
companies or individuals. If the government can arbitrarily 
revoke someone's rights, as it did in the case of the Pearson 
contract, it can do it anywhere, to anyone, in any situation, 
maybe even in the enforcement of the provisions of a marine 
security act. That is beyond contempt.
<P>
	If questionable activities were limited to the transport 
problem that would be one thing. In that situation we could 
probably accept Bill C-38 at face value. However, revoking or 
ignoring the needs and rights of Canadians seems to be a general 
theme of this new Liberal Party with its new found perspective. 
This means we must look much closer at the emerging pattern 
provided by the Liberal cabinet in order to determine what is its 
real agenda.
<P>
	For example, consider the Minister of Canadian Heritage and 
the recent developments showing that he interfered with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7676"> 7676 </A></B>
<P>
activities of the CRTC. Further examination revealed that this 
was not the first time he  had done so. That is beyond contempt. 
Further it underlines the concerns I have in dealing with Liberals 
in all areas, including Bill C-38.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development recently tore 
a page from the Reform policy on funding for post-secondary 
education. We have advocated the use of student vouchers to 
channel federal moneys for universities through students to the 
universities of their choice. This would have neither increased 
nor decreased tuition for students. It was simply meant to be a 
more effective way to make the universities more responsive to 
the needs of students.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	However the minister in tearing out that page must have left 
most of it behind. The proposal he made was to propose issuing a 
voucher that was in fact a loan repayable to the government, and 
then cut off federal transfer payments in support of 
post-secondary education. This would have effectively doubled 
tuition costs for students who are already having trouble 
affording an education. That is beyond contempt.
<P>
	Bill C-38 deals with the security of those who use the oceans. 
In that context let us look at recent actions or the lack of action 
by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Millions of west coast 
salmon have recently gone missing. Even though the salmon 
may never surface again, evidence that the recommendations of 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans which may have 
prevented this catastrophe were ignored by the minister. This 
evidence is surfacing regularly. That is beyond contempt.
<P>
	Safety and security are the main points of Bill C-38. The 
health and safety of the Canadian public were the subjects of a 
recent private member's bill dealing with HIV testing for 
immigration applicants, submitted by the member for Calgary 
Northeast. Although a few Liberals were prepared to go against 
the grain and vote in favour of the bill, unbelievably the 
majority under the direction of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration defeated this basic measure to ensure the health 
and safety of Canadians. That is beyond contempt.
<P>
	Enforcement measures under the marine safety and security 
bill will fall in some part into the realm of justice. Let us take a 
look at the integrity of the justice minister. This is the minister 
who was planning to introduce new restrictive firearms 
legislation without one shred of evidence it will do a single thing 
to prevent the criminal misuse of firearms.
<P>
	This is the minister who stated: ``I will not legislate according 
to head count. I will do what I believe is in the best interests of 
Canadians''. That statement interprets to: ``I do not care what 
Canadians want, I know what is best for them''. That is a rather 
scary concept. We might have this same minister involved in 
decisions that challenge matters arising out of Bill C-38. I find 
the minister's attitude to be beyond contempt.
<P>
	One thing we have not heard is when the government intends 
to invoke concerns about aboriginal people into this bill. It may 
well be that with potential land settlement claims eventually 
some port may end up being owned by an aboriginal group. If 
that happens the Minister of Transport would have to work in 
consultation with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development whose record on legislative fairness is the worst of 
all the ministers we have discussed thus far.
<P>
	He is the minister who introduced Bills C-33 and C-34. These 
two bills were rushed through the House to the extent that the 
Liberals invoked closure to finalize the bills on which even 
aboriginal people were writing to us with their concerns. If the 
land settlements contained in these bills were to be used as a 
precedent for all aboriginal people in Canada, we would need a 
land area four times the size of my home province of British 
Columbia to settle. These bills establish self-government at an 
unprecedented level and apparently revoke the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms from the aboriginal people affected by this bill. 
This type of action and attitude is beyond contempt.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is the person who is ultimately 
responsible for all ministers and all legislation. Bill C-38 is no 
exception. He is the person who recently claimed to have 
consulted with the ethics counsellor but had not talked with him 
at all. He later stated that he had not met nor talked to the ethics 
counsellor personally, but rather had directed his staff to do so. 
All this time the Prime Minister was referring to advice that he 
received from the ethics counsellor. Now we find that no one 
consulted with the ethics counsellor. This is a measure of 
integrity from the person on whom the responsibility for Bill 
C-38 rests? Not only is this very unsettling, it is beyond 
contempt.
<P>
	Let us look at the Standing Committee on Transport, the 
committee that dealt with Bill C-38. At a recent meeting this 
committee went through the process of electing chairs and 
vice-chairs for the committee. At that meeting I asked for the 
voting on positions to be done by secret ballot. The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport objected to 
this request suggesting that the Reform Party was trying to 
introduce unacceptable secret dealings into the committee.
<P>
	I was forced to point out to the parliamentary secretary that 
this procedure was recommended in the Liberal's little red book. 
What is more it is the very method by which the Speaker of this 
House is elected.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	My motion was defeated and the Liberals once again elected a 
member of the party who is dedicated to breaking up this 
country to be the vice-chair of the transport committee. This 
procedure was repeated in every committee in this House. I find 
that beyond contempt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7677"> 7677 </A></B>
<P>
	I said at the beginning I would support Bill C-38 and I will. 
The reason I am supporting it is due in part to my consultation 
with users whose concerns have been addressed.
<P>
	There is some potential for integrity on the other side. It is 
hopeful. Some members chose to vote in favour of the bill on 
HIV testing for immigrants. Notwithstanding the actions of the 
transport committee on the election of vice-chairs it appeared to 
be at most times a reasonable group working to resolve 
problems facing Canadians, I guess because there are no cabinet 
ministers who sit on committees. Because of this I will continue 
my support of the bill but it does not end my basic concern that 
the attitudes and actions of many government ministers in this 
House are beyond contempt.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B>Mr. Speaker, Bill C-38 to provide for the security of marine 
transportation now before us meets an obvious need. Our party 
is in agreement with the principle of this bill and approves the 
enforcement procedure. Rather than waste my colleagues' time, 
I will limit myself to recalling briefly the bill's objectives, its 
highlights and its reception by the stakeholders. Unlike my 
predecessor, I will leave considerations not directly related to 
the bill aside.
<P>
	First, the objectives. The bill's objective is to introduce in the 
marine sector the same security principles found in the air and 
rail transportation sectors. Although these sectors have security 
measures regarding boarding, there are none in the case of 
marine transportation. The government cannot, therefore, 
intervene in emergency situations, such as when a vessel is 
threatened by unlawful activities or poses a risk to a port 
facility.
<P>
	The legislation focuses primarily on transportation of 
passengers. Screening measures will be instituted in ports to 
ensure that weapons and other explosives are not brought on 
board. This measure is aimed at preventing hijacking, sabotage 
and hostage-taking.
<P>
	We all remember the tragedy of the <I>Achille Lauro </I>about ten 
years ago-and we are only now considering action. A group of 
Palestinian terrorists took over a Greek ship by force and took 
the passengers and crew hostage. Since then, the International 
Maritime Organization has established security standards to be 
observed in port facilities and on vessels. These standards, 
which were first developed in 1986, were ratified by Canada in 
1993. The purpose of the bill before us is to implement these 
security measures.
<P>
	It should be noted that 85 per cent of passengers on cruise 
ships are Americans and that the American government carries 
out surveillance of port security measures worldwide. In certain 
cases, it may recommend that American citizens avoid certain 
ports. Guaranteeing security in our ports is a way of protecting 
our tourist industry.
<P>
	The bill puts in place the legislative framework and 
authorizes the minister to make regulations to deny certain 
vessels access to Canadian waters and re-direct vessels posing 
security concerns to a secure place. For example, a vessel 
subjected to a bomb threat would be directed to proceed to a 
place where it poses less of a security threat to persons, vessels 
and marine facilities, before undergoing authorized screening 
by Canadian officers.
<P>
	The bill makes it illegal for passengers or crew to have on 
board weapons or materials such as explosives that could be 
used as weapons. It will apply to all vessels in Canada, whether 
registered in Canada or not, and shipowners and port authorities 
will be required to install a security system including sensor 
equipment like the ones used in airports. The legislation will 
also apply to port facilities and drilling rigs. Naturally, vessels 
and facilities under National Defence authority will be 
exempted.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The legislation will have teeth: in the case of a corporation, 
the maximum fine will be $200,000. I might add that the bill was 
well received by the community. It met with the full approval of 
the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority and the Canada Ports 
Corporation.
<P>
	For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-38.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with your permission I would like to add my voice 
to those who have addressed this House today in support of the 
Marine Transportation Security Act, Bill C-38.
<P>
	The primary purpose of the Marine Transportation Security 
Act is the prevention of violent acts which could result in the 
loss of lives or impairment of the national transportation 
system. It is necessary however to also consider the financial 
implications of the bill before us now.
<P>
	This government has a responsibility but even more this 
government has an obligation to ensure the security in marine 
transport, not only for Canadians but for our guests and visitors 
to this great country.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has promised that regulations 
subsequent to this act will be made in full consultation with 
interested parties, consultation which is beyond that normally 
required for regulation. These consultations will include parties 
which have already contributed a great deal to the development 
and promotion of good security practices in Canada such as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7678"> 7678 </A></B>
<P>
Canada Ports Corporation and the North West CruiseShip 
Association.
<P>
	I know that my colleague, the Minister of Transport, will 
ensure that such consultations are pursued with full vigour in 
order to ensure achievement of the optimum method of 
protecting the system while at the same time enhancing its 
competitiveness.
<P>
	This legislation has been specifically designed with the 
flexibility to require enhanced security measures when threats 
are increased thereby requiring minimum expenditures in time 
and dollars when there is no apparent danger. This approach is in 
keeping with the current lack of threat to Canadian marine 
interests. The government has also promised to utilize to the 
fullest extent possible best industry practices and performance 
standards instead of detailed technical specifications. These 
commitments by the government will result in the most 
appropriate regime at the very lowest cost.
<P>
	Very little in this world is free. The financial resources that a 
regulatory regime pursuant to this act will require the marine 
industry to expend are truly very minimal. We know that most 
passenger vessels have the technical and human resources to 
comply with very little effort should they choose to do so.
<P>
	Unfortunately because Canada has such a good reputation as a 
safe destination, a safe haven, some operators tend to be less 
than diligent here in their observation of security precautions. 
This legislation will help ensure that passenger vessels do the 
things that are necessary and not only the things that are 
minimal to avoid becoming victims of unlawful acts while in 
Canada.
<P>
	Other elements of the industry such as major cargo vessels, 
major ferries and the ports which serve them will have to expend 
a small amount of time to develop and practise contingency 
plans and conduct security surveys. Employees of major 
Canadian ports will also have to take basic preventive security 
training in line with regulatory requirements. Many of the ports 
implicated already have security plans and surveys. Some go 
well beyond the requirements envisaged.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	For those areas that will have to expend limited resources, it is 
certainly not more than would be required to conform with good 
business practice and management. The government will add 
from its existing base of expertise in the Department of 
Transport, administration, training, monitoring and 
co-ordination resources that will make the sum of the security 
efforts greater than the individual parts.
<P>
	The international cruise trade is worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars to Canada annually. This trade over the last 10 years has 
grown at an average of 10 per cent a year. It shows no sign of 
abating. One incident of violence against a cruise vessel in the 
Mediterranean, the <I>Achille Lauro</I>, resulted in major losses, 
direct losses to the Greek economy of more than $300 million 
U.S. This does not account for losses in subsequent years of 
recovery. The preventive insurance this bill proposes is 
insignificant in comparison to such potential losses.
<P>
	My colleagues have pointed out that other nations have 
increased their marine security. In particular, we know that the 
U.S. has security legislation already in place and that it will 
likely implement a marine security regime this year. The U.S. 
already has the authority to issue travel warnings regarding 
destinations it considers not to provide adequate security. I 
would remind members of this House that approximately 85 per 
cent of Canada's cruise ship trade is made up of American 
citizens. They come to Canada because they feel safe in Canada.
<P>
	It would be folly to treat visitors to our land or indeed to treat 
Canadians themselves moving within each jurisdiction within 
this land with less concern and less respect than our American 
neighbours do. Will we not be good hosts as many nations 
already are, requiring security which adds to the ultimate 
enjoyment of travel? I would suggest that considering the cost of 
the security proposal before us, failing to offer it to our guests 
and to Canadians alike would be like buying friends a meal in a 
fine restaurant but refusing them a dinner mint after because of 
the cost. Failing to provide adequate protection certainly runs 
the risk of discouraging tourism and losing important revenue.
<P>
	It was only last week that our Prime Minister was speaking on 
tourism for Canada, admitting that we will put money, billions 
of dollars, into the industry luring international conventions and 
trade to come here. They will come here because they feel good 
about Canada and they feel safe about Canada. Their interests 
will be better protected with this legislation.
<P>
	I do not think I am far out on a limb when I suggest that safety 
in travel is a primary concern of all travellers, for all citizens. 
All responsible nations, including Canada, have a range of laws 
to ensure that our planes, trains, ships and cars travel with 
security. Now it is time that we ensure that marine travel is also 
guaranteed that same security. We offer to our people less safety 
and perhaps a threat of death if we do not engage in this 
legislation in this House. We have still more laws governing 
operation of the transportation system such as capacity to drive 
rights of way, waterways, roads, et cetera. People simply would 
not travel if they were in fear of tragedy of death en route.
<P>
	None here can have forgotten the tragedy of the Air India 
disaster. Security in mass transportation is as critical as a failed 
engine or as an impaired driver. It is an important element that 
travellers and tourists need and want and that we must ensure.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The Saint John <I>Evening Times Globe</I> in a March 4 article 
about cruise lines stated: ``For passengers from Miami, New 
York and Los Angeles security is a huge consideration. Cruise 
lines like to go places where they know their passengers are safe, 
and not just from pickpockets but safe from terrorism and the 
whole works''. They want safety first. There can be little doubt 
that security is critical to life, but it is important to competition 
and to the economy and cannot be overlooked.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to support the bill to ensure that Canada 
has this important competitive advantage. In so doing it will 
ensure that visitors to Canada enjoy the beauty of the country, 
the serenity of the landscape, and arrive and depart with 
memories of Canadians that will live on forever and, above all, 
will ensure their immediate and quick return to Canada.
<P>
	I live in Nova Scotia. I live on the water. Cruise ship lines 
come into our ports annually. Their great desire to come to these 
small ports, to these unique and scenic landscapes, is growing 
immensely. It increases more than 10 per cent a year in the east. 
We look forward to promoting it even more. The potential is 
tremendous not only for the pleasure of it but for the economic 
value. Those people tell us in the follow up reports that they love 
Canadians and want to come back.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to support the bill. It is imperative and 
obligatory that we serve Canadians and our visitors with dignity 
and security of safety.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise following 
the very eloquent remarks of my colleague who has described 
the importance of the legislation from an east coast perspective. 
I concur in what she said about the importance of the industry. It 
is important not only for Quebec, the Gulf of St. Lawrence area, 
Nova Scotia and indeed all Atlantic Canada but it is immensely 
important on the west coast.
<P>
	What has been introduced by the parliamentary secretary is 
enabling legislation that will allow regulations to be put in place 
and, in addition to regulations, some security measures and 
rules. Some are of less importance, less legal standing than 
regulations, but nevertheless are legislation, security measures 
or rules. They all have the same objective: to ensure a greater 
level of safety for the cruise ship industry operating in Canada. 
This is very important. My colleague has very correctly given 
some figures. I may be repeating one or two of them. However 
the cruise ship industry is estimated to be worth $500 million to 
Canada's economy.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that we are facing a tourist account 
deficit in the country of $8 billion per year. This is a major 
financial hemorrhage to the national accounts. Every effort must 
be made by Canadians over the next few years to rectify that 
balance and to improve the  opportunities in Canada for tourism. 
That is precisely what my colleague's legislation will do.
<P>
	Cruise ship operations create a demand for port services. 
Victoria and Vancouver in particular are very fortunate to have 
the opportunity of taking advantage of foreign ships, which may 
be of Panamanian, Dutch, German or British registry, that come 
to our ports and then take people north up the inland passage and 
ultimately to Alaska.
<P>
	Generally the process is for the passengers to get off at that 
point, participate in some tourism in Alaska or in Yukon, which 
is very important to those areas, and then fly back to their home 
destinations. At that point another group of tourists will arrive 
by air and board the ship for the return trip to Vancouver and 
Victoria. In our cities they live aboard the ship. However once 
the ship turns around with another group of tourists to go home, 
many of the people stay behind for a few extra days.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Cruise ship companies are enormously supportive of efforts 
to extend the tourist period of their passengers in Canada and, I 
might add, in the area of the United States adjacent to us. We are 
trying to keep them in B.C. and Washington. We are trying to 
give packages. I give cruise ship companies full credit for the 
efforts they make to assist us in having the people stay longer in 
our part of the world. They have allowed promotional materials 
and packages to be promoted on their vessels, which is 
immensely helpful to our balance of payments position.
<P>
	Virtually all operating vessels are registered outside Canada. 
Most of them are not of American registry. Most are from 
outside North America. We are getting a few more of the 
so-called pocket cruise ships with anywhere from a hundred to a 
couple of hundred passengers on board. Some have even fewer 
than that. They are important as well. A new niche area is the 
private yacht type cruise with 50 or 150 on board, not the 
massive cruise ships as we know them. There is expansion in the 
industry. People are moving into different areas which have not 
been exploited previously.
<P>
	The Canadian shipping industry in Canada has been depressed 
in recent years because of rising costs, changes in Canadian 
ownership requirements and, very important, the recession. As 
my colleague mentioned, in the cruise ship industry there have 
been 10 consecutive years of growth and an increase of 190 per 
cent in traffic in that period.
<P>
	In 1991 there was a total of approximately 714 cruise ship 
sailings, nearly half a million embarking passengers and a total 
number of passengers of nearly three quarters of a million. I 
should add that it is still increasing dramatically.
<P>
	Thanks to American legislation it is more advantageous for a 
foreign flag vessel to use a Canadian port. The Jones act requires 
that American ships be used between two American ports. Going 
up to Alaska it is advantageous to foreign ships to use Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7680"> 7680 </A></B>
<P>
ports. If  they could not do so they would simply be out of the 
business.
<P>
	We know well of the importance of safety to this industry. We 
know well because there have been a series of accidents, fires in 
particular, in the Caribbean and elsewhere which have led to loss 
of life. We have all heard of the tragic loss of a ferry in the Baltic 
in recent weeks. It is an industry which can be dramatically 
affected by accident.
<P>
	It is also an industry that can be dramatically affected by other 
people's regulations. I remind the House of the impact of 
American regulations on the Caribbean cruise ship industry 
some years ago following a series of fires that essentially 
enforced American law throughout the Caribbean regardless of 
the flag of the vessel involved.
<P>
	With the legislation we are trying to put in place a system 
whereby we will be able to regulate and put in place security 
measures and rules for vessels so that we can guarantee the 
goose will lay a very important golden egg. We want to ensure 
that we keep costs to the industry down.
<P>
	Our belief is the extra cost that could possibly come as a result 
of these measures would be less than $1 per passenger and 
probably closer to 80 to 85 cents. The extra cost would not be 
borne by Canadian taxpayers or by Canadian ports but by the 
industry. I might add that many cruise ship companies will have 
absolutely no extra costs as a result of meeting Canadian 
regulations because their standards are extremely high; they 
have very safe and seaworthy vessels at all times. This is not a 
major expenditure item that will impact adversely upon the 
industry.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I do not know the exact amount of time, but we will have some 
period of time after the legislation comes into effect to consult 
with industry and analyse the impact, where the costs can best be 
borne and how the charges can best be made. We will ensure we 
work as closely as possible with other regulatory agencies 
internationally to ensure that we do not get out of sync with 
international regulations.
<P>
	We will be able to show to potential tourists that we have a 
system in place in Canada which will go a long way toward 
assuring their safety at sea. There have been accidents in 
Canada. Cruise ships have hit rocks or had other unfortunate 
mishaps. It is important for us to be able to show that we have 
gone an extra mile and have done what was necessary to ensure 
safety in the industry.
<P>
	As a west coast person I rise to join with my colleagues from 
elsewhere in supporting this piece of legislation. Its major 
purpose is the safety of people who use cruise ships that are 
major contributors to a very important and growing area of our 
tourist industry. Given the balance of payments considerations I 
repeat the importance of having everything possible done to 
insist that we in Canada gather the maximum advantage from 
tourism. This is the type of low cost measure that will assist us in 
doing so. Therefore I am delighted to be here in support of the 
legislation.

$5.3 billion more than originally anticipated.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance plans to spend another $3.3 billion on

through a well timed leak we understand that the Minister of

<P>
	The Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister say all 
Canadians register their motor vehicles so why would they 
object to registering their firearms. I respond to that by saying 
that the registration of motor vehicles in great measure has been 
a move to tax Canadians for the use of their motor vehicles. This 
move to register all firearms in reality is a move to allow this 
government to tax all firearms to pay for this unjust firearms 
control policy and the bureaucracy it creates.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Within less than a year, three different estimates of the 
balance of the Unemployment Insurance Fund were announced. 
Last March, there was a deficit of $216 million; in September, a 
surplus of $240 million; and in October, a surplus of $2.2 
billion. This week, the Supplementary Estimates indicated that 
this year, there has been a reduction in $3.4 billion of 
unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance confirm that the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund will have a surplus in excess of 
$2 billion this year and that the surplus will be used to reduce the 
cumulative debt of the fund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of 
the year, the Unemployment Insurance Fund had a deficit of 
around $5.9 or $6 billion, I believe.
<P>
	This year, we expect a surplus for the current year. However, 
that will still leave us with a cumulative deficit in the account. I 
think it would be premature for me to give any figures, which 
will certainly be less than $6 billion, but I think we will have to 
wait until the end of the year. In any case, at that time we will 
still have a deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when he 
brought down his budget, the Minister of Finance said that 
premium increases were killing jobs and that he would create 
40,000 jobs by reducing these premiums starting next January.

of $2.2 billion, a surplus that is growing very rapidly, he did not 
immediately announce a reduction in unemployment insurance 
premiums in order to create thousands of jobs? Was that not his 
priority?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I repeat that 
despite this year's surplus, the cumulative UI account will show 
a deficit. Obviously, we will have to eliminate that deficit before 
we have a cumulative surplus.
<P>
	That being said, the hon. member is quite right when he says 
that we want to reduce unemployment insurance premiums. We 
certainly do. In fact, that is the position I announced before, and 
it certainly is the position of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.

<P>
	What is even more important is, that when we lower 
unemployment insurance premiums, we will be able to keep 
them down. This means we must be able to give the business 
community the assurance that the account is in good enough 
shape to keep premiums down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance made a slip that was very revealing. He 
referred to bringing down unemployment insurance premiums. 
In fact, we now know that he is far more inclined to reduce the 
benefits paid to the unemployed than to reduce the premiums 
paid by workers.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Would the minister agree that this enormous surplus in the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund, which, I may add, is growing 
very rapidly, was partly accumulated at the expense of workers 
that the government's social security reform has excluded from 
the unemployment insurance program and thus prevented from 
drawing benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I repeat, the 
unemployment insurance account still shows a deficit. We will 
have to deal with this deficit, and that is what is happening.
<P>
	I would have thought the hon. member would wish to 
commend us, as the government, for the fact that as a result of 
our economic philosophy, we are at last bringing down this 
deficit and putting ourselves into a surplus position.
<P>
	I may add that the reason we are now bringing down the 
deficit and giving ourselves a surplus is, that as a government, 
we are creating jobs at record levels. I am very pleased to say 
that the unemployment rate in Quebec went down again this 
month.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-91 protects pharmaceutical manufacturers 
who invest in research and development; they have major 
investments in the Montreal area.
<P>
	In most industrialized countries, these manufacturers benefit 
from legislation that protects the results of their research for at 
least 20 years. Now, manufacturers of generic products, most of 
whom are in Ontario, have put tremendous pressure on the 
government to eliminate these same guarantees in Canada.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Given the 
importance of the brand-name drug industry in the Montreal 
area and the concern raised in this industry by the attitude of 
some Liberal members, can the Deputy Prime Minister rule out 
any threat to amend Bill C-91 and its regulations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's question seemed to suggest that 
only Liberal members were interested in this issue. Obviously, 
the people throughout the country who have to pay the cost of 
drugs, organizations of all kinds, seniors and so on are very 
interested in it as well.
<P>
	I want to assure my hon. colleague that although a committee 
of the House is looking at Bill C-91, the Government of Canada 
is very clear in its commitment to check all the data concerning 
this law, as the law itself provides, or any other legislation 
which must be reviewed at the appropriate time.
<P>

some point. We will do what must be done, but do not believe 
that just because a House committee is looking into some issue, 
the government's policy will change.

immigration plan for 1995.
<P>
	Included among the things that were expected to be reformed 
but were not was the strengthening of the enforcement branch of 
immigration. No firm action was taken to beef up Canada's 
woefully inadequate deportation system. The government said 
that Bill C-44 would ensure that those who are ordered deported 
actually get deported.
<P>
	My question is very specific. What effect would Bill C-44 
have on those who have been ordered deported for violations of 
immigration law as opposed to criminal law to the minister of 
immigration?
<P>

<P>
	I hope it means that the hon. member and his party will be 
supporting Bill C-44. Bill C-44 will ensure that deportations 
take place in the required time with all due speed and that the 
laws of Canada are properly enforced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, six 
filing cabinets full of deportation warrants were recently 
discovered in Ontario. Tragically, they were discovered in the 
same office as the misplaced deportation file of Clinton Gayle 
who stands accused of killing a Toronto police officer.
<P>
	These warrants are for violations of immigration law. 
Therefore they are not subject to any of the terms of Bill C-44, 
are not addressed by the 1995 immigration plan and would not 
be given priority by the minister's so-called task force.
<P>
	Why has the government, the minister and the department 
done nothing this year to address the enormous and dangerous 
backlog of removal orders relating to immigration violations?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

again thank the hon. member for his question. I am delighted he 
asked it because a number of misconceptions are out there with 
regard to the story.
<P>
	It was an inaccurate story. These files were not lost. They had 
been screened by the department of immigration. They have 
been input into the Canadian police information computer and 
are in the process of being input into the immigration 
department's computer.
<P>
	I want to reassure the member that things are going as they 
should. I thank him again for his question and the opportunity to 
set the record straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary is making much ado about the tiny steps 
that have been taken to push criminal immigrants out the back 
door while she and the immigration department and refugee 
board appointees, at least one of whom was an illegal 
immigrant, are allowing with no screening whatsoever 
thousands of refugees with criminal records in through the front 
door.
<P>
	Will the minister or parliamentary secretary admit that the 
RCMP refugee identification section has found in the first part 
of this year that fully one-quarter of all successful refugee 
claimants to Canada were identified after the fact as having 
criminal records or having made multiple illegal refugee 
claims?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows or should know, this problem is one that affects 
all refugee receiving countries.
<P>
	The minister travelled to Russia very recently to deal with 
international concerns in this matter. An international 
conference will be taking place within the next month to deal 
with this very serious matter.
<P>
	Again I am delighted that the member has shown such an

question is for the Minister of the Environment. At the Rio 
Summit, the previous government undertook to stabilize carbon 
dioxide emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect at their 
1990 levels, and to do so by the year 2000. In their red book, the 
Liberals went further, promising to cut these emissions by 20 
per cent from 1988 levels by the year 2005. But the Minister of 
the Environment has admitted publicly for the first time that she 
will not be able to fulfil this election promise.
<P>
	Does the minister still intend to fulfil one of the most basic 
environmental undertakings in the red book, namely cutting 
greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1988 levels?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I never said that we 
would not fulfil our commitment. What I said is that, in order to 
achieve a 20 per cent reduction, as provided by government of 
Canada policy, co-operation will be required from both the 
private sector and the provinces. That is why I am really looking 
forward to seeing, on Monday, what policies the governments of 
Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia have, so that we can 
develop a plan of action not only for federal institutions but also 
at the provincial level. We need the support of the provinces to 
succeed. I hope that the hon. member opposite will speak to her 
Quebec counterpart to convince him to develop a plan of action 
in conjunction with the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans document reveals that on 
March 25 of this year, three months before the opening of the 
salmon season, senior fisheries officials on the west coast were 
warning of a disaster if the level of enforcement was further 
downgraded on the Fraser River. They warned of a ``repeat of 
the missing sockeye problems that occurred in the 1992 
season''.
<P>
	Why did the minister ignore these warnings and initiate the 
reduction in the enforcement effort which led to the disaster of 
1994?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I know 
of his genuine concern about the state of the salmon stock. Many 
stakeholders in British Columbia are concerned about the state 
of the salmon stock.
<P>
	I do not know what document the member is referring to. It is 
evident that many enforcement officers who work for DFO in 
the Pacific region have expressed concerns through the system 
about the state of enforcement. Indeed, as I said several weeks 
ago, many of those concerns and detail have not reached me.
<P>
	It is for that reason two nights ago, for two and a half hours, 
that I as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans sat down with 40 
enforcement officers from all over the Pacific region to hear 
from them firsthand their concerns about the state of the stock 
and their suggestions for improving the situation.
<P>
	I have given them a commitment that I will come back to them 
through the department with a solid plan within our fiscal means 
to ensure proper enforcement everywhere the salmon run to do 
the job that is necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I warned the 
minister last spring and others tried to and he refused to listen.
<P>
	As we learned on BCTV last night, rather than accept blame 
for his incompetence the minister is fanning the flames of 
racism by saying: ``The biggest goddam conservation problem 
on the Fraser River is the Sto:Lo''-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would urge 
members feeling as passionately and as strongly as they do in 
this place of vigorous debate on all issues of importance, and 
this one specifically, to choose their words carefully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was quoting the minister. He 
said: ``The biggest-conservation problem on the Fraser River 
is the Sto:Lo''. Will the minister admit that he is afraid that a 
real judicial inquiry will simply point the finger at his own 
incompetence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if anybody has been playing games that seek 
to generalize about an entire group of people, an irresponsible 
attitude about an entire group of people in the fishing industry, it 
is the Reform Party that does it with respect to Canada's First 
Nations, that does it with respect to Canada's immigrants, that 
does it with respect to Canada's poor, that does it with respect to 
anybody who does not have a right wing, narrow minded, 
bigoted attitude about people in the country.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Excuse me, you have asked a question. Now take 
the answer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. First I remind 
everyone to direct their interventions through the Chair. Second, 
in order that we might get as many questions and answers on the 
record as possible today, both should be succinct and brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said to every one of the 
groups I met in British Columbia-and I met with aboriginal 
leaders, the leadership from the commercial sector and people 
from the sport and recreational sector-is that all groups 
without exception, if the truth is to be heard in this place, must 
accept obligation for conservation, enforcement and 
compliance whether they came to this nation first or came to this 
nation last.

some crew members are foreigners.

question is for the minister of agriculture. On October 31 the 
U.S. department of agriculture announced the 1994-95 
allocation for subsidized exports under its export enhancement 
program for barley and malting barley at 2.6 million tonnes.
<P>
	The targeting of South Korea with a 50,000 tonne barley 
export is a direct affront and challenge to a market opened up by 
Canadian exporters. This trade action violates the intent of our 
agreement with the United States and creates further market 
distortion.
<P>
	Considering the minister has described the American EEP as 
``the worst trade distorting policy on the face of the earth'', 
could he now indicate to the House what specific action Canada 
will be taking to respond to this new and damaging application 
of U.S. trade policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's aggravation 
about this particular situation can be exceeded only by my own.
<P>
	The federal government is very disappointed by the U.S. 
government's continued use of the export enhancement 
program, which is a major market destabilizing export subsidy. 
Not only are we concerned by the recent U.S. announcement 
allowing for the subsidization of 2.6 million tonnes for barley 
and malting barley, Canada finds particularly distressing the 
50,000 tonne allocation of U.S. barley to South Korea.
<P>
	Canada is in the process of considering the form and the 
content of the appropriate protest to be lodged with the United 
States about this allocation. The Minister of International Trade 
and I will be pursuing that issue at the very earliest opportunity.
<P>
	As the hon. member pointed out this is especially aggravating 
because it was Canada that worked very hard to achieve the 
opening in the Korean market. It is disturbing, to say the least, to 
see the United States attempting to undermine that through the 
use of export subsidies. We will make the Canadian position 
abundantly clear.

of smuggling, like the smuggling of weapons.
<P>
	The added resources both of the mounted police and of the

smuggling of arms as well as the smuggling of other goods. This

therefore, are being pursued as we said they would be.

that is being examined and worked on by the Minister of Justice, 
the Minister of National Revenue and myself to be dealt with as

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B>Mr. Speaker, in a news release sent out yesterday the 
government announced it will hold 60 public consultation 
meetings on light station destaffing. This consultation process 
was not to determine whether or not people accept destaffing. 
Previous consultation showed that west coast communities, 
boaters, fishermen and coastal pilots do not want this. This 
consultation is on implementation of the very policy the 
government previously agreed not to implement.
<P>
	My question for the Minister of Transport is why is this 
government cutting back on operational jobs which affect public 
safety instead of cutting back on senior bureaucrat jobs that only 
affect the spending of the Canadian taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>Mr. Speaker, it boggles the mind even on a Friday morning that 
Reform comes along and tells us not to try to save the Canada 
taxpayers money.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that in the United States there is one 
lighthouse that is still staffed and it is a historical site. The 
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, countries around the 
world have destaffed their lighthouses.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I understand the importance historically of lighthouses in 
British Columbia and Newfoundland, on both coasts of this 
country.
<P>
	If the Reform Party wants to be consistent it should 
understand that even the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> had a headline that said: 
``It is time to switch off our lighthouse keepers''. It is time for 
the Reform Party to switch on the light to reality as it relates to 
some of these technological changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B>Mr. Speaker, if the government is going to follow the example of 
other countries, I hope the justice minister will take note that 
Australia cancelled its firearms registration because it did not 
work.
<P>
	The minister's departmental publication ``West Coast 
Lighthouses'' states that despite technological changes over the 
past 200 years in the automation of equipment, the human 
element has proven essential in warning of unpredictable 
changes in weather, aiding in search and rescue activities and 
providing essential services to mariners.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us why he is ignoring his own 
department and jeopardizing safety to save money by cutting 
operational people instead of bureaucrats?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>Mr. Speaker, I will say in response to my hon. friend that we are 
not being very picky at Transport Canada about what we are 
cutting.
<P>
	People who are looking at what we are attempting to do in this 
department recognize that we are trying to be even handed about 
it. We are trying to reflect new technologies. We are trying to 
make sure that we have a very safe environment for Canadians to 
travel in this country.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that I cannot continue to accept 
questions like this coming from a member who says he thinks 
there is nothing wrong with the Pearson deal and then expects 
me to take him seriously when he is talking about lighthouses.

	Next week provincial and federal environment and energy 
ministers will meet to discuss the reduction in carbon dioxide 
emissions to deal with climate change.

	Can the minister indicate to this House what kind of

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

at this point in time we are about 11 per cent short of our goal for 
stabilization.
<P>
	To meet even the stabilization goals, the bare minimum goal 
established by the previous government at Rio, we would need 
to have an action plan tabled by the national government and by 
every provincial government in advance of the Berlin meeting.
<P>
	We believe that science is telling us that we have to go further. 
We are convinced that at the meeting in Bathurst we will get the 
full support of energy and environment ministers across the

action but we also need other legislative action to make sure that 
we meet our goals of stabilization and 20 per cent reduction.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	The minister has not yet rejected the recommendations 
contained in the SECOR report on the future of cultural 
industries. Yet, all are unanimous in saying that if the minister 
implements the recommendation regarding Telefilm Canada, to 
the effect that the government should only invest in presumably 
profitable projects from a commercial point of view, the whole 
independent motion picture industry will be jeopardized.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the recommendations giving 
priority to major profitable corporations would have the effect 
of eliminating the whole cultural dimension of Telefilm Canada, 
and does he agree that this strictly commercial approach would 
adversely affect the arrival of new creators on the market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the SECOR report was submitted by a 
consultant who has ideas and who made suggestions. That study 
was commissioned by the previous Conservative government. 
Obviously, there are other  sources of advice and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage will make a decision in due time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the study was indeed commissioned by the 
Conservatives, but the contract was awarded to a prominent 
Liberal.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that he is losing all credibility 
within the cultural community and, in order to reassure once and 
for all the creative artists and those who will follow into their 
footsteps, will he categorically dissociate himself from the 
recommendations of the SECOR report? Yes or no?

Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Farmers who lose their land due to debt settlement are being 
treated unfairly due to the taxation of capital gains. When land is 
taken back in debt settlement it is deemed to have been sold for 
the amount of the debt with interest. The deemed proceeds 
usually exceed the value of the land. This results in a taxable 
capital gain. The taxpayers lose land, livelihood, child tax 
credits or benefits and they have to pay provincial tax as a result 
of the fictitious calculation.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that the Income Tax Act will be 
amended to retroactively rectify this situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is good news 
and bad news here. The good news is that the member gave me 
advance notice of this question. The bad news is that he gave me 
advance notice about three months ago and I am not sure I can 
remember the answer.
<P>
	The fact is that the department has taken the member's 
question under consideration and I believe that we are going to 
be in a position if not to satisfy all of the question, certainly to 
give a favourable response. We are working on it.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing,

promised Canadians they would bring honesty and integrity to 
government. Yet earlier this week the Prime Minister slipped 
out of Ottawa to meet with 350 Canadians who paid $1,000 each 
to the Liberal Party to buy access to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister who will 
remember that when the previous government carried on these 
sorts of activities she and her colleagues aggressively criticized 
that Prime Minister. Will she indicate how these secret meetings 
with those who pay for access and influence square with words 
about honesty and integrity that this government has spent so 
much time expressing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in 
the hon. member. We did not raise this issue when his leader had 
a boat cruise. We understand there is a legitimate function for 
fundraising in all political parties. Take a look at the Reform 
Party. There is a recent annotation that it received $75,000 from 
Sabre Energy Limited, $25,000 from Canadian Pacific, $20,000 
from Hollinger Inc., $15,000 from Company No. 135482. 
Obviously parties have to raise money.

	In the instance of the Laurier Club, the Laurier Club 
membership is even open to the member from the New 
Democratic Party. It is a public document. Membership is 
available to anybody who wants to walk four blocks down to 200 
Laurier Avenue.

does not want to tell people who gave it money before the

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	The Canadian government bought a year of peace for wheat 
exports to the United States by signing a very bad agreement.
<P>
	Among unresolved agricultural issues, the U.S. is still using 
NAFTA to challenge the tariffs filed by Canada under the GATT 
agreement on supply-managed agricultural products, namely 
milk products, poultry and eggs. Section 424 of the GATT bill 
before the U.S. Congress requires the President of the United 
States to personally deal with this dispute and report back within 
a few months.
<P>
	Can the minister give us an update on the negotiations in this 
specific matter and tell us why, on the eve of a new trade dispute 
with the U.S., he is not using the conciliation mechanisms 
provided for under GATT and NAFTA?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two parts to the hon. 
member's question. One of those relates to the wheat agreement 
recently signed between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	The hon. member characterizes it as a bad deal. He ought to 
know that the volume of access that we have secured by this 
agreement is higher than any other year in history except one 
year in which U.S. production was distorted by the worst 
flooding in 300 years.
<P>
	This is a high level of access that we have secured for 
Canadian wheat. Those who argue the contrary should explain 
why they would take about $150 million out of the pockets of 
Canadian grain producers by forcing them into a trade war 
situation.
<P>
	With respect to the quota situation dealing with supply 
managed products, those items were under discussion with the 
United States at the end of last year and the beginning of this 
year. The United States preferred in the month of June to focus 
exclusively on the wheat issue. It will at some point I presume in 
the future again raise these issues with Canada.
<P>
	However, it is our view that tariff equivalents that we have 
filed under the GATT agreement are perfectly legitimate and 
proper in the context of international practice. If they should be 
challenged by the United States we have indicated that we will 
defend the Canadian position.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>Mr. Speaker, a question like that obviously reflects the total lack 
of respect that the Reform Party has for members of this House.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks I have doctored anything she should 
say so, say it in here and say it outside. I do not take lightly my 
responsibilities as a minister. If there is any doctoring to do I 
think perhaps the hon. member should see if there is something 
that can be done for her.

Standing Order 18 with respect to disrespectful or offensive 
language.
<P>
	Earlier in question period the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans referred to the member for Delta or the Reformers as 
bigots. There was no intervention on your part, Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to that language and yet while the member for Delta 
was quoting the minister's very own words you rose and held 
him back.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to know what your ruling would be 
on that?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me see if I can be 
helpful to the House. Clearly I heard the words from the member 
for Delta as reported by the hon. member for Calgary Centre and 
I reacted. However, as clearly I did not hear other words that 
would have led me to rise in the same fashion and react as the 
House would deem appropriate and also as the Chair would.

more judicious words. I will also undertake to review the blues 
and report back to the House if necessary.

which are unparliamentary, words which I want to withdraw. 
One of the words was ``racist'' and the other word was 
``bigoted''.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	However, the member who has just risen will know that his 
colleague who sits just beyond his arm's reach, in asking the 
question, which prompted that response which I have withdrawn 
unequivocally, used the words ``racist comments'' in referring 
to me. The member thinks those kind of words are unacceptable. 
I have withdrawn them. I ask the member opposite to do the 
same.

Delta in reference to the word ``racist'' was using it in the 
context of a question. He was not referring to the minister as 
being racist because we know the minister is not racist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand, because once or twice 
in the 15 years I have been here I have been guilty of using words 
that one would not want to use. However, the member for Delta

preach or seek from other members in this House.

Mr. Speaker, I hate to continue on the same train of thought, 
except that another member, namely the member for

falsifying government documents during question period. That 
is a very serious accusation. Needless to say it is far more 
serious than that which has been previously withdrawn. I would 
seek the guidance of the Chair with regard to that issue as well.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B>Mr. Speaker, I am presenting more petitions on behalf of 
Canadian grandchildren and grandparents. It is long overdue 
and I sincerely hope that our government recognizes the urgent 
need to stop punishing a large percentage of our grandchildren 
by not allowing them access to their grandparents.
<P>
	My private member's bill to grant grandparents continuous 
access to their grandchildren is soon to be debated in this House. 
I ask all members of this House to support our Canadian 
grandchildren.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

Speaker, I believe the following questions will be answered 
today: Nos. 72 and 73.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 72-<B>Mr. Caccia:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the buried radioactive waste at Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited's Chalk River plant, (a) to what extent, if any, has tritium spread into 
the environment within a radius of 50 kilometres, (b) to what extent has tritium 
been measured in drinking water and is this considered a safe level, (c) is the 
disposal site safely insulated and (d) is there any danger to humans emanating 
from the disposal site?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to (a), tritium emissions from 
the waste site at Atomic Energy of Canada Limited's Chalk 
River plant do migrate to some degree within a radius of50 kilometres of the plant. However, tritium emission limits are 
set so that hypothetical doses to the public are always well 
below the regulatory limits set by the Atomic Energy Control 
Board. In practice, nuclear facilities do not operate anywhere 
near their emission limits and Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited's Chalk River plant is no exception. The tritium 
releases from the plant are well below the regulatory limits.
<P>
	In response to (b), local drinking water is monitored for 
tritium and the levels observed, being very much less than 
regulatory limits for the public, are considered safe. Daily 
samplings are collected at the Pembroke main water supply 
intake and these are measured monthly to confirm that releases 
are a small fraction of the regulatory limits.
<P>
	In response to (c), yes, the radioactive waste disposal site is 
safely insulated. It is located well inside the plant boundary and 
is not accessible to the public. The releases of tritium from this 
site are well below the regulatory limit.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7696"> 7696 </A></B>
<P>
	In response to (d), the radioactive waste site is safe and poses 
no undue risk to humans.
<P>
Question No. 73-<B>Mr. Caccia:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is 40,000 becquerels of tritium in a litre of drinking water considered a safe 
level?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, 40,000 becquerels per litre is the 
regulated standard for drinking water and corresponds to 10 per 
cent of the legal public dose limit of 5 millisieverts per year. 
Even if a person's water supply through a whole year were to be 
at 40,000 becquerels per litre, the radiation dose to that 
individual would be less than the current dose limit for members 
of the public. It would also be below the reduced limit that is 
recommended by international authorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I ask that the remaining questions be allowed 
to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Shall the remaining 
questions stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Could the hon. 
parliamentary secretary give the Chair a moment?
<P>
	I have taken somewhat of a liberty. Since we are getting ready 
to go home to our families, friends and constituents and since 
this break particularly marks the occasion of Remembrance 
Day, I have asked the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, the senior member of the 
House, to please say a few words on our behalf.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REMEMBRANCEDAY">REMEMBRANCE DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, every November 11 Canadians take time out 
to remember those who served in two world wars and in the 
Korean war. Now must be added the several peacekeeping and 
peacemaking expeditions where several young Canadians have 
lost their lives.
<P>
	Korea was the first big test for the United Nations when the 
North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel. It was a case of the 
United Nations proving itself and its role within the 
international community by keeping boundaries stable or losing 
its clout in the world.
<P>
	Sixteen nations went to the aid of the United Nations and 
between 1950 and 1953 brought order back from the chaos of 
that particular area of the world. Five hundred and sixteen young 
Canadians today rest in Korea.
<P>
	During World Wars I and II the Royal Canadian Navy, the 
Royal Canadian Air Force, the Canadian Merchant Navy and the 
Royal Canadian Army and Canadians who served with other 
forces played their roles.
<P>
	In World War I, 66,605 young Canadians lost their lives. That 
talent was lost to this Parliament, to municipal governments, to 
provincial governments and to all walks of life.
<P>
	In 1939-45, 45,000 more young Canadians lost their lives in 
battle; 55,000 came home wounded. All told, including our 
peacekeeping expeditions, this great nation has lost more than 
114,000 young Canadians in war.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Can we as members of the House of Commons today, right 
now, fully realize the atmosphere that prevailed in this Chamber 
when Canada declared war in World Wars I and II and the 
Korean war?
<P>
	On September 1, 1939 Germany and Russia invaded Poland 
and Poland collapsed. France and Britain had promised that they 
would come to Poland's aid, and they both declared war on 
Germany. On September 7 the House of Commons of Canada 
was called into special session to decide what Canada was to do. 
By September 9 it had decided it would support Britain and 
France. On September 10, 1939 Canada officially declared war.
<P>
	The battles of Dieppe, Hong Kong, the Italian campaign, the 
Battle of Britain, the freeing of Holland, the north Atlantic 
battle and the war at sea generally, and the D-Day campaign 
were among many in which Canada participated. The only great 
conclusion is that no matter where these campaigns took place, 
wherever they will take place, war is hell.
<P>
	The joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate 
has recommended a one day debate per year on Canada's 
international role, a very important debate. If we do not work 
toward keeping peace in the world, we are not keeping faith with 
those 114,000 young Canadians whom I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	The world is not a happy place today. It has some 75 to 80 hot 
spots. The greatest service we can do is to try to keep cooling 
them off. This process is to a great extent shaping our world 
today.
<P>
	On behalf of all members in the House, I congratulate the 
1,700-plus Legion branches across Canada for inviting all 
Canadians to attend a November 11 Remembrance Day 
ceremony to remember those young Canadians who left their 
high schools, their universities and their careers, who left their 
jobs in the factory or the corner store, who left their ploughs and 
cultivators and their farms; people from all walks of life who 
left loved ones to go out to fight for freedom and for eventual 
peace.
<P>
	Canada has a great role to play in the negotiations for peace in 
the world. Think of those today who are far away from home on 
peacekeeping duties. Think of their families who are at home 
awaiting the return of their loved ones. These people are keeping 
the faith with those who died. If we do not give them our support 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7697"> 7697 </A></B>
<P>
and if we do not play our role around the peacekeeping tables 
and  at the United Nations, then we are not keeping faith with 
those who died.
<P>
	By our own neglect we may well be promoting another 
debacle and more loss of Canadian lives. As we leave the House 
of Commons today, let us remember them. Let us not just 
remember them on Friday next as we stand around the Cenotaph. 
Let us remember them 365 days of the year because they gave 
their all.
<P>
	What we should do as Canadian parliamentarians and as 
Canadians is work toward the peace and the sanity of a good 
world for our young people. We must not neglect our duties and 
allow international plans that might hinder their lives.
<P>
	Let us think of our families and all young Canadians who are 
looking forward to a future. If we keep faith with those who died 
and keep faith in international relations we will indeed be 
remembering them.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, may I ask all members of the House to rise for 
one moment's remembrance.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: The House stood in silence.</I>]
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I get back to the 
parliamentary secretary, perhaps I may add the following on a 
more personal note. I draw your attention to the Table today. Our 
Senior Clerk, Mr. Camille Montpetit, arrived here on the Hill on 
November 4, 1968, so this is his 26th anniversary.
<P>
	On behalf of all previous and present members, we want to 
thank you for your good offices and your friendship.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, after those very moving words 
from you and from the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, I think you might find there is 
unanimous consent to call it 2.30 in light of the excellent 
progress we have made today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 2.30 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until Monday, November 14, 1994 at 
11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28(2) and 24(1).
<P>
